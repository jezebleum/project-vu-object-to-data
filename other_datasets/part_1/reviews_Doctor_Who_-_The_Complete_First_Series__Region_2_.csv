B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AZDCKOKZK0RCB	Aaron	For those who long for The Good Old Days of Doctor Who, this isn't it. The 21st century Doctor is more fast-paced than incarnations of old. We focus more on the companions and their lives. They no longer exist just to say, &#34;What is it, Doctor?&#34; My favorite actor will always be Tom Baker because he was my first Doctor. First-time viewers will suffer the same nostalgia decades from now.It might be helpful to go back and view old episodes just to get a running start. Maybe even just the special shows The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, and The Two Doctors will be enough to give historical flavor, even though these will not have Tom Baker. Okay, add The Keys To Time set of six. Maybe Baker's first episode Robot just so you can see Sarah Jane Smith. And some of Pertwee while banished to Earth so you can experience UNIT, and the lovely Jo Grant at his side. And any episodes with Daleks. And Cybermen. And the Master. And....?	5.0	He's back!	2014-04-11	0	0	0

The tenth doctor to this day is still my favorite with Dalek being my favorite episode of the series. If you have any inkling fr Science Fiction definitely check this show out.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2EEUQ81DTY7G3	A Customer	Having just completed watching Doctor Who: the complete first series in bits and pieces over the past fortnight I can honestly day what a treat it is. This series is a startling re-imagining of the world's longest running television show and is destined to satisfy both long-term fans and entrance newbies alike.Kudos should certainly go to writer/director and producer Russell T. Davies who grew up with the show and has treated this revival of it with the type of iconic reference it deserves. Of course, much of the congratulations must also go to the beautiful Billie Piper as Rose and the acclaimed Christopher Eccleston who offered to step into the shoes of the mystifying Time Lord and intergalactic do-gooder known only as the Doctor.Both Piper and Eccleston give superb performances, totally involving us in their characters - and it's interesting to watch their growth as friends and companions as the series progresses. Gone are the makeshift cardboard sets and men in rubber alien suits, for this Doctor has been updated to current sensibilities, reflecting the hip, stylish and youth culture of England today.The long downtrodden, flimsy budget was eradicated, and the show was reinvigorated, with top-notch special effects and strong scripts, and even some surprising co-stars. With the series as a whole really pushing the boundaries of what television can offer.These thirteen episodes are loosely linked the tenth Doctor finds he is immersed in a sequential scheme to influence the events of his life. Over the course of thirteen episodes, the Doctor and Rose travel to Earth's past, present, and future to unravel the mysteries of the Bad Wolf. Of course the clues are subtle and the masterminds behind the conspiracy are not revealed until the very last episode. Meanwhile, however, Rose is whisked away to all sort of wonderful places, both in the past and the present.The stories are tight, mesmerizing, speedy, clever, amusing and throughout the course of the series we are introduced to a variety of characters: there's the cocky and brash American time traveler - and perhaps even bisexual Captain Jack (John Barrowman) who accompanies the Doctor and Rose in the final four stories; Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), who hates the Doctor for constantly whisking her daughter away into danger.There's also Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) Rose's on again off again boyfriend whose wimpy demeanor tends to put the good Doctor off. The stories also present us with an amazing amount of strength and power - we are transported to the 19th century where we meet Charles Dickens (played lovingly by Simon Callow) and then swept 5 billion years into the future where we witness the end of the world from a satellite orbiting in space.There's a Dalek invasion force numbering in tens of thousands, exotic aliens in the form of flatulence forming Slitheens, shop window dummies that kill, 19th Century Cardiff where mysterious blue ghosts form through the gas lights, a giant space ship which obliterates Big Ben, and the London blitz where people have gas masks embedded into their faces. Rose also gets to visit her father the moment before he died, in the process; however, she causes a rift in time and space.Of course, nothing ever stays the same and one of the unique qualities of the show is that the cast keeps changing. Whilst Billie Piper stays on for the next series - which is rumored to have an even bigger budget as the first, and is currently screening in Australia and other Commonwealth countries and has recently wrapped up in the UK - we are given a new Doctor with Scottish actor David Tennant taking on the prized role.There's certainly nothing cheesy or cheap about this series and it features some suburb acting by Eccleston and Piper and it is certainly going to be a fitting legacy for the series as a whole. Now one can only wait with bated breath for next July when the second series will hopefully be released on DVD and where the Doctor will be faced with even more intergalactic archenemies including the return of the dreaded Cybermen!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ADOUBP7AMWGKU	"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole"""	"I've been a Doctor Who fan since the 1970s and was delighted when I heard the series was being revived. I was feeling pretty pleased for the first few episodes - the show had been updated, the effects were better, and the Shakespere-style acting of yesteryear was gone. The new Doctor was also a nice change, demonstrating that the character can be variable enough to go from being an aristocrat (Jon Pertwee) to somebody's goofy handyman uncle (Christopher Eccleston. It also helped that two of my favourite old enemies - the Autons and the Daleks - reappeared in this series. The Daleks, in particularly, were really nicely revamped and actually seemed scary (though more through their actions than their appearance). HOWEVER, I noticed a lot of problems with the new series that I believe - once all the hype and backslapping about the series dies down - will start to work against it. These are:1. CLIMAX-RESOLUTION: Probably the biggest problem. Each episode has a fast paced plot... until the end. Then, quite noticeably, the story runs out of puff. It's as if the writer (especially Russel T. Davies) suddenly realises that the story is supposed to end now and he hasn't worked out how to do it. For this reason, the climax of most of the stories seems like a tacked-on, half-hearted effort (e.g., ""Parting Of The Ways""). Typically we get to see a brief struggle between the Doctor and the villain/problem, followed by an almost instantaneous victory. The victory is rarely due to the intelligence of the characters, and usually involves pure luck or a really simple solution that takes a couple of seconds to complete. Even worse is when the solution is an utterly implausible cop-out like the one we see in the final episode. There is almost no dramatic tension toward the end of each episode and no sense of concern that the Doctor might not win. Rather, we just get to sit and wait for the next easy solution to pop up.2. EASY ENEMIES: The villains the Doctor encounters in this series are typically pretty fearsome - until it comes time to actually face them. Then they go down in a heap without any fight at all. We first see this with the Autons, being defeated within seconds with a simplistic gimmick. I spent most of the series thinking ""Gee that was easy. Why were they so worried?"" At least the Daleks got to do a bit of damage until their ultimately ridiculous defeat. It's when you realise they've been defeated in such a pathetic way that you might start wondering ""Did the writer actually put any thought into this story?"" The old series had its flaws, but it never came up with extreme grasping-at-straws style solutions.3. ROSE: I got the impression that the writers were trying to shove the Doctor's new companion down our throats every chance they got (most of the series centred on her). There's never been a companion in the series that has been as over-hyped as Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. Old fashioned as I am, I liked it when the Doctor's companions had a bit of class, or if they lacked it, at least had intelligence. The character of Rose is certainly not intelligent and is about as classy as Roseanne Barr. It doesn't help that she speaks like she failed the fourth grade, and can't seem to say the letter ""r"" without turning it into a ""w."" In the episode with the flatulent aliens, I kept wondering when she was going to join in, or at least ask the Doctor to pull her finger.4. AWFUL COMPANIONS: The additional ""companions"" also aren't great. Rose's mother Jackie is even less classy than Rose and can't seem to say anything without throwing a fit. Rose's boyfriend Mickey is a major loser who seems to be in the show as both the comic relief and the ""token black guy."" The biggest letdown was Captain Jack, supposedly a swashbuckler-type character (although we never really see this), whose main claim to fame (and apparently the only thing about him that the writers considered significant) is that he is gay. Wow. In the classic series, the companions used to have a bit more to them than this lot does.5. EARTH: For some unfathomable reason, the writers of the show decided to confine almost every episode to Earth or a satellite close to it. It's as if they aren't able to think beyond a London or Earth setting. Confining the series to one planet is a big mistake and it's going to get boring fast.6. DUMBING IT DOWN: I had the sense that the show had been dumbed down as much as possible in order to make it appeal to a bigger audience. I know they wanted the show to have the best chance it could, but this kind of display just smacks of selling out to me. The old series worked with all its high scientific concepts, regardless of the fact that none of us really understood them.7. CHEESY MELODRAMATIC MUSIC: The music is either ""stirring music"" for the emotive scenes (sounding like the soundtrack of a bad 60s romance movie) or ""spooky music"" (which sounds like Enya doing a warm up) for supposedly deep scenes.8. MORE WILL-THEY-WON'T-THEY RUBBISH: Finally, they had to include a soap opera element, with the possibility of a romance between the Doctor and Rose. Name one TV show these days that doesn't have the will-they-won't-they component. Again, another case of selling out in order to get viewers.In short, I found the series disappointing and I really didn't want to. The whole thing seemed to me like a lot of bells and whistles, designed to draw in viewers, but lacking the necessary substance beyond the surface glitter. Great special effects cannot cover for poor writing indefinitely. Eventually, when the novelty fades, people are going to start wondering why they praised this show so highly, and they'll probably start casting a fond eye back to the way it was. Trust me, I'm already there."	3.0	Dumbing Down A Legend	2006-11-11	52	28	24

All of his high school friends were always talking about ""the doctor"" and quoting obscure lines from this show.  He asked if we could watch this british series together.  I must admit that I was not really looking forward to it, as it seemed so campy and silly.  Okay - it is.  But, boy was I wrong about not wanting to watch.  We are now finishing season 3 (we have one episode left) and he asks me every night if we will have time to watch ""a Doctor Who.""  Who would expect a teenage boy to want to watch a show with his parent?  They are great fun, family friendly, no nudity and very creative (and yes, silly, funny, campy and entertaining).

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2OZBJ58CML9OS	A. Gammill	"There are many great reviews here that go into detail about the show.  And I agree with almost all of them: Doctor Who is a terrific show--fast, fun, and full of wonder.  But let me talk for minute about the price of these sets.As you probably already know, a season (or ""series"" if you like) of Doctor Who runs 13 hour-long episodes.  That's just over half the length of a season of most American one-hour shows, which usually are comprised of 22 or 24 episodes.  When you consider that a large majority of American series' full-season sets are priced at under $50, it seems hard to justify the pricetag for these BBC shows.""But Doctor Who is so much BETTER than those other shows!"" you might exclaim.  And I'd have to more or less agree, although there are exceptions such as moderately-priced sets for THE X-FILES or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I can only hope we will soon see a price drop, as was the case with some of the STAR TREK series.I love Doctor Who, but I'm holding out a better deal."	4.0	5 stars for Doctor Who, 3 stars for ridiculously high price	2008-04-26	6	5	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AU0FHYE1IT05S	A. Hayes	Doctor Who is finally back. I was eager for the toPaul McGann version of Doctor Whoto hit the screens even though that didn't feel 100% right. Christopher Eccleston's portrayal is spot on - quirky but lots of fun; serious when he needs to be. From the first episode, he seems very comfortable with the role. Great casting call.The story arcs are very good. Where the original version of the show had usually four and occasionally six episodes that made up a story, each 45 minutes story here is self-contained. However, many of the stories give tidbits into the bigger story of the season. It's a great way of doing the show.Effects are infinitely better than the original Who as is the increased use of location shooting. True Whovians won't be disappointed by lack of continuity: it's all there plus some new things that need to be filled in (the Time Lords are gone? How did that happen?) Those new to Who (like many I know) still love it since it fills in the gaps it needs to and doesn't make you feel like you are missing the joke at a party.All in all, great job all around. I would've taken any Doctor Who series. I'm glad we got one that has mass appeal to keep it on the air but stays ever true to the show that began it all.	5.0	You'll be pleased!	2007-11-23	0	0	0

I'm glad I didn't buy it, because it really is not worth the price to own this piece of dreck. The effects are awful, even worse than the old (and fun) Doctor Who. The sets in a Godzilla movie are more convincing than the sets here. Billie Piper has the acting talent of a soup can. And it was racist of them to put in the cowering black guy. At best buy it costs $84.99. It hardly looks like BBC had that budget. Obviously made for kids, but we can give them a little credit here!

Yes, it can be cheesy, but it's a great intro to the reboot and leads well into the Tennant years. Don't skip Eccleston!Note: I had issues with the Marketplace seller I purchased this set from. The first &#34;new&#34; set they sent me was falling apart and very fishy. The &#34;replacement&#34; set they sent me was missing the outer cover and I'm fairly certain they just ordered a used set from another seller and shipped it to me. In the end I was able to scrounge a complete set and returned the other to the seller, but it was terribly annoying overall. The seller was very friendly and appeared to be trying to work out the issues, but be very careful buying Who DVDs from marketplace sellers (even if they are supposed to be new DVDs). I've read reviews for other seasons by customers suspicious of pirated copies.	4.0	Love the Doctor	2013-01-03	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AE8LL9S715YTE	"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2"""	"This is a DVD pack that I have been waiting to see for so very long, much like most of you others who are Doctor Who fans.  It is so great to finally see the Doctor back on the air.  Though I loved the Paul McGann movie, I didn't think there would be many people out there who would have their eyes caught by the movie.  Which is sad because apparently it means that the DVD of the movie will never come to the states.  Still, we have this new series...and there are a lot of good things about this new series.  Chris Eccleston's Doctor is a fascinating Doctor.  Even more fascinating if you are familiar with all the other Doctors, at least through the purchase of the DVDs.  You can see the hawkishness in the face of Chris, much like that of the 1st Doctor and the 8th Doctor, the grin of the 4th Doctor, the mystery of the 7th Doctor, and the well insanity of the 6th Doctor...among others.  And yet, and yet there is so much more in this new series.  We have the mystery of the Time Wars, the good and the bad of traveling with the Doctor (as seen with Rose's mom and boyfriend), we have intimate story's like Father's Day and Dalek stories as in, well, Dalek and Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways.  What is really good about all this is that the people who are writing for the series really love the Doctor Who mythos and really want to add something new, something different, yet also still firmly grounded in who Who is.  As the 9th Doctor would say, ""fantastic!""  The only frown that I have is this, that sadly Chris is only the Doctor for one season and apparently there will not be anymore 9th Doctor novels.  I really wish the BBC would expand on the 9th Doctor's world (how he regenerated from the 8th to the 9th, besides the 8th Doctor's book The Gallifrey Chronicles) by showing him before he came to Rose, such as how he acted and how he faced his own race's destruction in the Time Wars.  Still, you do get a lot for the price of this DVD pack...you get 13 well developed stories and a large load of extras.  I firmly say this is a give me, buy this for yourself, you'll love it!"	5.0	What a way to start the new adventures!	2006-08-01	1	1	0

In fact, the last time I really watched was when a local PBS station was running the Tom Baker series and that was a Looooong time ago.  So, after hearing about the 50th anniversary and the like I decided to give a look.  Started by re-watching some Tom Baker series but admit unless you are a real &#34;fan&#34; the shows fall short for me.  So, I decided to start watching the more recent vintage series and started here.  OK, I also admit I must have been living under a rock since his companion played by Bilie Piper, was unknown to me but I did recognize her from a couple other projects.  I admit the difference in special effects and the story lines between the old and new(er) was like night and day. I very much like the interplay between this Doctor and companion.  I do wish he would have stayed around for more than a season and Christmas special however.  Even if you aren't a Dr. Who fan these are worth a look.	5.0	Yes, I'm behind the times	2014-06-18	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AVTUEH63AFOXD	Amazon Customer	Okay, so I admit that I never even wanted to watch Doctor Who.  The whole &#34;scifi&#34; genre really isn't my thing and I've always seen Doctor Who as sci-fi.  While in high school, one of my friends and her family were really into the show and I had seen bits and pieces, though I never really paid it any attention.This past February/March, my husband decided that, since he'd heard good things about the show, he'd give it a try.  It was something he would usually like, so why not.  He tried everything in his power to get me to watch it with him and I always refused, &#34;knowing&#34; that I wouldn't like it and telling him that it just wasn't my thing. I can't deny that I occasionally got sucked into it.  I would be on my computer or doing whatever and it was almost impossible for me to keep my eyes away from the TV.Long after my husband got up to date on all the current episodes, I finally admitted to him that I had liked what I had seen of the show.  I couldn't deny it any longer.  After watching the 50th Anniversary Special and The Day of The Doctor, it began driving me insane because I felt so out of the loop and I wanted to know everything that had happened up to that point.  So I decided to finally sit down and really watch theshow.This season for me was really good.  There were a lot of sci-fi-ish things in it but I found that, unlike other shows and movies, these don't really bother me because I'm so wrapped up in the storyline, the Doctor, Rose and everything that's going on between them.  The show has a lot of things to keep a person interested and is full of action, emotion and humor.I think the only thing that really annoyed me was how often Rose was the cause of the Doctor's problems.  I mean, Father's Day.  It was a great episode, but jeesh.  Every single thing was her fault.  And she just had to touch the lone Dalek, regenerating it.  I probably would have chucked her out of the TARDIS ages ago.Overall, I'm really enjoying the show and I hate the I rejected my husband's pleas so many times.  I feel bad that I'm now watching by myself and made him watch it on his own without my company.  But at least now I can share in his enthusiasm and we can talk about Doctor Who together.  :)Favorite Episode:  The Empty Child.Favorite Quote:&#34;I have to keep you safe... my Doctor.&#34;	5.0	RainyDaysandPajamas.com	2013-12-18	0	0	0

She has a curiosity about what The Doctor has to offer and is very intelligent.  In many ways she's his equal.  Christopher Eccleston is a great choice for the ninth doctor.  He's sserious and somewhat dark.  The theme of Bad Wolf running throughout the entire season was a stroke of genius.  The special effects are so much better than they used to be.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A31RM5QU797HPJ	Amazon Customer	15 years ago, a legend seemed to have died. A long-running show had tripped over itself and couldn't get up.  The Doctor's two hearts had stopped beating.  There were no more adventures through time and space in the TARDIS anymore.  A show that had started way back in the '60s just ended.  Time was up for the Doctor.  Or was it?In 1996, The Legend was brought back to life, if only for a short time.  Of course, nobody watched The Legend come back.  Nobody noticed that a blue police box was in San Fransisco and that its owner was saving our world once again.  After the Dr. Who movie, the legend seemed to be over for real this time.But, the Doctor still had five regerations to go.Christopher Eccleston brought new life to Doctor Who, along with the production crew.  The Legend that was Doctor Who is back.  Gone are the rubber alien suits, replaced by CGI. Gone are the cheap visual effects also replaced by CGI.  Could this really be Doctor Who?  The Theme sounds the same, and the humor is there.  So, it appears that Doctor Who is here to stay....at least for a while.	5.0	The Legend Returns	2006-04-04	3	3	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A21CQ00BRMPWRE	Amazon Customer	Christopher Eccleston is a fine actor, but honestly I'm not sure how Doctor Who got picked up for a second season after this. I'm by no means a whovian or whatever they call themselves, just a fan of sciFi. I've seen the rest of the series and just now got a hold of season 1. There are some interesting episodes, but to be blunt this version of the doctor is a complete and utter tool. The character obviously looks down on humans and pretty much says as much a couple times. (This is one of the things that concerned be about The 11th Hour when Matt Smith's Doctor started babbling about humans filming the end of the world on their cell phones. Apparently forgetting no one on the planet knew it was the end of the world, just something spectacular happening in the sky. But that's another rant) Honestly (and this is hardly a spoiler since there's 5 other seasons with two other doctors) when this doctor dies and regenerates that's about the best scene in the whole series. Mostly because I know how good the Tennant stuff is. I think had I suffered through this when it was released new, I'd have never gotten through it at all and wouldn't have bothered to watch any of the Tennant or Smith stuff.  Christopher Eccleston's actual acting is great, the stories are actually alright, it's just... Why would you want to watch or hang out with an alien who is all about reminding you how much better he thinks he is? Idiot monkeys in deed. It was good to watch just to see the beginning, but this condescending version of the doctor just made me want to punch the TV.	1.0	Made me want to punch my TV	2012-01-30	60	7	53

If you are even looking at this then you probably already know what you're getting into. This is the DVD set of the first series.We in the US will be surprised to find many new scenes that were cut from SciFi's & BBCA's broadcasts. Each disc has neat stuff like interviews and behind the scenes stuff. It's the new Doctor, it's on DVD.You know, I do have one thing to complain about. The packaging is not terribly practical! One must remove the plastic sleeve and then unfold the box to remove the DVDs. If you are like me and constantly switching out discs, you'll go mad and wish for a much simpler design.

Chris Eccleston was brilliant as the Ninth Doctor and is sorely missed.  He set the standard that David Tennant and following Doctors have to live up to.  Not only does Eccleston bring dark conviction, pain and vulnerability to his performance of the Doctor, he leads you through the maze that is the Whoniverse with an offbeat humor and manic intensity.  He will remain my favorite Doctor (behind Tom Baker).Billie Piper is terrific as Rose, and along with Noel Clark, brings the uncertainty and apathy of the youth of London's working class to light.My one minor creepout is that the writing/production team of Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner are intent on gaining female viewership by building up an awkward romance between Rose and the Doctor. Since they play it out innocently enough, it's not a huge thing.  And the later incarnation of Tennant's Doctor is even more charming and younger-appearing than Eccleston. But it's just a matter of time before things have to change.  As a longtime Who fan I've seen William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, and Sylvester McCoy (the ""geezer"" incarnations) take on this role, so the relationship between an ever-changing 900 year old alien with a 19 year old human girl is bound to take a weird detour that Rose may hesitate to follow, once the Doctor isn't quite so cool or adorable in appearance.But I am certain Davies can handle even that turn of events.  The writing for each episode is packed full of imagination and biting social commentary about our times (especially pointed while living through the policies of George W. Bush's administration and The War on Terror) with its increased militarism, paranoia and ambiguous fears.  The Doctor assures us we're going to be okay, but not without a fight.  And there are constant battles with ordinary folk learning that they will have to engage the powers that be in order to change their world.Some standouts in the series:Eccleston's brash performance in ""Aliens of London"" contains his delivery of one of the funniest lines in Who History.""Dalek"" sees the return of our favorite villains - essential to the Whoniverse and the Doctor's identity. Rose must take a stand that changes the Doctor for the better.""The Long Game"" shows what happens when people are seduced into perpetuating their own backwards state of affairs. The ""media"" in this new world is the key to their problems and solution.""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" introduces the controversial but charming character Jack Harkness (eventually we grow to like him). And writer Steven Moffat (Coupling) produces one of the best stories of the entire 4 seasons with this two parter.  Powerful, unforgettable writing and quotes that even David Tennant has to recall in later seasons.""Bad Wolf"" and ""Parting of the Ways""  reaffirms everything we love about this Doctor and makes our parting with him even more difficult in retrospect.  And Rose is forever changed once she sees that it's up to her (With help from Mickey and Jackie) to ensure that destruction and chaos are turned away. These last two episodes ultimately show what potential we humans possess when tested.This season is a standalone classic. It works because the true heroes are those who allow their lives to change once they've encountered the Doctor: they stop accepting their place on the sidelines, stand up in the face of overwhelming odds and do something about the mess they are in.Watch it!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ABRKIJ6D4V42O	"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster"""	"It was once said by Harlan Ellison that negative reviews are easier to write. In which case this review for the new series will be extremely short. The new Doctor Who had a unique challenge - how to update a forty-year-old TV show for a modern audience that expected a much faster-paced story than the classic series could provide? The answer is a textbook-perfect example of how to update an old show for modern audiences.Everyone in the cast and crew deserve credit for the great work they did. From the managers at BBC TV for choosing Russell T. Davies to revive the show. To Phil Collinson and Julie Gardiner for fostering a creative environment in which the writers and actors can shine. To the Mill FX for providing the most mind-blowing effects in a UK-based TV series for decades. And finally to the actors themselves for bringing a zing and a zest for life that the old series didn't always have.Billie Piper (as Rose) is the biggest standout performance throughout the entire series. She brings a strength, charisma and believability to the role that makes her character the most unique in the show's forty-plus-year history. And Christopher Eccleston also deserves credit for bringing the Doctor's portrayal into the 21st-Century. This is still (to paraphrase) absolutely the same man, but rewritten for a much more cynical harder-to-please audience.The special features on this boxset are just terrific. The commentaries are definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, apart from a BBC interview Chris doesn't make an appearance. But Billie Piper does a commentary on two episodes. But the award for Best DVD Commentary on this boxset has to go to Steven Moffat, John Barrowman and Dave Houghton for The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances. In addition to being an informative commentary, it's also a very amusing one. Some highlights being both Moffat and Barrowman gleefully pointing out the ""gay Officer's club"". And listening to Moffat desperately backflipping through plot hoops to justify the appearance of a tape recorder in World War 2 Britain. Barrowman is a real livewire, always ready with a charismatic quip. And it's an absolute delight to see that Steve Moffat in real life is as witty and clever as his scripts are.A word-of-warning however to classic series fans: The new series is most definitely not like old Who. In addition to the 45-minute episodes, there's much less time for the dense leisurely plotting and science-fiction themes that were such a huge favourite of Eighties who fans. The burping bin and the farting Slitheen might also put old fans off watching the show. But the biggest turnoff for conservative classic series fans has to be the burgeoning romance between the Doctor and Rose. A plot development which would've been an absolute no-no to Old Who fans. Anyone who's been reading the Dr Who fan forums would've noted that these developments have alienated  a large number of Old School Classic Series fans, in addition to attracting new ones.In conclusion, the 1st Series Boxset is strongly recommended for those wanting Family-friendly entertainment for a cold Winter's night. In addition to being great Science Fiction, it's just a great series - period. This new series has elevated Doctor Who to the ultimate form that we all knew it could be. Long may it reign."	5.0	Not recommended for old series fans	2007-01-14	7	5	2

The show is different than the originals, and as much as I love the original I think this season is the best. The stories are wonderful (yes some are better than others) Captian Jack is great. The final scene with Rose in episode 13 is one of the finest moments in 27 seasons. The tardis packaging and the widescreen format are an added plus.

I so liked the song that i bought the track Moonlight Serenade separately.The Dalek is what shows Doctor's acting at its best.His terrified scream, and his relief, his taunting of the dalek when its laser is powerless are amazing.These are my two favorite episodes. The Slitheen was funny, but not that great.And the initial Earth episode was stunning.I have now seen a few of them different doctors, especiallt the classic The Five Doctors.But none of them match the terrifying intensity of London Blitz or the acting skills in Dalek	5.0	Eccleston is the best Doctor	2008-02-04	3	0	3

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1CBWE8ZTY1E9P	Annikaya	I was never a Doctor Who fan, thinking it was obscure, British, and old. However, I decided to give it a shot and started watching Doctor Who, beginning with this season here. I was hooked! The first episode seems a little silly but after that things pick up quickly. You don't have to know anything about Doctor Who to start watching, since the show was off the air for awhile and it was put back on the air with the idea of catching a whole new audience. However, if you do know about Doctor Who, it's really fun to see old friends and species that reappear. Anyway, as an American girl who had never watched Doctor Who before, I went from watching this one season to watching all of the recent stuff and then going back to watch the old stuff too. I would definitely recommend this show, and this season in particular, to anyone interested in a deep, thought-provoking, adventure-filled ride!	4.0	New Doctor Who	2010-02-10	2	1	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3CTJ7W87KIIOA	"Artie ""Office Assistant"""	"What can you say about Doctor Who?  It deserves it's place alongside the likes of ""Star Trek,"" ""Star Wars"" and others as among the best Sci-Fi stories ever written about or put to film. Christopher Eccleston is great as the Doctor, doing justice to all those before him who portrayed the wandering Time Lord.  Even more so because of what his Doctor has gone through as we see him throughout this new version. This Doctor is experiencing the burden of survivor's guilt over what occurred in the Time War.No doubt that the Doctor and his new assistant Rose have feelings toward each other throughout the series, culminating with what happens in ""The Parting of the Ways.""  For one of the few times in the overall history of the series, the Doctor has a partner in Rose that he opens up to without fear of being rejected.Best thing about the return of Doctor Who? An updated version of one the eeriest (and best) opening themes in TV history.  Back to that classic theme with a more modern feel, but it doesn't take away the feeling of a viewer that you're about to embark on something scary and amazing at the same time."	5.0	A Return to Greatness	2006-03-25	15	15	0

I was taken aback by how cool the effects and flow of the stories were, as compared to to many predecessors were.  I grew to love rose and mickey and the new doctor.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1Q4776I4LX70P	A Southern Fish &#34;Todd&#34;	"This was the episode that earned my affection for the new Doctor Who.  After something of a mixed bag in ""Rose"" this episode showcases what the Russell Davies led new show would be.  On the surface it is a fun and witty romp at the end of the earth full of colorful aliens and with more than a wink towards current pop culture; it is a show that doesn't take itself as seriously as most of the classic Who.  Simultaneously, however there are dark and moody undertones and an emphasis on the main characters and their emotions that serves to give the show more adult and moving moments than most sci-fi. Companion Rose is still the showcase here and it is clear why she became so popular so quickly.  She is sympathetic and understandable (as in the scene with the alien plumber) yet headstrong and full of her own point of view (as in her ill-advised argument with Cassandra).  The doctor, after his muddled start in ""Rose"" also becomes clearer here and the dark tortured soul under the glib exterior begins to be revealed. The two dimensional Cassandra (literally a piece of skin stretched between posts with a brain in a jar connected from below) makes a great, comic and original villain.  This is where the show found its footing and definitely one of the must-sees of the first season (along with ""Dalek"", ""Father's Day"", ""The Empty Child"", ""The Doctor Dances"" and the last two episodes."	5.0	A Second Episode you Wish Couild be First	2011-03-29	5	5	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3AES1C04IQHFN	"A. Tom ""Light Talker"""	Refreshed format and story lines from the older Doctor Who's.  Usually collapsed to the new one hour format for a complete story the plots are still well developed given the fast pace and action.  Occasionally the writers do bring up points of ethical introspection.  Throughout a wonderful character development takes place.  In this opening season we see affection develop by Rose for the Doctor.  Given the accents and how quickly the dialogue moves, best to watch it uninterrupted if possible and not multi-tasking because from time to time a couple of words are used to build key motivations and subplots.	5.0	Longtime fan	2013-09-14	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1VI1WT9TN4P3T	Austin Fitzgerald	Chris Eccleston brings likeable humor to the doctor, but the issue is not with him. The issue is with, #1: The enemies. The walking mannequins are even less convincing than in the classic series (NOT due to the CGI, which always has and always will be bad -- so get used to it -- but simply because of design decisions and the characters' interactions with them), and a certain rubberized trash container gives that episode an unwelcome cartoonish flavor. Later, there are farting aliens. #2: Supporting actors. The doctor and his assistant Rose are more than adequate in their roles, but Rose's family, particularly her boyfriend, are such terrible actors (particularly when interacting with CGI. Once again, I must bring up a certain cartoon trash can) that the overall quality of the entire series is lowered. In summation, the ideas are good, but apparently the staff were on different pages as to what the tone of the series should be.	3.0	More cheesy than the later series, but still enjoyable.	2013-02-13	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1G3U0XBPV77JF	AutismMom	I bought this for my son for Christmas.

We have all of the newer Doctor Who episodes on the dvr, so whenever I can get the full seasons at a decent price, I get them to we can delete some of the episodes to hold the newer ones that come on.I hear a lot of things about this Doctor.  Whatever your opinion is of him though, this was still a great series.  It brought back Doctor Who to those who watched it before, but also introduced it to a lot of others.  If you are new to Who, I think that this is where you should start, to get an idea of what the new series of Doctor Who is about.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M	"Ax20 ""Ax20"""	A couple of weeks ago, my father kept bugging me about a show he'd recently discovered: Doctor Who. A friend had recommended the show to me over the summer and I tried it but found myself unable to get through episode one. I found the graphics and the acting to be sub-par. But my dad kept talking about it. And I mean KEPT. Like brought it up every day on our morning bus ride to the city. I told him I didn't like to watch shows not from the beginning (which would be quite a trick since the show started back in the 1960s and has been on and off since, being most recently rejuvenated in 2005). Finally, after he'd driven me crazy for...a few days, I agreed to watch the show, starting from the beginning of 2005 (he said you can start with 2010, but that's not my style).I'm glad I did because once I watched for a bit longer, I found myself actually enjoying it. Sure, the acting isn't the greatest (I often find that British shows don't have the best acting) and the special effects are greatly lacking (some of it is so incredibly old fashioned to the point where things that should be creepy feel more silly than creepy-I know sometimes they're staying true to the original series, but couldn't the Daleks have done with an upgrade?), but for some reason it's still pretty addictive.I think that discovering that Billie Piper of The Secret Diary of a Call Girl was the first of the companions amused me enough to give it a chance.The show, it turns out, is fairly clever. Sometimes the cleverness has to do with plays on history (such as meeting Agatha Christie and resolving the question of where she was for the seven days that she couldn't remember and having her think she failed as a writer) and other times it has to do with the characters.Considering the number of changes in the Doctor's companion, they do a good job of integrating each new personality so that it actually feels like they are close to the Doctor. Some are better than others of course, but always you can feel the bond that is developed.I think the thing I like best about the show is the way they handle serious issues, (SPOILER) such as the departure of Rose (giving a plausible explanation without killing her while keeping her relevant, at least for season three) and the Doctor's Daughter. I wish they did more in terms of letting us know about the Doctor, though I get that the point is that we don't know a lot. They slowly build information over the course of the show and we learn something new about him all the time.I'm only mid-season four so I can't wait to see where things go. I've heard good things about the episode I'm up to (The Library).I also particularly like how many episode are joint episodes, spanning two, sometimes even three, episodes per arc. It really allows you to get involved and to care about the characters, even when they are temporary.The concept of time travel is a complicated and confusing one, which has yet to satisfactorily be explained. You can't change events that are fixed but some are in flux and those ones can be changed. How do you determine one over the other? The Doctor knows. Not the most satisfactory answer. It may be further addressed later, but seeing as I'm pretty far into the show, I don't think so.	4.0	Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey	2011-06-21	2	2	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	"Like a lot of Americans, The Doctor always meant Tom Baker to me, but Christopher Eccleston, had he had a longer time in the role, could easily have displaced Baker for me. Not only was Eccleston's ninth doctor a wonderful mix of whimsy and tragedy, he also benefited from what has to be the best-written Doctor Who series to date.While ""Doctor Who"" has always had its moments of screenplay greatness, never has a single season had so many grace notes, including the tear-jerker ""Father's Day,"" the horror and pathos of ""The Empty Child"" and ""World War III"" and the epic science fiction of ""Bad Wolf.""The only clunker -- and it's enough of a clunker to cost it a star with me -- is the terrible decision to include far-future versions of contemporary British game shows and their version of Extreme Makeover in the penultimate episode. Forget this not holding up well in 10 years, this already feels dated and stupid.But the special effects really are (almost) comparable to contemporary American science fiction shows like ""Battlestar Galactica"" (which has the same problem with alien/futuristic people wandering around in contemporary clothes that ""Dr. Who"" does). Coupled with solid acting (even from pop star Billie Piper) and top-drawer writing, this season of ""Dr. Who"" is a winner for fans old and new.Strongly recommended for fans of science fiction television shows."	4.0	The best-written Doctor ever	2006-08-09	6	4	2

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AKIQSC2TNPA43	Bijan Joobeen	I love the Doctor Who reboot but the first season just pales in comparison to the latter ones. I generally like Christopher Eccleston, but as the Doctor he lacks the presence and intrigue brought forth by both David Tennant and Matt Smith. Despite my issues with Eccleston, this is a very important season as it sets up the stage for that which has yet to come (or that which has already occurred depending on how you perceive time). I may be a bit unfair with criticisms but regardless, the series only gets better!	3.0	Only reason I don't give more stars is because I review this after watching the tenth and eleventh doctors	2013-08-29	0	0	0

It got me started in watching the series.  After that, each episode had its moments.  Billie Piper (Rose) steals the show as she acts like this is really herself if real life.  It felt natural .  The 2nd episode, End of the World, was just 'meh' for me.  3rd, Unquiet Dead, was good---it's story interlaced with factual portrayals of Charles Dickens and the period.  ""Fathers Day"" was pretty decent.  The other episodes are good but maybe not great.After season 1, I've only been able to watch David Tennant as the Doctor.  Matt Smith doesn't do anything for me other than nausea.  And, I've tried to like him by watching Vincent (Van Gogh) but it doesn't work for meMartha Jones (Freema) was a great replacement for Billie, when she went off to a higher calling portraying a call girl...

"The witty and sometimes casual and unofficial Doctor of Time travel has gotten another facelift(and personality).  this time a freethinking, fast-paced(often labeled ""manic"") Doctor who rides roller costers(so-to speak) and runs around not(needing to or feeling the need to) explain everything to everyone.  Where Tom Baker left off, this guy picks up.  Sylvester McCoy's subtle underplay and quick mumblings is not understood, yet this guy ""The Escalator"" is well understood without even explaining.  Rose is only ""tollerable"" to him and vica-versa.  The personalities are so contrast that it is a lesson in excpting(as in both of them) without understanding them.  DW's ""anchor"" as said by the editor review is the rare and very deep explamation for exactly ""who"" and ""what"" in the Planet of Hades he is.  The TARDIS(since Paul McGann) has been totaly redifined from the inside(as I predicted) and is a post-modern(as in NOT modern) disaster with convention thrown in for style not function.  buttons are replaced by knobs(transistor radio that is) a huge wall mounted veiwing screen is replaced by a tiny lap top computer for the outside world(as in William Hartnel's TV display)  By the way, Will and Pat's classic Doctor Who was what the producers were going for here.  The clunky, campy and comical and serious mixed together with as much beleviblity as possible.  And it works, farts and all.  I don't normally think so but in this it's the exception.  Just PU LEEZ don't think of Eddie Murphy's stupid ""Nutty Professor"" movies.  Those were just stupid and not to be compared.  Although the classics didn't have ""farting aliens"" Patric Troughton was just as odd ball in the Luner epsiod where he checked everyone's shoes for infections(while the moonbase persons were still waring them).

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1X3U7TT9XXJ9V	"Blake Elder ""Blakey"""	I was quite excited at the prospect of a new Doctor Who series - the old show is a classic, a powerful icon of sci-fi culture.  What we have here, however, is a greatly flawed revamp of the show.  The writer and producers obviously went all out to reshape and redefine the entire Dr Who legend, no doubt to draw in a new generation of viewers.  One aspect you could definitely describe as an improvement - the CG effects are quite impressive and lightyears ahead of what they had twenty years ago.  Apart from that, however, there is little that I can say in its favour.  It has a sleekness to it which is very modern, and perhaps over-emphasised.  The main issues I have with this version are:The One Episode Story Format over the Old Multi-Episode Story Format:  Most stories in the old Doctor Who ran for several half-hour episodes.  At the end of each half-hour there would be some sort of cliff-hanger.  In this new version, the setting for the story is introduced, the Dr and his companions walk around finding out what is going on, and after twenty minutes or so, a highly dangerous situation would become a apparent - eg. A practically unstoppable Dalek becomes active.  Then the pace would begin to quicken, the situation would appear hopeless, and in some completely corny way, it would be resolved in the final couple of minutes.In the meantime, we would be subject to an enormous amount of sentimentality as the Dr and his companions talk about their feelings or gaze into each other's eyes or something else as equally inane and inappropriate for the situation they are in.  Why so much emotionalism?  Is it due to that Russell T. Davies guy?  Is he forgetting which genre Dr Who is?  Please get a new writer.By changing the format of the show, they have sabotaged a very effective formula for the telling of stories in the Dr Who universe.  It worked for decades.  Why did they change it?This format also includes the most grating musical scores I have ever been subjected to.  It mirrors the exponentially accelerating pace of each episode, getting louder and more obnoxious as it moves along.  By the time you get to the overly-dramatic and implausible resolution of the episode, you are being bombarded by a cacophony of sound right off the decibel range.  It doesn't add to the drama, it just enrages you.The last issue I wish to mention is the layout of the TARDIS - it's organic look, like a greenhouse merged with a bad abstract painting, doesn't work.  The console might look appropriate in a old oil refinery that nature has tried to claim back, but not as the central controls and brain of a ultra-advanced space/time vehicle.  What highly advanced beings would design something like that?!	2.0	What have they done to it?	2006-12-08	51	13	38

It's as good as the original series. My only beef with it is the fact that they return to earth too many times instead of going to different planets. The original series was more about travelling to distant planets but so far (even in the second season), it has all revolved around earth with a few exceptions of episodes taking place in space stations. Since we now have great CGI, it would be wonderful to see them travel to different places.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Brent Butler	First, Chris Eccelston had a glorious season getting Dr. Who back off to at great start in the reboot. He brought both a darkness and a joy to the role that no other actor has achieved, before or since, in my opinion. He's a guy with a look that would convince anyone or anything they didn't really want to mess with him.Billie Piper made instant fans with her portrayal of Rose ... innocent, loyal, and brave as the Dr's ubiquitious boon companion.The plots in season one were fresh and inventive while at the same time embracing elements of the cheesiness of earlier special effects and props from the previous, low budget series. The Darloks were shined up a bit, but remained true to their earlier steam machine incarnations. The first season hooked us in and we haven't stopped watching yet, despite the fact that I think the next two actors were small steps down each time.Highly recommended.	5.0	A great start to the reboot	2011-11-08	2	2	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AJ5MZZ596YM2C	Brent Pieczynski	This episode established the mood for the Series with the transmitter hidden in sight while not instantly explaining how the Doctor understood the misunderstood life-form, known as the Consciousness.  The act of explaining the reason for the invasion being a wealth of resources that could be used is justifiable, because of destroyed planets.  A panic at the end causing plenty of destruction is a classic example of the build up to create believability at the end. A response to reveal how people with their sense of reality violated would act at the end pulls the story together for a sense of ending.The end where the strange man offers the young woman the option of an exciting life is hook to catch the viewer for watching the next show.  I admired how Rose's attention was captured by that Doctor evading that curious woman's questions as part of, believable building of a relationship.  An escape was desired with the Doctor knowing of Rose's future so he could justify in his mind taking her away.	5.0	Mood for the season.	2011-10-13	3	1	2

But as of 2005 he is looking middle-aged in this incarnation and has a fun friend, Rose Tyler. Rose has a boyfriend Mickey, but the Doctor keeps calling him Rickey. Most fun is Rose's poor mother, with a daughter who keeps gallivanting off in space and time. This season is lively stuff for the Brits, compared with their Aztec days. (Although the BBC Radiophonic Workshop did a better job with the theme music back then.) The &#34;Father's Day&#34; episode from this season has interesting &#34;space-time&#34; considerations. The Doctor this season is Christopher Eccleston. He is the &#34;2005 Doctor&#34; and voted third most popular of the ten.

I wasn't prepared for such poor quality writing, and it became quite obvious that Chris Eccleston didn't really relate to the character. Billie Piper has two facial expressions and is by far the worst companion the Doctor has ever had. The stories are mostly borrowed from such things as Pigs In Space and The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe. There is very little originality, imagination, or respect for the original Who concept. Plus, the monsters are extremely un-scary.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3DG93E8TXMKZF	"BytemanProofreader at Gmail ""JohnnyWill"""	Many years ago, I watched Doctor Who on PBS when I could, but I lost track of The Doctor when I moved to Arkansas in 1992.Now that I've got Amazon Prime, I'm delighted to see that they have many seasons of Doctor Who, both original and rebooted series.I decided to watch the reboots first, and I'm enjoying them as much as I remember enjoying the older doctors.Though the doctors change, and the companions change, I like the way that it happens logically. I better understand how and why The Doctor regenerates, and I even understand how each of the Time Lords (back where there were more than one) chose their names, as our multiply-lived &#34;The Doctor&#34; chose his.I like the way that the producers and writers found creative ways to keep bringing back the various bad guys, and I like the way that some of the so-called villains are not always villainous, but merely seeing life from a different perspective.Don't forget to watch the specials. They are longer so usually have extra time to spend on a particularly special story. Some of them include &#34;Making Of&#34; episodes that show how much of the filming happened, and other trivia.While it isn't necessary to watch the seasons and specials in any particular order, you can find complete listings of the episodes online.The copy I found shows this order for the reboot:Reboot Season One: 9th doctorReboot Season 2-3-4: 10th doctorDavid Tennant Specials: 10th doctorReboot Season 5: 11th doctorSpecial: A Christmas CarolReboot Season 6: 11th doctorSpecial: The Doctor, the Widow and the WardrobeReboot Season 7: part one (5 episodes)Special: The SnowmenReboot Season 7: part two (8 episodes)and of course, there are also Special Specials that do not fit anywhere in the timeline aboveDW: Best of the DoctorsDW: Best of the MonstersDW: Best of the CompanionsDW: Best of the Christmas SpecialsDW: The CompanionsIf you enjoy time travel, sci fi, fantasy, or just plain fun, try Doctor Who?John	5.0	The resurrected rebooted seasons are wonderful, better than I imagined	2014-04-23	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	Now to start off I must admit something, I was never a fan of the old series as I simply saw them as too silly and a bit too pompous. Also before I address the actual show I would like to address a reviewer who gave this 1 star by saying the Dr. calls the Tardis a spaceship and it never leaves Earth. This displays that you obviously haven't been paying attention as in the second or third episode the Dr. takes Rose 5 Billion years into the future to the end of the Earth. This episode is primarily featured in space and from Earth.When I first discovered that Russell T. Davies was bringing back the show, I became very excited as I was very curious as to what Russell would bring to the table. At the beginning when the cast was announced, I became sceptical for the first time, Christopher Eccleston as the Doc and Billie Piper of all people as his companion Rose Tyler. These two are a prime example of never judge before you see it for yourself as they both gave excellent acting performances throughout the series. I said earlier that the old series were quite pompous, this was due to the fact that the characters who played the doctor in the past were people with very middle class voices and attitudes and simply it wouldn't fit with todays young audience. This, to some may be a bad thing but to me it's an even better way to re-invent the whole character of Dr Who and show a new side to him that we have never seen before.The relationship between the Dr. & Rose developes into an unrequited love relationship, Rose grows to care for the Dr. more and more through the series to a point where you believe she starts to love him and the Dr. grows into the father figure that Rose never had and gains a responsibility for her to the point where he would risk his life for her. Throughout the series we are introduced to individual characters and taught to appreciate them in the same way as we appreciate the Dr. & Rose. Mickey & Captain Jack are the two more complex side characters in the series, Mickey fighting for the heart of Rose once again as the is drawn ever closer to the Dr. and Captain Jack the feisty heroic American who is featured in only a few episodes and was first introduced to us when the Dr. and Rose took a trip to War Time Britain.A very good reinvention to the series and something that will be a benchmark in history as something that not only changed the Dr. Who image, but something that changed the entire face of Sci-Fi Drama.	5.0	An Amazing Re-Invention	2008-03-04	4	4	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	I will be very surprised if any fan of the orginal series does not enjoy this return of Doctor Who. I was not a big fan of the first Doctor William Hartnell but the second Doctor and all the rest I enjoyed. I especially liked Tom Baker, Pertwee, and Davison. This new Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston has his own distinct personality which always made previous Doctors unique and kept us interested. The cast and the music is good which you could say about previous Doctors episodes, but the special effects are excellent which you could not say about the previous episodes. Sure we still love them, cheesy F/X or not, but it is nice to see some cool new effects. I have several episodes of earlier Doctors on DVD, and now I just ordered this from Amazon since their price is very reasonable. Especially if you price what it would cost for 13 episodes of the originals at around $18 plus a piece. I don't see this getting much cheaper since the demand is there as it was with the other Doctors and everyone is looking forward to seeing a new season and a new Doctor. I recommend this to all fans of SciFi but in particular to fans of the original series.	5.0	The Doctor	2006-07-12	1	1	0

He is a darker, more alien Doctor, changed by events we humans cannot begin to comprehend.

The stories were superior and Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper are loads of fun.  I'd seen a couple of the episodes on tv, but was even more impressed with the full series.  I'd expected there to be one or two duds in the set, since even with the best, that's often the case.  But there wasn't a bad one in the bunch!  Billie Piper is a perfect ""companion"".  She adds so much to every scene without stealing the thunder.  Eccleston is a great Doctor, I think.  I've been in love with a number of the others, and I half expected to feel a bit more critical, but he brings a depth and seriousness to the role and yet continues the adventure and fun of the part at the same time.  Quite a surprise!  He pulls off his own style and continues the tradition really excellently.  I wish he had done more episodes, frankly.  As it is, however, I fully expect to be watching and re-watching the First Series for a long, long time."	5.0	Who's on First	2007-02-06	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AESVYHGQ9ATNG	Christopher Knapp	Christopher Eccleston, assuming the role of the Doctor after the cataclysmic Time War, is the first Doctor of the reboot of Doctor Who. He does an astounding job as the titular character, not only bringing the feeling of being the silly Time Lord back but also assuming the role of a war-weary veteran.However, Billie Piper's character, Rose Tyler, is one of the most obnoxious Mary Sue characters to be the unknowing sidekick to the Doctor. She's a dumb blonde whenever she should be saved by the Doctor, will flirt with ANY male character, and continually does phenomenally stupid things to the point that Christopher Eccleston's Doctor should have simply taken her home and left her there.All this said about Rose Tyler, though, the First Series of Doctor Who has great episodes such as Dalek and The Empty Child, and is definitely worth putting up with watching Rose being a nitwit.	4.0	Eccleston was a Phenomenal Doctor, wish he didn't have to deal with Piper as a Companion	2012-12-03	2	0	2

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A25N9CA0ZW4FU6	Christopher Prewitt	I had watched the original series on PBS repeats back when I was in High School.  By the last three or four seasons, the series was so bad it nearly drew blood from my eyes.  I remember being sad because the reruns from the 70s were so much better (the problem was JNT... but that's an argument for elsewhere, I think...).When I heard the BBC was going to revive the series, I was skeptical (again, visions of Sylvester McCoy prattling around like a moron).  This was exacerbated when news came almost right on the heels saying that the lead had already quit!However, they got it right.  They kept everything that worked in Doctor Who, and chucked most of the chaff.  The stories for the season are great (particularly Dalek, Father's Day, and the WWII two parter).  The acting is outstanding.  It's a real shame Chris Eccleston left, because he captured the magic of the Doctor.  We still have Billie Piper for another season though!  She does a wonderful job this first season, another great surprise.So, to sum up, great acting and good stories (not to mention the obvious improvement on special effects).  Well worth your time.	5.0	A pleasant surprise...	2006-08-26	3	2	1

I had no idea what this was all about but she mentioned it was from a show called Doctor Who (who?). I went to it on my Kindle Fire and have been watching various episodes ever since and it is rather fascinating. How the British cram so much into a segment is amazing. I have found out that this &#34;telephone booth&#34; is actually an intergalactic time-traveling whatcha-macallit. Leave it to the British to take something mundane and turn it into something exotic. I have watched maybe 8-9 shows and I guess it has got me hooked. It is sometimes rather corny but one goes along with it.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AKHJVOYEX6QME	"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;"""	"Like a lot of teenage geeks, I was a fan of the Doctor Who episodes that showed on PBS in the early 1980s, mostly Tom Baker and Peter Davison with a bit of the older Doctors and Colin Baker thrown in.  In the mid to late 1980s, with newer interests, the dropping of the Doctor from most PBS stations, and ultimately the cancellation of the show, I wandered away from Who fandom, filing it with other youthful crushes like (the old, bad) Battlestar Galactica.I heard of the ill-fated 1996 movie/Fox TV revival attempt but the bad reviews kept me away.  But the casting of Christopher Eccleston as the new Doctor in 2005, and talk from devoted fans that the new show was great, piqued my interest, and I was finally able to watch the new series on the DVD set.In Eccleston's Doctor's favorite word, it's fantastic!Russell T. Davies marries a deep love for the character and the past history of the show with a modern 21st century sensibility and brings the subtext of the traditional character--the edge of danger, the melancholy of seeing and knowing so much (maybe too much?), the moral gravitas, the whispers of chemistry with the companions--into the text, while keeping much of the sense of wonder and cheeky wit of the original incarnations.I can't say enough good things about Eccleston's Doctor and his more than worthy companion, Rose (Billie Piper).  The two, and the relationship between them, are the heart and soul of the series.  Davies' choice to give Rose a real backstory, characters back home who care about her and worry about her, is a stroke of genius, as they wind in and out of the episodes and fluctuate between acting as a good anchor (giving Rose a base of love and support in our world) and a bad one (trying to drag her into a smaller version of life).The series gets off to a slowish start with the first few episodes.  My initial reaction was ""Okay this doesn't suck and it's nice to see the Doctor wearing something sexier than a long scarf"".  But it still felt like a take it or leave it proposition.  The worst episodes, the two-parter featuring the ridiculously farting Slytheen, are paradoxically where things start to gain traction, as we really start to see the intensity of the Doctor's caring about Rose, and about supporting the side of right and good in the universe.But that's just the beginning.  The show enters a whole new plane in Epsisode 6, Dalek, where the Doctor has a confrontation with the last surviving member of that venerable evil species.  The show fires on all cylinders, from comedic intervals with the bad-guy American gazillionaire collecting alien artifacts, to the Doctor facing his own demons as a genocide and sole survivor of a horrific event, to the potential loss of Rose at the hands (claw? laser arm?) of his most fearsome enemy.From there through Episode 13, it's a stunning ride that just keeps getting better and better, from moments of laugh out loud comedy to ones that have tears flowing.  The addition of con man Jack Harkness in Episode 9 is just icing on the cake.  The final two episodes are near perfection in wrapping up all the myriad themes and storylines of the series and giving Eccleston's Doctor an amazing send-off.My only complaint is that the team of Rose/Eccleston-Doctor/Harkness is so wonderful, it's just too bad that they only get 5 episodes to shine.  I could have done with another 13 before the inevitable regeneration.But.  What a series it is.  It does the job, revitalizing and maturing the Doctor Who character and canon and breathing new life into the entire premise of the show, and does it with such panache and verve and confidence that as much as I enjoyed the old Doctor back in the day, this series has leaped to the front of them all as my favorite ever.  To say I look forward to what David Tennant does in the next series is the understatement of, well, several centuries."	5.0	Fantastic!	2007-03-25	9	9	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AQVBOVE8P7K3J	Condor Libros	"A solid start to the new series run. Not the best of the new seasons, by any stretch (a few of the episodes here are a bit too silly even for ""Who,"" and the writing in one or two episodes is rather weak - clearly the new writers feeling things out), but a respectable start.My biggest regret here is that Eccleston didn't sign up for another run. Mind you, we got enormously lucky and got Tennant for the second season (he was such fun), but I'd argue that Eccleston was actually the better man to restart the series in Season 1 - at least given the recent backstory that the writers gave him (the Time War, the death of the Doctor's people). Eccleston brings a gravity and melancholy to the part that really work, and that I'm not sure Tennant would have nailed as well (at least not that melancholy, anyway). Yet Eccleston is also delightfully and eccentrically funny, physical, and slightly dangerous (but never overly-so).

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A11GO5VA74HD8K	Crazy Fox	"All in all, this is a fantastic regeneration of a classic TV series, and it's nice to have the ""Doctor Who"" saga continuing after such a long and unfortunate lapse. Still, as anyone familiar with the show knows, the Doctor is always disoriented and weakened immediately after he regenerates, and the same must be admitted of this first season. It's still better than much of what passes for entertainment nowadays, and I liked it a lot, but it must be admitted that it falls somewhat short of its full potential and of what longtime followers of the renegade Time Lord's adventures have come to expect.Christopher Eccleston's rendition of the Doctor is a compelling one, and he brings a real screen presence and charisma to the role. He's taken on the much beloved eccentricity, lighthearted wackiness, and comforting sense of justice of the character and alloyed it with a bitter sense of sarcasm and a short temper in a convincing fashion (with a streak of arrogance reminiscent of William Hartnell's original Doctor). It's a tough balance to strike, but he manages quite well and gives us a Doctor who is very much alien but very much likeable.The Doctor's companion Rose is also a nice, believable character with a more active role in the stories and a life outside the Tardis--the effects upon both oneself and one's family & friends of whisking oneself away from one's everyday grind and traveling time and space with a cosmic hobo is explored here in a way unprecedented in ""Doctor Who"" history and I found it refreshingly realistic and original. Even if it all does get a bit ""domestic"" sometimes.However, while it's all fine and well to give the show a faster pace in line with contemporary sensibilities and frankly wonderful to endow it with the production values it's always deserved (i.e. cool special effects), the heart of ""Doctor Who"" has always been in the excellent quality of its science fiction storytelling, and that's the part that's really shaky and unsteady here. Actually, the first three stories are truly excellent and well-told, but the quality starts gradually dropping off from there (with peaks nonetheless, like ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child""). Many of the stories seem a bit rushed and slapdash, with crisis resolutions annoyingly sudden and unprepared for, like rabbits pulled out of a magician's hat. The worst offender on the latter score transpires in the otherwise exciting and promising season finale, where we get a very literal (!) ""Deus ex Machina"" solution--c'mon folks, even the ancient Greeks got tired of that one.Still, I'm willing to chalk these shortcoming up to regeneration disorientation. Overall, the show is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable, and it's nice to have the ride of a lifetime (or nine lifetimes, rather) back on the road again."	4.0	"""Did I mention?

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A146F287VCYOYY	"Cree Dalene ""Adventure Guide Extraordinaire"""	I came across Dr Who in early 2009, and watched every available episode from Series 1 & 2. Much to my surprise, I discovered that Doctor Who had been around since 1962, and was just as cool then as it had been forty-seven years before I'd ever heard of it.This 'season' re-introduces the Doctor in his latest regeneration, as well as his companion Rose Tyler. Both Actors did an outstanding job, and I highly recommend this series to anyone with a little taste for sci-fi/fantasy.	5.0	Doctor Who	2012-05-29	4	3	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2CISZ4JLKQRJA	C. Richard	I used to work with a guy who was a big fan of the older Dr. Who series. I had trouble getting into it for some reason.Recently, the latest incarnation started on BBC America. I was not that impressed. My old friend suggested the episodes with the two doctors who came right before the present one.I just finished the first series of these episodes and I really really liked them. They are just great.The British have a slightly different take on sci fi than Americans I guess and this made it refreshing to me - the voices of the Daliks are too much. It took me a little while to get used to the accents of the characters, but I managed it. They are very likeable so it is worth the slight effort required. The story lines are quite varied and interesting. Where would you go if you could go anywhere in the universe at any time?The doctor in these episodes left the program after this series. He was very good. I am just starting the next series and I am not sure which one I will like better.In any case, give these episodes a try if you like sci fi - sorry for the cheesy rhyme there.	5.0	GREAT!!!!!!!	2010-06-11	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1RD1LL5E5JZOT	"Crookedmouth "":-/"""	Doctor Who needs little introduction - a TV sci-fi series that started way back in the 1960's that ran more or less continuously until the late 1980's and was required Saturday night viewing for generations of British kids. It was notable for it's scary monster of the week theme, the changing title role, the Doctor's slightly ramshackle mode of conveyance and the variety of &#34;Doctor's Companions&#34;. Sadly, it was also notable for it's limited budget, wobbly sets and man-in-a-rubber-suit aliens. However, despite its failings, it gained a special place in the nation's conciousness and is looked back on with fondness by many.After a seventeen year break, the series restarted in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the tenth Doctor, Billie Piper as his travelling companion Rose and Russell T Davies behind the typewriter to carry the Series through 13 episodes, to wit:- &#34;Rose&#34;- &#34;The End of the World&#34;- &#34;The Unquiet Dead&#34;- &#34;Aliens of London&#34;- &#34;World War Three&#34;- &#34;Dalek&#34;- &#34;The Long Game&#34;- &#34;Father's Day&#34;- &#34;The Empty Child&#34;- &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;- &#34;Boom Town&#34;- &#34;Bad Wolf&#34;- &#34;The Parting of the Ways&#34;This first of the &#34;reimagined&#34; series has some strong themes, largely based around the Doctor's somewhat patronising admiration for the terribly backward, parochial yet still wonderful people of Earth and his developing (but of course, chaste) relationship with Rose Tyler. It does struggle however, oh yes. The monsters are still mostly rubber suits (human-inhabited or not), most of the scrapes are solved (or at least mitigated) by means of the ubiquitous sonic screwdriver, and the elephant in the room is that all of those scrapes /could/ simply be sorted by the Doctor popping forward (or backward) in time a few more years. Also, while Ecclestone clearly wanted to develop an unique persona - slightly unhinged but terminally optimistic - his mad, bouncy grin simply annoys.I suppose one can forgive, however. After nearly two decades away, some time would be needed to bed in and find feet. And there ARE some outstanding episodes, in particular &#34;Dalek&#34; and &#34;The Empty Child&#34;/&#34;Doctor Dances&#34;. Also, several new and subsequently recurring characters make their entrances; Harriet Jones and Jack Harkness, to name but two, and there are some sweet cameos to spot as well. Interestingly, there is also the genesis of several recurring references and story arcs that make themselves felt in subsequent series, such as &#34;Bad Wolf&#34; and The Time War. Finally, we are also introduced to Mark Gatiss who is a huge asset to the franchise in his recurring and intermittent role as screenwriter (&#34;The Unquiet Dead&#34;).In the end, however, I felt that the series was a bit of a letdown - not half as good as I remembered it to have been when I watched it with my (then) pre-teen daughter. It is nevertheless good entertainment and essential viewing if for no other reason (and it's NOT the only reason) than to provide continuity into the next series.The five discs come with a short &#34;making of&#34; documentary for each episode, plus various trailers commentaries and video diaries.	3.0	The Good doctor and Bad wolf	2014-02-28	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3M3DP4YU8CSY1	"C. Stanley ""Book Worm"""	"Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper star in this wonderfully bizarre, colourful new series of Doctor Who.  If you loved the previous seven (or is it eight?) doctors you'll love Eccleston's interpretation of this loveable eccentric.  The Complete First Series is packed full of absurd plot twists, zany characters and goofy special effects that Doctor Who fans have come to love over the years.  The signature BBC cardboard scenery has been partly replaced with CG and the special effects are more high tech but that doesn't detract from the unique storylines.  You'll meet all kinds of evil villains, updated for the ""me generation"", not forgetting the Doctor's arch nemeses, the Daleks.  Rose (Billie Piper) is a perfect companion for the Doctor.  She's street smart, sassy, cute, and brave.  You may notice some sexual tension between the good Doctor and Rose later on especially when a third character comes on board.  Rose's down to earth Mum is also an enjoyable character.  Other notable chars. include Rose's jealous boyfriend who comes through in the end, a wonderful group of flatulent mobsters, Charles Dickens, and a cute ex-con."	4.0	Fasten your seatbelts for an action-packed sci-fi comedy	2006-08-14	3	1	2

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ABVG6TCSYQ6ZE	David Barro	Other reviews of this product are pretty good, especially when it comes to the reviews of the individual episodes. But here's what you need to know about this packaged set.Just to sum things up: the packaging for this product is very cool. The inside layout is of the TARDIS console room, and it's printed on the DVDs the same way as the rest of the interior. Although the arrangement of the DVDs is pretty cool, one thing to be aware of is that you kinda have to take out DVD 1 in order to get to DVD 2, and likewise you have to take out DVD 3 in order to take out DVD 4. I feel it a minor inconvenience, but a small price to pay for really individualistic packaging.There is a fifth disc which contains the Doctor Who Confidential episodes which act as companion to the regular Doctor Who episodes. One thing to note is that DWC is a half-hour program. On this extra DVD, however, the DWC episodes are cut down to about 10 minutes apiece, so they all can fit on the DVD. As of yet, there are no plans to release Doctor Who Confidential on its own DVD set, for shame. So, these 10-minute episodes are the best you can get.All in all, if you're positively a Doctor Who fanatic, you should have this package.	5.0	Important notes about this DVD set	2006-09-11	9	9	0

Watch it all from the originals to now, just make sure whatever you do you avoid any of the shows or films that American producers had anything to do with, every one of them couldn't stick to the story line and were honestly just horrible. I hope the Dr keeps at it for many many many more life times... :)	5.0	Great Dr Who!	2011-11-13	4	3	1

The show, along with the doctor, has gone through some astounding changes.But our beloved Blue Box has never changed.  Reday and able to whisk us to adventures set in the deep past, the relative present, or the farthest, most flung future.Pity that Christopher Eccleson was the shortest lived doctor of the entire series. And just when he was hitting his stride.Ah yes... what's his name of the Universial movie. Sorry, he does not exist. Just like the two Cushing movies.Other than that, I'm looking foreward to the new voyages of the T.A.R.D.I.S.

Absolutely love the new Dr. Who series just as much as I loved the first batch (though I didn't come to the show until John Pertwee, but have been a fan ever since). The writing, the acting, and the technical aspects of the new Dr. Who are nothing less than wonderful, especially for a TV show.This particular doctor is not my favorite, and in many ways I am glad he was only around for one season, but he was still very good, and the adventures he and Rose go on are splendidly creative and well-written.	5.0	Starts out great and stays there.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AM4RMGZD6HYMS	"David R. Mckenzie ""Ferret"""	"For those of us that actually remember The Cold War and fuel prices that were less than a dollar there was a great Tv Show called Doctor Who. It came from Great Britain and featured cheesy special effects and a constantly changing main character. Afterr a while, you got to know ""The Doctor"" and the world he lived in and if you were lucky enough to get it on local PBS stations it became a weekly ritual (and of course the marathons durring the Pledge Drives!)Okay, maybe this is more me than everyone, but for those that were like me, you can relate. The show had a good run. It ran for over 25 seasons and featured seven Doctors as well as countless ""Companions"" (random people that hung out with him and mostly got into horrible situations that required rescuing). However, in 1988 it went away seemingly forever. There was an attempt to bring it back through a colaboration between the BBC and Fox Tv in the early 90's, but it really wasn't ""series-worthy"".Now, let's fast forward ahead nearly one and a half decades and the show is back. There's another new Doctor and right off the bat he has a companion. But, this show is different. Instead of being made of episodes with 4-7 parts, it's done with a series of 45 minute self-contained episodes. The special effects are improved (although, still kinda' cheesy by American standards) and the writing's a lot better. The Doctor actually has more depth to his character and he and his companion, Rose, have more of a true friendship going. You actually care about these two. More than one episode left me in tears at the end (especially the season finale).If you're a fan of the classic series or just someone that wants to see a good modern sci-fi-drama, this boxed set is for you.But wait, there's more! Also included is a series of behind the scenes shows called ""Doctor Who Confidential"" hosted by Simon Pegg (Shaun of ""Shaun of the Dead"") giving lots of insight into the show (but, wait until you've watched all the episodes first! You don't want to spoil the fun)It's worth the time and the money to get this great set.-Ferret"	5.0	The Classic is New Again	2007-01-10	3	2	1

My review here will therefore deal more with the DVD set itself.The box set is attractively packaged. The picture of the Doctor and Rose is on a clear plastic sleeve, and the box iteslf can be opened  into a TARDIS model (OK, not really, but it does have 4 panels). There are 5 discs, the first 4 are 3-4 episodes per disc, with commentary and short featurettes dealing with the special effects. The fifth disc includes 9 ""cut down"" episodes of Doctor Who Confidential, which aired on BBC3 after the Doctor Who episodes premiered on BBC1. DWC is about what it sounds like, with plenty of behind-the-scenes interviews and ""How did they do that?"" segments. Each one is pared down to ~15 minutes. Mine also came with two flyer ads for Doctor Who books, a comment card (oddly enough, targeted to USA customers, despite buying the DVD set from Canada), and a 16-page booklet with plot outlines, credits, and pictures. All the episodes are in widescreen format and 5.1 surround sound. The quality is as good as if it were a movie.I should give my opinion of the show itself. I always liked Doctor Who for its humor, and brilliant storylines. What I didn't like were the sub-par special effects. I believe this series fixes what little was wrong with the original series while keeping what made it great. They clearly have a much greater SFX budget this time around. If you've read this far, you're probably going to buy it anyway. If you really can't wait until July (as I obviously couldn't), you can get it from amazon.ca but it'll cost more for the international shipping."	5.0	Excellent DVD set!	2006-03-23	12	12	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A13OUB4K10Z7F1	Dennis Evans	"I have been a Doctor Who fan since the debut of the modern series in 2005.  I have every episode of the modern series on DVD, along with 30 episodes of the 1963-1989 series.Season 1 is my favorite season of the modern series, followed by Season 5 and Season 4 in that order.  Season 1 accounts for 4 of my all-time top 11 episodes and 4 of my top 8 modern episodes - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Dalek, Father's Day, and Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways, with The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances rating number one on my all-time list.  The corresponding figures for Seasons 2, 3, 4, ""4.5"" (the 4 specials from 2009), and 5 are 0, 2, 1, 0 and 1 episode, in that order.  The only respect in which any other season is better than Season 1 is in the number of really rotten episodes.  Season 5 had only 1 really rotten episode - Victory of the Daleks - compared to 3 for Season 1 (Rose, The End of the World, and the Long Game) and 3 or 4 per year for Seasons 2-4.  I also think that Season 1 contained the most under-rated episode of the modern series - Boom Town.  Boom Town got very negative ratings from the viewers in the Doctor Who Magazine poll and in the Doctor Who Dynamic Rankings web site, but I thought this story had an interesting plot and good acting.  It was very short on action, which probably hurt it with most viewers.Part of my enthusiasm for Season 1 is due to the actors and characters.  Christopher Eccleston did a great portrayal of the Ninth Doctor as angry, enigmatic, lonely, and occasionally vengeful, but also fundamentally brave, honorable, and helpful.  As for the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler/Billie Piper is my all-time favorite companion.  I also liked the fact that Rose had a meaningful ""back story,"" and I really liked the interplay between the Doctor, Rose, Jackie Tyler (Rose's mother) and Mickey Smith (Rose's boyfriend when she met the doctor).  There was nothing to match this interplay in the later seasons, and the only interactions that came close were those between the Tenth Doctor, his companion Donna, and Wilfred Mott (Donna's grandfather) and those between the Eleventh Doctor, his companion Amy Pond, and her boyfriend Rory Williams.The rest of my preference for Season 1 is due to the writing.  Season 1 included my favorite Steven Moffatt episode (The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances), an episode by Paul Cornell, and an episode by Robert Shearman.  I think that these were the 3 best writers of the modern series, and only Season 1 features all 3 of them.  Moreover, Russell T. Davies, who was the primary writer for Seasons 1-4.5, was at his best during Season 1.  I think he started to burn out from over-work in the later seasons where he was the show's producer."	5.0	Great Season of Doctor Who	2010-12-01	2	1	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AIXZ614CM09RH	Dennis Maloney	I wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard the show was coming back-a feeling familiar to many fans. After 16 years of false starts and rumors the show was finally coming back. Would it be any good? Who is Russell T Davies or Christopher Eccleston? These and many other questions must have run through many fan's minds as they did through mine.I began to have a good feeling when I read some interviews and Russell T's column in Doctor Who Magazine. I felt that the show was in good hands and eagerly awaited my first glimpse of the show. Sure I was disapoointed when the show wasn't picked up in the US but thanks to the internet I was able to see all the episodes as well as the Confidential documentaries.All I can say is it was worth the wait. Eccleston made an intense, forceful Doctor and Billie Piper was a revelation as Rose Tyler. Both of them and the show itself were deserving of the awards and praise they received.I'm enjoying seeing the episodes on the Sci-Fi channel and will be there in early July to buy this set.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1LUK5JTVULPE8	"Devony ""simon whittingham"""	I was very sceptical when I heard they were remaking Dr Who. I had two main concerns; the BBC's trademark cheap special effects that make some of the older episodes almost comic, and the impossibility of this leather suited northener and ex-Britney Spears wannabee pulling off the Doctor and his companion.The BBC came through spectacularly on both counts. The Special Effects are as good as anything I've seen (and way better than in most US SciFi channel shows). Classic villains like the Dalek's were redone in a way that both moderrnised them and yet preserved the classic elements that made this show great.Most spectacular of all is the performance of Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, which is just brilliant.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	As a kid I was glued to Dr Who in the 1960s and the 1970s. The 1980s saw its slow wind down to eventual cancellation. The 1997 film with Paul McGann proved to be a false dawn but this was not the case with last year's tv series.Christopher Eccleston is simply brilliant in the role of the Doctor , displaying the character's traditional love of the underdog but also possesses an almost scary intensity at times. This intensity replaces the eccentricity of the Doctor's earlier incarnations and we are left with the doctor as an inquisitive but highly charged and volatile individual. This is largely because he is the only survivor of his race, the rest of whom were annihilated in a war with the Daleks. The Doctor reacts with fury as the series goes on when he discovers that the Daleks too have survived, instead of perishing in the war as was previously thought...Billie Piper is great in the role of his travelling companion Rose and her growing relationship with the Doctor is handled well, and keeps the viewer interested.Russell T. Davies who wrote the series is a fan of the old Dr Who and has managed to keep so many of the ingredients of the old series in this one. However, updated SFX and hour long episodes usher the Doctor into 21st century tv.Davies' usual great character realisation works a treat in this, as well as the main characters, all the supporting cast are superb - from Rose's mother to Captain Jack  Harkness as the Doctor and Rose's time travelling ally.I won't list all the episodes but they are consistently good and some are outstanding. The episodes that stand out are all of the Dalek appearances, and an episode where Rose goes back in time to meet the father she never knew.Russell T. Davies has written a series with action, wit and humour but also managed to pack in an emotional wallop.The Daleks nearly did not make it into this series due to legal wrangles with the estate of their creator - Terry Nation. Luckily  these differences were resolved and the Doctor's greatest foes made it into this series, a little updated but otherwise the same Daleks that we all know.The main villains of the next series will be the Cybermen - another classic foe of the Doctor, and advance shots of them look superb.Sadly Christopher Eccleston called it a day after making this series, however, having seen the Christmas special with his successor - David Tennant in the role, it looks as though Series Two will be business as usual. Tennant while retaining some of Eccelston's intensity, also brings to the role the eccentricity of the former Doctors. I am really looking forward to the imminent start of Series Two now.In the meantime, fans of Christopher Eccleston wanting to see more of him, are recommended to check out the dvd of 'Let Him Have It' which in my opinion is the actor's best ever performance.	5.0	Daleks and Cybermen	2006-04-08	17	14	3

I am enjoying both but I have a special affection for series 1. I think Eccleston is excellent and he has an amazing amount of charm. (After watching a few epsodes of series 2 online I wish I knew why he was replaced by Tennant). Billie Piper is wonderful as his assistant.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2HBRINA3F9YHV	Doctor Trance	"Having barely seen an episode or two on PBS in my youth, I really got into the series after seeing the 1997 US TV movie. I quickly snatched up every VHS tape, and found every other missing episode and unreleased story on bootleg videos, to obsessively have every inch of existing Doctor Who known to man. I preferred Jon Pertwee's Doc the best, with Troughton and T. Baker next. No need to get into the original classic series, so on with the new one.Right from the start, I really enjoy Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor. It seems he really did his homework and seems to have found just the right combination of wit and intellect that made so many previous doctors a success. His quick tongue seems to keep up to the fast new pace of the show. While the longer episode, vintage shows had more time for character development and interaction, in today's fast paced world of 32x fast forward speed DVD capability, you can't have 4 to 6 part episodes and expect to keep people's attention to that one storyline. It worked in the 70's, but certainly wouldn't work now.Vintage Doctor Who always had great supporting casts and guest stars, and the new series is no different. Rose's boyfriend and mom keep up nicely to the pace and plotting of the show. Simon Callow gives a great performance as Charles Dickens in the series 3rd episode.Episode 1, Rose, sweeps us back into the whirlwind world of Doctor Who that we all know and love. It seems like it nearly skipped a beat since 1989, with only the surroundings and special effects being updated. It also offers enough info to keep a new viewer interested.  'Rose' is very action packed, much more than most vintage Who stories, and I think it has to be in some way to cater to the thrill-a-minute new millenium that we are all now fully accustomed to.I had seen some sneak preview photos of the Autons before the show aired, and I thought they looked a little awkward and feared they might come across a bit cheesy in live action, however they threw me for a loop after watching Rose, as they looked incredibly lifelike and menacing. Bravo for the special effects wizards who worked on them as they looked brilliant. A superb opening episode to bring us all back into Who!Ep. 2 kept Eccleston's sharp tongue going, and flew us into an alien space station, complete with just about every new concoction of an alien species one can concoct. Actually, the oddest looking species was the human!! A murderous metallic set of spiders is unleashed on a group of interplanetary oglers, wanting to witness the last moments of Earth. The always fashionably-late-in-saving-the-day Doctor has to come to Rose and everyone else's rescue.Ep. 3 takes us to familiar Who territory, a period piece on planet Earth. 1869 to be exact, and Charles Dickens is giving a Christmas Eve performance of A Christmas Carol that gets rudely interrupted by a gas powered, walking corpse. The sets and costumes are superb, and this 19th century Cardiff set story is a real treat.Episodes 4 & 5 are the first two part storyline, which deals with the Slitheen aliens invading Parliament.  It features some hilarious moments when the Slitheen attempt to wear their ""rubber suits"" that impersonate humans.Ep. 6 is what we've all been waiting for:  The Dalek episode.  But alas, it features only one, but that's all it takes for a very strong episode involving an American collector of the future, who happens to have found one remaining Dalek, but doesn't realize how dangerous it really is.  The Doctor, fully aware of Dalek aggression, has to step in and set things straight, with a little help from Rose.Ep. 7, The Long Game, takes us into a satellite space station where people are not returning from certain floors of the station.Ep. 8, one of the strongest and certainly the most emotional of the series, sees Rose wanting the Doctor to allow her to see the father she never knew, however she does something the Doctor would never do, and specifically asks her not to do: interferes with time.Episodes 9 & 10 is another two parter involves the Doctor and Rose in the middle of bomb ridden London circa 1941.  Captain Jack Harkness is introduced and becomes a rival hero character for the Doctor.Ep. 11 involves the return of the Slitheen and their plan to destory Earth.Ep. 12 features a great spoof of reality shows, with the Doctor stuck in the middle.  This episode also features the best cliffhanger of the new show: Rose is kidnapped by the Daleks and the Doctor defiantly proclaims ""I'm gonna blow every last stinkin' one of ya out of the sky"".  Something no previous doctor would have ever said, it's a now classic quote and very characteristic of the new Who era, and the new Doctor.Episode 13, the final battle with the Daleks, is the culmination of startling sci-fi entertainment, and a fine arguement for being the best season in the show's long and storied history.  It extremely disappointing that Eccleston is not returning for Season 2. That is a shame, because his Doctor is extremely well played. Hopefully David Tennant can fill his shoes nicely, and I'm sure the writing will be just as strong as series 1.These are going to be loaded with all the extras found in the UK release.  They initially released bare bones DVD's on Region 2, in 4 volumes, which is how I got them as I had to have each new Who right away, and I can't wait until May 1st, when I will have the first of season 2 in my hands!!  For now, US fans unable to play or get a hold of Region 2 discs, have the Sci-Fi Channel airings and this new set out in July!!"	5.0	The new Doctor Who finally hits America!	2006-03-22	417	382	35

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3K74JJXH3QAFS	DPK	"Before it premiered, the big question about the new series of Dr. Who seemed to be, would Russell T. Davies make it an edgy modern drama or have it return to its traditional family-viewing roots. The answer is that Davies, one of the UK's best script-writers, managed to do both.First thing's first, though, the show is to use the Ninth Doctor's expression, ""Fantastic!"" While I've found something to enjoy in nearly every episode of the ""classic"" series (which I'll define as everything from 1963 through the one-off movie with Paul McGann in 1996), rarely has the balance of action and humor been so expertly handled. What's more, by focusing solidly on the relationships between the characters and the ways in which the Doctor's actions affect them (particularly Rose's loved ones), the 2005 incarnation of Doctor Who has an emotional heft that the older episodes seldom achieved.Some would argue (and not without merit) that some of the humor is a bit broad. Indeed, the spoofs of reality shows and aliens with gastro-intestinal issues were not the most subtle. On the other hand, the repartee between the characters (especially when Captain Jack joins the party) is often excellent. High marks go not only to series regulars Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper but also to Noel Clarke who plays Rose's boyfriend Mickey and Broadway veteran John Barrowman who plays the dashing (and it turns out truly heroic) Captain Jack Harkness.Both of the latter characters exemplify one of the series key themes, namely that the Doctor makes people realize that they're better than they knew. Mickey helps Rose get back to the Doctor even though he knows he may lose her again. Jack puts his life on the line for the Doctor (not to mention the whole human race) even though it means almost certain death. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention Simon Callow's excellent guest spot as Charles Dickens and Nicholas Briggs voice-work in the episode ""Dalek"" which succeeded in turning one of the show's most famous monsters into a fleshed-out character.Obviously, some of the individual episodes stand out. The two-part WW2-era story The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances in particular is a contender for one of the all-time best from the show's 40+ year history (personally I'm baffled by the assertion an earlier viewer made that this story is somehow out of character with the show's past). That said, in many ways the 13-part series is best seen as a single epic storyline, culminating with a battle for the survival of the entire human race.Of course, we know who wins. It is traditional Doctor Who after all, and good always triumphs over evil. At the same time, this is also every bit a modern TV drama, and good doesn't win without a cost. As we see in episode 13 (The Parting of the Ways), the cost is a steep one for many people. The final moments of this episode are sad but also leave you wanting more. Thankfully, the wait won't be nearly as long this time.Addendum (7/7/06): I noticed that someone expressed a view that the price seemed a bit high. To give some context, the SRP for most releases of older Dr. Who episodes has been $25 (less any discounts), and that's for a program that runs about 2 hours. This new release runs 13 hours for $100 (again less any discounts). In short, the amount of material on this new set compares most favorably to the pricing approach established for previous releases."	5.0	Fantastic!	2006-06-22	12	12	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AHJF1J9I4LYVR	Drektath	"I'm not a stranger to the original run of Doctor Who. The original series could be cerebral, charming, and witty. The production values were notoriously bad on the original run, but as George Lucas has proved with his prequel Star Wars trilogy, big budgets aren't everything.Furthermore, I generally hate time travel in stories. In most cases, the use of time travel is a convenient plot device that opens up several cans of worms that makes the plot unbelievable and contradictory. The writers of this Doctor Who are well aware of this problem. They're also aware that the whole franchise is based largely on time travel. Their solution is one that I approve of: namely, indicate to the audience through clever dialogue that they are well aware of how their writing contradicts last week's episode, but ""kindly ignore it *wink wink, nod nod*"". Frankly, it's nice to have the writers admit that sometimes they're trapped, rather than just blatantly insulting the audience's intelligence by pretending that no conflict exists.I would rate this renewal of the franchise as a massive improvement (I've already insulted fans of the Star Wars prequels, why not go for two and invite howling responses from Doctor Who purists?). Sure, some episodes aren't as good as others, but the highlights from the series exhibit witty dialogue, excellent writing, clever plots, and at their best, genuinely engaging emotional entanglement.For Doctor Who fans of old, I'd say that if you're willing to adapt, this could be a truly rewarding experience. For those that have never heard of Doctor Who (but like well-written science fiction), I think it would be worth a shot. For those that hated Doctor Who in its original run, I think it may be worth a fresh look.To me, this is the proper way to refresh a decades old cherished science-fiction mainstay. It is completely unlike the lobotomy that J.J. Abrams performed on the Star Trek series with his reboot of the franchise (there, I've insulted the neo-trekkies as well, that's some kind of trifecta, right?).I may get around to rating series 2-4, in time, but if I don't, this review stands for all of series 1-4. Eccleston is brilliant as The Doctor. While I initially had reservations regarding Tennant as a replacement, I quickly accepted him as equally brilliant, in his own way, as The Doctor.Fans would do well to check out Torchwood as well.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1DX4GG7PSK3MJ	Drew Pepin	I've never had any inclination to start this show but after realizing several friends like it and swear by its entertainment value I decided to dive in. I watched the first two episodes one weekend and liked, for the most part, what I saw, but it took me a little while to jump into the third episode. When I did I began to see more clearly the ways in which Doctor Who is brilliant. I get easily tired of shows, especially ones where mysteries are solved, that do the same thing each and every week. With Doctor Who we get the new locations, new enemies, new stories. I burned through season one in a few days and I'm looking forward to beginning season two.	5.0	A pleasant surprise.	2013-09-16	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3ORWAR4CAOPAC	DRob	It is so good to see Dr. Who again-- and completely new episodes as well. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper make a terrific duo as the lonely doctor has to wrestle with the knowledge that he is the last living Time Lord.The episodes in the first season all intertwine beautifully, with familiar characters popping up throughout. The only complaint I might have-- and it's a small one-- is that I would like to see some episodes that are not so earth-centric. However, that in no way detracts from the fabulosity of the new series!It is good to see that they have retained most of the elements of the classic series-- the new TARDIS does take some getting used to, but by about the fourth episode, it grows on you.It is absolutely smashing! (And I must say, it was quite interesting to see the Doctor actually engage in his first televised kiss!)	5.0	Only Thing Missing is the Jelly Babies	2006-07-16	5	5	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU	"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large"""	"Fans of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer who've been feeling bereft since the show's 2003 cancellation should look no further than the first two seasons of the newly revived British series, Doctor Who.  A BBC flagship series from 1963-1989, the updated show bears little resemblance to the quaint, campy, and often hokey old show that Americans might remember from PBS in the 1970s and 1980s.  Dr. Who has been brought forward into the 21st century, modernized, and given a gleaming makeover.  Yes, the special effects still looks cheap by American standards, but the update is still streets more sophisticated than the original series; the quality of the writing and acting more than make up for its visual shortcomings.The smartest decision the Beeb made was to hand the reins of the revived series to maverick writer/ producer Russell T Davies.  The smartest decisions Davies made were 1) to cast Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the leads, and 2) to base the structure of the show (a la Kim Possible) almost entirely around Joss Whedon's Buffy.  Davies recognizes that Whedon had hit on a winning formula, which he replicates in loving detail.Rose Tyler (Piper) essentially IS Buffy Summers, minus the Slayer powers.  Green-eyed peroxide blonde?  Check.  Former gymnast?  Check.  Raised by single mother?  Check.  Brave, intelligent, and curious?  Check.  Sarcastic tongue and pop culture vocabulary?  Check.  Doofy but well-meaning best friend who grows into a hero in his own right?  Check.  In love with a centuries-old otherworldy being?  Funny you should ask.  Replace high school with space/ time travel and vampires/ demons with aliens, and you have, in essence, described the new Who.With so much focus on Rose, the Doctor himself seems almost of secondary importance, but that's not really so: Davies and his writers use the profoundly ordinary Rose as the viewer's avenue into the Doctor's bizarre world.  Yes, he's still a space-time traveling alien who rackets about the cosmos in a giant ship that looks like a blue phone booth on the outside, but gone are the loud costumes and outlandish behavior viewers may remember from Doctors past.  Eccleston's Doctor is modern and stripped-down, with buzzcut hair, a black leather coat, and a pronounced northern accent.  He's 80% Rupert Giles and 20% Angel: dry, ironic, sexy, hundreds of years old, and staggering under a burden of unimaginable guilt.  He quickly comes to fill the role of both father figure and mentor to Rose, and in a break with old Who tradition, he becomes her love interest as well.Rounding out the cast are Noel Clarke as Rose's on-again, off-again (ex) boyfriend Mickey Smith (95% Xander Harris and 5% Willow Rosenberg), who starts out useless but by the end of the season has proved his guts and integrity several times over.  Jackie Tyler (Camille Codori) is a trashier version of Joyce Summers: loudmouthed, cuttingly funny, always on the lookout for a shag, but fiercely loyal to and protective of her daughter--even though Rose's new lifestyle bewilders her, and she's deeply suspicious of the Doctor.  Later in the season, Rose and the Doctor are joined by Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a 51st century omnisexual conman with a heart of gold.An array of aliens and monsters provide the Doctor's adversaries each week, but the real evils he fights are universal: greed (individual and collective), conformity, apathy, and the mother of all monsters, religious fanaticism.  The stories deftly mix humor, horror, romance, and drama, much as Buffy did at its best.  Viewers get a smorgasbord of ""Who's greatest hits:"" travel to the past, travel to the future, new foes, classic foes, human evil, alien evil, and a spectacular regeneration sequence in the season climax.  If the series had not been renewed beyond its first season, Davies would have at least treated his audience to all the classic elements that made the original series so wonderfully inventive.Of all the stories, the two part ""Empty Child/ Doctor Dances"" stands out as not only the best of the season but the best of the series to date (rivaled only by season two's ""Christmas Invasion"").  A creepy, suspenseful thriller set in WWII London, the story unfolds at just the right pace; the guest cast is outstanding; the atmosphere of war-torn London is marvelously evoked; the resolution is joyous without ever descending into schmaltz.  Other highlights include the pilot episode ""Rose,"" the gripping ""Dalek,"" the powerfully emotional ""Father's Day,"" and the hold-no-punches finale, ""Bad Wolf/ Parting of the Ways.""  Of all thirteen episodes, only ""The Unquiet Dead"" feels a little flat.The series would not have succeeded without the formidable talents of Eccleston and Piper, whose chemistry together is tremendous, coming across as completely new and fresh while still evoking the best classic companion-Doctor partnerships.  Purists might quibble at the romantic attachment, but it's mostly very understated and nicely worked into the narrative structure as a whole, never distracting from the stories themselves.Above all, the new series is infused with a powerful sense of love and hope that serve as a welcome antidote to the sometimes crass cynicism of popular culture.  The emphasis on courage and self-sacrifice is especially good to see.  Parents who are looking for thought-provoking entertainment that has real warmth and decency at its core should definitely add the new Who to the family's DVD collection.In short, Who is a terrific television accomplishment.  A new series of this quality would likely be hailed an immediate success, but Who is even more impressive for having shed the clunky embarrassments of its past.  The marvelous essence of the original has been preserved, nurtured into life by the able talents of its cast and crew.  Skip the TV broadcasts (which are badly mangled for commercial time) and splash out some money on the DVDs.  The extras alone make the purchase well worth the investment.  Come discover what so many viewers around the world have already learned: that Who is one of the best things on television.And fans of Buffy may at last discover the program that fills the void in their hearts."	5.0	The New Buffy	2006-12-20	12	7	5

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1I2ZRRN2XVVCD	"E. Blake ""poodlebone"""	I knew about the original Doctor Who series and had seen some episodes, all snowy and full of static, on some PBS or UHF station that I was able to pull in with a rabbit ears antenna in the early 80s.  By the time this latest version came around I no longer had cable.  I finally decided to order the first season on DVD and loved it.  I've read a lot of negative reviews of Christopher Eccleston's version of the Doctor but I loved him.  The episode The Empty Child really creeped me out, but in a good way.  When I joined Amazon Prime and was able to watch more seasons of the show it took awhile for me to adjust to David Tennant but after a few episodes I really liked him as well.  I'm still catching up on Amazon Prime and while I'm enjoying Matt Smith as the Doctor, I still much prefer Christopher Eccleston or David Tennant.	5.0	great reboot	2013-04-24	0	0	0

Now, I am going to stop blabbering,Quality:The acting, though slightly unnatural at times, is actually suprisingly good for a TV show. Also, TV shows usually are low budget and seem to be poor on the effects, and costumes, and such, but this show hasn't really dissapointed me. Anohter note, I just started to watch the show, and I got so addicted, I watched the full season in three days!For me, the worst thing was the change of actors... or was it? I was soooooooooo dissappointed when I found out that there would be different actors, but let me tell you... I just watched the first episode of the second season, and let me tell you, it's GREAT! It has a slightly different feel, but I think that they improved on it...Humor:Just a quick note, if you are still doubting whether or not to buy the epsiodes... (GET PRIME, AND WATCH THEM ALL FOR FREE) but still, this is a must see.Plot:Sometimes, the plot is a little simplistic, but there are other times were the plot gets nice and twisty... Its not really a thought provoking plot, but its very interestingLast notes:AS I said, it is a must-see. A friend recommended it to me, and I hate him because I am officially addicted to the show. Also, I really wish I could vote a half star, because the first season should be 4 and a half, but only four stars doesn't do it justice...

If you have found that you truely love the doctor, then you will want to know all the back story you can. David Tennant was my first Doctor, but I have found that it's The Doctor I Love, and I want to know all I can about him. These are great to watch. I am completely mesmerized with how I can go and watch older shows and find out sooo much more than I thought would even be there. Example: Bad Wolf, when I started with David Tennant I thought Bad Wolf was one thing, then all through watching the first season I was guessing...this is Bad Wolf, no this is. Then WA-Bam.... No freakin' way that's Bad Wolf. So, well made and I watch them over and over. When I say 'Well Made' I'm saying for the time they were made. The pixels are off for our newer TV. For me it doesn't matter, I still watch B&W shows. Love that I can watch on PRIME, and am collecting the DVD's just in case, for the future.	5.0	I LOVE THE DOCTOR!!!	2013-04-24	0	0	0

My wife, who has never seen Doctor Who, is totally hooked on the show now. The Characters are great, the stories are engaging, and the acting is genuine. Christopher Eccleston has done a wonderful job, bringing more seriousness to the part while maintaining the whimsy and joy of life that all of the previous doctors had. The true stars of this show though, are the writers and production teams. The quality of the shows are extraordinary, especially if you're like me and remember the old Troughton through Davison episodes. I could go on all day, but I'll reign myself in. :)  The best episode in my opinion is ""Dalek"", really good, emotional (!) stuff.  There's something here for everyone if you're into Doctor Who, or Sci-fi in general. Enjoy!"	5.0	Oustanding update of a BBC classic.	2006-11-03	1	1	0

They never did.  And it is almost painful to watch the male lead. (I know he is a fine actor but it's clear that he could never connect with this character.)I recommend buying this season, however, just to get the characters and back stories straight so you can better understand some of the plot elements in the FABULOUS season 2-5.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AG8E2F0G98ZTB	Fritosgirl	I admit, this was my first real introduction to a complete season of Doctor Who.  I'd seen some of the past Doctors, but never their 'complete run' as the Doctor.  I didn't know what to expect when I popped it in the DVD player, but, boy, am I sure glad I did!This 13 episode season had me hooked from beginning to end.  It had me thinking about it when I wasn't watching it and wishing that I had the time to sit and watch the entire series all the way through.  Christopher Eccleston is amazing as the Ninth Doctor.  His portrayal is different than I'd ever seen of the past doctors I watched.  He brings a darker edge to the stories and the Doctors mysterious past.  His chemistry with Billie Piper is great.  They work together so well.  I never heard of her before this and since seeing the rest of the companions in the full series, must say that she is my favorite of them (the companions).I recommend this series to anyone who has the slightest urge to pick it up.  It has time travel, space aliens, heart wrenching moments, laugh out loud moments, some romantic bits, and heart.  Give it a chance and, like me, I suspect it will have you hooked.	5.0	Great start to a stellar series!	2009-01-28	1	1	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3LQDYVAAHHV2T	FYI	"""I can feel the turn of the earth ... the skin of this tiny little world,"" declares the 9th Doctor Who.""The Doctor is a legend woven into history. When disaster comes, he is there. He brings a storm in his wake."" Many would love a ride in Doctor Who's TARDIS, a time-machine ans spacecraft = Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Russell T. Davies overwhelmingly succeeds in rebooting Doctor Who after a 16 year hiatus. This is a wild romp, brilliant; the normal and mundane are mixed together with elements of absolute bizarreness. Christopher Eccleston (Thor: The Dark World) adds his Geordie 'tude as the 9th incarnation of the Doctor. When asked by his soon to be new companion, Rose Tyler (the great Billie Piper) about his distinctive accent, he replies, ""Lots of planets have a North."" We savor northern English culture and history, and series like Manchester'sThe Street, and genre-defyingLife On Mars, U.K.starring Doctor Who alumni John SimmDoctor Who Specials: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, The End of Time Parts 1 & 2.In ""Rose,"" the first wonderful episode, which harkens back to Pertwee's 3rd Doctor and his entrance in ""Spearhead from Space,"" we meet Rose, going about her ordinary day. As the Doctor says, ""You lot, all you do is eat chips, watch telly, go to bed."" Well, Rose's world is about to be rocked. Her mother, Jackie Tyler (the adorable, delightful Camille Coduri,Rumpole of the Bailey), resists the Doctor and his impact on Rose's life.Hang in there past an episode that would have been super but for annoying gaseous aliens (why?) and get to 'The Unquiet Dead,"" where you'll be whisked to Cardiff, Wales, in 1869, with ""Torchwood"" star Eve Myles as a young physic working in a haunted funeral home. A Shakespeare-quoting Dickens (Simon Callow) enters the picture, ""There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, even for you, Doctor. Shawn Dingwall is marvelous as Rose's wayward father Pete Tyler in the poignant ""Father's Day,"" where Rose travels back to her distant past, with 'No Third Term for Thatcher' posters pasting walls; as the Doctor says, ""The past is another country."" The spooky two-part ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" features remarkable acting by Florence Heath as Nancy, helping a group of street kids survive in London during WWII, and introduces Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a former Time Agent. ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"" are superb social commentary - with the Anne Droid (Anne Robinson) in a brutal form of 'The Weakest Link,' Jack facing two scary female robots (Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine) on 'What Not to Wear,' a sweet contestant Lynda (Jo Joyner) on 'Big Brother' assisting the Doctor, and a new incarnation of an old, relentless foe. The Doctor sends Rose back home in the TARDIS to her mother and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), but she can't abide being forced back into normalcy while the Doctor is facing a huge battle. At the end, the Doctor must regenerate into a new, wonderful creation/incarnation, the inimitable David TennantBroadchurch,Spies of Warsaw) as the 10th Doctor Who inDoctor Who: The Complete Second Series. The narrative gets even better from here on out... Enjoy!"	5.0	Adventures of an Eccentric	2013-11-19	1	1	0

Pabulum.As has always been the case with this ridiculous series, the appeal of Dr. Who to the viewing public baffles me.  Never has this been more true than viewing this sub par re-imagination of an already below par television show.The equally ridiculous price of this DVD boxed aside, there's very little you could honestly term ""genuine entertainment"".  Unless constant jokes about flatulence is your thing, mind you.The new Dr. Who is annoying and has an extremely bad crew-cut.  Forget flamboyant costumes, this guy wears normal clothes.  If I remember correctly all the other Dr. Whos wore flamboyant costumes.  Those are gone.  So are alien planets apparently.  He calls his ship a spaceship, but it never goes to an alien planet in any of these DVDs.Then there's his spoiled and whiny assistant who looks like she'd rather be anywhere than filming this series.  She also brings along an equally whiny boyfriend and a grating mother along for the ride.As for Dr. Who's aliens, please.  You'd think that in 2006 they could at least do something about the quality of the creatures.  The first episode has ridiculous rubber mannequins, the second has a plethora of bad rubber creatures:  (i.e. a giant rubber head, a miniature little blue rubber one, a flat rubber one.), they must've run out of rubber by the third episode as it had zombies.  What are zombies doing in a Sci-Fi series anyway?  The most idiotic alien had to be the (again) rubber monsters with gas trouble.  The British fascination with bodily functions may be humorous in the UK, but  to the rest of the world it's childish and not very good television.Look, this show clearly has its fans, but someone needs to be honest to anyone out there who isn't and thinking of buying this overpriced DVD boxed set.If you fall into that latter category AVOID this ghastly re-imagination.

What a great actor and the chemistry between the Doctor and Rose (Billie Piper) was incredible. I really thought I would like David Tennant's or Matt Smith's Who better but I was wrong. Eccleston just nailed it. Great writing and great stories. The episode called Father's Day really got to me and had me crying my eyes out. For anyone who has suddenly lost a loved one under tragic circumstances, have the tissues ready for that episode.	5.0	Hooked on Doctor Who	2013-09-06	0	0	0

Secondly,  the writing, directing and all the other aspects of generating each episode are clearly done by skilled people who care.  Thirdly, Captain Jack is introduced and explained.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3DXVAI08P00HD	Greg	I used to be strangely fascinated with Dr Who in my younger days.  His explorations of weird planets and his encounters with bizarre creatures and enemies, from the daleks and cybermen to hostile algae and pool machines, were strangely captivating (despite the tacky special effects).  Still, the series deserved its place as a classic.For a while, Dr Who went quiet.  There was one telemovie but no series.  The BBC handed the task to Russel T. Davies, the writer who created the telemovie 'The Second Coming.'  Christopher Eccleston was chosen for the role of the doctor, while Billie Piper (a very pretty pop singer with a strong accent) was chosen to be his companion.The new series was made in 2005 and shown in several countries.  We are reintroduced to some old enemies (the daleks) and also some new ones.  We also learn some new things about what happens to humanity in the future, and also some things about our past.Overall the new series is much more faster paced than the classical series have been.  The first reason appears to be that instead of five episode stories which slowly lead up to their conclusion, a story is usually self contained in a single episode.  The new series tends to have far more action and less 'cerebral' meditation on arcane science fiction ideas, perhaps because Davies wanted to appeal to a younger audience with a shorter attention span.The weakness of the new series is that some of the stories seem to lead nowhere, are executed too quickly, and at times the emotional interaction between Rose (Billie Piper) and those around her gets too sentimental at times.  Still, I have generally enjoyed the format of the new series, as well as the ideas and the reappearance of old enemies.	4.0	Good reboot of classic series	2006-11-16	6	2	4
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A5VB41A8KJNVO	Greg McElhatton	"After being off the air as a regular series for 16 years, it's understandable that the public was more than a bit skeptical about the return of Doctor Who. Known primarily as ""that show with the really low budget"" and set to be relaunched in a time when the Star Trek franchise had come to a crashing halt, was this really a good move?As it turned out, the advertising slogan was correct: ""He's back, and it's about time.""Helmed by writer/executive producer Russell T. Davies (Queer as Folk, Bob and Rose, The Second Coming), the new Doctor Who was in many ways how fans of the original had always pictured a modern day incarnation of the program; slick, edgy, sharp, and fun. Assembling a group of writers who'd worked on other hit British shows (Coupling, The League of Gentlemen, Casualty), Davies and company wrote 13 stories that really proved that Doctor Who could and would still be topical in this day and age.Even the worries of a bit of stunt casting in the form of former British pop star Billie Piper as the companion Rose to Christopher Eccleston's Doctor proved to be all for naught; not only are both leads excellent actors, but they have such an instant chemistry that it's easy and understandable to see why the two continue to travel together.This first season has something for everyone. For long-time viewers there are classic foes from the past, but new viewers won't feel left out, as any bits from the past are presented in a way to make everyone welcome and on the same page. With high points with episodes like Dalek, Father's Day, and The Empty Child, you'll want to watch one episode after another in rapid succession.There are thankfully few weak points; one two-parter that could've stood to be compressed down to one (Aliens of London, World War III), and a slightly rushed ending to the season finale that feels like it comes down to a behind-the-scenes changing of the guard at the end of the season. They're minor quibbles, though, and quickly forgiveable when compared to the high quality otherwise on display.The packaging of this DVD set leaves a bit to be desired (the overlapping discs in particular seem like they're just begging for scratches), and it would've been nice if deleted scenes had prepared in time for inclusion here, but with numerous documentaries and commentaries there's enough to keep even people who've already seen the episodes entertained.Once you've watched this new series of Doctor Who, just be warned--there's no turning back. You'll be hooked, and absolutely loving it."	5.0	"In the words of the Doctor, ""Fan-TAST-ic!"""	2006-04-25	30	28	2

Davies and Christopher Eccleston was announced. Russell was best known as the creator of ""Queer as Folk"" and Christopher was, at least to me, the nasty Duke of Norfolk in 'Elizabeth' starring Cate Blanchett.Now, let me mix in that I am HUGE fan of the Early Doctor Who (read as 16mm telecine and monochromatic and you get the idea). I really enjoy the years from Patrick Troughton to Tom Baker. I like Peter Davidson too.I am a ""fan"" of the 'classic' Doctor Who. I am not a *fanatic* (I don't have a 27-foot long scarf, my mom would never knit one anyway :) )Now you have a picture of a HUGE fan of Doctor Who. Still am!Let's turn forward to 2005 and the new series.I was ROCKED when I watched the first episode. Yes, gone are all the hokey effects, the ""clamps and bits of wire"" and the sometimes entirely passable acting and rubber suits.Christopher Eccelston brings the Doctor to the new series and he is absolutely FANTASTIC (yes, one of his favorite sayings!). Billie Piper ROCKS as Rose. She is one of the best companion characters I have seen.And Russell... well, what can I say. He gets my vote as almost on level with Sydney Newman (he created Doctor Who, in case you didn't know) with just about a genius in regard to the way he resurrected a series, gave it a new flair and set it on the road to success. I will never question him for what he has done to bring back my all-time favorite series.OK... now a few notes about the new series.'Rose' is a great opening episode.I found 'The Unquiet Dead' to be quite a good episode and had a nice 'Who' touch to it.'Father's Day' is good with a nice performance by Billie Piper. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose's mum is not to be missed.'Dalek' let me down a little at the end, but it was a great start, had an almost Stargate quality about it.'Bad Wolf' has a great introduction to it. ""You are now live on Channel 44,000. Please do not swear."" ""Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.""The Slitheen episodes ""Aliens of London"" and ""World War Three"" are great. Good writing on what happens when you pop off for a jaunt in the TARDIS and leave loved ones behind. And then you find the time machine has whoops a 18 hour abscence into 12 months...This is a great television series again and I really enjoy it. I have raved about it to anyone who cared to listen.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1OJP82FZESMKD	Hank F	This season amazingly reintroduced many concepts from the classic series (the Doctor, the TARDIS, UNIT (sort of), Daleks, and Regeneration). Despite being only the Doctor for one season, Christopher Eccleston left an impact as the Doctor who brought the show back from a 16 year (9 year if you count the TV movie). Although Rose had a few good moments (and one good episode), she unfortunately came across as selfish, and is on my opinion one of the weaker companions of the show. Don't get me wrong, Billie Piper is a good actress, but the writers loved her TOO MUCH! Here are my thoughts on all 13 episodes (SPOILERS!):Rose: Great start, especially on bringing back the Autons!End of the World: Good futuristic look at the Earth's End (just get the fast forward button when &#34;Toxic&#34; plays)The Unquiet Dead: Creepy, yet fun romp with Charles Dickens!Aliens of London/World War Three: Flawed, but entertaining invasion story.Dalek: Successful re-introduction of the Doctor's most iconic enemy.The Long Game: The weakest episode of the season, but is saved by Simon Pegg's dark sense of humor.Father's Day: Rose's finest hour.The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: Hands down, the scariest, yet the best story of the whole season!Boom Town: Interesting ideas, but rushed plot.Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways: Fantastic finale and has one of the best send-offs from any Doctor (better than End of Time, but can't top Caves of Androzani).	5.0	Fantastic!	2013-07-04	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AUUH6Z8MSGGF	Haunted Flower	"""Doctor Who"" the complete First Series was my first exposure to Doctor Who. Some of the episodes in this series are utterly ridiculous and silly, but the majority overall are fascinating, well written, have scary moments, funny moments, and have an emotional pull, particularly at the end of the season. The premise of ""Doctor Who"" is that there is a character called ""The Doctor"" (played by Christopher Eccleston) who is the last alien of his species and travels through space and time in a Tardis spaceship that looks like a phone booth. His Tardis is often drawn to places where important events are taking place where the Doctor can have a hand in helping solve a problem or save the world. He meets Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) in the first episode and invites her to go along with him on his adventures and unable to pass down such an opportunity, she joins him as a sidekick and over time becomes more of an equal.Examples of the adventures the Doctor and Rose face together include mannequins that come to life, trying to change an event in Rose's past, meeting Charles Dickens to investigate walking dead, getting stuck in reality TV, encountering the ultimate killing machines known as Daleks, and saving the world numerous times. The most ridiculous story is two episodes consisting of farting aliens that wear man suits and try to take over the world by assuming identities of high up political figures in Parliament. The most frightening story is the two episodes ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" where a wandering child with a gas mask keeps asking for his mommy and anyone he touches turns into a zombie wearing a gas mask just like him during a war. Positively eerie! Scary kids give me the creeps! The most emotional episodes are ""Father's Day"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"" where difficult choices have to be made and some characters meet their end.Bonus Features:The bonus features are about five hours spread out across five discs (not including the 13 episodes' worth of commentary) so if you wait till the end of the series as I did to watch them, you'll have to put them all in again. Three of the discs alone have trailers for the series, certain episodes, and even the storyboard for a trailer. There is an interview with Christopher Eccleston at BBC Breakfast that clearly takes place before the series has premiered because he talks about the differences between this new first series and the older series making the girl a better written character and focusing on the intelligence and psychology of the Doctor and refuses to answer if he regenerates at the end of the series and finds some of the early bad reviews painful to listen to.There are commentaries on EVERY episode that have producers, visual effects people, writers (Russell T. Davies, Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, Steven Moffat), and supporting actors (actor for Charles Dickens, voice of Dalek, Captain Jack, etc.). They never have Christopher Eccleston who plays Doctor Who and don't have Billie Piper who plays Rose until the last episode on commentary (which was also my favorite episode to listen to on commentary).There is a behind the scenes making of feature with Russell T. Davies that shows read-throughs, behind-the-scenes video of shooting, rewrites, and interviews with select cast and crew members. They show the effects behind the destruction of the lair in the pilot episode, Mark Gatiss has a video diary for his first episode about waking the dead for writing for ""Doctor Who"" admitting the amount of pressure he felt taking on such a big project and problem-solving plot elements out loud, and the origin of the idea for the unquiet dead from Mark Gatiss.On the second disc, the Big Ben destruction scene is deconstructed and an error is even admitted. Billie Piper goes around the set with her own camera showing the inside of the Dalek, pick up shots from Episode 4, and scenes from several other episodes. On the third disc, you can see the models of the large balloons used in ""The Empty Child"" and the challenges of making it visually fit together with footage of Rose hanging from one. On the fourth disc, ""Designing Doctor Who"" takes us through the set design of the Tardis, Satellite 5, Captain Jack's ship, and several other pivotal locations on the series. ""The Adventures of Captain Jack"" lets John Barrowman talk about his character's background and the purpose of this really handsome guy that showed up in Episode 9 being out for himself and stayed through the end of the series where he makes a stand. He also wishes Captain Jack had his own TV show (and so do I!).The fifth disc has the bonus feature documentary, ""Doctor Who Confidential"" narrated by Simon Pegg who also had a large role in ""The Long Game"" about Satellite 5 controlling all of the Earth's television programming and news. Christopher Eccleston is the ninth Doctor in all of television history, the first in the new series. It is broken up by credits for each sequence which is a little distracting, but it's a great source of background information for fans especially since it's nearly three hours long when you add in the behind-the-scenes extra about the Christmas episode for the second series."	3.0	Dr. Who - Reviewed by Haunted Flower	2011-03-30	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AX8Q4XFVXGXIN	hellodownthere	I started with season five which is the 11th doctor, Matt Smith and I fell in love with the show. i didn't like the ninth doctor at first. Then I watched it again and suddenly started to like him and Rose and Jack and everything about them. The 9th doctor grew on me and I ended up loving this season as well. If you are having a hard time watching this, my suggestion is to give it a couple episodes because he grows on you and it's fun to have the back story on his companions for when you watch the 10th doctor in seasons 2-4.	5.0	Doctor Who is amazing.	2013-04-06	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AAKEZ1D6ZDZEY	...	Doctor Who is a fabulous series.  It is truly charming, perhaps a wee bit campy...but that is part of its appeal.  It is written as a family show, meant to entertain children and adults alike.  It is about a time travelling alien (Eccleston) and his exploits as he rambles through universe with his friends...how he uses wit and intelligence instead of brute force and violence to overcome the evil plots he stumbles across during his travels.  It is definitely worth a watch, and if you are having a hard time getting into the story...give it through The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, a two part.	5.0	LOVE IT!	2013-11-21	1	1	0

He has done for the ""Doctor Who"" franchise what Rick Berman (and assoc) did for ""Star Trek"" - he has brought it back bigger and better than ever.  Obviously the special effects are better than the original (which were pretty meager - to be polite) - but who would have expected them to be motion picture quality? (Yes - they are THAT good).  But all would be for naught without great writing, directing and acting - and the new Doctor Who has all and more.I love all the episodes set in the past.  Mark Gatiss wrote ""The Unquiet Dead"" which features Simon Callow as Charles Dickens; ""The Empy Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" (in which we meet Captain Jack) had me in tears; as did ""Father's Day.""  ""Boom Town"" features negelected actress Annette Badland in a performance that should have won her an Emmy/BAFTA).  The entire series is one high note after another.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3P603GVJIGKAN	Jacquelyn Bailey	My only quibble with this excellent series is Christopher Eccleston's wardrobe.  It's too stylish and tasteful.  All the previous Doctors have had a quirky (not to say loud and garish) mode of dress, and each had a signature accessory.  Tom Baker's scarf, for example, or Peter Davison's stalk of celery worn as a boutonniere.  Now here comes Christopher Eccleston, slim and elegant in basic black.  Where's the fun in that?That said, I thought Christopher Eccleston's doctor was wonderful--his manic persona overlaid a very real sense of haunted tragedy.  Rose was a feisty heroine who could more than hold her own.  She saved the Doctor at least as often as he saved her!  I'm only sorry that Eccleston left after only one season.  DOCTOR WHO is only improved by having an actor of his caliber playing the lead.	5.0	When did the Doctor get a sense of style?	2006-08-04	2	1	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AY0GCKR70J9F5	Jadi	As an American, watching BBC productions takes a bit of adaptation on my part. I'm so used to perfect Hollywood actors, that it requires a mind re-set to watch real people on television. I love it! Gaps between teeth, freckles, big ears, big noses, a bit of pudge...it's all good! As a sci-fi fan, this show also requires a mind re-set. On the one hand, it's cheesy and silly; on the other hand, the deeper themes make it worthwhile. Some of the special effects are just plain bad; others are amazingly good. I watched the first episode and was lukewarm about it. I waited a couple of weeks before watching the second...then a few days before watching the third...and now I'm hooked. Sometimes it's SO silly that it makes me laugh out loud. No spoiler alert...but the last episode of the season does strain your brain a bit. I had to quickly watch the first episode of the second season just to be sure I was understanding what was going on. I suspect I'll work my way through as many episodes as possible.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2J5OU8UDHN6CP	"J. A. Schulenburg ""India Joy"""	Eccleston doesn't have the same chemistry with Piper that David Tennant has in Season 2, but the duo work well together as partners in adventure with Eccleston's Doctor acting more as mentor to the very young and wide-eyed Rose Tyler. Their voyage to the far future to watch the Earth die in a fiery finish is one of the most memorable episodes of Dr. Who to come along and nicely introduces both Rose and the audience to the Doctor's newest series rivival. Some of the monsters are cheesy, but, let's face it, they are writing for an audience combined mostly of 12 year old boys combined with all those older folks like me who grew up on the original BBC Dr. Who with tin foil costumes!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AEY2XD6039MR6	"J. Barnes ""feisty lady"""	My husband and I have already watched ALL of these and were definitely looking forward to the American release. We love the extras, that's one reason we buy DVD's. However, I don't understand why it list's David Tennant as the star, when Christoper Eccleston clearly is the Doctor for the entire series one, umm he's even on the box. Tennant only has a few lines in this one. If you are wanting to see more Tennant, you will have to wait for season two. We bought this the second day it was out, and our 3 year old can not get enough, we have watched at least one episode a day. We only wish it had been released with the rest of civilization...why we in the good 'ol USA is a year behind we don't quite understand.Okay, here's the review, it is much different at least to me than the previous Doctor Who series, which we own some episodes on VHS, and some I would rather not watch, but my husband grew up watching the Doctor and is a huge fan. I will never forget my first Doctor! I am now a huge fan, and love the new series and can not wait for more. The extras are great!When this series first came out, I would not sit and watch with him, now we pre-screen the episodes, and  will sit and watch with our 3 year old son as a family. Our son acts out the scenes - sometimes he is the Doctor, sometimes he is the bad guy, and he always seems to have a make shift sonic screw driver in hand. This DVD is great for all of you older Doctor Who fans, but is also fantastic for a new generation - young and old. I can just see all those  kids who will be gripped and peering from behind the couch.Here's to more! And it's about time!	5.0	Finally it's here!!! FANTASTIC!	2006-07-09	0	0	0

The story is haunting, the masked characters just scary enough, and the line, ""Are you my mummy?"" has become a family inside joke. We thought Christopher Eccleston was the best Doctor until David Tennant. By the time he left the show we couldn't imagine any one taking his place but Matt Smith brings his own brand of eccentricity and talent to the role. What can I say?

Its rare that you can find a sci-fi show that doesn't take its premise or itself so seriously yet still have interesting plots and characters (kinda like Star Trek or the original 3 Star Wars).

The &#34;special effects&#34;, especially for the first few episodes are abysmal!  But the writing and acting gradually improve and by the time that Moffat starts writing (the writer for the amazing Sherlock series) the acting, dialogue, special effects and general story-line are vastly improved and you find yourself really drawn to the show - wanting to know what happens next.  Even at the beginning, though, despite the cheese it's still original enough and interesting that you want to keep watching.	3.0	Cheesy but it draws you in...	2013-09-20	2	2	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AK4UD9J5QCMRH	Jeff Hodges	"I knew it was trouble when I did it.  As a middle schooler who watched Jon Pertwee and Peter Davidson on PBS and read many Dr. Who novelizations, when I Netflixed ""The Five Doctors"" about a month a half ago, I knew I would be completely indulging in my inner prepubescent geek.  While my subsequent trip through the available Dr.Who DVD catalog is best chronicled elsewhere, I am very happy to say that I broke my original pact with myself to hold off on this volume until I caught myself up.Inspired in part by a phenomenon the BBC apparently came to call American Quality TeleVision (Star Trek, Buffy, X-Files, etc..), Dr. Who has been successfully revitalized after over a decade of relative inactivity.  This is in no small part due to David Eccleson's Doctor.  He is absolutely brilliant, and I genuinely wish that he would have stayed on longer.  Eccleson is as simultaneously charismatic, eccentric, and cranky as the best of the Doctor's previous incarnations.  He also has no small bit of chemistry with his solitary ""companion,"" Piper Laurie.  Given time, he might have unseated Tom Baker as the ""most popular"" Doctor.The problem that Dr. Who ran up against in its original run was that it was weighed down by its own history.  Serious fans of the sixth or seventh Doctor most assuredly knew and took into account the comings and goings of the second and fourth.  This ""reboot"" of the series does not require that its viewers have an encyclopedic knowledge of Dr. Who's convoluted history.  However, it references the history in a way that the fan can appreciate without talking down to the newcomer.The Lowdown: This is a show made by Dr. Who fans for Dr. Who fans. If you were not already one, you will be after watching this season.  Then watch more - as of this writing, you will not be disappointed.  Tenant's Doctor easily matches Eccleson's, but has the privilege of long-term character development."	4.0	The Time Lords Strike Back	2007-12-14	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1G0I4WLTA5PYA	Jennifer Myers	I'd heard of Dr. Who, but didn't really know anything about it, so when I found it available through Amazon Prime, I thought I'd take a look. I would not recommend it to my friends, but maybe to my college-age sons.If you like science fiction, then this is up your alley. If you want your drama to be in any way believable, don't bother. Dr. Who, who looks human but is an alien, with a British accent no less, meets Rose in the first episode and takes her on some amazing adventures through time and space using his Police Call Box, even though there is no romantic attraction. He's 900 years older than her, for one thing. Some episodes go back in time, like the one where they meet Charles Dickens. Others go forward, to the end of the earth. The viewer likes Rose and Dr. Who, and perhaps the future Prime Minister when she shows up, but every other contributing character so far, including Rose's boyfriend and her mother, are annoying and not very likeable.	3.0	Curiosity got me to watch it. . .	2014-01-18	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2DDBYKXF1N0D5	Jero Briggs	"The new series starts off so well. Christopher Eccelston makes a brilliant Doctor. He reminds me a lot of Jon Pertwee's, Tom Baker's, and Paul McGann's Doctors while making his Doctor a completely new charater himself. The episodes are brilliant. ""Rose"" makes a great premiere episode - bringing in both old and new fans to the show. The only let down to that episode is that it is a copy-cat of ""Spearhead from Space"", but still it's hard not to like it. After all, who can say that ""Spearhead"" wasn't that good? It was brilliant! The worst episode was ""Boom Town"", and it's even hard not to like that one. The best episodes were ""Rose"", ""Aliens of London"", ""World War Three"", ""Dalek"", ""The Empty Child"", and ""The Doctor Dances"". In all, there is not one bad episode, and I highly recommend this season!"	5.0	He's Back!	2009-03-30	0	0	0

The first few episodes give clues, hints & teasers that are not fulfilled until much later in the series or even seasons.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AOM2MCID201WO	Jesse	Never watched Doctor Who until recently, and have finished the 1st and 2nd season so far.  I can definitely say that this show is one of my all time favorites already, and can't wait to catch up to the current season.  Unfortunately, Christopher Eccleston (The Doctor from this season) only stays for these 13 episodes... He is awesome, and he seems a lot less of a goof ball that David Tennant.  His reaction to powerful enemies shows a true sense of fear, and we can almost believe for a second that the doctor might actually lose.  Tennant on the other hand seems to lack the ability to display any fear, making the show more of a sci-fi comedy rather than sci-fi drama.  I know I've only seen 2 seasons but these are just my initial thoughts.Anyways, enjoy a great show.	5.0	Like him better than David Tennant	2013-02-27	0	0	0

I will say this: the 'Dr Who: Confidential' episodes that ran after each episode in the UK are really quite good. They give a great sense of the huge task of bringing Dr. Who back to modern television. I'm rather dissappointed to hear that these great shows have been cut down to less than half their length so that they can be shoved onto the last disc in this set. That is really a shame. I think anyone who enjoys the show would weant to see these documentaries in their entirety. At this rather steep price, I'm suprised that the Box set cuts this material down.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A37UPPF989N4EB	"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer"""	Just as it was inevitable that Doctor Who was finally scrapped in 1989, after a long and agonizing death spanning almost a decade, it was equally so that one day it would be revived. The format was just too flexible, exciting and productive for any TV executive to ignore for ever and finally in 2005, after one abortive attempt to get the series back on track in 1996, the Time Lord returned to BBC TV with a bang. And what a bang! Under the guidance of Russell T. Davies, one of British TV's leading creative forces, the famous show has undergone a transformation and revitalization that has made into the most successful drama of the past year.One of the problems facing any production team charged with reinventing Doctor Who was its long and distinguished history. Tampering with such an iconic format too much would be in danger of subverting the brand, but producing it in the same style and limitations of its earlier incarnations would have been a recipe of disaster. Davies and his team and have surpassed all expectations and relaunched the show for a whole new generation, while successfully maintaining all of the elements that make Doctor Who, Doctor Who! The Daleks are back, but are now more convincing and mennacing than ever before. The alien mystery of the Doctor is explored and the companion is seen to have a life outside of the TARDIS walls that gives the show an edge of reality it always lacked before.The first season of 13 forty-five minute episodes is now available on DVD, with a welter of extras and goodies spanning five discs in an impressive TARDIS designed box set. There is a commentary for every episode from numerous members of the production team and at least one member of the cast from each story. Alas, The Doctor himself, Christopher Eccleston does not appear, but you will find his assistant Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) popping up, as well as the two part-time companions Adam and Jack (played by Bruno Langley and John Barrowman) making contributions. Eccleston's dominant portrayal of the 900 years old Time Lord was pivotal to the successful revival of the show and it's such a shame that he severed his ties with the program so abruptly and quickly. Although it has to be said that his replacement, David Tennant is also wonderful in the role.  There are 12 accompanying behind-the-scenes mini-documentaries for each episode, although sadly, these are only 50% of what was broadcast on the BBC at the time of the episode's first airing. All of the material relating to the classic series that was included has been dropped from the DVD. There are wonderful behind the scenes looks at the amazing special effects, graphics, design etc., and some interviews with the cast and crew.Fans of the classic series have nothing to fear in this new version. It's different Doctor Who for sure, but it's a new vision of the format that works wonderfully. If only we could pretend that the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann never happened, or indeed we could wipe out the dying years of the original series with Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy. This is Doctor Who back at its very best and this set will keep you riveted for hours of entertainment.	5.0	Back for good!	2006-08-23	4	3	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ATQZQR4H8BEN6	"J. M. Cornwell ""Reviewer at Large"""	The return of Doctor Who to television was well worth the wait. Christopher Eccles as the ninth incarnation of The Doctor is a refreshing change from the posh and sometimes haughty language of previous doctors. Eccles's Doctor is more down-to-earth in language and approach to the character, making him eminently more approachable.By carving out his own niche and making the character his own, Eccles manages to not only take the show in more fun and interesting directions, but his incarnation does not detract from the actors who previously played the role. Although there are faint echoes of Tom Baker's zany and often mischievous persona, they echoes are very faint indeed. Casting aside the posh accent and adding an element of competence bordering at times on mania, Eccles brings new life into an old favorite and ushers in a new era of intelligent and inventive writing that retains the best (and sometimes hokiest) of the old era.Bravo! And welcome back.	5.0	A new look and a whole new direction	2007-05-06	3	3	0

Doctor 9 is great as well, very alien as well as human.  This season has lots of connective tissue to the old Doctor Who series and the two new Doctors to come.  It also has one of the best stories of all of Doctor Who. &#34;The Empty Child&#34; is the first of a two-part story, which concludes with &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;  these two episode form one of the best of the Doctor Who stories over the past 50 years.	4.0	A good start on  new take on The Doctor.	2013-08-11	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A8HQ2SO23HETR	John Barelli	"Every time a new Doctor took over the role, some of the Doctor Who fans complained that the new one wasn't a ""real Doctor Who"".  Generally, they were wrong.  This new one is no exception.Christopher Eccleston brings considerable talent to the role, and his portrayal is odd and quirky, always a bit distracted, but not exactly like any of the other Doctors, which means that he really has managed to catch the essence of the Doctor.The Doctor always has at least one companion, generally a pretty female, and this Doctor is no exception.  Billie Piper plays Rose Tyler, who comes off as a bit of an airhead at first, but quickly shows herself to be someone that comes through in a pinch.  Of course, like all of the Doctor's companions, she also shows that she cannot follow simple instructions, but that has been true of every companion since Susan and Barbara.The sets and costumes are somewhat better, but still a bit cheesy.  Again, like the earlier versions.In essence, the people making the new series have an obvious respect and love of the earlier series.  No, it isn't exactly like the earlier shows.  If it were just a copy, then it really wouldn't be true to the spirit of the original.The show is fun to watch.  Once fans of the earlier shows get over the fact that neither Jon Pertwee nor Tom Baker will be back, they'll enjoy this verstion too."	5.0	All the Whos down in Whoville rate this Who a Who	2006-03-18	13	11	2

A few words are in order for the exceptional audio/video quality of this Amazon Prime TV seriesas streamed through Roku 3 streaming device. Unfortunately, the Doctor actor was replaced in the last episode by a younger-looking actor, death at the hand of the Doctor has also entered the picture, and looking ahead to Series 2,at least episodes 1, 2 have been disappointing compared to Series 1, instead of rational-sounding explanations based on current/future science, we get magic, soul exchange, werewolf lore.	5.0	Doctor Who Season 1	2013-12-28	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AVCIAWHTON93E	John Dziadecki	Everyone remembers their first Doctor.I hadn't paid much attention to Doctor Who since Tom Baker's departure. Several years back, I remember reading a brief article in a 2005 Time magazine about the 'new' Doctor and his forthcoming return but I had no access to the series and forgot about it. Then last year I found a great deal on the the Sixth Series in Blu-ray, bought it and was blown away. Shortly thereafter, I found a similar deal on the Fifth Series in Blu-ray and was blown away. Found the Complete Specials of the 10th Doctor's closing tenure in Blu-ray and was blown away.Enough, I thought. Start at the beginning. But there weren't any Blu-ray releases. Why not? I did the research and -- duh -- found prior entries were not 'filmed' in HD. So, well, DVD was about as high def as it was going to be. Well, technically, European PAL (625 lines) has more resolution than American NTSC (525 lines) so there is a case for upverting to 1080 and releasing on Blu-ray as done partially on the Complete Specials.Broadcast image quality issues aside, this series is a solid reboot of the series! To be sure, the series has its ups and downs with most installments better than others, This series sets the stage for what follows and does it quite admirably.Following in the footsteps of Paul McGann's little known but very notable 8th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor breathes new credibility, vitality and integrity into the long-lived series. A great achievement and fun entertainment. I can finally see why the Time article was so positive about Eccleston and the reboot.No need to hesitate. Trust him. He's the Doctor.	5.0	The 9th Doctor's reboot is, to coin a word, fantastic!	2013-05-13	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A32W1LNAG6S52V	John J morozuk	The long hiatus between the end of the series first run in 1989 and its second incarnation beginning in 2005 allowed time for development of CGI technology to make the show's special effects far more realistic and entertaining.  Christopher Eccleston was an excellent choice to introduce new viewers to the Doctor and to update the personality of the 900+ year old Time Lord for long time fans of the Dr. Who franchise. I would have liked to see Eccleston continue in the role for another season or two, but have read that there were lots of behind the scenes issues that limited his portrayal to a single season. Regardless, this series is excellent entertainment with a few, subtle morals worked into the stories.	5.0	Great Reboot of a Classic Series	2014-01-28	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"""Doctor Who"", the oldest, longest-running, science fiction television series is finally back, and it has hardly looked better than this series (season), which has been billed as the ""First Series"", when it is actually the 27th season dating from 1963 (""Doctor Who"" was officially on ""hiatus"" from 1989 to 2004, with the sole exception of the joint Anglo-American 1996 television film which had Sylvester McCoy briefly reprising his role as the 7th Doctor with Paul McGann as the 8th Doctor and Eric Roberts as a flamboyant, still utterly repugnant, The Master.). Producer Russell T. Davies and his team of producers and writers at BBC (Wales) have wrought a veritable television masterpiece in this 27th season of ""Doctor Who"", which many already regard as one of the show's very best. In his most capable hands, Davies has successfully ""re-booted"" ""Doctor Who"" with better, more elaborate sets and special effects than before (The TARDIS' interior looks more like a Gothic cathedral's than before, owing its look more to the 1996 film than to its earlier run as a BBC television series.), without forsaking the show's unique identity that has earned ample praise and admiration from Whovians (""Doctor Who"" fans) across the globe. Davies also has to be commended for ensuring a high literary quality to this season's scripts, and for being responsible for some of the best written scripts in the show's history. However, substantial praise must be extended too to Christopher Eccleston for his vivid, most imaginative, portrayal of The Doctor that almost has no peer - with the possible exception of Tom Baker's - and Billie Piper as his young companion Rose Tyler. Christopher Eccleston's 9th Doctor may be the series' most emotionally complex; a moody, introspective ""loner"" prone to unexpected emotional outbursts, who truly finds some solace in his friendship with young Rose. He's also the very last of his kind, the sole surviving Time Lord of some distant future ""Time War"" whose very existence casts a reoccuring dark shadow across the individual episodes of this season. A season in which The Doctor meets up with Charles Dickens (Simon Callow), visits London during the Blitz in the early dark days of World War II, and is reacquainted with his deadliest adversaries; the Daleks. Long-time fans of ""Doctor Who"" - and those barely acquainted with this series - will find this DVD set a highly desirable acquisition."	5.0	"One of the Best Seasons of ""Doctor Who"""	2007-07-19	7	6	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A15K1QU7XE1Z9A	John Liosatos	"This rating is not for the show, which gets 5-stars. The show is great, but I have a problem with all the crappy extras used as an excuse to charge a ridiculous price.  Having seen this series even before the Sci-Fi Channel aired it, I can attest to the quality of the stories. Christopher Eccleston fantastically portrays our favorite timelord.  In fact I wish he would have chosen to stay on for another year or two.  Two problems with the series itself: 1) most of the aliens on Platform One look like something you'd find in Star Wars, not a good thing; 2) although I like Captain Jack as a character, they could have done without the ""yag"" angle (figure it out, as I couldn't get it on here if I had spelled it properly). I felt like I was watching Will and Grace at times. As for my main flaw with the DVDs themselves, if you look around, you can fortunately find bootleg copies of the stories on DVD-R for a much cheaper price, if you just need the episodes and nothing else."	2.0	Again too many worthless extras	2006-07-09	40	6	34
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2JO0NT6Q8TTW7	John M. Schreiner	I was first introduced to the doctor via my local PBS station. Though the rubber monsters made me laugh the excellent writing kept in interested.I went on to purchase the Dr. Who episodes as they become available on VHS and then later on DVD. Watching the evolution of the show from William Hartnell through Sylvester McCoy. I enjoyed each show in it's own right.Then the Doctor went away, partly due to the cost to air the reruns on our PBS station and partly due to the BBC ending production on the show.We watched an attempted resurrection of the character and the show with the Dr. Who movie of the 1980s (a bit disappointing in story line but we did see a return of the Master. Also the shortest lived doctor in the form of Paul McGann)Again the doctor left us for years. Now he returns, and I must say that I am overjoyed at his return. The storylines are worthy of the original show, and though we still have our rubber monsters we also have Computer Graphics to enhance the Who experience.Although at first Christopher Eccleston Northern England accent is distracting (the other doctors had an upper class accent) but he more than fills the Doctor's shoes.I highly recommend you purchase the DVDs. The show is priceless, if you enjoy Science and good writing you will love the new Dr. Who	5.0	Is there a Doctor in the House?	2006-04-06	5	2	3

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2BHAF6HJ727UW	Jonathan Snooks	I thought this season was a great come back for Dr. Who.  I know that there was a gap between the last Dr. Who series (with Sylvester Mccoy) and the 90's movie, and another gap between the 90's movie and the new series.  I thought it was a great revival and it was good how they didn't waste time reinroducing the main themes and concepts of the series.  It has most of the elements which made the old series great plus modern special effects.  I say most of the elements because much of the new series is devoted to adventures on Earth while the older series seemed to involve more adventures on alien planets.  I kind of prefer going to alien planets more, but all of the episodes were still well written and executed.  I was also kind of put off by Captain Jack's gayness.  Fortunately they didn't show much but I didn't think it was inappropriate for something that is supposed to be a family TV show.  I also tend to think that using a big name entertainment franchise to further one's political agenda is a cheap shot.  So I don't think the first set is family friendly, but it's still fun to watch.	3.0	Good comeback for the most part	2010-07-15	7	3	4
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1QLJ0G3X76UL4	Jon Clendenen	I had always avoided the old Doctor Who shows because I thought they were just a little too cheesy. After a bit of convincing, a coworker finally got me to try Episode 1 of the reboot of the show. Christopher Eccleston's wit and the easy banter between the principle characters lured me in right away. I have to say that this is my favorite TV show of the millennium. The adventure, emotion, humor, and sometimes creepiness of the show keep me coming back again and again.Since Eccleston was my introduction to The Doctor, I have always compared the others to him and found them to be good, but missing the unhinged, humorous, manic energy of season 1. The only drawback is that Mickey is such a whiner. I get it that it is his place in the story, but seriously, he needs to grow a spine or find a six-pack of self esteem.If you are even a slight fan of Science Fiction, WATCH THIS SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING. You will thank me later.	5.0	For large values of AWESOME, see the Doctor	2014-04-02	0	0	0

After a recent comic con where my girlfriend went crazy about all things Who, I figured it was time to educate myself. The first few episodes were a little rough, but the series is a lot of fun as it gets going. My favorite thing is that it's not as predictable as a lot of the content I'm used to watching. Unfortunately the actual doctor was actually a detractor for me. Ecclestone does not make for a particularly likable Doctor.  Kind of a jerk really, and often not in an entertaining way.	4.0	Not a big Ecclestone fan	2014-05-12	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2Z5GFJ0ALTCIP	Joshua Bryant	Christopher Eccleston really kicked off the new series of Doctor Who(s) and without him the current pop culture would be lacking.  While the production quality was really kind of lacking in this season, I believe that's what started making it great.  It was the fantastic stories and character development as opposed to Hollywood trickery with bright lights and flashy things.	5.0	Headliner to a fantastic series...	2013-02-26	0	0	0

Christopher Eccleston is such a great person to fill in as the doctor and this season is a must watch as it sets the ideas of what the doctor believes in as well as the adversaries that will be faced that make the next seasons so great.

I recently started watching this series a month back, and i am already into the The third series.But, I have decided to go back and rewatch the first series with this doctor again simply for the memories. What brought me back to the series was actually its first episode with the mannequins. I saw that way back when it was first brought back in 2005. that one scene stuck with me throughout the years and i could not remember where it was from! after racking my mind and talking to a few people, I discovered the doctor.I give this series a 10/10 a must watch for new fans and old! take my word for it, i'm the doctor! ha ha!	5.0	A Great Series For New and Old Fans Alike	2013-09-21	0	0	0

The pair have amazing chemistry despite the age difference - these two obviously work best as a team, whatever the function of that team may be. The addition of John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness is the icing on the cake. The characters are engaging, their relationships are believable, and the sci-fi is pleasantly easy on the brain while allowing the human element to tug on the heart strings just enough to make it stick with you.

It is updated, yet holds every charm that the old series did-sometimes silly, often serious, with a hero who is definitely the good guy, without being too perfect and most certainly not infallible.  I admit I came into it expecting to hate Rose (a little jealousy, maybe?), but she quickly became one of my favorites of the Doctor's companions.  The only regret I have is that I am not able to get the show on TV, so I'll have to wait until next season is released on DVD.  WAAAAA!

I liked the premise and characters enough to want to keep going.....but man, some of the scenes in this series (especially early on) were kind of hard to get through. The acting almost always felt forced from not one, but all of the main characters. The only exception might be the scenes with the Doctor getting angry, those were the times I most believed him as a character. Everyone else....meh. I am happy to report that the production and acting quality got much better in season 2, though I do miss Christopher Eccelston.

I just didn't understand why anyone would like it.  Couldn't even stand to listen to the theme music 'cause it freaked me out so badly!  I've never been a huge fan of science fiction either.  (Harry Potter books are one of only a very few exceptions to this rule.)However, when my local PBS station (which I LOVE) started airing episodes from this new series, I figured I'd give it another try.  SO worth it!  The writing, acting, special effects, directing...EVERYTHING about it is excellent, and it's such an intelligent, thought-provoking show which makes you feel so many different emotions!If one episode alone could completely change my opinion, how much do you think YOU would enjoy it?  :-)Yes, I'm an adult now and can tolerate scary TV much better than I used to, but I will admit that sections of some episodes still frighten me.  (Great episode, but ""Empty Child"" sent shivers down my spine every time I heard this little voice call out, ""Mummy.  Mummy.  Are you my mummy?"")  I like to watch this series with all the lights on and the dog curled up with me.  Each episode sticks with me, and I always hope that it won't give me nightmares!"	4.0	Not at all what I remembered!	2007-07-02	7	7	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1UX6L7NEJQ6VY	Keitheaux	"This season is the starting point for the renewed Doctor Who TV program by the BBC, and it's one of the best in my opinion. Christopher Ecclestion gives an excellent performance as the shell-shocked Ninth Doctor, who has just fought in the apocalyptic Time War. This off-camera event essentially resulted in the extinction of his species and thier ancient enemies, the Daleks. So the last Time Lord returns to the Earth he loves, and through the course of the season grows back into the whimsical, capricious, but competent Doctor we all know from previous regenerations. This season has an overreaching story arc, but most episodes are free-standing. One excellent exception is the two parter, ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" which is very scary and creepy, but has one of the best endings. These two episodes also introduce the irrepressible Captain Jack Harkness, played by John Barrowman, who later goes on to be the lead in the Doctor Who spinoff series Torchwood. Billie Piper plays the major companion, Rose Tyler, through Season 1. She brings hope and light to the Doctor through the course of episodes, helping him become himself again."	5.0	"One of the best seasons of the ""New"" Doctor Who!"	2011-11-02	3	3	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	"Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). The BBC celebrated in 2005 by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodes from the rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.EXTRAS:SET features the companion series DR. WHO CONFIDENTIAL, a behind the scenes show that ran concurrently providing an episode for all 13 shows supplying fun chart toping tunes to film footage, interviews and more. Set also includes commentaries by cast and crew actually worth listening to!!Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any ""new"" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.The PILOT story: ""ROSE"" introduces his new companion Rose Tyler who is attacked by mannequins (or AUTONS) in the department store where she works. She meets the Doctor and the pair end up fighting to save the world. The pacing of this one, like most of the 13 new episodes, is like lightning, and the Autons have never been scarier. The TARDIS (interior) has never looked better or bigger.Next in ""THE END of the WORLD"" The Doctor offers Rose a chance to go anyplace, anytime, they end up 5 Billion years in the future above the Earth just before it ends. But someone has sabotaged the very observation satellite they're on. Not a bad episode, it shoots very high with a ""Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" motif and cinematically accomplishes it, also reveals that the Doctor is the ""Last of the Timelords.""In the episodes 4 & 5 ""ALIENS of LONDON"" & ""WORLD WAR III."" The Doctor takes Rose home (mistakenly) 12 months later. We  FINALLY learn what happens back home when a companion up and leaves with the Doctor. The pair deal with Rose's Mum, who thought she was dead, and the ex-boyfriend who has been the main suspect. But when a spaceship crashes in the Thames in an ""stunning"" sequence which sets new standards for TV effects, the whole world goes on Red Alert, and the Doctor is noticed by the Government. Contains a nice mix of CGI and latex. Also features Toshiko Sato, returning character for Dr. Who spin-off  TORCHWOOD due to broadcast for late '06.In Episode 6, ""DALEK"" Beneath the Salt Plains of Utah, the billionaire collector Henry Van Statten holds the last relic of an alien race and the one living exhibit in the museum is a....you know what. This one makes the Daleks scary (again)! One Dalek, outgunned, outnumbered, boy is mankind in trouble. This one was nominated for a 2006 HUGO Science Fiction Achievement Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form category (Battlestar Galactica won it last year for the episode ""33"")In episode 8, FATHER'S DAY, The Doctor takes Rose back in time to meet her long-dead Father, but the Tylers finds themselves battling the Reapers. A truly heart-wrenching episode, loads of disturbing imagery. The interaction between the Doctor and Rose is very real, in spite of the increasing unreality of the situation(a 2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION).In the 9th episode, THE EMPTY CHILD. Its London, 1941, the Blitz. A mysterious child terrorizes Homeless children in this 2 part storyline.The Empty Child story continues in The DOCTOR DANCES. The Child's plague is spreading throughout wartime London, and so is its zombie army. ""TORCHWOOD's"" main spin-off character Capt. Jack Harkness is introduced...ROSE: You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kindof freelancer.JACK: That's a little harsh- I prefer to think of myselfas a criminal.The ""Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" maybe one of the greatest stories in the entire history Dr. Who.(2006 HUGO, SCI-FI Achievement Award NOMINATION)In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features ""Big Brother,"" & ""Weakest link"" gags as the Doctor becomes a ""flatmate"" and Rose a contestant. Also features the ""Final Battle"" of the ""Time War,"" the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!AWARDS:The 2005 series won the 2006 BROADCAST AWARD for BEST DRAMA SERIES adding to the series' successes at the National Television Awards (voted Most Popular Drama), TV Moments, and the BBC 2005 Drama Awards! The show's two stars (Eccleston and Piper) scooped the most popular actor and actress honors in the awards voted by the public. Dr. Who (2005)was also nominated for not only the 2006 HUGO Award (announcing winners on Aug 26), but on May 7th it WON 5 of the most prestigious award British Television has to offer: the BAFTAS Awards (British Academy of FILM and TELEVISION ARTS)  out of the 14 categories it was nominated. Winning for BEST DRAMA SERIES, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST MAKE-UP, BEST COSTUME, BEST DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and the PIONEER AUDIENCE AWARD which was voted for by the British public (kind of like the US People's Choice Award).WHEN it aired on SCI-FI FRIDAYS @8 PM CENTRAL there were some lines and moments cut from the original BBC versions, these are the complete episodes.Hopefully SCI-FI will pick up SEASON 2, starting with the post-regeneration CHRISTMAS INVASION because believe it or not the next 13 even better!!"	5.0	It's finally here & it's FANtastic!!!	2006-06-30	76	71	5

Christopher Eccleston puts up a strong and quirky performance and Rose acts as a good audience surrogate to the world. The best episodes (Dalek, The Empty Child, The Doctor Dances, Boom Town) far outweigh the weaker (Aliens of London, World War Three, The Long Game). The finale is fun, if a little weak, but definitely enjoyable. It is no surprise that this series sparked Doctor Who's surge in popularity.The set comes with mimi-Doctor Who Confidential episodes that detail the making of episodes.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Having been a longtime fan of the original series, I was elated to hear that the BBC was reviving the brilliant world of ""Doctor Who.""  I became even happier when SciFi Channel picked up the series and began broadcasting it here in the US.  This wonderful boxed set contains all thirteen of the original episodes in their entirety on four discs as well as a fifth disc containing an episode-by-episode ""Doctor Who Confidential"" hosted by ""Shaun of the Dead"" star, Simon Pegg.Each episode disc includes its own special features, with commentaries for all of the stories.  The highlights include an interview with Eccleston and the making of the destruction of Big Ben.  That particular extra reveals a fun secret to fans about London's famed clock during the taping of the sequence.The tales feature classic ""Who"" enemies like the Daleks and Autons as well as hints and nods to the classic series, including a glimpse at members of UNIT.  New enemies, like the wonderfully wicked Slitheen, also add to the mythos of ""Who.""Christopher Eccleston, who comes across as very serious about his portrayal of the Doctor, plays the Timelord as an intense vigilante at times, a caring, loving friend at others, and then almost child-like when he encounters new experiences.  Loyal fans of the series have argued over who Eccleston's Doctor reminds them of the most.  Personally, I think that there's a healthy mix of Tom Baker's (#4) wonder and seriousness, William Hartnell's (#1) crankiness, and Peter Davison's (#5) sometimes emotional frailty.His companion this time around is Rose Tyler, played by Billie Piper.  She's a young Londoner fed up with her ho-hum life who jumps at the chance to go time-hopping with the Doctor.  She's a solid character who comes into her own as the series progresses.What makes this particular Doctor Who series so unique from the classic is the fact that victims, friends and enemies question the conscious of the Doctor.  Why is it that everywhere he turns up, people die?  Is he a selfish being, or a true hero?  Excellent characters like Jackie Tyler (Rose's mum) and Rose's boyfriend, the wonderful Mickey, are used as vehicles to drive these questions home.  Even the Daleks get a couple of ego-bruising shots at the Doctor.  The consequences of the actions of the Doctor and others are also addressed like they've never been looked at before in the classic series.Overall, this is an excellent revival of the classic series.  Gone are the wobbly sets and cheesy costumes, but the intelligent stories, scary enemies, and wonder and amazement are well-intact.  If you're new to the series, this is an excellent introduction.  If you're an old fan, you've probably already made up your mind about the show.Highly recommended."	5.0	"To Quote The Doctor, ""Fantastic!"""	2008-01-06	2	2	0

They have kept alive the story of The Dr through the ages and brought new life into it. The continuous story within the episodes makes you have to watch from beginning to end but it is worth it. The outcomes are not always expected and not always happy like so many other shows. For fans of Doctor Who, you know that he does what he has to to preserve the timeline and the people of Earth.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1KEBE2ZM0AKJ6	Kiri Namtvedt	I had a period of fanatical Doctor Who adoration in my past; during college Tom Baker was on, and I adored him.  I lived for my half hour of Doctor Who on Saturday nights!  But time passed and the Doctor faded out of my life...Now, all these years later I've finally watched Season One of the new Doctor Who, and I'd have to say that I am MORE obsessed than ever.  Christopher Eccleston is every bit as good as everyone says.  He captures the Doctor's wit, charm, mystery and depth with grace and style.  Billie Piper as Rose Tyler is a delight.  The chemistry between the two just makes the show; it is as much about them as it is about him.The plots are full of the usual Doctor Who outrageousness and wacky weirdness, although with a modern edge, an often scary edge.  Still, the characters shine through, and the supporting cast is generally superb.	5.0	"It's been said before - ""Fantastic!"""	2008-04-25	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1KVO275MBQIVN	K. Johnson	What an amazing way to bring back a classic show!  Chris Eccleston is mesmerizing, and Billie Piper is great as the audience surrogate in this reimagining of Doctor Who.  Each episode in this series is imaginative and funny, taking a character well known in British pop culture and continuing his story in the 2000s for a new generation.  Remember, though, that this series was made in 2005 on a TV budget.  The CGI isn't the best though it's infinitely better than the very cheap model work and compositing done on the original show.  The cameras used to film this weren't great either which gives a grainy, murky texture to darker scenes.This DVD set is a great way to own all of Eccleston's episodes.  The slipcover might get set aside if you watch it a lot, but it's still a clever way of packaging the show.  There are tons of special features including all of Doctor Who Confidential for the season, videos Billie Piper made on the set, and deleted scenes.	5.0	This set is STELLAR!	2012-12-07	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	4.4 starsI am no DW fanatic; I saw plenty of the old ones as a kid on BBC, and enjoyed them in the same way I liked Trek: very interesting ideas married to laughable special effects. But I never went out of my way to watch them. So when I saw this set at my library, I picked it up expecting to watch a couple episodes and maybe have a good laugh.Instead, I found one of the best tv series, sci fi or otherwise, I've seen since Deadwood, Arrested Development and The Sopranos. The scripts are tight, the concepts often very clever and even politically relevant, and both the principals quite engaging. I truly like Ecclestone in this role, even more than Baker. He underplays it wisely, and his interplay with the quite lovely Piper is much more advanced than in the old series.The first episode is very fine indeed, and pulled me in immediately. Davis is an excellent director and writer as well; his set-ups are tight, the camera work inventive and playful, and in general this is just top quality stuff, recommended even for those not in love with the genre. Davis grasps the inherent silliness of the series' premise, and plays to it with much daffy humor, but also recognizes the potential for making statements about modern-day Britain, and gets off some good ones.The extras are excellent; plenty of them, and most are well done. Exemplary, in fact.But, the price is waaay too high. This should go for 35 or 40, not 65, but I guess they know they have a captive market; Whovians are second only to Trekkies in fanaticism, and have no doubt happily bought this set in droves. Still, it's overpriced. Sure am glad my library has such a great catalog!All in all, an excellent introduction of the Doctor to the 21st century.	4.0	Excellent series, way overpriced dvd set	2010-01-23	2	1	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A358CUKO6YXVEX	Kuba	I started off my experience with Doctor Who by watching the fifth season (or series, as the Brits call it), featuring my personal favorite Doctor, Matt Smith.  I then went on to finish the last few seasons of the series, and yet I wanted more.  I decided to go back to the first season, and while I wouldn't recommend watching the show in that order, it was still incredibly satisfying, and filled in a few gaps of the Doctor Who universe that I hadn't yet learned about (i.e. Bad Wolf, Captain Jack, etc.).  At first, I found some of the effects used in the show to be somewhat amusing, since I suppose the BBC didn't have as large of a special effects budget back then.  However, you get used to it pretty quickly, and besides, that's not where the beauty of Doctor Who lies.  If you're interested in space,  time travel, the English accent, or all of the above, you're guaranteed to have a blast watching this show.  I just wish that I had found out about it earlier than I did, but, as they say, better late than never!	5.0	Binge-Watchers Beware	2014-03-20	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A31ATTQN54SZ4M	Lady Were	Doctor Who is a wonderful series that takes all viewers on a trip and expands a person's normal universe exponentially. Each episode details the adventures of a time lord, a type of alien in the show, called the Doctor and the companions that come along for the journey. Its a Sci-fi classic and a must see for anyone who enjoys watching random adventures and the occasional technobabbleChristopher Eccleston's portrayal of the 9th incarnation of the Doctor, brings a comedic no-nonsense sarcasm to this series that breathes life into this once dead series. Billie Piper is Rose Tyler the newest companion and grounds the Doctor, and while he shows her new worlds, she shows him a new perspective.All in all I highly recommend this to all who are interested in wanting to begin watching this series or any one who really enjoys Sci-fi.	4.0	One of the BEST ways to revive an old series	2008-12-30	0	0	0

Yep, cranky William Hartnell, funny Patrick Troughton, dapper Jon Pertwee, the odd Tom Baker, bland Peter Davison(sorry), obnoxious Colin Baker, and the UNIQUE Sylvester McCoy.  One way or another it has lived up to all the imaginings sci-fi can summon up.We only had one movie with Paul McGann, so I really can't comment on him.Now Christopher Eccleston.  In an interview, both Christopher Eccleston and Russell T. Davis realized that Mr. Eccleston won't win over the ""hard core"" fans of the show, but they are wrong.  The BBC encourages comments about different shows it's aired.  Dr. Who is rated one of highest sci-fi show for all ages.  Season 1-2005, is right up there.  My first Doctor was Jon Pertwee, but I've enjoyed them all.  Then I found Sylvester McCoy.  He was wonderful.  Davis and Eccleston have brought my two favorite Doctors together.  What else can I say.In this first season, they have used all the quirks of Dr. Who to bring the new viewers up to date.  Who is the Doctor?  Where is he from?  What is the TARDIS?  Though they don't come out and say Gallifrey, it saddens me that the planet has been destroyed.  What is that 'tube' he carries?  Just about everything that has existed in the Dr. Who myth has been brought forward, though I'd love to see him in Patrick Troughton's Yeti coat tied with a rope.  That would be hysterical. The saddest bit of the first season will be Rose's introduction to regeneration.  It was a brilliant idea to replace the ailling William Hartnell.I wish Mr. Eccleston had decided to stay, at least for 2 more seasons.  Peter Davison had a rule that he wouldn't stay in a role more than 3 years, so he wouldn't be completely identified with the character.  It makes sense.  I wish Mr. Eccleston  had the same rule.  It would have been nice to see him for another 2 more years.  He is a wonderful actor and after 15 years, he has made the Doctor tangible again.I hadn't known of Mr. Eccleston prior to his portrayal of the Doctor, but now I do and I will keep watch for his other projects.  After bringing the Doctor back to us with his portrayal of the Doctor, I wish Mr. Eccleston all the best in what he has planned for his career."	5.0	I didn't realize how much I missed him.	2006-06-03	10	9	1

I have always been sort of a nerd/geek; so this was perfect for me. I am starting the second season now and I still love it.(Slight Spoiler Alert) This show is about a man called The Doctor. He is an alien called a Timelord. He travels through time in a blue public call box. The setting is London England for the first episode. (The others are scattered around the universe.) The show starts with one of the main characters; Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).I would probably recommend this show for someone probably age 12+ Just because it is good for young audiences doesn't mean it isn't great for adults; though. Now, there is some swearing and some parts that may be inappropriate for young ages; so watch out. I would recommend this show very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.	5.0	Amazing.

The acting was terrific, the special effects excellent and the scripts were outstanding. There was wonderful character development, especially for the Doctor and Rose,but also secondary characters also. The plots were clever and I especially liked how there were connections that ran through the series (and actually into series 2 and 3 despite a new doctor). The series was thoughtful, complex and very emotional - particularly ""Fathers Day,"" and the two parters - ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"" and ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways."" I geninuely felt bad when Eccleston's Doctor regenerates into David Tennant's Doctor. I've enjoyed the following two season which I think are a much more mixed bag than Season One.

That is until I saw this new, high budget and well written adaptation of the series.I'm traditionally into American ""hard sci-fi"" like Star Trek and Stargate franchises, and traditionally not into the British stuff, but this series made me cross the pond and pay attention to what's going on over there in Britian.  I'm very impressed with the actors, the writing, the stories, and the whole series in general.You get action, adventure, top-notch effects, character development, morality plays, and sarcastic pop-culture referential humor all in one.  And, speaking as an American, the English accents and expressions just make it all the more fun.This DVD set also contains a number of special features that both cater to the Dr. Who fan who wants more insight into the series and to the person new to the Dr. Who universe.  All in all a great deal of great sci-fi.  Bravo!!"	5.0	Dr. Who has the cure for predictable Sci-Fi.	2007-08-25	5	5	0

The 9th Dr is wonderful and very entertaining. If you have seen Chris in any of his movies he plays against type as Dr Who. He really is a very good actor! The stories are very good and they refer back to previous enemies but you don't need to know the background. The stories stand up on their own. He has a great smile.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3TRXPRUYVOLSM	Little Roy Blue	"Like many ardent Doctor Who fans, I spent much of the 1990s wondering if the BBC would ever get around to producing new episodes of its signature science fiction program. Well, I should've heeded that old cliche, ""be careful what you wish for,"" because the Beeb did start making Doctor Who again and I ended up sorta hating it.To start, I should try to explain the ... ah ... strange appeal of the classic series. Despite being filmed on the cheap and in a rush, the original Doctor Who generated a lot of witty and engaging episodes, which hold up well for those of us who can tolerate (or even enjoy) camp. To me, the show was always at its best when it was cerebral (e.g., The Aztecs, City Death, Snakedance) while the ""action"" or ""scary"" episodes were much overrated by fans (see Earthshock, or almost any of the Troughton Doctor's kiddie-oriented monster episodes).Alas, this revival series can't really be described as ""witty"" or ""cerebral""; indeed, it throws out the intelligence of the old show in favor of gloopy sentimentality and domestic drama of the soap opera variety. (Will Rose and the Doctor kiss? Or will Rose go back to her doofy ex-boyfriend? Oh, the suspense!) Now, I quite like domestic dramas, when they're well done; indeed, my favorite film director is Yasujiro Ozu, who elevated the genre to high art. But watching this season of Doctor Who, with its shrill cardboard characters (I'm thinking of Rose's mother here) and superficial conflicts, is as far from good domestic drama as Earth is from the sun. It doesn't help that every ""emotional"" moment is underlined by manipulative music, over-the-top acting, and lots of crying.On the plus side, this season had an impressive star in Christopher Eccleston, who may be the most accomplished actor to ever play the Doctor. That said, he is not the best Doctor by a long shot, because showrunner Russell T. Davies didn't use him right. Indeed, throughout this season, Eccleston veers from effective to obnoxious. His overall character - an angry man who tortures a helpless Dalek and practically taunts Rose by showing her the destruction of planet Earth - is not really that nice, or that evocative of the more charming gentleman-genius Doctor of the original series. But at times, Eccleston is a good enough actor to vault over the bad writing and make his Doctor memorable.Like the Doctor himself, the scripts here are uneven. Mark Gatiss writes an excellent episode about Charles Dickens fighting zombies, and Robert Shearman contributes a pretty good script for the Dalek episode (I'm not sure why he wants me to sympathize with the mass-murdering creature, though). Alas, showrunner Davies consistently pens the worst episodes, and uses the series as a showcase for his weird opinions on such irrelevant topics as reality TV and, of all things, weight (one of his villains is depicted as being too thin; another is too fat). Another flaw of Davies' writing is his over-reliance on silly deus ex machina resolutions; the season finale is particularly bad in this regard, as it literally ends with a god emerging from a machine and solving all the Doctor's problems for him!Finally, the production design is also hit-or-miss. British fans and TV critics tend to describe the new Who as a big-budget spectacular, but to my jaded Yankee eyes, this looks like just another cheesy BBC production. The ""redesigns"" of the TARDIS and the Daleks look little better than the originals, the opening credits resemble a screen saver, and the quality of the video footage is poor (the actors' skin tones look orange!) The CGI special effects, meanwhile, improve on the special effects of the original series (anything would) but are still mediocre; I, for one, prefer older Who special effects, which are quite funny when approached with the right attitude. As for the Slitheen, they easily rate among the stupidest-looking Doctor Who monsters in history, and they appear in no less than three episodes of this season. I'll take the Destroyer or the Zygons over them any day...In short, I was disappointed by this revival of Who, and I'm afraid that the show only got worse with time (with the exception of season four, which managed to produce a few good episodes, like ""Midnight""). As for the DVD package itself - well, these episodes weren't filmed in high definition, so they already look a bit dated and rubbish. And the special features mostly consist of the production team congratulating itself for its own cleverness. I prefer more honest, retrospective features to this kind of self-praising stuff.Anyway, while this isn't exactly *terrible* science fiction, it is overrated, and I'd give it a miss in favor of (a) modern sci-fi that's better written, or (b) older sci-fi that's funnier and more soulful. Like, erm, Doctor Who..."	2.0	The best of new Doctor Who - and it's mediocre	2011-09-28	14	10	4

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3OYBVF3PZEKGA	"Mari Atherton ""Mari (Author of Merari and The..."	"At last, at last Dr. Who is back. It's been a long spell without him, but Christopher Eccleston was worth the wait and Billie Piper as Rose joins Ace, Sarah, the first Romana, Leela and K-9 as my favorite companions.Although it is somewhat disappointing that the series did not pick up where the Sylvester McCoy stories ended (because it really seemed as if the McCoy stories were headed SOMEWHERE,) this series is eminently satisfying. The Doctor seems more unhinged-- he doesn't have to worry about the Time Lords riding herd on him and he is free to swing around the galaxy and do whatever he wants, although he mostly hangs around earth.The hint of a romance between him and Rose is a different direction for the Doctor, but it feels natural with the doctor's new sense of being alone in the universe. The chemistry between the two of them is terrific. I also loved the character of Captain Jack in the last few episodes in the series-- he reminded me a lot of the alternate Rimmer (Ace ""Save me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast."") on Red Dwarf.It doesn't matter if you've never watched Dr. Who before.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A33775AIB1A664	"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url"""	"I have always been aware of Dr. Who but somehow it seemed daunting to slog through 40+ years of material.  We somehow got into Torchwood and enjoyed it, but started getting an inkling that Jack was actually from Dr. Who and got curious.  In fact, it turns out that Torchwood is an anagram for Doctor Who.  So having completed Children of Earth and waiting for the next series to hit DVD, we checked it out.THE SERIESIt seemed campy to me, and I didn't love the characters when I first met them, but it didn't take long to warm to them.  By the end, I loved them and respected them both deeply in important ways: they had depth and character beyond many characters on other shows, even to a greater extent I think than on Torchwood, but of course there are two main characters here, so there is more time to explore them.  The Doctor and Rose both have a lot of heart and care a lot for each other - more as the story goes on - though Rose shows it from the beginning, and The Doctor opens up more as it goes on.  The characters are also intelligent, as are the stories.Like Torchwood, stories are unusual for science fiction, if you would even call it that.  I won't say there are NO space ships or that nothing blows up, and there is one scene that reminded me of a Hollywood action event, but these things are not the point.  The point is the stories, the drama, the PEOPLE.  The people make this show worth watching.  The events in the stories are mysterious, but in general there is usually something human - or something unusually alien - behind events and characters.There are a couple of stories that are complex enough that they had to span two episode to get fleshed out and resolved.  One in particular is one of the highlights of the series IMO.It is and is not violent.  When it is violent, it is not in the usual way.  A lot of people, or aliens, do die in the course of events.  ""Death follows Dr. Who"" is one of the slogans, and it's true, though it is generally as a result of problems he is trying to solve (that is, people are killed by aliens) or a sacrifice in the solution (people or aliens must die to solve the problem).  He tends not to kill directly so much as let it happen when it must.TORCHWOOD COMPARISON AND OVERLAPUnlike Torchwood, there is very little sexual tension in the stories.  I would not say none by any means, particularly when Captain Jack makes his appearance; after all, he's kind of an omnisexual guy.  But this series IS suitable for a younger audience than Torchwood, which has implied sex, and some a bit more than that.It was really fun to meet the cast of Torchwood, as we half-expected to do.  We knew we would meet Jack, though I thought it would be much later.  There were two other central cast characters from Torchwood who made single-episode appearances, though in different (yet somewhat similar) roles; I will let this be a surprise for you.  From having watched Torchwood, I know at least one more cast member will appear, and I suspect two more may show up.EXTRASLike Torchwood, there is an extra disk with 2+ hours of 12+ minute reviews of each episodes, with interviews of the actors, writers, producers, special effects people, and so on.  These are great fun after watching the series.  It really reminds me how great the series we just watched was, and provides some insight and some bits you may have missed.  Definitely recommended.BOTTOM LINEMy girlfriend is not often a fan of science fiction, but this is not the usual science fiction, and she likes this.  After watching the first season, we're both fans, and looking forward to more."	5.0	A Great Series, and fun for Torchwood fans (and no spoilers)	2012-03-24	3	3	0

I remember seeing the original series on PBS when I was a kid, but have to admit I didn't actually watch it. I found this first season to be quite good. The acting is where it needs to be and for the most part the storylines are engaging. The special effects are definitely a detractor in my eyes when cgi is involved, far less so in the use of physical objects of course and there are a few episodes I didn't particularly care for, but felt they were saved by the humor, overall I would highly recommend this show to those who love quirky sci-fi.	4.0	Enjoyable	2013-11-30	0	0	0

He is a Doctor Who fanatic and recommended that I watch the first season starring Christopher Eccleston (G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, upcoming Thor movie) and Billie Piper (Secret Diary Of A Call Girl tv series) in order to help me get the message of the subsequent seasons. The series opens with the character of Rose unintentionally meeting ""The Doctor"" after an eerie encounter involving mannequins.  Simon Pegg (The World's End), John Barrowman (Torchwood tv series) and Richard Wilson (Merlin tv series) are among some of the celebrities who guest star in season 1 of Doctor Who.  Simon Pegg  features in The Long Game episode (#7),  while Jack Barrowman and Richard Wilson first make appearances in ""The Empty Child"" episode (#9).

The writing is outstanding, the cast and crew excellent, and the special effects far and away out-do anything ever seen in Dr. Who before (See the Dr. Who Original series, 1963-1989, and other extraneous productions). I'm only saddened by C. Eccleston's decision to leave so early (he could easily have gone on another season or two), and the ""single episode equals one story"" format simply cannot match the ""serial"" format of the original -- there's simply not enough time (tee, hee)to develop the stories or characters the way the ""original""series did; the 3-4 episode length stories (average) of the original series, with the ""cliffhanger"" endings and tie-ins, were far and away the best way to go. I will be happy to buy the ""next series"" with David Tennant as the Doctor, in hopes that the people at the BBC are ""raising the bar"" with his Doctor!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A32BPER1JFW1AQ	M. Aves	"OK, this review is for everyone who NEVER saw the original -- because like you, neither did I.I grew up with the usual American sci-fi TV:  Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica (dicso 70's version), Lost In Space, Space 1999, X-Files.  I was even a fan of the short-lived ""Space: Above & Beyond"".  Never watched the original Dr. Who, because it just looked too campy.But when Sci-Fi channel resurrected this series, I got curious.  So I rented it via Netflix, and I gotta tell you, this is a GREAT sci-fi series!It's a little PG, so for those looking for something edgy with intrigue and gore, this won't be for you.  The CGI, not exactly top form, but pretty darned good when compared with what's out there.  The series has a feel that's a little bit Monty Python, a little bit ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", and a little bit...well I can't figure out the other bit, but its very good.The new Dr., played by Christpher Eccleston, is a very likable character, and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is the UK Britney Spears only not a dumb blond.  She's got a little bit of the ""Bond Girl"" good looks, but she's no helpless female, and she helps keep the viewer anchored in the modern 21st Century mindset, which is important since there's so much jumping about throughout time and space.What really surprised me was how faithful this series was to the original.  From the theme song, to the appearence of the Tardis, to even the look of the arch villain race of Daleks, everything done here is faithful to the original series, which began in the UK back in 1963 (take that all you trekkers!).  Moreover, Dr. Who ran continuously for over 25 years on UK television, which is more than you can say for Star Trek or even the Simpsons.  When you consider how much American Television is shamelessly reinterpreted (well, ripped-off is more like it) for the US, then that alone should make you curious as to why this concept and story has endured for so very long in a culture so similar to our own.Fans of Sci-Fi who are not Star Trek/Star Wars elitists will really enjoy it, and strangely, my 10 year old daughter and I really enjoy watching it together, so for parents who want to find good family friendly TV programming that won't dull their brains will not be dissappointed by purchasing this boxed set!"	5.0	If you never saw Dr. Who, then u gotta check it out!!!	2006-09-15	15	11	4

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A222IDCEOI77C	"M. B. Hopkins ""Diogenes"""	As a long time fan of the original, campy, Dr. Who of the BBC of the 60's and 70's, I was very skeptical of a new Doctor for the new century. My skepticism is now gone, washed away by the Doctor and his new assistant. The new Doctor has marvelous special effects at his disposal and still brings off to perfection that near manic energy, camp, and sense of fun of the old series.I'll watch the series on TV, but I prefer to buy the DVDs so I can have the captioning if I need it and so I can miss out on all the commercials.This is a very slick, professional package. I recommend it highly.	5.0	The Doctor Is In.	2006-11-03	2	1	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2PR69Z9QVA8VO	"M. Byars ""talkwebb"""	The show itself is fantastic ... as the new Doctor would put it. I recommend it with 5 stars no problem. However. $64.00 for a set of 13 episodes on DVD is insanely expensive. I feel like such a set should go no more than $38 at the max. I don't care what the special features the price is way too much. If you have a recorder ... it would be cheaper to just record them from off Sci-Fi network, and live with that. The BBC is obviously selling only to a niche market with a price like this. I love Doctor Who, and I love this new series, but if all I can do is watch it on Sci-Fi and online ... then so be it at this price.	2.0	Reviewing the DVD set not the show	2006-07-06	46	22	24

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AUZR3D51MOQ3A	Mel	I'm so glad I rented these instant videos.  I needed to watch this series from the beginning to fully grasp the story.  Eccleston and Piper do a great job.  Since I love historical fiction,  I'm used to seeing Eccleston as the very dark,  treacherous Duke of Norfolk in Elizabeth,  and I thought I would never embrace him as another character.  He does a spectacular job in this,  however.  He has the perfect amount of seriousness and goofiness,  that makes The Doctor seem very human, but for a moment you can believe he is an alien.  I'm up to Season 4 now,  so I can say I like Donna more as a companion to The Doctor,  but Rose Tyler(Piper) is of importance too.  This is the beginning of a very subtle romance.  One thing I can appreciate about the Doctor Who series is that it manages to have romance without being sexualized.	5.0	A great beginning	2013-04-24	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A38JVU5F3IIQOO	Metallman	I am new to Doctor Who and I started off with the 21st century reboot (also a continuation) of the Doctor Who series.  Season 1 of the new Doctor Who is the perfect introduction to Doctor Who.  You learn of the TARDIS, the Time Lords, time and space travel, and you get an introduction to many of the alien life forms that are a staple to Doctor Who.  On top of all that, you get the compelling story (and travels) of the 9th Doctor and his companion Rose.  Doctor Who season 1 is part a love story, a drama, a comedy, a sci fi adventure, but it's 100% entertaining!If you are new to the Doctor Who mythos like I was, you must start off with the adventures of the 9th Doctor and Rose!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2Y9DF04O4AKBQ	Michael D. Williams	"After over ten years of being off the air, Doctor Who returned to BBC TV and to the rest of the world's TVs.  Doctor Who first came on the air in 1963!  The new series starting with Christopher Eccleston as the time and space traveling ""Doctor,"" and Billie Piper as ""Rose Tyler,"" is labeled as ""The Complete First Series,"" but here we are refering to the New Series not the Original Series.  The Doctor's oldest enemy the Daleks return.  ""Captain Jack Harkness"" (John Barrowman) appears in several episodes before having his own spin-off program, Torchwood.  ""Rose"" becomes over two ""Doctors"" one of the best companions ever.  The new series, now in its fourth complete seasons is darker, more dramatic, and less campy, yet can still be humorous.  The special effects are better and on par with feature films.  After the flashy and outrageous clothing of the Doctor as played by Tom Baker, Peter Davidson, and Colin Baker, Eccleston is more Earth bound looking.  It is funny, but I seriously think Eccleston looks like a submarine captain.  This ""first"" season was a great restart to the overall Doctor Who world, but the stories get deeper and better with each new season.  In the UK Doctor Who is probably more popular than Star Trek was in the US.  Doctor Who may be seen in the US on the ""cable channel"" BBC America.

Other special features include behind the scenes views, special effects planning, and the like, but those are mostly space filler:  good enough for what they are, but not really a selling point.The reason to buy this is the stories, of course.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2ATBRISQWZOK5	"Mindmatters ""mindmatters"""	Buy the Dr. Who Complete First Series DVD set now! Don't be a cheapskate like me. On a whim, I bought Volume 1 of the Series last Friday and by Sunday, I was compelled to purchase the remaining three volumes. The show is just that good! Christopher Eccleston is phenomenal as the Doctor. Witty, sarcastic, cerebral, vindictive, compassionate and ocasionally scary. I challenge anyone to watch the Dalek episodes and not be impressed by Eccleston's performance! I know Sci Fi series aren't supposed to be Shakespeare. But Eccleston transcends the genre. Billie Piper and the supporting cast are all great as well. It's great watching The Doctor and Rose's relationship intensify with each episode...I'm an American who grew up watching Tom Baker's Dr. Who on PBS. So naturally, I was skeptical about the latest incarnation of the hero. Nevertheless, all my reservations were for naught! Russell T. Davies has done a commendable job resurrecting the series. He somehow managed to update the show without compromising the integrity of the characters!Bravo. I only wish Eccleston had at least given us one more season....Buy the set or each volume individually...but don't pass this gem up!	5.0	BEST DR. WHO EVER!	2007-01-15	5	4	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AO35F6BD3LMTV	Miss DePlume	Whether you're an old fan or a new one, you're in for a treat.  The show's been on since the 60's but don't let 40 years of past episodes scare you away, everything is explained. The new series is fast-paced with great production values and snappy dialogue.  Doctor Who is part space adventure, costume drama, and soap opera - so there's something to interest everybody.  There are even a few teary moments in this, something that doesn't happen so often in science fiction.Once you've devoured 2005, never fear - things get even better in 2006.	5.0	Three cheers for the Time Lord!	2006-08-20	2	2	0

Christopher Eccleston in the 1st series as the Doctor is FANTASTIC.  Great action packed stories that are lots of fun to watch.  If you never understood the British cult of Doctor Who previously, this new series will hook you.In the second series, David Tennant's Doctor is just a bit melodramtic nutsy with a tinge of mushy humanism (a few too many diatribes about the magnificance of the human race).  But still worth watching!	5.0	Christopher Eccleston is the DOCTOR!	2007-07-03	2	2	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1SZFSC0U0K54U	M. Lee	You have to have a bit of tolerance, or even preference for the goofy to really get into Dr. Who. It's really hard at times to take it seriously, particularly where the special effects are concerned. However, it can be completely endearing once you get into it.The thing I like the most about Dr. Who is that it is sci-fi, it is action-adventure, but what it isn't is dark and moody like a lot of other pieces of its genre. It's a light-hearted fix of an action show. But then, not always; it does have just enough of seriousness spread out across the season to keep you engaged and anticipating outcomes and the story of the main characters.I've only seen two doctors (Eccleston and Tennant), but I want to take a moment to comment on Eccleston's Doctor. When I first started watching, I thought his portrayal was strange and even a bit detached. As the series went on, however, I realized that his performance is anything but detached, and he actually did a really good job bringing to life a character who is extraordinarily complex. He is often warm and wise, but he fluidly switches to a cold and lethal persona. All in all, his performance really made the Doctor into someone to be fond of and have great respect for. I'll really miss his portrayal after watching this season.All in all though, if you like sci-fi and don't want to feel depressed after watching each episode, definitely give this one a try :)	4.0	Light-hearted Sci-Fi (Mostly)	2014-06-03	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1AMZ1ZM7SI6HI	Motoman	I thought Dr Who was gone twenty years ago. The last time I saw Dr Who was back in the 1980's. I loved that show with all of it's inexpensive special effects and great actors that really made the show special to me. I didn't know it's been revived until I accidently seen it here on Amazon. I'm glad it's back!The new Dr Who series still has the same story formula as the older series but it's been modernized for the 21st century. Dr Who is still Dr Who from past series. He travels in a police box called the Tardis through time and space. There's always an adventure and there's always something strange that will keep your attention thoughout the each episode. What's really changed from the past is a love relationship with his young assitant which gives it a little twist. The love relationship starts off as small hints throughout each episode but it tells you straight out and end of the season. All the special effects and sets are not cheap looking and all the actors are top notch!	5.0	Dr Who Is Better Than Ever!	2011-04-21	5	5	0

The last half of season 4 starting with Silence in the Library on to the end of season 6 (and hope it continues amazingly in the future with season 7) are in general stronger seasons than seasons 1 to 4a, but there are some wonderful parts in some of the early episodes, too.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1Y71PWTRZDR77	Napski	I love Doctor Who and I LOVE this first season, so let me be clear about that.It's this new packaging that has me on the ropes right now.  I am lucky to have the old one case that stands up like the Tardis on all four sides.This new way is basically your plain DVD box.If you want the old one, you can still pick it up on Amazon.uk, but the region of the disks are PAL and not NTSC (which means they won't work on most DVD/Blu Ray players here in the US), but it only goes for about $20 anyway.Yes, I know I am giving a lower rating because of the packaging, but I think it's worth noting on here.At least Amazon could have written in the description that this is a REVISED version of the series.Still, if you have never seen Doctor Who at all, then you MUST see this and if you don't care about packaging, then pick this up either here or at WBstore.comTake care everyone!	2.0	New packaging stinks!	2012-11-02	9	3	6

Christopher Eccleston is fantastic in his one and only series as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is a great match for his companion.  This series is smart, funny, goofy, and thought-provoking, sometimes all at the same time.Every episode on this DVD set has commentary, and it's all fascinating.  Tons of other special features as well, such as Billie Piper's video diaries showing some behind-the-scenes of how the show was made.Almost since I got this DVD set I have been lending it to others to get them hooked on the series.  It's in its fifth set of hands right now.  Last time it was returned to me I didn't even have time to bring it back home, I lent it out again immediately.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3TISHGXRLMTTV	Patrick Correa	"I have to admit, from the start of this I knew 9 would never be one of my favorite Doctors.  He does get good from episode 5 onwards, but even then he's nowhere near as good as David Tennant, Matt Smith, or Tom Baker.  Still, it was worth buying.The following synopsizes come from me &/or Wikipedia.1.  Rose: The story of how a girl named Rose Tyler came to know our favorite Doctor after being attacked by mannequins.  For the triumphant return of Doctor Who to TV, this isn't very special.  It's not bad, for the most part it's good, but I hate the scene at the end where the Doctor hesitates to destroy the Nestene consciousness & Rose hesitates to help him, resulting in one of my favorite characters being fired at (I refuse to believe he died).  Apart from that it's fine though.  C+2. The End of the World: The Doctor takes Rose to see the end of the Earth in the distant future.  Better than the last one, though there was still an annoying moment of hesitation.  B3.  The Unquiet Dead: The Doctor & Rose go to Cardiff in 1869, where they meet Charles Dickens & encounter what appear to be ghosts possessing the bodies of the dead.  Now this is a great episode.  The atmosphere is good & the guy they got to play Dickens was perfect.  A-4.  Aliens of London: An alien spaceship crashes into Big Ben, drawing attention.  But it turns out to be a hoax.  It starts off good, but starts to suck somewhere around the midway mark.  C-5. World War 3:  Earth is in danger of being destroyed by the Slitheen.  When I realized this would be a 2-parter, I thought ""Oh no!  An even worse episode awaits me.""  But big surprise, this episode starts off strong & stays that way.  Not 100% perfect (Jackie Tyler annoyed me), but pretty darn close.  A6.  Dalek:  The Doctor & Rose find themselves near Salt Lake City, Utah in 2012 in an underground bunker owned by a rich collector of alien artifacts after the TARDIS is drawn off course by a signal.  The signal turns out to come from the last surviving Dalek.  This is the first perfect episode of the season.  A+7.  The Long Game:  The Doctor, Rose, and their new companion Adam travel to the year 200,000 and land on the space station Satellite 5, which controls journalism.  The Doctor finds out that ever since the satellite began broadcasting, something has held the human race's attitude and technology back, so he investigates.  I won't say anymore, because it's a great episode.  A8. Father's Day:  The Doctor takes Rose back in time to see her father before he died, but she saves his life, and the change in history could spell doom for everyone.  This is a fantastic episode.  My personal favorite of the season.  A+9.-10. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: I'm just going to combine both of these since my opinion of the is the same.  Chasing a metal cylinder marked as ""dangerous"" through the Time Vortex, & they land during the Blitz in World War II.  There, they face a creepy child wearing a gas mask & meet Captain Jack Harkness, a pansexual human from the 51st century.  I'm going to be honest: I hate Captain Jack.  But that's the only bad thing I have to say about this story.  A11.  Boom Town:  The Doctor, Rose, and Jack visit Cardiff to refuel the TARDIS at the rift, and Mickey meets them there. They discover that the Slitheen impersonating Margaret Blaine is now the mayor of Cardiff and capture her, suspicious of what she has done. The Doctor sees that she has created a nuclear power plant designed to open the rift and destroy Earth, and a device she would use to flee.  Rose was at her worst here, but apart from that it's good.  B+12.-13.  The Doctor, Jack & Rose wake up with amnesia on various reality television & game shows.  The Doctor & Jack escape & the Doctor realizes he's back on Satellite 5, 100 years later.  And an old enemy is waiting in the shadows to attack.  I have to admit, although 9'll never be my favorite Doctor, this is the perfect ending to the season.  A+So overall I'm satisfied with the season, but I'm not sad he was only the Doctor for one season.  David Tennant would quickly prove to be much better.  But as for where I'd rank 9, I'm not sure.  I know who my least favorite Doctor is (William Hartnell), & you know my top 3 Doctors.  My next 3 would be Jon Pertwee, Sylvester McCoy & Peter Davison, in that order.  Then it would be Patrick Troughton,  Colin Baker, & Christopher Eccleston, but I don't know what order.  I'll have to see more of 2 & 6 to find out.  I also have yet to see Paul McGann, so who knows what my ranking will be like when he comes in."	5.0	Doctor Who is back!  But not necessarily better.	2013-04-14	0	0	0

Sure, there is a certain element of awkward props and some of the acting is suspect. Some of the stories don't start out solidly, but by the end the genius is revealed.

Not sure whether it was that Eccleston disliked the people he worked with, or if that version of the Doctor was written to be a jerk, but Eccelston sometimes gets so dislikable it's jarring.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1CIZ90FFOZTLM	phantomfan	For fans of the original Doctor Who, rest assured - this is still the Doctor we know and love. Here are but a few things you will recognize:1. The Doctor can't seem to control the TARDIS.2. The Doctor takes offense at the suggestion that he can't control the TARDIS.3. The people from UNIT are useless.4. An enemy uses the Doctor's emotions against him.5. The Doctor thinks a companion is dead, and it's his fault.6. A companion thinks the Doctor is dead, and it's her fault.7. The Doctor is strapped to a table and tortured.8. Something pulls the TARDIS off course - not that it was going where it was supposed to, anyway.9. The Doctor makes vague passing references to famous events of the past, as if he's been there.10. The Doctor refuses to use violence.11. The Doctor becomes violent.12. The Doctor seems amused by things that aren't particularly amusing.13. The Doctor boasts of being able to go anywhere in space and time, but somehow always ends up on or around the earth.14. The Doctor is always the only person who can come up with a solution to save the day.15. The Doctor never changes clothes, never showers, and never needs a shave.16. The sonic screwdriver.17. Autons.Of course, there are some things that will appear new and baffling to fans of the original series. For example:1. The TARDIS lands on earth, but not in England. (Well, okay, this did happen once or twice in the original, but only the staunchest fans will remember it.)2. A Dalek that's actually scary. For a few moments, it's terrifying.3. Innuendo. Boy, was that a no-no way back when.4. A companion who actually has a home to go to.5. CGI.6. Slitheen. (Personally, I could pass. Give me big lumbering Ice Warriors or fuzzy Yeti any day. Or better yet, giant bugs made of bubble wrap.)So who's the real Who?Only you can decide.For my money, I love them both!	5.0	Old vs new - who's who?	2006-08-21	13	9	4

I recently was asked to rate the finales on each series 1-8 and I found that this was the best finale of any year. Considering I am a huge fan of David Tennant, that is saying something. Eccleston gives us a Doctor who straddles the old and new in Doctor Who. He is a very mysterious and mercurial figure and, yet, he has an emotional attachment to Rose. This was a new concept outside of fandom and the books at the time of this series, and it broke radical and, still relevant ground. Everyone involved in this first series is responsible for introducing Doctor Who to a whole new generation. If it hadn't been so very good, it never would have continued. So, if you've been waiting to see what Doctor Who is all about...grab this series, rather than just tuning in to the latest episode. But I will warn you, that once you fall in love with Nine and Rose in S1, it will be hard to move on to anyone else as Doctor or Companion.	5.0	Nine and Rose and Daleks	2013-07-18	0	0	0

His version of the Doctor is complex, dark, but still fun to watch. I love that he focused his performance for CHILDREN (what does that say about me!!).  I think this season is a good bridge between the campiness of the older Who to the new slicker (and well funded) look of the later Doctors. Rose and Captain Jack are great companions, each in their own ways highlighting and parrying the Doctor's many personality traits. Often fans shun this season, but I believe Eccleston lays the foundation for Tennant and Smith's portrayals.	4.0	This is how you reboot a TV series!	2014-05-21	0	0	0

I was afraid it wouldn't be the same - the revival of ""Battlestar Galactica"" being a prime example. When it finally came to the Sci-Fi Channel in 2006, I watched the first episode, ""Rose"", with excitement and trepidation.It had enemies from the 'old' show. It had a new Doctor. It introduced the concept of the Doctor's companion keeping in touch with her family while travelling with the Doctor. And it made me fall in love with 'Doctor Who' all over again.While the new series has divided fans and earned new ones, I definitely recommend this collection to anyone who wants to get re-acquianted with the Doctor."	5.0	He's Back, And It's About Time!	2007-02-11	1	1	0

Something about it seemed a little too corny to me.However, I decided to check out the first season because it was free with my Amazon Prime membership.OMG IT WAS SO GOOD.The writing stayed true and consistent to the original - it wasn't a reboot at all, it was a continuation.  Immediately, we empathize with Rose Tyler and her mundane and rather ordinary existence.  She couldn't be some rich glamour queen or else we'd never be able to understand the Doctor through a commoner's eyes.  I also enjoyed that we could see the multiculturalism of London through her relationship.I won't give anything away when it comes to the story line, but there are some very interesting concepts that the first season deals with, including the return of some old foes.I very much recommend Season 1 to anyone who loves good storytelling, history, science fiction, and fantasy.	5.0	Late to the party	2013-03-29	0	0	0

Though I think the raw, high-spirited jungle girl Leela is still the best companion ever in my opinion and the only one whose eyes changed color. With Tegan the stewardess running a close second). What a pleasure to have another totally up-to-date incarnation of Dr Who to fascinate whole new generations of ""Whoovians"". Now we'll see Lexus', Infinitys, BMWs, Hummers, and Corvettes with stickers that say ""I Brake For Daleks"" and ""My TARDIS"". LOL. After years of watching the doctors reincarnate into new bodies, this is my first Dr Who DVD (though I own many books) and it's excellent. I bought it mainly for the behind the scenes extras and it is chock full of extras of all types.Newer CGI and the use of primary colors (a very reddish cast to the scenes at times) gives the show a whole new look, although the aliens and monsters can still be pretty 'cheesy', but we expect that. (BTW, did Mickey call Captain Jack ""cheesy""? LOL)With Dr Who, you MUST use your imagination alot. Love the upgraded 'Sonic Screw Driver'. But I hate the interior of the TARDIS, it looks too much like that one from the Fox TV 'Dr Who movie' in the 90's, which totally sucked!! But it's a minor complaint. Not every story works either, ""Aliens of London"", ""WW Three"", & ""Boomtown"" missed the mark somewhat, but the acting was still a hoot and there is no danger of ever turning off a Dr Who show!! Who knows what we might miss. ""I Do Brake For Daleks"" the darkest force in the universe, next to the Sontarans, of course. No Borg, Sith Lord, or Species 8472 would mess with the Daleks !! ""Exterminate !"" SIX HUGE Stars for The New Doctor Who!!"	5.0	"THE NEW 2005 ""WHO"" IS VERY COOL AND ROSE TYLER IS A WINNER."	2006-04-20	7	7	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AT79BAVA063DG	ReadNReVu	"In the interests of full disclosure, this is written from the perspective of someone who has never watched any of the earlier Doctor Who series.The Good:Enjoyed the Doctor immensely--a shame that the actor did not return for the second season. At times when he would try to be funny he reminded me of the Bert Spooner character from AYBS? (same tone of voice and wide smile). The episode with the Autons, the off-Earth episodes, the WWII shows and The Unquiet Dead. The Captain Jack Harkness character.The Bad:Too many retreads/revisits--are the writers channeling the ghost of Irwin Allen here to save money?  The Slitheen looked like they were a cross between Barney and the Teletubbies.... and we had to see them TWICE!Whomever did John Barrowman's (Harkness) hair in this series needs to get a clue and do his hair in future shows as in the Stephen Sondheim ""Putting it Together"" DVD (great DVD for Barrowman fans, by the way). The combed back look does absolutely nothing for him.The Rose Tyler backstory--good grief!  Would you, with her backstory, keep coming back to see Mum and ""sort-of"" boyfriend (seemed more like a ""friends with benefits"" situation than a true relationship) when you could be off time-tripping? NO WAY! And the way she was dressed was not flattering to her at all, made her look rather overweight, in fact.  Just about all of the Earth scenes with Mum and boyfriend are worth watching perhaps once, but upon repeat viewing, you won't miss much fast forwarding through them (no offense to the actors, they had to work with the scripts they had).The price (even Amazon's current one).  This is maybe worth $25-$30 at most, especially if, like me, you really enjoyed only half the episodes."	3.0	Interesting, but could be better	2006-10-05	19	9	10

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	I must admit I'm somewhat new to Doctor Who. I haven't seen an episode of the classic series, and I hadn't followed this show when it premiered, but the amount of friends I have that are Doctor Who fans is immaculate, and the first six seasons of the new show were on Netflix, so I decided I'd start watching the series just to see how it is... and immediately off the bat, I was hooked. As of writing I'm on the third series, and thenshow really is that addictive.It's probably obvious what the show is about now: an alien known as The Doctor takes companions with him and travels the world, dimensions, AND time with his spaceship disguised as a police call box named the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension In Space). Every episode is something new, but from time to old enemies, such as the Daleks, show up. Which is what is really exciting about he show; it's fresh and every episode has you excited to watch what adventure will come up now.The performances are absolutely excellent. In this season, Christopher Eccleston is fantastic and very quirky, very flamboyant as the Doctor. He has a charming personality, and he Makes the season exiting. Billie Piper as the sexy Rose Tyler is awesome too, and really fits into the role, and the acting from her mother and Noel Clarke as her boyfriend Mickey are great too. And the story of each episode is fun, twisty, keeps you hooked throughout. The only drawback is the obviously low budget, but then again, that's just a minor gripe, and is overpowered by the excellent storytelling and great performances.Well, I now officially want my own sonic screwdriver and TARDIS!	5.0	The start of something great	2013-01-17	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1RDQPPRXMKBHD	Reviewer	"There are plenty of reviews here.  I want to just make some comments which hopefully will be helpful.  I am a Doctor Who fan of old, I have nearly all the episodes (that are avaiable) from the first 6 Doctors.  So here are some comparisons from the old series.1.  I don't like the new Tardis.  It's too dark, it's not what the old show had.2.  This is high-tech Doctor Who.  This isn't your old fake monsters and cheesy sets.  BBC puts some money into this series.3.  The ""continuity"" from earlier Doctors is not good.  Yes, there are episodes on the Nestenes and Daleks, but the ""link"" with the older Doctors needs to be improved.4.  Almost every episode in this series takes place on earth.  Please.  Let's go somewhere else, ok?5.  Christopher Eccleston made a good Doctor.  I was pleased with the job he did.  I hated to see him go.  Billie Piper is fine as an assistant, nothing special.6.  This is a new age Doctor, not just a children's show any more.  A tad bit of romance and something for everyone, including queers, since in the last episode there was a man-man kiss.  Quite revolting, actually, but it didn't ruin the whole series.7.  Bottom line, if you're a Doctor Who fan from way back and haven't gottent this one yet, go ahead and get it.  It needs some improvement, but it's worth the money"	4.0	This is not the old Doctor Who	2006-10-29	10	3	7

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1DVLQ54AJVY2U	"R. Hunter ""rozzychan"""	"If you are a fan of the old Doctor Who series for kids you may be surprised by the new series which is anything but kid stuff. Some of the episodes are now too scary for young children. Although Doctor Who always had a high body count, the deaths are made to seem more poigniant and real by artful cinematography and a full emotional score. The vastly-improved special effects and the increased quality of acting in this series reduces the camp elements making the dangers feel more real.The Doctor as played by Christopher Eccelson is much darker and much slicker than previous incarnations. Having survived the ""Time War"" which is said to have destroyed both the Dalek race and the Time Lords, the doctor appears shell-shocked. He is full of guilt for his part in the extermination of his own race. This makes him both angry and vulnerable. His guilt over being the last surviver of his race makes him hesitant in some situations, and vicious in others. He is especially determined in his desire for all remaining Daleks to be destroyed.The doctor's guilt and vulnerability also make him susceptable to romantic attachments , and he becomes romantically involved with his companion Rose. This makes him extremely sensitive to situations that put Rose in danger.In one situation where Rose is threatened he yells out, ""I'm gonna wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky!""A phrase that it is difficult to imagine any previous Doctor saying. This Doctor is much more emotionally involved in the world around him, a situation hightened by the fact that he has no safety net. There are no other time lords around to fix his mistakes. The Doctor must constantly face the consequences of his actions, from getting slapped by Rose's mother for stealing her girl away, to observing the degradation of a world that he thought he had set right.This series is also more sexually suggestive than previous series. Much of this is found in the character of Captain Jack, a former time cop gone freelance implied to be bisexual. This character also appears nude in one episode although nothing is shown.Although some episodes may be too intense for children, the series is too good for older science fiction fans to discount.The great special effects, beautiful score, and incredible acting make it worth seeing. If you are already a Doctor Who fan. You should see this series, because of it's different take on the doctor. The box set includes DVD commentary on all episodes, and several hours of special features. Fast-paced and intense, this series is a good buy."	5.0	A Doctor with all of the safetys turned off. - Spoilers	2006-07-12	5	4	1

I first began watching the clasic DW series in 1983, and I will admit I was rather skeptical about the prospects of bringing DW back as a regular series.  Could it possibly be as good as the original?  The fact of the matter is that Executive Producer/Head Writer Russell T. Davies and his cast and crew have put together an excellent TV program which retains many classic elements of Doctor Who, with some updating to bring the show into the twenty-first century.  Christopher Eccleston (Gone in 60 Seconds) makes an excellent Doctor, combining the wit and charm of Tom Baker with the vulnerability of Peter Davison's Doctor.  And Billie Piper is an absolute delight as Rose Tyler, the Doctor's new traveling companion.  Camille Coduri is also very good as Jackie Tyler, Rose's mom, as is Noel Clarke as Mickey, Rose's boyfriend.  My favorite episode so far has been ""Rose,"" the first episode.  It was great to see the return of the Autons and the Nestene Intelligence.  And I am looking ever forward to the return of the Daleks later in the season as well.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3559I6Q7RCPP3	"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll"""	The first season of the new Doctor Who is everything a Doctor Who fan could ever hope for.  Never has a series so lived up to its potential as these new episodes have done.  Right from the get-go the producers and respective episode directors have gone for a newer, gleaming, edgier look--and yet the dialogue and some recurring villains from the doctor's past keep the series simultaneously grounded in that past Doctor Who most of us grew up with, especially those of who were us weaned on the Baker and Pertwee years.  Each episode builds on itself as well.  Although Russell Davies was the primary genius behind the resurrection of Who, a good portion of the credit must also go to the onscreen chemistry of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper.  Eccleston will grow on you so quickly that it will be all the more painful to see him depart by the end of the season.  The Rose character is a wonderful continuation from Ace, the last onscreen companion we saw (unless you are counting the TV movie that most people have pretty much disowned) the doctor with.  She is both tough and vulnerable, but on way many more levels.  These episodes are all beautifully written-watch for Rose's short speech in The End of the World episode right after the earth explodes.  The Unquiet Dead brings us a world weary Charles Dickens-our first glimpse of him just before he has to face another Christmas audience is a hoot.  The Dalek episode is stunning: there isn't much action, but the Moby Dick take on the Doctor and just about all the dialogue is positively electric, especially when the Dalek nonchalantly remarks how the Doctor would have made a good Dalek.  My personal favorite episodes are the two-part story arc of Empty Child and The Doctor Dances.  One reason is that we get introduced to Capt. Jack Harkness (supremely played by John Barryman), the most over the top and larger than life sidekick we'll probably ever get to see with the Doctor.  The other is the reason for the title of the second part--not going to tell!  When the Doctor does dance, it is perhaps the defining moment of the whole series for the whole of the 40+ years it has run.  Trust me, it's that perfect.  The Long Game is probably the creepiest episode in the series.  Those of you who saw the movie, Shaun of the Dead will see a familiar face in Simon Pegg.  Father's Day tweaks the familiar why-time-shouldn't-be-tampered-with-and-changed angle.  Boom Town has an interesting twist-the villain gets caught, but it is the Doctor who has to dispatch the justice.  Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways bring the first season to a close by reintroducing an old enemy and a seemingly inescapable outcome.  Bad Wolf is a keen parody of the reality tv/survivor shows that have come to dominate the ratings.  Parting is almost mystical in its resolution.  Eccleston gets a nice sendoff.  The DVD extras almost defy description.  There are commentaries for all the episodes and interviews with all the major stars as well as featurettes on everything from special effects to location choices.  Truly the future has never looked so golden--and you will see when you crack open the second season!	5.0	Doctor Who enters a new golden age!	2007-11-16	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"I was a huge fan of the old Doctor Who. For years I was an obsessive viewer of the series on WTTW, the local PBS station here in Chicago, coming the love the show through TomBaker's Fourth Doctor.  Over the years they showed all the rest of John Pertwee's Third Doctor, as well as all of Tom Baker's successors.  I loved the hokey nature of the show, the silly special effects, the long array of creepy villains, and the various weird worlds that they explored.  But for some reason when Russell T. Davies relit the series in 2005, I deliberately avoided it.  I've talked to others who were fans of the old series, and many of them have also avoided seeing the new shows.  I really can't say why I avoided watching the show, but eventually I realized that it was the only SF series of the past decade that I hadn't seen, along with its spin off TORCHWOOD.So for some reason I decided to give the new series a try.  Each year after the regular TV season has ended, I always try to watch several TV series that I had previously missed.  My first show this summer was DEADWOOD (loved it!) and my next project was to watch all of DOCTOR WHO and TORCHWOOD.  And I've really loved them!I instantly loved the combo of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper as the Doctor and Rose Tyler.  I have only one complaint about Season One and that is that it was the only one that Eccleson did.  I really came to love David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, but I wish that Eccleston had done an additional season or two.  Viewing Season One of the new Doctor Who in contrast with all of the other seasons, there is no question that it represented a massive improvement in the sereis in virtually every way.  There was an absolutely stunning improvement in special effects.  The sets were vastly better and the series engaged in far more location shooting than before.  The show was better acted, better written, better designed, and better photographed.  But as good as Eccleston was as the Doctor, I think the writing sharpened in future seasons.  Season One had no individual episodes as spectacular as the episodes of later seasons such as ""Blink"" and ""Midnight.""But if you are like me, a fan of the old Doctor Who who has been avoiding the new series, I encourage you to give this new one a try.  I've enjoyed the first four seasons enormously (I'm now watching the Matt Smith episodes and have to confess that I'm not loving them, but I'm going to give him a good try).  The show is absolutely a worthy successor to the longest running SF series in the history of TV."	5.0	Triumphant return of the Doctor	2010-06-19	4	4	0

Needless to say now have watched 80 some episodes. I was raised on Star Trek from its beginning but have to say Dr Who is light years ahead of Star Trek. The changing of the cast and the story lines are pure genius. The acting is incredible. If you are a si-fi fan this is a must see but start with the first episode and also look for past Christmas specials that are not included.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AMKFQKTNW8ESX	"Robin Bland ""WhoFan"""	"I ordered these DVDs from the UK last year and have watched the entire season (13 episodes) straight through 15+ times.  The writing, the acting, and the special effects are all top notch - equal to anything we're seeing here on SciFi (Batllestar Galactica, Stargate SG-1, etc).If you ever watched the old series - even if you didn't like it - this show is worth it.  It picks up where the original series and TV movie left off.  Christopher Eccleston (28 Days Later) plays the ninth Doctor and if anyone can be said to ""chew up the scenery"" it is him.  He has boundless energy and an infectious, if somewhat mischievous, smile.The new companion is Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and she is not like any companion from the old series.  The closest comparison you could make would be to Sarah Jane Smith from the late seventies.  However, Rose has more depth and a more participatory role in the series.  No longer do the Doctor's companions simply stand there and scream.Later stories introduce other, equally compelling, companions like Captain Jack Harkness.  With a few exceptions all of the characters in the series are fleshed out and have solid motivations.The stories are clever and some are downright gripping.  All of the old series mythos are there (Time Lords, Daleks, the TARDIS, the sonic screwdriver, etc).  There are also quite a few new twists and there are a couple of moments in the 13 epsiodes where long-time fans will feel their jaws drop.  I smiled uncontrollably through all of them the first time I saw them.At the price Amazon is asking this is a steal (I paid twice as much to get them from the UK).

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AOPKC0MNK7ZPT	Roger Williams	"From a long-time Trekkie: The new series of Doctor Who takes it to a world that Doctor Who has never visited before: incredible special effects! The effects are movie-class and the ""steam punk"" effects that they used on the inside of the new TARDIS is right on target. The best part of all is that none of this has compromised any of the writing.. it is all first class by incredible writers. The production is grest, the actors are great, the stories are great, the music is great and the effects are great. There's not really anything else to ask for in a sci-fi show.As a long time Trekkie, I can say that this show easily fills the bill while there are no Treks on the air. It is witty, intelligent, romantic, action-filled and funny all at once. I was leary the first time I watched an episode of this series because I was never a fan of the old Doctor Who because of the cheap effects and low production values.. but those days are gone and Doctor Who has become a first-class sci-fi show (which we so badly need). Don't let any past preconceptions of the show stop you from watching this.. you won't regret it.The percentage of good shows that they produce (verses ""bad"" shows) is MUCH higher that NextGen. I loved NextGen, but they had some real dog episodes (Royale, anyone?). I can honestly say that, in the six seasons that Doctor Who has been back on, there has not been one episode that I simply did not like. Some are better than others, but they're all good. Rewatchability is extremely high.. there is so much to see in each episode.If you are a Trek fan, I definately think you'll like this. The doctor get's to play the Spock/Data roll, always commenting on human society from a third person point-of-view. There is that perfect mix of drama, action, humor and romance to make it play very much like a Trek ep.. although there tends to be a bit more humor than in Trek. There are some lessons (usually about humanity.. go figure), but none that are shoved in your face.. think NextGen vs TOS. There is ofter an enterage of people who make up the cast and the plots can be quite engaging. It is a serial, with each week depending on the previous (like Voyager and Enterprise). It IS interesting going from the beautiful white Enterprise to a little blue box, but I simply can't picture a Trekkie not liking this show.The biggest bonus of the DVD is the Confidentials. They are like documentries about each episode that include interviews with cast and crew.. many of the interviews quite candid. One of the biggest thing about the Confidentals is how surprised you'll be at the actual number of special effects that are in the show.. so many of them are so good that they go unnoticed.Pick this one up, watch it on streaming.. do whatever it takes. Once you start watching, you'll be hooked."	5.0	A must have for ANY sci-fi fan (especially Trekkies)	2012-08-08	1	1	0

I have watched every episode of every season (1-7) multiple times and still catch such clever (and so often hilarious) moments in the Dr.'s lines.  I have loved every regeneration of the Dr. and got teary eyed when each one was replaced.  I just have to say, what an amazing vehicle for unlimited fantasy the Dr. Who idea is!  I also deeply appreciate that we aren't jerked out of the fun and fantasy by explicit sexual material.  I think that is what makes Dr. Who (at least so far and I hope it continues) a program that leaves us all (from child to adult) with so much to be intrigued by and left to imagine.	5.0	What a Very Stodgy Person Thinks of Dr. Who	2014-07-05	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"It's not a retcon, or a reimagination, or a franchise revitalization, or any of the franchise buzzowords that sci-fi franchise fanboys tinker with - instead, it's a new ""Dr. Who"" that captures the spirit of the original while knowing when to go its own way.  Unlike the original show, structured around serials of 4-6 episodes, the new show has whole hour-long episodes arranged in loose arcs.  Some of the basic story ideas are unoriginal, or too thin to otherwise work, but nifty scripts and an unspeakably irresistable chemistry between Christopher Eccleston & Billie Piper provide more than enough entertainment to punch a whole through the space-time continuum.  The beauty of the show is that it's pefect for old-school Whovians and those who never knew what the show was about.  The scripts rely on deft dialog to establish the premise of the show - and not the leaden expository narrative that you'd get on any of the Trek slin-offs - creating a backstory far richer than that other franchise could have boldly gone forward to imagine.In the first series, we meet the new Doctor (there are signs that this is a new regeneration) as he tours 21st century London; we also meet Rose Tyler, a working class girl who unknowingly stumbles upon an alien menace bent on world conquest.  Over the course of the first season, the Doctor will face off against new breeds of aliens and other way-out creatures in Earth present & past, with jaunts to far off worlds.  The episodes embody comedy and drama in the right measure - they compliment the original series without condescending to it; besides the main characters, the scripts work up guest characters - villains and heroes: from Charles Dickens to the Prime Minister of 21st Century England; From the London Blitz to the end of the World; from enemies we've never seen before to the appearance of...well, Whovians can figure it from there.  The show excels mostly because you never know where it's going, so it's always a surprise."	5.0	Nice to meet  you, now run for your life!!!	2006-06-26	6	5	1

The first episode is a little goofy. I'm rewatching the seasons now and I think this season is a very strong on. Be warned, though, Eccelston only does one season and for me, I was very fond of him so it took a little time to warm up to the next Doctor.That's always an issue on this show--whoever the new Doctor or companion is, you likely won't care for them at first. (Only once has a companion been replaced and I felt it was high time and liked the replacement immediately.) Stick with it, though, the writing is so good, you'll end up loving them.	4.0	Who's Better	2013-12-13	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2OE49B95NF3KI	"Roy ""Roy"""	Five over-priced DVDs worthy of five simple words each:Stupid.  Inane.  Vapid.  Pabulum.  Juvenile.While this show clearly has its throng of easily-entertained thralls, someone needs to comment on the sheer price of this boxed-set for any non-fan who may accidentally purchase this juvenile collection of what can only marginally be called sci-fi.  Save your money is my advice.Whatever whimsical qualities this television show may have once evoked are long gone, and lost in a morass of stilted dialogue, narrow-minded scripts and excessive jokes about flatulence.  To be fair, it remains true to its predecessor by keeping the one thing that kept this show from every being truly popular in the U.S. - cheesy rubber monsters.  This re-imagined series of Doctor Who is populated by obvious rubber monsters.  The first episode features living plastic (rubber) monsters, the second episode is a bevy of rubber monsters.  A veritable cornucopia of them - - a spitting blue one, a giant rubber head and even a flat one made of rubber.  Ridiculous flatulent rubber ones feature in the fourth and fifth episodes.  What is the British fascination with spit and flatulence?  It certainly doesn't make for entertaining sc-fi.  It's remedial.The remaining episodes each become more and more ludicrous.  For a ship that allegedly can go anywhere in the galaxy, it never does.  Three and a half episodes take place in outer space.  Not even on another planet, but on the exact same space station.  Clearly the BBC is reticent to invest in sets for this abysmal re-imagination.  Visit some alien planets like the other high budget sci-fi shows.The companion looks like she'd rather be anywhere than acting in this series.  The new Doctor himself seems bipolar most of the time, flinging emotionally from giddiness to disturbed.  And what happened to the outrageous costume?  That new look just didn't work for me.  Doctor Who will always be rubber monsters and clown costumes.With all the fart jokes and spitting, this DVD Box Set will appeal to the nine-year-olds across the country.If you are not aware of this show, move along.  There are better DVD's out there worthy of nearly $75.00  AVOID.	1.0	Expensive British Triteness	2006-08-09	166	13	153

When I finally did, I began with Season 1, continued through all the newer seasons, then returned to watch the classic Who seasons.  After now having watched every episode available anywhere of all 11 Doctors, I believe this season is still the best option for anyone that has never seen Doctor Who but is interested in beginning their journey through time and space.  Season One takes the time to introduce you to the concepts of who The Doctor is, the Doctor Who universe, and does so in a modern television format.

Even though the special effects can look cheesy at times, the stories, the acting and the production value are really good.  Christopher Eccleston brought seriousness to the Doctor and it is such a shame he was only in one season.  Billie Piper also was really good.

And I guess last year's incarnation really had me surprised. I really thought they were going to mess this one up royally like the last attempt with a bad two hour teevee film that stunk, but it would seem like they are on the right track now. The first season seemed upbeat and current, no campy special effects and really no emphasis on special effects but great to decent stories ripe with dry British humor. I hope the Scifi Channel gets with the program and shows the second season with a new Doctor.

I broke due to peer pressure and fell in love with every minute of it. The characters and storyline are absolutely fantastic. ;-) If you honestly don't think you'd like it, you will. It hard to explain but it is heartbreak, and wonder, love, loneliness, being the most important thing ever and yet still so small, fear, excitement, that little piece of child in us ALL. You fall in love with EVERY character, big or small. It's something to take as a role-model. To be that one person in a extraordinary large world. You start to believe it's real. And maybe it is.

I know Christopher Eccleston was the Doctor for only one season, but I'm sorry to see him go.  But I have many more Doctors with whom to catch up.  I knew John Barrowman from a very short-lived soapy US TV series called ""Central Park West,"" and I've since discovered he's a great singer too.  But I'm glad to see him now as he's first introduced in Doctor Who (I'm aware of ""Torchwood"" but have never watched it.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AJ7SBFCIXPJM1	"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson"""	"Russell T. Davies had a problem in 2004.  His problem was how to restart Doctor Who, the great British science fiction television series that had died a slow death in the 1980s, primarily due to shoddy writing and stale characterizations.Then he remembered the basic rule of good-to-great science fiction.  It isn't the situations...it's the characters.  We learned this when Ronald D. Moore and David Eick reworked Battlestar Galactica.To that end, I felt that RTD really treated the four seasons he ran production more as a 52-episode story that was told in four chapters.  This First Series Set plays more as a laying of the baseline for the 21st-Century Time Lord and those around him.  Davies seems willing to lay more of the Doctor's emotions out.  There is the irreverence and stream of thought that has usually played through the character's recent history, but Davies--through Christopher Eccelston's interpretation--starts laying the Doctor bare at times.  The Ninth Doctor doesn't wear the scarf of Tom Baker, the celery boutonniere of Peter Davidson, or the straw hat of Sylvester McCoy.  Davies starts this with a subtle reminder that, in spite of his name, what The Doctor is...is a warrior.  Whether considered a soldier or superhero, Eccelston's Doctor is a black-wearing, short-haired survivor of a conflict that wiped out his planet.  He can be severe, angry, feral and snappish all in a matter of moments.  He also hurts--he's alone.This is where Davies' thought process begins to percolate around the character.  He starts in this season to introduce ""The Family of Time/Children of Time"" concept--his Companions , the cohorts who aid and support (sometimes unwillingly), and a world that goes beyond his travels in the TARDIS (Which absolutely could NEVER change from its 1950's Police Box camouflage).  In many ways it is a broader vision than what we had in the first run, and opens up new avenues for the Doctor's world.  This allows Billie Piper's Rose Tyler--the Family of Time's First Lady--to be the soul and the conscience the Doctor so desperately needs.  Piper is allowed to give a strength to Rose that we haven't seen in the Companion's roles before (Or at least since Sarah Jane Smith), and all the while look absolutely adorable.  She saves the Doctor's life twice within the first six episodes--in the premiere/return episode ""Rose"" and at the conclusion of the ""Aliens In London/World War III"" storyline.  In ""Dalek"", Rose actually challenges the Doctor AND the infamous robot enemy in a way no Companion had.If Rose is the Family of Time's First Lady, Camille Courdi's Jackie Tyler is the Queen Mother--her first meeting with the Doctor is a wonderfully hilarious moment of attempted seduction crushed--and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith is the reluctant entrant.  Having been the boyfriend of Rose when she met the Doctor, Mickey is the one who study's the Doctor's history and realizes the danger of being around him--yet, he finds himself working with the Doctor; even saving the world from itself in ""World War III"".But the character that knocks it out of the park in Series 1 is John Barrowman's Jack Harkness.  Introduced in ""The Empty Child"", Harkness is the knight errant of the Family--born in the 51st century, Jack would seemingly prefer being a thief to his moments of heroism...that is, if he could get his mind off of getting some.  With anyone.  Or anything.  The explanation of Jack--in the 51st century, the former Time Agent comes from a time where the term ""omnisexual"" is used.  That explains Jack, short of using the term ""male ho"".While expanding the base of the people surrounding the Doctor, RTD also expands the physical world of the Doctor.  In ""The Unquiet Dead"", the Doctor and Rose travel back to 1869 and meet Charles Dickens in Cardiff, Wales.  Finding themselves in an investigation of corpses reanimating at a funeral home, the Doctor discovers the funeral home sits on a time/space rift that is capable of allowing extraterrestrials to move into this world and dimension.  That rift becomes a part of the Doctor's universe about 145 years later...but that's for another review.It is the finish to the season--the two-parter ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting Of the Ways""--that set the transition from Eccelston to David Tennant, and the course for Captain Jack...but also the level of strength and devotion to The Doctor that Rose shows; a part of the four-part storyline that runs deep.This first chapter of Doctor Who's return is a fascinating watch, made all the more fascinating by the first season being Eccelston's only season as The Doctor.  Among the special features is Eccelston's BBC interview before the premier episode was shown in England, an odd moment because one realizes that Chris knows he's completed his run--leading to his mentioning of regeneration.All in all, the return of Doctor Who to television has been a wonderful view--it hasn't been reimaged as severely (Though to its benefit) the way that Battlestar Galactica was, but it comes off as a diamond long-buried, found and--thanks to Russell T. Davies--well polished...and well done.Season/Series 1--highly recommended."	5.0	Doctor Who Series I--Welcome Back, Old Friend...	2009-07-09	2	2	0

For those new to the series, it shows you an ""everyperson"" character to relate to who isn't super, rich or socially admired but just a working-class gal with a job in a shop who experiences something weird and meets a mysterious man in the process.As for The Doctor himself, Christopher Eccleston gives us a battle-weary traveller who is the ""only"" survivor of the great Time War. We also find he detests violence, in no small part because of his capacity for it if he so chooses to let that side of him loose, and has a fondness for the Earth and its people, especially the English. ;-).It's a great show for people of any age and offers fun, laughter, adventure and sadness alike throughout it's run. David Tennant and Matt Smith are both great in their ways following Eccleston's portrayal but for anyone just discovering teh show this is where I suggest they start."	5.0	The Doctor, just the Doctor	2012-11-29	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2COCCOQYFIL0X	Sdalbright72	The Ninth Doctor was brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Eccleston. Billie Piper in the role of Rose, the Doctor's companion, is a bit of genius casting. The pair had amazing chemistry on-screen and were fun to watch. It was easy to get carried along as The Doctor and Rose fell headlong into one spot of trouble after another. Admittedly, the make-up, effects, and bad guys are cheesy/kitschy. But that is a large part of the charm. It's new, but well known at the same time. I love it.	5.0	I adore Doctor Who	2013-08-21	0	0	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1VEZ4ZUG8TNH2	SD	The DVDs themselves are packed full of great special features but the real joy comes of course from the episodes themselves. Series 1 of 'New' Doctor Who with Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper is a genuine delight. The first series definitely has it's downsides; not the best special effects but they're still getting their footing because by Series 2 they've worked out all the kinks. Don't let that stop you PLEASE because the real heart of it, the acting and the writing is honestly so compelling you can't stop watching. I've been a genre fan my entire life; sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comic books, manga- I *love* monster make up and visual effects, but none of that matters in the face of truly well rounded storyline and phenomenal chemistry between co-stars.This is hands down my favorite 'season' and I'll always recommend it!	5.0	Take me back!	2013-08-20	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ADUJIQUN53OCJ	Seirra Poirier	Like many others this was my first introduction to the Doctor, his T.A.R.D.I.S, and the Whoniverse. Christopher Eccleston really charmed me from the moment he stepped into camera view. Having no Doctor Who background or even an awareness this was a reboot of a series that ran for many many years I stumbled into what is now my favorite show in television history and in all likeliness will never be replaced. I've never witnessed anything so spectacular, creatively explored, and brilliantly written with such an overwhelmingly talented cast. Doctor Who raised the bar and changed my TV watching experience irrevocably!For the last couple of years I've wanted to own season 1 of Doctor Who and BBC America finally made this possible - and I don't think I could be any more happier with this product. It's absolutely FANTASTIC, it really is. I've watched this DVD set many times over and plan on watching it many more. This series includes a lot of cool features like Doctor Who Confidential. Confidential is footage shot from behind the scenes that show the making of each individual episode and has a sit-down with the actors who talk about their characters, the sets, makeup, and the Doctor Who story itself. It's really interesting to see where and how they film the show. They also let you peek at the creative process behind making the special effects and even let you see some of the alien/monster makeup application. Some bonus material included are actor interviews and commentary with hours of exciting features not seen elsewhere! It's such a delight to see the behind-the-scenes with Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper - they are every bit exciting off-screen as they are on-screen!! That alone should be worth making this purchase easy because you completely get your money's worth!If you're looking for the best that television has to offer look no further because Doctor Who is it! The stories are compelling and complex yet simple enough to understand and thoroughly enjoyable. There's nonstop action, aliens, otherworldly creatures, fantastical worlds, top-notch acting, crazy plot twists, not-to-mention the British wit that will have you laughing out loud at the very cleverness that's presented. Spot-on EVERYTHING! This rebooted series is the beginning to what is one of the best shows on TV, assuredly you won't be disappointed. You'll immediately want to watch the following series as they only get better and better, and that's the biggest understatement. DO NOT skip the Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston because he's incredible and integral to the series as a whole. His portrayal of the Doctor is amazing and his adventures with Rose are the start of a bond unbroken by time and you'll fall in love with them both. Whovians if you don't own this series already then what are you waiting for?! & If you're new it's never too late to become a fan, and trust me upon watching this season you will be!	5.0	Absolutely FANTASTIC!	2012-12-31	1	1	0

What I will say is I love it... and can't wait for the Series One DVD to come out here in the States.I think my favorite part about this is that they DIDN'T go over the top with special effects (which is what would have happened if an American company had gotten ahold of the idea to remake it). I'm glad the creatures are a little on the low-fi side... not all super CGI'd up. It would have ruined the whole thing. ... its the kitsch that makes this show so fun!	5.0	I adore this show!	2006-06-03	6	5	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2ZE4ITB8LX1S1	S. Hachey	There are more outstanding episodes in this season than any since. It also introduces us to all of the characters till the end of the season 4 specials, plus Torchwood Season 1 and 2 and Torchwood: Children of Earth. In fact if you were to watch it all in proper order you would watch Doctor Who through season 3 episode &#34;Blink&#34;, then watch all of season 1 of Torchwood, then resume Season 3 of Doctor Who.All Seasons of Doctor Who have great episodes, just not as many in my opinion as season 1. It is also not about crazy space creatures, though there are plenty of them. It is still the best show in the history of television	5.0	Great Season!	2013-03-16	0	0	0

The Doctor in this season is played by the awesome Christopher Eccleston and I consider him to be ""my"" Doctor. Anyone a fan of Scifi, British TV, Chris Eccleston, Billie Piper, time travel, or just the adventurous should check out this show. It has it's moments where it gets a little cheesy but that's all part of the charm. This show is great for kids as well.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A19GTQ0YMXO8VW	Shane - AFR	The first episode of any new series is to introduce the characters and the shows concept to the viewer, and even though Dr. Who is an old show making a new and updated return, this the first episode named Rose is a presentation to the new audience. So lets go over what the new Dr. Who has to offer.The show originates in Britain, and with the UK sense of humor - humour as they say, the new Dr. Who offers more of a snarky personality than some may be used to. But does that make it bad, no it makes it fun. The personality of the show makes the characters relatable and more real. Its the characters and their interactions that drive the show and make it what it is.The first few episodes do include a science fiction thread that will have fans of that genre entertained, but the show doesn't revolve around the concept of SciFi, rather it focuses on the reaction to it. In this episode the Doc and Rose face off against manikins that come to life due to a remote signal from an evil alien form.The first episode is a great intro to old and new fans and overall is a good addition to the SciFi genre. Many, many people have argued that this is the best SciFi show ever and even though some may think that that is a stretch there is no denying that the show has plenty to offer viewers.Highly recommended.	5.0	Who is Doctor Who?	2012-04-30	1	1	0

I loved Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor and always thought that he was the best.Now the BBC releases the new Doc tor Who series and all I can say is Incredible! They have taken a very well done series and made it even better!That is why the previous critic who says that this new series has terrible writing is so perplexing to me. Christopher Eccleston is by far the best Doctor the series has ever had! He is witty and clever in his performance and incorporates almost every trait from every previous Doctor!Too bad Christopher Eccleston left the series after 13 episodes! He is much better than David Tennant.	5.0	Best Doctor Ever!	2006-05-17	8	3	5

It's actually the new Dr. Who from 2005.  Lets call him... ... ...The New Millennial Dr. #1.Still, this Dr. is the best of them all.  Believe me, it takes a lot to make me switch my favorites!  But here we have what we all wanted Dr. Who to be about from the beginning.  Still the great, campy, well written stories, but now we have the technology to really make them shine.

Put quite simply it is the biggest show on Tv in the Uk at the moment. I think that sometimes it is hard for people Stateside to grasp this. This is not a cult hit, one in 6 people in the Uk are watching this.This DVD set collects together all 13 episodes from the first series along with a good series of extras (although not as outstanding as we had all hoped) and shows off a dazzling array of inventive and intelligent telefantasy stories.Christopher Eccleston nails the Doctor completely and shows just what a good actor he is. Billie Piper is also superb as the companion Rose Tyler. But it is the writing where the series really scores. RTD and his team really show their love of the old show without missing the point that today's Tv market calls for a fast paced modern approach.This is the show that has redifined TV in the UK, it can be watched and enjoyed by everyone from 1 - 100 and has already found its place at the top of the television tree.	5.0	As good as it gets.	2006-03-21	161	145	16

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"In late March of 2005, ""Doctor Who"" returned to television for the first time in sixteen years (Or nine years, if you count the sub-par TV movie from 1996). And the wait was definitely worth it! Russell T. Davies, executive producer and head-writer of the show, has done a terrific job of bringing a fresh spin on the old series, retaining many of the traits and characteristics that made the original a classic, while also bringing it into the 21st Century!Christopher Eccleston proves to be a terrific choice as the Doctor, whose charm and humor are reminiscent of earlier Doctors, while he also brings more of a dark side than previous Time Lords. It's a shame that this would be his only season. Billie Piper is also excellent as the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. She has everything that you'd want in a companion: looks, sass, and smarts.The standout episodes of the first season include: ""Rose,"" the premiere episode; ""The Unquiet Dead,"" the show's first period piece; ""Dalek,"" which features the return of the Doctor's oldest enemy; ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances,"" the two-part story set in London at the height of the Blitz in 1941, and; ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways,"" the two-part season finale that not only brings the season to an exciting conclusion, but also sees the departure of Eccleston, and the entrance of David Tennant, as the Doctor.The DVD release is terrific, featuring great picture and fantastic extras. The only complaint I have is that the audio is a little off; the dialogue is buried under the sound effects and music at times.Overall, this is a fantastic return for one of Britian's greatest icons.

Not everyone loves Doctor Who (I don't understand that) but if you want to give the Doctor a try, this is the place to start.	5.0	New Doctor Who Fan	2014-01-03	0	0	0

Ignore Pinterest's obsession with 10 and 11. Nine is fantastic, in his words and mine. He's the perfect mix of an angry and bitter person who has lost everything and yet still fulfills his self-given obligation to rid the universes of evil forces.

I've wanted to see the rest of them, and when I realized I could watch via Amazon Prime, I almost wept with joy (actually, it was maniacal laughter of happiness).  I don't know why Mr. Eccelson left the series, but he did.While he was there, he was a terrific Doctor Who.  You MUST watch his season to really understand the whole regeneration thing. And why companions are so necessary.  And why Rose belonged with #11.  I cannot tell you which of the new companions I prefer; just that all of them are terrific.  Rose was the start of the most amazing reboot of the most amazing television show EVER.  Watch. Learn.  Enjoy the wonder that is Doctor Who.

Fleming ""Scaryteri"""	I'm an old broad from Portland, Oregon who has never even been to the UK but I've quickly become hooked on a lot of BBC TV shows. Graham Norton, Sherlock Holmes, Being Human and now Dr. Who. It's easy to see why the Brits have such a fondness for this gem! Every show is smartly written, well acted, fast paced with lots of action and doesn't take itself too seriously. Even if you didn't start watching in the sixties you can enjoy every episode. i'm the only one in y household that watches sci-fi and haven't been able to get anyone else on board to watch with me :-( Oh well...streams great on the Kindle my sweetie gave me for Christmas too.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2B2Z7Y4GUFI1G	Teri B.	"Let me just get this out of the way: no, I haven't seen the classic ""Doctor Who,"" okay? But the 2005 series is one of the best TV series I've ever seen. Even if you're not a ""sci-fi fan,"" it's such a well-produced show that you'll find plenty to enjoy. I'll give you two main reasons why.First, the writing is superb. Many science fiction series fall victim to writers (and, no doubt, producers) who are primarily concerned with coming up with nifty plots and who don't want to be bothered with character. I don't know about you, but if the characters are two-dimensional, I'm going to lose interest pretty quickly. The 2005 ""Doctor Who"" scripts, however, are rich in emotion and character while also filled with drama, comedy, and adventure in near-perfect proportions. If great writing is more important to you than genre, you definitely have to watch this. However, if you are a sci-fi fan...well, you've probably already seen this; but if you haven't, watch it. You'll be glad you did.Second, the two lead actors are incredible. Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and Billie Piper as his companion Rose not only give compelling individual performances, but their chemistry with each other is magical. These two were meant to be onscreen together. My favorite scenes are Doctor/Rose scenes because of the joy of watching them interact.The Doctor could so easily have come across as campy or cheesy, but Eccleston makes him completely believable. He (Eccleston) displays a range he's not often given the opportunity to show and makes it clear what a complex character the Doctor really is. The Doctor has a vast amount of emotional baggage, and Eccleston nimbly shifts from heroic to stubborn to joyful to angry to melancholy to silly and everything in between.Piper, not nearly as experienced an actor as Eccleston, more than holds her own. She's a talented young actress to keep an eye on. Rose is only nineteen but she's not intimidated in the least by the Doctor, and she doesn't hesitate to tell him when she thinks he's wrong (nor he her). Piper, too, has range and believably fleshes out what might have been just a sidekick into the Doctor's equal in many ways. Rose has confidence, courage, and heart beyond her years, all ably portrayed by Piper.I must also quickly mention Murray Gold's score, which is wonderful. I dearly hope a soundtrack release is in the works. Anyway, I could go on and on, but it would involve revealing spoilers. Suffice it to say that I've driven my family, friends, and coworkers nutty with my praise for the show, but it's so good I just can't help myself. Watch it for yourself and you'll see why."	5.0	Fantastic!	2006-07-17	13	13	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A19EX8NKV7JV1X	The Doctor	"Christopher Eccleston played the 9th Doctor in this reboot of the historic Doctor Who television show.  It had been several years since they'd stopped making new episodes of Doctor Who by the time this new incarnation of the program came out.  The 9th was my first Doctor, and succeeded in getting me ""hooked"" on Doctor Who.  Although Eccleston only did one series/season of Doctor Who, it was a good one and had some compelling stories and introduced viewers to Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) who would go on to remain the 10th Doctor's (David Tennant) companion the next series/season.  There are all sorts of fascinating adventures to be had in this year's episodes and it's the only place a person should start when watching the new Doctor Who reboot.  Starting with this year's show, someone who had never seen any Doctor Who previously would be able to feel comfortable and start learning about everything that makes Doctor Who what it is and why it's so great.  As for Eccleston's performance, I felt that he did a fine job and brought a unique persona to the role of The Doctor.  He has a buzz cut hairdo, he wears a black leather jacket, and he has both playful and serious qualities to his character.  I think he did a fine job and wish he'd done a few more seasons/series of Doctor Who.If you are looking for a great place to start watching Doctor Who, this is it."	5.0	Doctor Who is back!	2012-09-06	1	1	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A36C3TMUSZ8DQF	The Propmaster	I am so pleased that the new series came out on DVD in America.  The quality of the shows is excellent.  If you are unfamiliar with the new series, but loved the old one, you should know that this series was lovingly created by people who were bviously Dr. Who fans.  The essential elements remain, with some interesting modifications to the mythos.  The quality of writing, acting, and effects is what would be expected of an outstanding 21st century science fiction show.The discs have several hours of extras, including some very interesting behind-the-scenes items.  It would have been nice to have even more Dr. Who Confidential - it appears that the included versions were miniature versions.  The overarching theme of the season - basically life and death and the cost of each - makes repeat viewing essential.  You'll want to return and catch the clues for the final episode after you watch it (unless you cheated and read it on the web).  Overall, a fabulous, well-recommended series - you should buy it.	5.0	The first series of the new show - well presented	2006-08-20	1	1	0
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	ANFMETZP2OODT	The Shadow Warrior	I have watched Doctor Who since last  month and I absolutely love the idea of time travel and space. This episode is what started it all for me.Now to clear up any possible confusion, Doctor Who has been out there for a while now (since 1963) and was discontinued after a while. However, it came back in 2005 and is sometimes classified as &#34;NuWho&#34; (a play on words for new Who) I personally never watched the Classic Who (1960s-1989).Without any more delay, this episode got me hooked pretty quickly. I mean sure it does have 2005 CGI, but who cares? It is still an amazing episode, and I highly recommend starting with this episode and moving forward so you can catch up to the current Doctor and see what happens from there. In my opinion, only watch the Classic Who episodes after you finish the Nu-Who series. I am sure I do not stand alone here, BUT do not let me stop you from doing so! By all means you CAN watch the Classics before the reboot series, that is totally your choice.I'd recommend this episode to anyone who wants to join the Who fandom and/or just wants to see why everyone loves the show so much. I can assure you that you will find this absolutely &#34;FANtastic!&#34; (you will understand why I wrote it that way once you watch the first few episodes) Enjoy the episode!	5.0	An amazing start to an amazing show (well, technically the revival/reboot start)	2013-12-31	0	0	0

The pacing of these shows don't really play as well on American TV, but the DVD presents it as it was intended.Yea, it's expensive but this is a DVD that isn't just going to sit on the shelf.  With new Doctor Who and new Battlestar Galactica, it's a great time to be a Sci-Fi fan!	5.0	Much more fun than watching it on Sci-Fi	2006-07-07	7	6	1

However, at the urging of a co-worker I was told it was a &#34;must see.&#34;  After watching the first episode I quickly became hooked and this is one of my favorite shows to watch.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A29G8PJ1495I2L	"T. Koschmann ""Redeemed Advocate"""	This was my introduction to the Doctor Who universe. With that being said, I really enjoyed Christopher Eccleston's take on the Doctor. Most of the episodes were executed really well by Billie Piper and Christopher. With the budget that the BBC gave the writers, directors and producers, it was all just one heck of a ride for me. I must say, though, that I really wished Christopher had stayed on for at least one more season, but to each his own. Either way, it was a great kickoff to see Doctor Who come into its own as the series progressed.	5.0	Loved it!	2013-08-11	0	0	0

I could go on and on, but the basic idea is if you are looking at this, then you probably already have some sense of what Doctor Who is and, while he is no David Tennant or Tom Baker, in the history of Doctor Who, there had been no one who better portrayed the torment of the Timelord adrift alone, returning to humanity and having his own &#34;humanity&#34; returned to him.	5.0	Great Reboot!	2012-12-07	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3UI00DVXAJLW4	"Tony ""Ynot"""	I see I have come late to review this series, so I will not waste your time regurgitating the storyline: please see the numerous 5 star reviews for that.  I will give you what they did not: blatant honesty.WHO has the typical British dry humor, which I do like.  Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor is truly masterful; it is a character you can really fall in love with.  Rose on the other hand... she is - from what I've seen - the typical British female movie star; not very pretty and a little on the heavy side.  But if you don't need beauty to enjoy a show, then this may be just the series for you.  (I'm not bothered by the lack, but my husband constantly whines about it.)What keeps this from more stars is the special effects.  Being use to Battlestar Galactica, Fire Fly and many other SF US hits, you definitely feel the lack of Hollywood special effects on this series.  It reminds me of watching old reruns of 70's SF.  Even though the story is good, you can't help but almost laugh when the aliens appear.  I hope they invest some of their success in better monster creation.Worthy of a viewing, but not excellent.***** Edit ****Perhaps not very pretty was a bit harsh.  Rose just wasn't beautiful in the beginning, but they've glamorized her and toward the end she does make the very pretty mark.	3.0	The Difference between us and them.	2008-05-27	38	8	30

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A4EG92M25UL0W	Trisha R. Robertson	I remember the hoopla when it came back on TV and had caught episodes here and there while flipping through channels, but had never regularly watched.  I will say that every time I came across one, I was thoroughly engaged -- even if I didn't fully understand what was going on.  After a few years of being too busy to watch ANY sort of TV (went back to school, got married, got separated, had a baby, and got divorced all within about three years), I wanted to start watching it, but didn't know if I could just jump into it and catch up. FINALLY decided to start from the beginning (uh, the 2005 beginning, not the VERY beginning) when I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and realized I could watch them all for free being a Prime member!  I know Christopher Eccleston was only the Doctor for one series, but I'm quite sad about watching the last episode -- even though I love David Tennant very much.  As with any series, I don't love every episode, but I love the whole enough to keep watching, much to the detriment of my sleep.  Thought I might get annoyed with Billie Piper as Rose, but she's grown on me, too; unlike her boyfriend, Mickey OR her overbearing mother.  One other point I feel I should make is that this is definitely a show for OLDER children.  There are quite a few eps with fairly sexual overtones and a LOT of the imagery would be quite frightening for younger kids.  Some of them were pretty creepy to ME!  At any rate, I'm really excited about continuing on with the rest of the seasons, and already understand much more about some of the ongoing themes and phrases that I'd heard before, but didn't get.  Definitely recommend for anyone who loves sci-fi, fantasy or just plain old good story telling.	4.0	Late to the Doctor Who Party	2014-01-08	0	0	0

I saw all thirteen episodes of the new Doctor Who series and I was like, ""WOW!""  It has better plots, more action, and what I really appreciate more emotion.  Billie Piper as Rose is probably one of the best companions i've seen in a long time.  She is not only concerned about others, but she stands up to Chris Eccleston's persona.  I'm really disappointed that there is no recollection of Gallfrey though except that The Timelords were killed in the Time War.  This is probably the best version of the series yet.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1NDYL6D6QNVCI	"Valnastar ""Man With No Name"""	The Doctor has returned to production! In 2005 new TV episodes were produced for the first time since 1989. This new series of Dr. Who adventures first aired in the UK in 2005 and as of this writing it is running on the Sci-Fi Channel. It is everything Doctor Who always was when at its best and has none of the problems that it had at its worst. The Doctor is still the hero who always puts others ahead of himself, saving the day in each adventure, with a bit of a humanitarian message slipped in as well. His companion in this series, Rose, is lively and fun. The stars, C. Eccleston and B. Piper, turn in good, convincing and entertaining performances, even in the show's sillier moments.Unlike many of the old adventures from the original TV series, these new stories are relatively brief and fast-paced and have none of the padding that was often prevalent in many classic Dr. Who episodes. The soap-opera pacing of classic Dr. Who is gone in favor of succinct and tightly written action adventure. If you liked Dr. Who before but often found the pace of some of the original adventures to be a problem, these new shows will be a pleasant surprise.The visual effects, while not always state-of-the-art, are much improved over the classic shows and are therefore less laughable and distracting from the story. At its core, though, Dr. Who still does not take itself too seriously, so if you're looking for some escapist fantasy fun then these shows should satisfy.This set contains 13 episodes on 5 discs, with loads of extra features including interviews, making of documentaries, storyboards, trailers and more. I therefore recommend this set for all humans, Daleks, Cybermen and Timelords. Exterminate, oops, I mean, enjoy!	4.0	Fast paced and fun, new Doctor Who is as heroic as ever.,	2006-03-22	5	5	0

I soon fell in love with the whole show, however.  I find the interaction of Rose with the characters from different times interesting; it's more personal and engaging than the older series.  More suspensful, too.  The fact that the film makers kept most of the series Earth-related is slightly disappointing, but I think it was because of both budget and visual considerations.  It adds something to the show to have a lot of outdoor shots and not just studio scenes; it makes it more easy to relate to.  Overall, I think it's fantastic!	5.0	Doctor Who, First Season	2006-11-18	7	3	4

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"The first series of the new Doctor Who arrives on DVD in the U.S. with plenty of bells and whistles. We get the 13 episodes from the first series in an excellent transfer along with a commentary track on every single episode of the show. Christopher Eccelston is excellent as the Doctor in a series of witty, fun adventures. Writer Russell T. Davies (""Queer as Folk"", ""Touching Evil"") has recreated the Doctor by capturing the best elements of previous incarnations and putting his own spin on the material.Surprisingly the best episodes in this set are not written by Davies. He's done a great job of reimagining the Doctor for the 21st century (and Eccelston does a great job of embodying him taking elements from before Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton, etc. and then molding them into his own portrayal)but the best episodes here are the two part ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dances"". It captures the humanity, the mystery and complexity of what made the show at its best one of the finest shows on TV.The first episode of the series takes off at a breakneck pace as we meet Rose (Billie Piper) a department store worker who discovers an invasion by the department store dummies (possibly the Autons although they are never called that in the episode). The sixth episode involves the return of the Daleks. Actually it's a single Dalek as the Doctor mentions during the show that all of the Time Lords and the Daleks were destroyed with the Doctor believing he's the only survivor of their conflict. Needless to say this isn't a happy reunion between these two lone survivors bound by hatred and fear of each other. This single survivor has fallen into the hands of a greedy American  who collects alien technology in order to backwards engineer it and sell it.  There are plenty more besides that terrific episode.. The two part ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" also stands up well with a moving an powerful story. We also meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) another time traveler who shows up mysteriously during World War II in London.The transfer looks very good. For those that are super critical about such things the color is quite good and if you're a videophile you'll probably note that the resolution in some of the darker scenes isn't quite as good as it could be but the overall look of the show is quite pleasing. The audio 5.1 mix is a bit bizarre with the rear speaker mixes louded than the center (since this IS dialogue driven it would sense for the opposite to be the case) but that's pretty easily adjusted on your system. Why the BBC didn't correct this problem with the master (or Warner for that matter) is beyond me. It is a problem that supposedly existed in the first batch of releases in the UK and Canada so it's clear the same master was used here. Packaged in a fold out case with the discs laid on top of each other (the disc with the concurrent documentaries about the making of the show is strangely enough the first one you'll encounter when you open it)the packaging features the T.A.R.D.I.S. with the Doctor and Rose on a plastic holder that slips around the packaging to hold it all together.The first disc has an interview with Christopher Eccleston from BBC Breakfast where he discusses his memories of watching Doctor Who (not very many)and what attracted him to the project (writer Russel T. Davies). I do take exception to Eccleston describing ""Doctor Who"" as a show for children. Children can appreciate it (my kids love it) because of the humor and humanity but the show isn't just for children because it's a science fiction--it's for everyone capturing the best elements of drama. It's not ""The Tempest"" or ""The Godfather"" but it was never meant to be. Like ""Star Trek"" or ""Farscape"" at its best its about the quality of the drama. I think what Eccleston probably meant was that its a show that children can watch with high dramatic values. At least I hope so.""Making Doctor Who With Russell T. Davies"" features the writer in a video diary providing us behind-the-scenes footage from before the first read through of the show through to production. ""Waking the Dead"" also provides us with a video diary on the making of this episode (which features a terrific performance by Simon Callow). ""Laying Ghost: The Origin of the Unquiet Dead"" is also on the first disc along with trailers for the show and a storyboard of the trailers accompanied by the theme. We get a lot additional extras scattered throughout the set. Each disc has some extras on them related to the episodes on that disc for the most part.The overall quality of this set is quite good. I'm looking forward to the second season of the series and hope that Sci-Fi won't delay its arrival on DVD like they did this set."	5.0	"Outstanding first series of the ""new"" Doctor.

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A384SPNR1C68LF	W. D. Allen	"So, as a child, I remember watching ""Doctor Who"" on PBS.  It was a corny, cheesy show that tried to do what could best be described as 'serious camp'.  And then, in the late '80s, it went off the air.  Still, having been on the air for more than thirty years, there were a lot of episodes, and so they still show 'em on PBS.  Then, a few years back, fox made a TV movie, which was disappointing.  So when I first heard of a new 'Doctor Who,' I was leery, and ready to be disappointed again.Much to my surprise, the new ""Who"" is spectacular...phenomenal...great...(insert positive adjective here.)This show is not a re-make.  Instead, it is the same old blue box, same sonic screwdriver, same show... it just picks up some twenty years later.  Of course, there is a new Doctor, played by the versatile actor Christopher Eccleston, and the special effects are upgraded, but the story is the same: The enigmatic Time Lord known as the Doctor travels through time and space, along with his lovely female sidekick (played by Billie Piper), saving humanity from various disasters and alien invasions.The new 'Who' has fixed so many of the 'corny' aspects of the older episodes, (which were okay when I was ten, but come off as horrible when i look back) and the new Doctor is edgier, tougher, and a bit more of a hardcase than his predecessors.  We come to learn that he is now the Last of the Time Lords, the rest having been wiped out in an apocalyptic 'Time War', and the new shows have a bit more action, drama, and suspense. But it still has plenty of that signature British wit to keep things from looking too grim (Rose says, on meeting the Doctor, ""If you're an alien, how come you sound like you're from the North?"" The Doctor replies, ""Lots of planets have a North..."").There are a few nods to older shows, and the return of some of the Doctor's nemeses from days gone by, so older fans will remember with fondness those early encounters, but it is all presented anew so that new fans won't be lost in a backstory they do not know.Long story short, this new show is great fun for the whole family, and we can only hope it stays on the air for another thirty years..."	5.0	The Doctor is in...	2007-05-22	7	6	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A45TVGFR26WOO	"Who fan ""Nbr1hawkfan"""	"First off, I have not seen the DVD.  I was fortunate enough to catch the series on Canadian TV.Being a major Doctor Who fan, I was afraid an update would either be too silly for this era or way too serious.  Somehow the BBC has managed to get the mix correct.  It is not the Doctor of the 60's.  It is a Doctor for the 21st Century.  They have their little cheesy nods to the early doctor, but give us Doctor fans a fantastic update to a fantastic character.Christopher Eccleston makes a great Doctor.  While he gives his own take on the Doctor, there are times when he flashes his big smile so suddenly, that I am reminded of Tom Baker's Doctor.  But his quick temper reminds me of William Hartnell's Doctor.  Make no mistake, this is Christopher's Doctor, and what a debut he made.It's all here.  The Tardis, the humor (or is that humour?), the adventure and a few surprises.They touch on subjects that would have been avoided by any previous Doctor.Maybe that's what upset other veiwers.  The short lived companion of Cap'n Jack is perfect for the 21st Century.  And maybe it's because of who he ""dances"" with that causes people to say this series doesn't compare to others.I can hardly wait to see the series on DVD in proper widescreen to fill my TV set.The only problem I see, so far, with the DVD set, is it's price.  But they know we, well me anyway, will pay to have this in a perfect widescreen and 5.1 audio.I believe if you are a Doctor fan, you will truly enjoy this latest version.  Because it is the Doctor, it is not a revisioning.  It IS the Doctor.  Enjoy the ride."	4.0	New Doctor for 21st Century	2006-03-20	10	8	2

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1HQ2AQDHOX9HC	William A Potter	Far-fetched stories and wink-wink mayhem abound.  It is fun to watch because the story lines are so ludicrous.  The acting is mediocre and one-dimensional, but that is exactly what is needed here.  I am sure that die-hard fans will disagree with my assessment, but this is not a bad thing--sometimes we just have to have something to amuse us that doesn't really have a huge point to make.  Each episode has some impossible occurrence with an even more impossible resolution, however, good always overcomes.  I would compare it to the old Saturday matinee cliff-hanger serial without the cliff-hanger.  Each episode appears to stand alone so that you don't really have to see them in order, nor do you have to have seen them all to understand what is going on.  A true guilty pleasure!

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1BQ318GESS864	Wired Wrong	I know this might start a flame war, but I honestly have to say I feel Doctor Who. Like the most recent Star Trek movie does a good job of trying to push what Scifi can do, much like one might say for the series Firefly or any number of other Media. But in all honestly I love this guy, great stories great subjects. Deep thought provoking plot, as well as any number of other corks that draw you into a very well developed character. Also the fact they have managed to find a way to replace the doctor with new actors and some how allow them to make the part there own well developing a character many people love all over again. Is one of  the most wonderful parts of the series, I would also like to add that, David Tennant the 10/11th Doctor depending on what geek or Scifi fan who knows the series you ask will be greatly missed. I would also like to say that the change up between the doctor in the first series and the ones that followed it was every hard for many to except David Tennant at first but as the story went on we now will miss him. Also Doctor Who does a good job at showing the good in humanity as a whole through out the series, if any alien from any Science fiction  were to get a reward for being most human. I think the Doctor would surely win it, I would also like to add that the show as a whole is very moving. So moving even that it could sometimes even make a grown man cry.	5.0	GREAT!!!!!!	2010-02-14	2	2	0

One of the reasons that I bought the series DVDs was the inclusion of the ""Doctor Who Confidential"" episodes.  Unfortunately, these wonderful 30 minute documentaries on the making of each episode have been trimmed back to 11 minutes.  Having seen the episodes that go with the second series, but not the first, I was very disappointed."	5.0	The series was great.  The extras a little disappointing.	2006-07-11	3	2	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A21KDW8TDD8ZY6	W. Sherman	I have been watching Doctor Who for over 22 years, and I am pretty sure that I have seen nearly every episode except for the new ones that are not available on DVD yet from the BBC (from 2006). If you liked the old episodes -- in particular, Tom Baker's -- you will love this series. It has all of the old charm: a sense of humor, the Doctor's silly smile and desire to jump into danger, the lack of severe physical violence, the Doctor's respect for women and youth, and a couple of the Doctor's old enemies. However, you can add excellent effects, great sets, decent music, and the best directing and acting of any Doctor Who series bar none.The writing is good, not quite as heavy on the pseudo-science-techno-bable of the old Tom Baker episodes, but it is good. Also, I don't normally appreciate cute, blonde actresses. As a matter of fact, Billie(Rose) had a lot to prove to me so that I wouldn't think she was just picked for her cute looks, but she did a fantastic job. Christopher (the Doctor) ties for first right up at the top with Tom Baker. It is too bad that this is a one season Doctor, but it will go on my shelf as a permanent part of my collection. An excellent series. Great acting. Good entertainment.Will	5.0	A Very Happy Old Fan	2006-08-04	3	2	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A3F1ULRHE469C1	"Wu Zhiyou ""Zoom"""	I recall READING about Dr Who's adventures when I was a kid. That was about 14 years ago. I vaguely recall his travelling phone booth and the invasion of the Daleks. I sketched little Daleks all over my textbooks and I think my cousins whom got the books passed down didn't know what the hell they were. Hearing about the BBC's new take of the Doctor made me want to watch it. I didn't watch the older series (as mentioned, only read the books) but I heard nothing but good things about this new series and decided to try it out. It took a while (a short while) to get used to it. But I must say that I'm a fan again. Although the buildup of the entire series was great (my girlfriend particularly liked the episode with Rose's dad), the final episode with... well. The ENDING of the series didn't really go that well with me. Kinda silly. But I had a great ride. For those that are worried that Dr Who might be foreign or even alien to them, you don't have to. My girlfriend loved it and my friends whom I've passed the discs around all love it too. It will grow on you and after that, you'll just want to continue each and every episode until the end. Check out the interesting special features too, behind the scenes documentary by Rose regarding life on the set. BBC's done it right and the only sad thing I must say (other than the lacklustre ending) is that they had to change the Doctor in season 2. I can't judge the new Doctor as I don't get the show over here in Singapore, but after watching Season 1, I hate to see the change. Overall, a fantastic series and well worth the time and money. The rest of the episodes more than make up for the ending. So do check it out. Great price too. Bloody expensive in HMV Singapore.	5.0	Dr Who?	2006-11-04	2	1	1
B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	I writing this really to respond to all of the really bad reviews this series has had, and I have to say it is all wrong. I really had bad images of Doctor Who in my mind, probably due to the late 80s series of bad monsters and bad writing, so I wasn't exactly a great Who fan..until I watched this series. It has to be the best series ever; where else can our main characters go anywhere in space and time, no wonder this show ran and ran in the last century, you can do anything with it.The acting is great, who'd of thought Billie Piper could act so well, and Christopher Eccleston is a great actor normally, but he excells himself in this series and how can you criticis the monsters; the Sliveen, he Jagrofess, the Gelf and everyones favorates; the Daleks.The thing about Doctor Who is that is has a unique approch to science-fiction, that is is very VERY British, probably why it hasn't done that well in America, and I think that people who don't get this series have been influenced too much by American Sci-fi such as Buffy (which don't get me wrong is very good), but it's diffrent.This series is fantastic and I advice anyone who has just discovered it to watch it again and again, it is truly; as the Ninth Doctor would say 'fantastic'!	5.0	A True Sci Fi Classic Re-Invented	2006-06-15	11	10	1

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A9DYBZJCSD2IA	YM	As a huge sci-fi fan, I had to watch Doctor Who after all the buzz it's received. I must admit it was very different at first, not the typical American-Style sci-fi we see here...but I liked it! It was refreshing to see the entire season unravel, a lot of things I did not expect. Just when I was really liking this duo-- the Doctor changes form...WHY??? Now onto the second season, to fall in love with the next Doctor...and then at the end of his turn ask the same question all over again haha.	4.0	You gotta keep watching...	2013-05-01	0	0	0

B0009AK57Y	Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]	A2SBR91PTB22ZN	Zosia	"My family recently discovered Dr. Who by chance and was quickly hooked. We had not seen any of the original shows, only parts of Series 2 and were somewhat hesitant about a ""different doctor."" Series 1 was outstanding! Now we can't decide which Doctor we like better. We had to force ourselves to watch only one episode at a time so that we could spread the pleasure out. Season 1 is very well written, acted, and produced. I cannot believe that it is a children's show; it can be enjoyed on many levels. I enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the relationship between Rose and the Doctor and also the frequent glimpses into the Dr.'s complex emotions. The series sets the framework for several recurring themes and characters making it a must for people like us who are new fans. I also enjoy that the show has no bad language, and minimal, subtle sexual content. The overall message of a ""better way to live"" is a great thing to share with your family; a nice contrast to the narcissism prevelent in so much modern entertainment."	5.0	Couldn't stop watching it!	2007-04-10	4	4	0
