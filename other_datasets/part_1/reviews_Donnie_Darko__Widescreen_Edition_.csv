B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"It is hard to describe the plot of 'Donnie Darko' without making the movie seem repellant.  'Donnie Darko' is purposely ambivalent, and the causality of bizarre events is intriguing from the very start.  The journal development is a retro trip in itself.  Using footage of the Dukakis and Bush (I) debates before the 1988 election, the movie authenticates its setting of a high school near the end of the eighties.  How they manage to mix nostalgia with an eerie tale and dark manifestations is a mystery, but they pull it off.  Uniquely enigmatic with the memories they elicit, the movie has the effect of being a 'Twilight Zone' manifestation of 'Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.' (Aptly, the soundtrack draws from ""Tears for Fears"" instead of ""Bow Wow Wow"".)Now about the story.  Our titled tortured protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal in another talented role) is undergoing psychiatric care complete with medication.  The first hint we have that things aren't going well is when an ominous voice summons Donnie out of bed to meet him somewhere in the dark.  What we discover there on a golf green is a six-foot rabbit, who, if his processed voice weren't so menacing, could only be dismissed with chuckles.  (One can only describe the creature as a rabid or demonic 'Harvey'.)  And, indeed, our best evidence of a demonic presence  is when Donnie asks him later, ""Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?""  To which the voice quickly replies, ""Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?"")  Here he announces to the disturbed adolescent that the world is going to end in approximately a month--Halloween 1988--to be exact.  After that we get varying degrees of maladjustment with some foreboding events.  Upon his return home he discovers he narrowly escaped death when an airplane part fell through his bedroom, leveling much of the house.  A grateful Donnie will do anything for ""Frank,"" who saved him from the debacle.  From there a series of inexplicable events take place that leave one glued to the screen with magnetic interest.'Donnie Darko' is a mysterious and disturbing alternative movie.  Some of the draw comes with the acting.  Keeping it real is no short order.  The scenes of hypnosis are mesmerizing with Dr. Therman (played with expert delicacy by Katherine Ross) who tries to uncover Donnie's pathology.  But it isn't that easy.  In the meanwhile, Donnie, himself, seeks a teacher at his private school and an elderly woman down the road who has written a book about time travel.  Dabbling with penetrating thoughts about predestination and the occult, Donnie's predicament is fascinating.  Drew Barrymore, whose mere presence could singularly bring flashbacks of the eighties, is the producer and plays lively English teacher, Karen Pomeroy, a character who provides a pivotal place for social commentary.  (Besides a mysterious mood piece, some satire is accessible.)  On the staff is stalwart moral zealot, Mrs. Farmer, who is almost painted in clown white during her ignorant tirades.  There's also preacher-like motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze who makes his character creepy enough) who has a few skeletons in his own closet.'Donnie Darko' deserves accolades for being so original.  With effective performances that include the delicious novelty of having Donnie's sister played by real-life sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, the elements speak for themselves.  Nevertheless, the overall effect is not as satisying as the creativity, and the story leaves some gaping holes that, while like real life, are unsettling nonetheless.  'Donnie Darko' will fill a black hole for teenagers who will relate to some of Donnie's difficulties that beg for meaning.  (Recommended for a different sort of movie adventure.)"	4.0	'Through a Glass Darkly'	2007-06-21	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1TGVH3CHI75QT	"""40oz_to_freedom"""	I warn you that this movie is not for everyone.  It's the type of movie where if you get it, you love it but if you don't get it, it will be extremely boring.  I love the whole movie as it is witty and funny as well as deep and meaningful.  My advice is to watch the DVD as the extra scenes create a fuller, more complete movie.  I wish they had made an extended version DVD  with the extra scenes in it.  What I find the best in this movie is the ending.  It isn't hollywood but its not right out of left field either.  One of the smartest endings I've ever seen.  The whole movie is excellent and suggest that everyone gives it a go. It takes a few viewings to get the whole thing but well worth it.	5.0	Simply Great Movie	2003-02-20	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3LW6FZ12WUX2A	"4MaskCurse ""Kyonshi Jiang Shi"""	"I have to laugh at all of the simple people who are in awe of something that is so very insignificant.I obviously hated this movie,so of course all of the idiots who praise this garbage will say that I am close-minded (kind of ironic that all of these people who long for different points of view instantly bash the ones they don't agree with!)Since so many are so very blind as to what this movie is,I'll go ahead and make it clear:Donnie Darko is just a total attack on religon esp. Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold.All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent.Oh yes,this movie is so very original!Make good people look eviland evil people look good.Righteousness MUST be hypocrisy...Gee Hollywood,you certainly haven't been beating that dead horse for the past 30 years.Wonder if you can ever create something new with YOUR closed mind?And as far as this ""extrodinary"" storyline goes,let me just see if I get this straight.... God sends a man who was shot in a stupid looking bunny suit back in time to the man who shot him because he wanted him to kill himself instead of living life because death is better than living with a mental disorder...I think you should lay off the funny leaves Beavis!The dialouge in the movie also said that timetravel could be possibile if a large enough vessel was used that traveled faster than the speed of light AKA a spaceship.Uhm,an airplane can't travel faster than the speed of light;even when it's crashing into the earth.Yes,it wil travel very,very fast;but NOT fater than the speed of light.I wonder if the creator of this movie even understands how fast the speed of light is?Anyway since the airplane crashing wouldn't travel faster than the speed of light,no wormhole would be created,and so that adorable little windbag Donnie Dorko could not travel back in time. Thus our story(or lack there of) is no more.Game over man!All I know is that I wish I COULD GO BACK IN TIME to stop myself from watching this and do something else with the 3 hours of my life that I lost!!"	1.0	You people are SO gulibile.....	2004-11-16	87	12	75

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A25MRV80TFUZOZ	Aaron Golbeck	Donnie Darko mangages to achieve something akin to cold-fusion - the absurd yet necessary confusion of tragedy and triumph, beauty and the grotesque. This is a vital film, especially for anyone who thinks they know the nature of despair. Life is beautiful and if you don't think so, then go do something to make the necessary changes - add your own brush strokes.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3RRUE810UJC8R	Aaron	"Donnie Darko is one of may favorite movies so I was very excited to watch The Director's Cut version and anxious to hear what writer/director Richard Kelly had to say about his amazing movie. It was disappointing to say the least and I do not recommend buying it unless you are a die-hard fan of the film.  If you have not seen the film SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST (at least twice)After watching the director's cut, I have come to the realization that Richard Kelly was the victim of the rare ""hollywood first timer's luck syndrome"", where a writer's first big movie turns out to be spectacular, despite his or her best efforts.  Another past sufferer of this rare affliction was Bryan Singer (the writer/director of The Usual Suspects).The theatrical release of Donnie Darko was a rare cinematic gem. Mysterious and thought-provoking because it left so much to be interpreted by the viewer.  All at once it was a film about love, sacrifice, God, time travel, insanity and the supernatural (at least to me it was.  Others feel differently and that is why the movie was so great).  After watching the director's cut of the film I realized that, had Mr. Kelly had his way, the film would have ended up as a simple scifi flick about multiple dimensions and time travel to save the world.In the director's cut, much of the subtelty is gone.  We are allowed to see the pages of the time travel book, which explain what is about to happen in the next scenes in case (god forbid) the audience is puzzled.  Donnie and his psychiatrist blatantly discuss Atheism and the search for God. The perfect, sharp comedy of the Jim Cunningham school assembly scene now drags on and on. The final flashback scene becomes an industrial, robotic construct and loses all of its emotional impact because there is now a grid and computer text scrolling across the screen.Most of these changes were in the original cut of the film but Mr. Kelly was forced to remove them because of time constraints. Now that he can have his way, the movie shows too much and is reduced to a simple story about a ""chosen one"" who must save the world.The most disappointing feature of this DVD is the much anticipated, yet absolutely worthless commentary track for the film.  In it, writer/director Richard Kelly and his buddy ramble endlessley and joke with each other about topics completeley unrelated to what is going on on-screen.  I was so angry that I had to stop the commentary.  The first ten minutes of the commentary track are spent discussing whether or not the writer of The Breakfast Club liked to listen to music while he was writing.  Meanwhile, priceless scenes go by without any attention paid.Donnie Darko, The Director's Cut is an opportunity wasted.PS - The last straw for me in this director's cut was the changing of the dialogue in the scene where Drew Barrymore gets fired and the deletion of the perfect and classic ""Get off the stage Cherita"" line during the talent show."	2.0	Very Disappointing	2005-02-17	38	31	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A35R8PJSEURHHF	Aaron Merkel	Yes, it's totally original.  The person who made this movie created a whole plot that maybe only he/she would understand.....I had to go on the internet and look up explanations to figure the movie out.  Basically, the hero of the movie is thrusted into an alternate universe where certain rules apply.  Thankfully the director's cut inserts the laws/rules of the alternate universe as text for you to read, which may clear things up a bit.  There's a lot to see in this movie, and a second viewing is helpful or by going to internet descussion sites.  The main characters bunny friend gave me nightmares, very scary.	5.0	Extremely Confusing, but totally original movie.	2006-03-22	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A22OFG7MQKX6EV	Abstract Notions	"To start off I would just like to state that Donnie Darko is my favorite movie.  I have been a hard core Darko fan since I saw it in theaters in 2001.  For those who haven't seen it, this DVD will be a real treat.  Donnie Darko is possibly the greatest character based sci-fi flick ever.That said . . .  To my fellow hard core fanatics you may want to save your twenty bucks.  The 20 minutes of extra footage can all befound within the deleted scenes of the original DVD.  For those of us who have watched the movie at great lengths to figure out all it's subtle points, having them spoon fed in this directors cut is a bit much.  Some scenes we wished were in the original, some we were okay to see go.  But the one UNFORGIVABLE act was the changing of ""The Killing Moon"" to ""Never tear us apart""!  That song and mad world captured the feel of the original Donnie Darko like no other song could.  I bought the DVD because I wanted to see the documentary about the cult of Donnie Darko, but after hearing the new opening theme the film just somehow felt tainted.To all newbies, none of this will be a problem.  You will watch, and undoubtably love the movie.  But for the already hard core fans, just beware."	5.0	Newbies Will Love.  Hard Core Fans Beware.	2005-02-27	7	6	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3PIPHWD45VOGI	Ace-of-Stars	"Having known next to nothing about this film, but constantly hearing mountains of praise being heaped upon this obscure ""Midnight Madness"" fare, I had the original intention of waiting for the DVD release of the ""Director's Cut"" (which, as of this writing, is in limited theatrical release here in the US but, curiously, is already out on the DVD market in the UK). But after more researching & reading of reviews (including some information stating that the scenes which got left on the cutting room floor were just as much the Director's idea as that of the studio execs), and taking into consideration the fact that Director Kelly was -VERY- happy with the finished result which became this original theatrical version along with his revelation that virtually every ""new"" scene which will be presented in the ""Director's Cut"" is what's avalable on this ""original release"" DVD in the ""deleted scenes"" section, I made the conscious decision to discontinue ALL plans to wait for the ""Director's Cut"" -- either in DVD format or in theatrical release which, as of this writing, has still not played at any Hawaii venues.And so just a couple of days ago, with my recently shipped ""original theatrical release"" version of the DVD, I watched this movie for the very first time -- and let me say I was NOT disappointed in the very least!!! This remarkable little film lives up to all of its ubiquitous hype! (B+ easily!)The biggest surprise of all? -- I *TOTALLY* agreed with the trimming away of those scenes which had been selected for deletion! -- All 20+ of them! I usually go into kneejerk hysterics whenever I review deleted scenes from other films and I wind up cursing film execs for putting directors under this kind of pressure to meet some totally arbitrary ""time constraints"" for a film's length, but amazingly I did not have that reaction this time around! Sure, there were a couple of little ""bit pieces"" I would have liked to have seen within the main body of the film, but even so they were still not really necessary.And so ""Donnie Darko"" becomes only the SECOND ""Director's Cut"" of a film's re-release I would not endorse (the other being the D-Cut of the original ""ALIEN,"" which was totally unnecessary and broke the continuity it established with its sequel). Does that mean I think the new release of ""Donnie Darko"" is not worth seeing? I'm not saying that at all. But keep this in mind: If you have not yet seen this movie in its ""original release"" version, you'll be seeing in the ""Director's Cut"" what is, essentially, a ""different"" movie altogether -- because the added scenes will actually steer the story in a radically different direction leading to whole new different interpretations. It'll still be an amazing film to watch, no question about that; but it will also, in my personal opinion, actually present a WEAKER, not nearly as intense, and a less esoteric story.So my suggestion is to purchase the ""original release"" version DVD and enjoy the movie for the story it presents in its final form, then ""IMAGINE"" the ""Director's Cut"" by reviewing the ""deleted scenes"" and accompanying commentaries.Enjoy!"	4.0	"Believe the Hype!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3NCI5ZXIV59LC	"""acetiger_21"""	Whoa, How do I describe this movie? Well for starters, Donnie Darko isn't like most movies, infact the closest one I know off the top of my head has to be 'Harvey'. Why do you ask its like 'Harvey'? Well, Donnie see's an imaginary bunny named Frank, but Frank isn't an average bunny. Infact he is Donnie's sister's boyfriend in a costume.Anyways, the story starts out showing Donnie Darko (Who is played by the wonderful actor Jake Gyllenhaal), laying on top of a hill (Which is called 'Carpathian Ridge'). Apparently Donnie, who is sixteen years old, sleep walks, and has gotten into trouble before, but really wants to be a good kid. He goes back home and that night, he is awoken by 'Frank', who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie is skeptical about this warning, but believes it, cause when he comes home, he sees that a jet engine crashes in his room, which would have killed him if Frank hadn't come. He believes and does everything Frank tells him to do. Next Gretchen a new girl at school, is Donnie's love interest, soon they hook-up. Meanwhile, Donnie who goes to a therapist named Doctor Therma learns about Frank and hypnotises Donnie to tell him things about Frank. Dr. Therma starts to wonder whats wrong with Donnie and ups his medication. Then Donnie finds out that Roberta Sparrow who is an old lady who lives alone and checks the mail box obsessively, wrote a book called 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', Donnie studies it and understands what is happening to him.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, STOP HERE.An inspiration speaker named Jim Cunningham who believes that there are only two things in life, Fear and Love is called 'the anti-christ' by Donnie at an assembly at school. And Donnie burns down his house to reveal that Jim is a children's pornographer. Donnie's little sister, Samantha is in a dance squad called Sparkle Motion who make it to Los Angeles for a competition, but their leader Kitty cannot take them for she is fighting for Jim's right, so she asks Mrs. Darko to take them for her, Mrs. Darko says yes, and leaves Donnie and his sister Elizabeth home alone for a weekend. They have a party, and soon Donnie's days are up, Frank tells him to go to the Cellar Door by Roberta Sparrow's house which was mentioned to Donnie by his teacher, and Gretchen gets run over by Frank, and Donnie shoots him, and take Gretchen back home, that night Donnie goes to bed, thinking its all a dream, and is killed that night, by the recurring jet engine.On the DVD it reveals how Donnie's medication is really placebos, and much more. The DVD is wonderful, it has deleted scenes, the web site gallery, and TONS more! I love this movie and you should too! I hope this helps everyone.	5.0	Donnie Darko! *Spoilers*	2002-07-08	9	2	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3I4QT7QAZ65UI	A. Corrigan	Chuttup to all those people who don't like this movie! You should be eaten by Hungry Hungry Hippos. Okay just named two references to the movie and fans would know exactly what I mean! (And would call me a dork)Like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; or &quot;Empire Records&quot; (Damn the man, save the empire) Donnie Darko is another cult-classic film about or catering to Generation Y and Z--the generation who like to think, who speak fast and care more about others then themselves. (No offense, Generation X, its not your fault you were all products of the Me Me Me Eighties)We're not sure *exactly* what the film is trying to say but all the themes are here--loneliness, being different, depression, dying, love, parents, future.Donnie Darko escapes death when a demonic looking bunny tells him to get up and go out to a golf course, to prevent being crushed by a plane engine that falls out of nowhere...perhaps through a time travel barrier from the future...?Things get just plain weird though, when he has imaginary dreams, the bunny tells him the world will end in 28 days (Perhaps not 'the world' but Donnie's world?) he sleepwalks and uncovers secrets of people in his town unintentionally (or intentionally...?) and people he loves get hurt.Donnie is afraid of being alone. Especially of dying alone. But sometimes sacrifice is the only way to let the people you love live...and to never be alone.Whatever your stance on this movie, it will keep you up all night.	5.0	Cult Classic	2004-03-06	1	0	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3IUYAE9HLH2MM	AC-REVIEW	"I for one love movies closer to the as ""concieved"" or as filmed versions as possible. ALOT of studios and their execs have opinions that dont mesh with the people who came up with the idea in the first place. Mainly for timing issues, the shorter the movie the more seatings they fill and popcorn they sell. I love Directors cuts and extended version almost always over the theatrical cut. Why would you want to see a truncated, or shorter version ""vision"" when you can have it all. I like both versions but the longer cut always fills in more plot holes and or character development.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AC1HJD47B5X9	A Customer	Written and Directed by Richard Kelly (ASIN: B00005V3Z4)Any reviewer would be hard-pressed to discuss this film without giving away significant details. Donnie Darko is a snake eating its own tail, a story where the circularity of the plot is an integral part of its enjoyment, and so many seemingly insignificant moments through the film prove crucial to the end result, a kind of dark surprise different from any of the tired twists found in recent big-budget films.It is 1988. A borderline schizophrenic teenaged boy, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is haunted by visions of a man-sized rabbit named Frank. In addition to the prophetic announcement that the world will end in &quot;28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds,&quot; Frank forces Donnie to commit a series of increasingly serious misdeeds.As if this is not enough, a crash course in Einstein-Rosen bridges aka wormholes by physics teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle,) along with a copy of The Philosophy of Time Travel, convinces Donnie that a &quot;fourth dimensional construct&quot; has touched down right in his home town, allowing him to see such apparently hallucinatory events as streams of computer-generated liquid that hint at people's intentions.Set to an eclectic 1980s soundtrack, and also starring Drew Barrymore (producer for this project,) Mary McDonnell and yes, Patrick Swayze, Donnie Darko is deliberately vague as to its genre--the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully. The setting is vintage to the time period, but not prone to the heavy-handed display of era-specific props as other near-period pieces.The DVD (from CBS/Fox Home Video) contains the 113 minute feature film in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1,) deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, director's commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, the The Philosophy of Time Travel, music video for covered 80s song &quot;Mad World&quot; and an art gallery with production skills.This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and English and French Dolby surround.	5.0	Brilliant and Original	2002-10-08	5	4	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AO3JW5VHT2GQ	A Customer	Summary:Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears to be a delusional schizophrenic with a number of other problems, including a potentially anti-social personality disorder. He is being visited, usually in daydreams or hallucinogenic states, by a disfigured rabbit named Frank (James Duval). Frank, who describes himself as a messenger from the future, tells Donnie to do certain things, including flooding and defacing his high school and burning down a local, motivational speaker's house (Patrick Swayze).While experiencing these visits, Donnie is seeing a therapist (Katharine Ross), has fallen in love with the new girl in school (Jenna Malone), is having trouble with his parents (Eddie Darko - Holmes Osborne; Rose Darko - Mary McDonnell), and is having trouble at school. What all of these people surrounding Donnie don't know is that Frank has informed Donnie when the world is going to end. Donnie, meanwhile, begins exploring conceptual understandings about God and time travel in hopes of understanding what is happening to him.The movie ends with Donnie realizing that he wasn't delusional, but that realization comes with a steep price.Comments:Several friends highly recommended this movie, describing it as a dark 'mind trip' (though they used a slightly different word, if you get my drift). In some ways I would agree that this movie is, for the most part, a mind trip, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a film that has the potential to be a 'mind trip'. Though this movie is about as close as a movie can get to being a mind trip, I don't think it quite pulls it off. But the reason why is not because the story didn't have all the essential elements, but because the elements that would have given the story the necessary additional information to solidify the intrigue are cut from the final version of film. The result is a movie far more open to interpretation than I believe was originally intended. The movie is supposed to contrast divinity and insanity, but it doesn't quite get there without the deleted scenes and director's commentary. I don't understand why, in the DVD edition, a director's cut version is not an option. If it was offered, I don't think I could complain about this movie.As far as the acting goes, Jake Gyllenhall is tremendous. Most of the rest of the cast is okay, but I found myself not caring that the supporting cast wasn't outstanding because Gyllenhall was so good.Generally I also comment about the fluency and logic of the story, but my only concern with this film is that too much of the story was cut (see above).Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I have a tendency to be critical of films that require additional commentary in order to be understood. I understand that some films are designed to be interpreted, but I don't think the degree of openness to interpretation in this film was intended. Sure,  the issues of God and time travel are left unresolved, but the I believe the writer/director had intentions to clarify the issues that were being raised but was forced to cut some of the scenes that would have done this. I think a good example of a movie that has enough substance to clearly raise an issue but not offer any answers is 'Eyes Wide Shut' (or pretty much any Kubrick film), though Kubrick was generally able to take as much time as was necessary to tell his story. Thus, my critique of the film is more of a disappointment; it had what was necessary to be a great film, but, sadly, elements that were necessary for achieving that end were cut when they shouldn't have been.  Though those elements are offered as special features on the DVD, they should have been reincorporated into the movie on the DVD - then the writer/director wouldn't be able to complain.	4.0	Almost really good; but as it stands, just pretty good	2003-11-07	6	4	2

"When I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky (one of my favorites) I said, ""That guy will be headlining the movies if he keeps going like he's going."" Luckily others agreed, and now we have Donnie Darko.First off, Donnie Darko belongs in a category by itself like a large number of movies released in recent years. Horror? Not quite. Thriller? Nope, no Jodie Foster in sight. So, we have the new category that I have dubbed ""Stumper"" or ""Figure-it-outer."" Other movies in this category range from ""Magnolia"" to ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Unbreakable"".Donnie is disturbed. So disturbed in fact, he's stupified. (Cheap Joke). He has been seeing a psychologist due to his emotional instability. Also, he is seeing a six foot rabbit. His family life is so-so, and the bindings in his family seem to be slipping daily. Like Sixth Sense, at the end of the movie, there is a shocker, and no matter what your thinking while your watching, throw it out. Thats not going to be it. But I can tell you that you will be thinking about Donnie Darko for days after you see it. It's a great movie, and requires puzzle-piecing. I just have one question: Did the world end in 88?

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3GZP564FYJATJ	Adam Witthuhn	"The first thing that occurs to me when I think of this movie is a quote from the Simpsons.  Moe has radically remodeled his bar, and it is now filled with assorted eurotrash, yuppies and pseudo-hipsters.  Homer and friends appear at the grand re-opening and are taken aback by the crowd and environment.  Looking up at a TV above the bar that is showing an image of an eyeball blinking and looking wildly around, they ask him what the hell it's for.  ""It's po-mo"" says Moe. This elicits no reply from the guys. ""You know, post-modern?"" Silence.  ""Weird for the sake of weird.""That would be my phrase of choice to sum up Donnie Darko; or perhaps better put ""Ironic for the sake of Ironic"".  Why set your supposedly ""deeply affecting"" sci-fi, teen coming of age story in the 80's?  So you can set a SLOW MOTION montage (let me repeat that; SLOW MOTION MONTAGE) to Head Over Heels of course! Wait, WAIT!  Couldn't you also have a group of stony faced pre-teen girls in silver leotards perform an interprative dance to Notorious?  GENIUS I say!  Also that way you could have your attractive and (mostly) talented cast dress up in unflattering clothing as well.  Hell, you'd even have an excuse to use that lame Smurf discussion that's been sticking out like a sore thumb in all your other screenplays.  Cheap, CHEAP devices.  These are the kind of jokes that require no insight or thought on the part of their creator. They only provide a laugh of recognition, a self satisfied feeling that you are cool enough to know the non-sequitur or kitsch factor inherent in the scene you're watching.  Really now, it's basically a hyper-intellectuallized  version of MAD TV at that point.Every single component of this movie simply SCREAMS at the audience ""I AM SO AMAZINGLY CLEVER!"" or, alternately ""I AM SO AMAZINGLY LAZY!""  It feels like the filmmakers just threw on screen some commonly accepted cinematic signifiers of profundity, social commentary, romance, or what have you, and called it a day. Having stilted line readings and a non-linear plot does not make a film profound.  Having a soundtrack that sounds like a VH1 list show does not make a film clever.  Ending a film with a major sacrifice on the part of one of the main characters is meaningless if you have not earned any sort of emotional investment from the audience.  There is a distinct coldness and distance between the audience and the characters in this movie, which wouldn't be a problem if the movie then didn't expect you to care about the budding of young love and the self sacrifice it compels young lovers towards.  Countless people have told me that this film has literally moved them to tears.  I genuinely don't understand how a movie with such an icy, cynical void at its center could do that.  I'm not saing that I sit around and watch Shakespeare in Love on an endless loop all day, but this movie claims it's one thing (love/coming of age story), but does everything in its power to convince you otherwise.  It lacks commitment to any one point, outlook or plot thread and ends up not accomplishing anything; that is, anything aside from annoying me to the core of my being.Oh, and Drew Barrymore's performance was stunningly bad."	1.0	If I could time travel, I'd tell me not to see this movie	2005-01-21	57	23	34

When I hold a movie in high regard, I try to wait as long as possible between viewings so I can experience the story with the same awe - and often more - than the first time.I'm not in any way knocking the fact that many people watch their favorites quite often. My husband and I are especially inclined to do that with comedies full of great one-liners that make us laugh by simply quoting something (Christpher Guest movies are a good example). But personally, I need to be in the right frame of mind - with very little distraction - when I watch an intense film that requires attention to detail.It's been a little while since I last saw Donnie Darko, and I was very hesitant tonight to watch the director's cut because I didn't want to risk having the story spoiled somehow. I'm glad I decided to because it didn't change a thing for me. But I'm also very thankful that I've seen the original several times because it was a thrill to ""get it"" ... and even more so each time I watched it.If the only version that had ever been released was the director's cut, I wouldn't have a different view about the film. No offense intended to anyone, but if you've watched both versions and are still at a total loss as to what happened, this movie is definitely not for you. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!If you're like me and you do not have every detail of the theatrical version burned to memory, the difference between it and the director's cut was not monumental and didn't change my perception in any way. Now I'm compelled to watch the original again so I can compare the two.For those who haven't seen the film: the acting is superb, the story is very compelling, and it's probably not at all what you were expecting to see.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Donnie Darko is one of those films you will either love or hate. I sort of love this movie, I saw it over a month ago and still can't get this dark comedy out of my head. Jake Gyllenhaal tends to overact sometimes but overall, his performance as the title character is quite engaging. His sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars, she is such a powerful and intense actress. Even Patrick Swayze is a marvel, probably his finest performance of his short, amazing career. The premise is really outrageous but Donnie Darko will leave you scratching your head and that's a good thing!	4.0	Sleepwalking teen.	2010-08-26	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.  After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film.  One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction.  This is something to think about when you watch this edition.  The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change.  Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer.  That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities.  He does this by adding chapters from the book ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences.  Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality.  This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie.  We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist.  There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition.  I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original.  There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.  This powerfully sealed the film for me.  It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him.  It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place.Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.  The way the director wanted it to be.  We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake.  The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film.  Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad, Mad World""?  It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film.  Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel?  The truth is out there?  Not unless you have seen this film.  There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film.  This was not the case here.  Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story.  The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch.  It will be up to you to see if this is true or not.Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list.  I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut.  It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come.  You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today.  It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.Grade: ***** out of *****"	5.0	The search for God is absurd?	2004-11-07	19	17	2

To me, great movies mirror great books, in that, they require numerous visits, and analysis.  Sure, I am a fan of the accesible, I mean who isn't?  But movies like Donnie Darko possess images, and thoughts that stick with a viewer.  In fact, I have watched this movie about 3 times, and only now am I appreciating the mind-blowing story and symbolism this movie has.  Donnie Darko is, essentially, about a young boy's journey into adulthood, and how he percieves the fake world around him.  The movie can not be catagorized, it is everything a movie should be....and more.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3838A26JR72NX	Aisr' moi	Donnie Darko is indeed one amazing film. It's unclassifiable as a genre but it still manages to confuse you, make you laugh and think. It's not an easy movie to fully comprehend from one viewing alone -that's why i bought the director's cut. The film's audio and image are top-notch quality, and i like the little changes that have been made on both by director Richard Kelly. The second DVD (Extras) is completely unnecessary in my opinion as it doesn't add anything to the movie or help you understand the plot any better. The commentary by Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma etc.) is informative and entertaining -I just wish Kevin would talk less, it kind of feels like he's always on the edge trying to give his input. Nevertheless it is a reccommended buying, go for this if you buy it first time, for those who own the original 2001 DVD edition it's still worth buying for the aforementioned audio/video improvements.	5.0	Great film	2005-09-13	1	1	0

You never doubt for a second that every one of these characters, especially the darko family,  has something hidden inside of them that is just on the verge of bursting out.. i think this is mostly due to the fine acting... which deserves congratulations all around.it was a touch of genius to have this film set in the 80s.. it adds a rich and unmistakable atmosphere to it, although it could be set in almost any time period, because the story is somewhat timeless.. (no pun intended)i would reccommend this movie to open-minded movie watchers.  for instance... if you liked memento and mulholland drive... or even if you didn't like those movies, but want to see something a little different from the average shoot-em-up explosion movie or sappy ""chick-flick"" with no purpose."	5.0	a beautiful film, hilighted by dashes of dementia	2002-03-27	1	0	1

I wasn't expecting much, since I had heard nothing about it, so I sat down and prepared myself for a visit to the land of mediocre.I've never been so wrong.This movie sucked me in from the very first frame...

This movie is my personal pick for best all around rental of last year.As soon as I finished viewing the movie, I went to the bathroom, went to the kitchen and made a snack, put on my night clothes, and watched it AGAIN!  Donnie Darko is the kind of movie that you can realize something new every time you see it.  It truly is a BRILLIANT piece of cinema. I of course bought the DVD the very next day (thank you Amazon.com!), and have watched it a good 15 times since.  I've lent my copy to other friends, who have immediately gone out and gotten their own copy, and thanked me for hooking them up with such a fantastic movie.This movie isn't a ""must rent""  It's a ""must own"".My hat is off to Drew Barrymoore and her production company.

Don't be fooled by the movie cover, it's actually a lot better than you'd be led to believe... and I don't consider it to be a horror movie by any means, so disregard the little catch-phrase.Just to answer many of those who do honestly believe that this movie ""sux"" or whatever, I can't tell you that you're opinion's invalid... but personally I really love this movie, and in my books its up there with the likes of fight club.  One of the defining attributes that makes this, what i consider to be, a ""good"" movie, is that the viewer isn't force-fed a cut-and-dry series of events.  There is some ambiguity in what goes on in the movie, and that is what I believe drives it in a direction that entices thought and discussion.  The non-sense about how this movie is anti-christian or whatever else is purely based upon that individual's interpretation that Frank was actually a divine messenger or likeness of, but that is by no means the only reasonable possibility.  In any case, the story deals too much with the theme of fate and chance to really be seen as a slug at christianity.  It does however do a good job at poking fun at the 80s and some school-experience jokes... i.e. ""if there is any vice-presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle"", and the love/fear exercise.I gave this four stars because although it is very good, i think it could've been better... i have yet to see the director's cut and perhaps i would view that as a 5/5.  This movie is very well done, with well-composed music and an enjoyable story.Anyone who wants to get a ""preview"" into what this movie is somewhat like or who has seen it and wants to know a bit more, check out donniedarko.com"	4.0		2004-11-17	6	3	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2PUYMR4W89GUY	Amanda	First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is an outstanding actor, and I believe this was the first film I ever saw him in. I was totally entranced with the film even before the opening credits finished popping up on the screen. Jake plays Donnie Darko, a young man with a sleeping disorder that has him waking up in strange places (far away from his house, even). Usually, he is drawn out of the house at night by a gigantic bunny - actually, a guy in a bunny costume. Yes, it's really weird. But one night, the vision of the bunny man saves his life, as he is lured out of his bedroom not too long before a big piece of a plane comes crashing down on his bed - where he would have been at the time, if it weren't for his darn strange sleeping habits. This scene sets the stage for what is, I think, one of the strangest movies ever - and the most original.The film also stars Jake's real-life sister Maggie, as Donnie's sister. Patrick Swayze turns in a humorous performance as one of those annoying motivational speakers. Drew Barrymore plays one of his teachers, and Jena Malone is good as Donnie's love interest. And while all of their performances are good, none of them are as good as Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives a haunting, mesmerizing performance that will stick in your mind. If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest doing it on DVD, because I found the audio commentary to be extremely helpful. The reason for this is that there is a lot in this movie I don't really get (the ending, if you ask me, is a weird one, and would love it if someone could please tell me their take on it), and especially the actor commentary was helpful; little things are actually pointed out that could be crucial to understanding the film, or at least it is cool to see how everything sort of all comes together in the end.I don't think this film is for everyone, and a lot of people are going to probably start watching and decide it's too eccentric for them, and not even finish it. But I urge anyone to at least give it a chance, even if it is just for Jake's performance. I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but I can guarantee the film will stay with you for a while.	5.0	Really Weird...But Utterly Mesmerizing	2003-02-17	5	4	1

He often finds himself waking up in places he didn't fall asleep and his family is so accustomed to it that it's practically humorous.  Troubled teen takes new meaning when a demonic rabbit appears to Donnie and sends him down a road which will change not only his life but the lives of his community.  In therapy and on anti-psychotic drugs you are forced to decide whether the good Doc or drugs are helping or hindering.  Good Donnie or bad Donnie?  The decision shouldn't be a hard one while you waft through a parade of lifeless characters that seem to be gasping for breath only because it's second nature to keep trying.  A psychological thriller to say the least with some sci-fi thrown in for good measure.  A very interesting flick--not for those who dislike trying to figure it all out.

As for the fact that this one came with a collectable tin, plus I got the limited edition Hot Topic version, so I got a necklace with Frank the demented bunny as the pendant; that was just the cherry on top. I  highly recomend this version to anyone who isn't a theatrical version purist and likes to get a little bling with their Darko...	5.0	Awsome-so glad I payed the extra money	2010-10-09	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A30IGY6U20D3C7	Amazon Customer	"I am not here to attempt to explain this film. There's no way to do so, really; even with the most thorough, scene-by-scene, clear as mud analysis, you'll still be trying to figure it out for days after you first see it. It was meant to be left up to interpretation. If you're looking at reviews to decide whether or not to get the thing, just rent it first. Cheaper. Or borrow it from a friend (free), because you're bound to have a few who own it. Believe me, once you've seen it, you'll be SURE you want to purchase it. (Unless you dislike it, in which case I can't help you.)Instead I am typing this in order to urge you to disregard the  one-star review (dated 11/17/04) by ""Lance Christian"". He says, and I quote, ""Donnie Darko is just a total attack on religon esp. Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold.All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent."" First of all, study your punctuation. Secondly, please know what you're talking about before you open your mouth. This movie is not an attack on religion. It's quite the opposite. Anyone with any sort of an open mind can see this clearly; if you want proof, kindly refer to the deleted scenes of this DVD. The third one is an extended version of the first sequence between Donnie and Frank. Listen to the commentary on this. It clearly states that Donnie Darko is a movie about DIVINE INTERVENTION. I think Richard Kelly, the creator, is a bit more knowledgeable on the subject than some random, utterly ignorant ""little windbag""."	5.0	...	2005-01-05	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AGM229KQHIJTB	"Amazon Customer ""kwietman"""	"The director's cut of Donnie Darko serves to further amplify a film which alternately puzzled and enthralled moviegoers.  Not much of a commercial success in the US, the film did very well overseas, and this is spotlighted in the documentary portion of the second disk, which interviews fans in the UK in 2004.  The actual film is fleshed out by an extra 20 minutes of footage, mostly explanatory passages that clear some of the ambiguity surrounding Roberta Sparrow and her book.  These extra scenes, however, do not detract from the sense of never knowing whether the film actually deals with time travel or the hallucinations of a schizophrenic main character.  This, coupled with the many genre-crossing elements of the file, are what make it a modern classic.  There are scenes which look like an update of The Breakfast Club, complete with 80's pop music (including a new track by INXS); science fiction, involving complicated theories of time travel which actually correspond with modern thought on complexity theory; spiritual allegory, with Donnie cast as a messianic figure sacrificing himself to save the world; and coming of age drama complete with first love and rebellion.  Through all of this, director Richard Kelly never speaks down to his audience, giving them nothing they can't figure out on their own.  At the time of the theatrical release, the website was a marvel, giving tantalizing clues to the origins of the story and the thoughts behind the characters.  The bonus materials touch on this only a little.  Perhaps the most interesting feature on the second disk is a ""Darkumentary"" film by a young man who explains why he is the film's #1 fan.  This film veers from a laughable portrait of the kind of person who attends Star Trek conventions to a slightly creepy painting of an obsessed fan who ambushes minor actors from the movie to ask them rambling questions about the film's philosophy. He even gets the director's phone number from the Internet, leaving long messages with questions about the fictitious book on time travel.The movie itself is a brilliant piece of work, and I think that the extra scenes are positive more than negative.  They add to the story, and don't detract from the sense of alienation and mystery.  The extras are mostly enjoyable, although I hope that the filmmaker who cornered Mr Kelly at the San Diego Comicon is taking his medication."	5.0	Intelligent, thoughtful and troubling	2005-03-12	2	2	0

I'd only seen part of the original version, so this cut was my first full viewing.I can see how this film has acquired cult status, my daughter loves it and thinks it's much better than The Butterfly Effect, however, I didn't agree, I thought this flick was a bit disjointed.I would definately recommend watching this film if you're into this kind of film, it's certainly entertaining.  Whether or not the film version or the directors cut is better, I'm not sure.  But I do know I enjoyed watching the film and discussing some it with my kid.You'd probably have to be really into the story to want to buy this latest version, but if you're thinking of getting for a gift to the older teen, twenty-something set, you'll probably be doing ok.	3.0	Interesting sci-fi	2005-02-18	13	2	11

Every once in a while, I have to go back and down-grade a bunch of films I reviewed, because a great film comes along and shows me what is really possible given a talented cast and great script in the hands of a good director. This is such a film. The first two acts set up our expectations - a nervous young man with a troubled past and a lot of barely concealed anger is abused in various ways by both kids and adults. He tries to stay in control, but some darkness within makes him stop taking his anti-psychotic medication even as he tries vainly to fight off visions of ""the end of the world"", brought to him by the ghost of Bad Times Yet to Come in the form of a satanic-looking rabbit. Family and frinds just watch as our hero starts circling the bowl. When will he crack ? Then the bomb goes off and this film rockets to my ""must buy"" list. Not only did I not get a Columbine-style ""gun battle"" that the marketing for this film seemed to promise, I found I was in the middle of a supernatural thriller. I will not say much, except that subplots and strange phenomena abound, which are resolved in one of the best third acts I can recall. I waited in vain for the payoff we usually get with supernatural thrillers in which the ""unspeakable evil"" shows up and is actually quite speakable, if not outright lame. What I got was worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense""). This remarkable achievement came not through trickery (hiding the Bad Thing) or cheats (making the Bad Thing invincible), but through not letting the the plot swallow the characters. Instead, the characters are drawn so well that when the Bad Thing reveals itself, (note: the Bad Thing is actually worse than anything we could have expected - it is classic in scope and scale) the characters act accordingly and the emotional payoff just rocks. The resolution of the film was so strong that while I watched it, I was taken in, but when I think back about the events early in the film in context of what I know comes later, I get serious chills. The DVD contains several fully-realized scenes and extensions of scenes in the film, some of which I wish were in the film or at least watchable as part of the main narrative. The commentary, what I heard of it (Blockbuster, two days on a new release is NOT enough!), was insightful, as well it might be given how much was going on in this film. See it, see it see it."	5.0	Forget what you think you know about this film...	2002-06-24	2	1	1

Its great for us teens who dont know what to think about life. It definately is NOT one of those movies you can watch and then be like &amp;amp;quot;oh, it was good&amp;amp;quot;. It makes you think. I watched it for the first time this last Halloween and i havent been able to get it out of my head ever since. Its hypnotic in so many ways. It has a great cast, great script(i think),and a great soundtrack!!! It has alot of potential into being a great cult classic.By the way, the docter doesnt call in regards to his girlfriend.	5.0	Touching	2003-11-26	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2NK78PA072QNP	ammarce	I know that a lot of people go around slapping five star ratings to every other movie, but I have to say that Donnie Darko is truly a brilliant film.  It's dark, clever, and more than anything, intriguing.  Another reviewer claimed that it did not have a satisfying twist for a conclusion but I must disagree.  I believe that this film will leave the viewer with an intense but reasonable mix of being creeped out, confused, angered, and depressed.  After a couple viewings of this film, thoughts of the main character(s) linger in your mind in a way that may actually make you want to cry.  The plot and storyline are stitched together perfectly with just enough said, just enough implied, and just enough left to be pondered.My biggest recommendation though is that you view this on the dvd version.  The special features are a must and bring a lot more to the experience.  Last but not lease, visiting the movie's site (donniedarko.com) after and only after fully digesting the film is an interesting way to add to it's sensations.	5.0	a beautiful and somewhat depressing film	2002-06-12	4	3	1

Good special effects that don't overwhelm the film.*Rather interesting story (although it's very weird and hard to figure out; at the very least, everything came into full circle though).*Interpreting the story is only half of the fun.  There are also many thought-provoking elements regarding theology, the nature of humanity, the nature of youth, and the nature of space and time.*Characters are good; acting was great.  I could almost relate to the title character, as he tried to stand up against so many self-righteous adults.*Frank is probably the freakiest bunny rabbit I've ever seen.*Good music.The Bad Things*Good luck trying to figure it out! Aside from being strange, it's also quite complex.Definately the strangest high-school film I know of, but also probably the most thought-provoking.  It's definately more than a story about a schizophrenic kid; there are many different elements, both visual and in the content, that are crammed into the film.  At the very least, it will leave you trying to figure out the plot.  Then, perhaps you'll be thinking about the characters or the themes.  It's definately food for thought.The DVD has good video and sound quality.  The two-disc special edition includes a fifty-minute production diary, about forty minutes of fan cult featurettes, some storyboard comparisons, and the trailer.	4.0	Life in the Tangent Universe	2008-07-18	2	2	0

It's supposed to be weird and if you like a film that makes you shudder as you're trying to figure it out then, again, this one's for you.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	A very strong directorial debut, `Donnie Darko' is a very modern twist on those tapestry films so many wannabe auteurs seem to be spilling out these days.  What is so great about `Donnie Darko' is that it remains oddly focused throughout the compelling insanity thrust onto every frame.  The core of `Donnie Darko' isn't as clear as some may want it to be, but that is half the fun.  Melding genres together to create something wholly original; it is safe to say that this film is unlike anything you've ever seen before.  Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the emotionally reserved young man who talks to giant rabbits and becomes obsessed with time travel.  As the world continues to evolve around him, Donnie finds himself increasingly fixated on a world inside that world, one that moves him and propels him to conclusions that will warp your mind.  The cast is extensive (Swayze, McDonnell, Barrymore, Malone, the hot Gyllenhaal...) and they all play their part, making the most of limited screentime to create whole characters that are interwoven into Donnie's destiny.  UGH, and please don't compare this to `Urban Legends' and `Final Destination'.  Those films, while entertaining to a point, are trashy slasher films that serve no purpose but to scare the audience.  `Donnie Darko' is a smart and provocative thriller that haunts more than it outright scares.  This isn't a film you can watch once and wholly appreciate.  This is a film that you need to explore.If you dare.	5.0	All aboard the train to Crazy Town...	2011-09-13	2	1	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3T767O02CHFN1	Andrew Hamada	(Please note: this review is intended for those already familiar with the original theatrical release of Donnie Darko, but have not yet seen the director's cut)Donnie Darko seemed to be a movie that people agreed to disagree about: lots of people loved it, hailing it as a great film, while others despised it, calling it a glib attempt at a sci-fi horror film.Either way, I think the Director's Cut is a vast improvement over the theatrical release.  Without ruining it for those who haven't seen it, I can say that almost all of the added scenes contribute directly to the viewer's understanding of the movie.  Although some may argue differently, I felt that the knowledge I had available because of the extra scenes greatly enhanced the viewing experience, because so many more aspects of the movie made sense.  Several plot devices that seemed thrown together in the theatrical release are much more justified because of the added content.Aside from the amazing amount of plot comprehension made available, some of the extra scenes added much needed depth to the characters (especially Drew Barrymore's character, whom I felt had a lot of potential but ended up being something of a walking cliche).Since it hasn't been released yet, I can't say whether the DVD extras will be worth it or not, hence the tentative four star rating instead of five.	4.0	Donnie Darko done right	2005-01-25	7	3	4
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A14MOU9MF0NNVB	"Angela ""Angel"""	I'm still debating how I feel about this movie. I know that I'll have to watch it a couple more times to pick up on all the little things and connections. Overall, for now, I appreciate schizo Donnie as the hero - giving his own life for the sake of others - in the end which is really the beginning and the end. Oh, and obviously the guy in the bunny costume, Frank, was really freaking freaky. I'm glad he eventually takes off the suit, though, because that would have given me nightmares if I hadn't known who or what was really inside it. Biggest surprise - seeing Patrick Swayze. I didn't know he was in this movie before I started watching. He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again. Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit. Yes, I do think this was a good movie, even though I don't fully understand it all yet. I'm still intrigued by the time travel elements. I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind. Oh, and favorite line so far - Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. This movie has some excellent weirdos.Maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real-life sibling actors acting together. This was Jake's first major film I believe (not sure), and he was excellent as dark, troubled, sleep-walking schizophrenic Donnie. Jake has continued to get better and better over the years, and, I have to add, hotter and hotter. I patiently await the day he's up for an Oscar.Next time I watch this, I'm sure I'll have more comments.	4.0	Still debating the darkness, but I liked it...	2010-04-26	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1JXE00AU3FGLL	Anna BookReader	"I watched this at home, and had to wait a few days until I could watch it again.  This movie makes you think, and slightly disturbed me.  I had to allow for 'processing time' before I could give it a second go.  Do not get up to go to the bathroom, try to talk to your friends about the movie while watching this movie or anything.  If you have a fear of large rabbits, don't watch this.  If you don't fear rabbits, you may afterward.The basic story is about Donnie Darko, a sixteen-year-old boy diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He talks to a very large and very creepy rabbit named Frank that predicts the future.  That is what to tell people when you just want to give the short version of this story.  The long version requires a rabbit suit.  To really understand the story line, you have to watch the movie multiple times and listen to the commentary and all the extra stuff and the maybe, just maybe you might kind of understand what really happened.Please do not let this deter you from watching.  The movie is well acted and the story is intriguing.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance I have seen from a young actor in a very long time.  He utilizes his posture, voice and eyes to convince you that he is Donnie Darko.  His mother, played by Mary McDonnell, is excellent.  In response to Donnie's despairing question ""How does it feel to have a freak for a son?""  she simply responds ""It feels wonderful.""  That is the most reassuring thing any parent could possibly say.  Donnie's older sister is portrayed by Jake's real-life older sister, adding to the plot-necessary sibling rivalry beautifuly.  This is Richard Kelly's directorial debut, and he has made his mark.  I fear that his next flim will not live up to the expectation left by Darko.Every character in the film serves a secondary purpose.  Frank the rabbit is Donnie's unconcious mind.  The teachers that Donnie likes (played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle) serve as guides to help him understand time-travel, responsibilty, girls and that nothing is simple.  The one teacher that thinks Graham Greene was a star on Bonanza is a reminder of the failings that all human beings have.  Kelly couldn'tfind a company to release the movie because no one was sure how to bill it.  The back of the DVD box says a 'psyclogical thrill ride', but that falls short of what the movie really is.  Of course, 'a sci-fi dark romantic horror thriller comedy fantasy religious story about being sixteen and having an imaginary pshchic rabbit freind that scares and intrigues you and makes you go sleep golfing' is too wordy for the back of a box.This film has been released twice to theatres (both times limited areas) and didn't do remarkably well either time.  On DVD, it has become a cult classic of sorts.  IMDB lists Donnie Darko as the fifth most requested sci-fi movie of all time.  Simply, this is not a theatre movie.  I don't know anyone who hasn't watched it at least twice, usually more times than that in search of answers.Watch it, and then find a creepy rabbit to help explain it to you."	5.0	Watch it....then watch it again in a rabbit suit....	2005-03-04	7	7	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2HQOYP2GJ6XIU	anonymous-pete	This is a flawed movie that has enough moments of brilliance in it to carry you through the rest. All of the actors are fantastic in their roles (although some of the charicatures in the film remain just that, despite the good acting). Especiialy Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is brilliant -- taking up the role of a schizophrenic Holden Caulfield-type character perfectly. The story is intriguing. The directing and cinematography, brilliant.This is a movie with great emotional punch, but which fails to come together logically in the end. It's a time-travel story with holes in it, and although the holes in logic are filled with touching, emotional moments, the holes in logic are still present.Still, despite the logic-problems, I give it four stars because it has so many moments in it that I can personally relate to. I think anyone who remembers the confusion, ackwardness and frustration of being an adolescent should see this movie, because, truth is, Jake Gyllenhaal brings Donnie Darko to life in the moments when he seems most sane -- when he seems like a kid too smart for his own good, unsure how to deal with a world that isn't the way he would have made it, if he were in charge.If you watch this movie and you remember those ackward adolescent moments you experienced when growing up, you'll find something in Donnie's character to which you can relate. And something in the story that touches you, in one way or other.	4.0	Moments of brilliance	2002-04-20	1	0	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	"Some films are impossible to categorize. Donnie Darko can be seen as horror, science fiction, drama or social satire but in truth it is just art. This is the sort of entertainment that is best experienced in a relaxed state of half dreaming. The plot defies analysis and the bizarre situations that arise are strangely suited to the audience's mood. After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. In fact, it took several sessions to reach a solid hypothesis as to the narrative cause and effect.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubling but not troubled young man who lives in a different world to the rest of us. His average family offers him all the support they can but even Donnie's psychiatrist struggles to understand his situation. The prescription of antischizophrenic drugs seems to do little to blunt his visions, nor do they stop his nocturnal missions. I particularly like the way the soundtrack was gently used to separate the normal from the abnormal. The film's mournful version of ""Mad World"", (originally made famous by Tears for Fears), was one of the musical highlights.One of Donnie's most interesting qualities is that he has no fear of the common-place terrors that exist for the rest of us. He tells his teachers where to shove it, asks the beautiful Gretchen to go steady after only a day, speaks out against the school's guest brain-washer and even copes calmly with murderous bullies. He is however, afraid that the world will end in 28 days and is concerned about dying alone, but then who isn't.The story is interwoven with several mysteries, only some of which are even partially explained in the film. One of the most important of these occurs while Donnie is out one night on the local golf-course, talking to a six foot rabbit named Frank. I don't know if this is an allusion to the James Stewart film, ""Harvey,"" but it is certainly not played for laughs, as Frank is quite sinister. Sometime during this meeting Donnie's bedroom is demolished by a falling jet engine. No one knows where it came from and no airline claims their lost property, but one thing is certain, if Donnie hadn't been AWOL, he'd be very dead.Life quickly resumes. The family's notoriety fades and school life once again regains its position of central torment in Donnie's life. His beautiful and sensitive English teacher, along with his grounded and caring science teacher, (Barrymore & Wylie), fail to offset the damage done by the stressed and misguided gym teacher, Kitty Farmer. She is a disciple of Jim Cunningham, (Swayze), a motivational speaker who reaks of charm and paternalistic love; so much so that Donnie, and the audience, just can't buy into his simple solutions.The film's cast is huge but of an impressive quality, for an ostensibly independent production. All the major characters seemed to go beyond what is expected and create three dimensional beings with quirks, fears and emotions that are subtly alluded to. I particularly enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie. When he is in the sway of one of his visions, the cast of his eye is more disturbing than any million dollar special effect. Beth Grant, playing the Gym teacher, is also outstanding. Her new-age zealotry is the perfect representation of what is truly dangerous in our politically correct society.Along with a great cast, the script is amazing. Not just in its creativity but that it ever managed to get funding. Chock full of unlikely theories, small but convoluted set pieces and thought provoking dialogue, it made the film entertaining, even after several viewings. Small touches bring Donnie's world home to us; like the discussion of the sexual mores of Smurfs, Ms Pomeroy forcing the new girl to sit next to the guy she likes best and an old lady suffering a life-threatening obsession with checking her perpetually empty mailbox.In the end though, it is the greater plot devices that twist our minds like some drug induced mobius loop. Is Donnie some sort of psychotic super-hero? Did everyone remember an alternative future, at the end? Were Grandma Death's theories on time-travel true? If you like pat answers in your entertainment, then you'll be frustrated with Donnie Darko. If however, like me, you like to solve puzzles, you may be prepared to dive into the depths of Donnie's world. Come on in; the water's dark."	5.0	Confusing and bleak but ultimately, rewarding.	2002-11-03	0	0	0

Donnie Darko not only scares you but he entrapes you in his world of bunnies and time travel. The acting is excellent, allowing you to find yourself in each character and making you become invested in everyones individual story.

Unlike all those movies, this movie is about a sensitive young man who is seeing a giant bunny rabbbit. When i heard about it i totally thought it was a comedy. It's not. It's a riveting physocological thriller (i did use a dictionary), and i can't believe i'd gone all of those years without seeing it. FAN-freaking-TASTIC movie!A cautionary note to those who also love this move: DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT WATCH S. DARKO!!!!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3IIYC4PF1DTG9	"Ariel Meadow Stallings ""Author, Offbeat Bride"""	Donnie Darko was a great movie. I was stunned by the concept and execution when I first watched it on VHS. Then I got the DVD and had my brain blown.First off, let me just say that the DVD is packed with features: two commentary tracks, dozens of deleted scenes, the full website (which has crucial epilogue stories, and is only accessible online with difficult trivia paswords), full copy from the book that plays such a vital role in the story and so SO much more. The Donnie Darko DVD is how DVDs should be: filled with features, all of which enhance the film.So, first things first: the director's commentary is AMAZING. If you had any questions after watching the movie (which most everyone did), the Richard Kelly addresses most of them...with humor and charisma. Jake Glyndenhall is also part of the director's commentary, and he's very funny. I especially loved his joke about &quot;FOUR MILLION DOLLARS! We only had FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!&quot; His groundskeeper Willy impression was pretty spot-on, too.The other commentary isn't quite as good...mostly just cast and crew chatting over the film, and Producer Drew Barrymore rambling about whatever.The deleted scenes provide some incredibly important story components, addressing Donnie's medication, who Frank is, and so much more. I couldn't BELIEVE that some of these scenes were cut. Some of them are just such integral aspects of the storyline....and I think you can feel their absence in the film. Richard Kelly provides commentary for these, too, explaining why he had to cut each scene.Reading &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; book that's referenced in the film is a great advantage towards understanding the story, as well. It's a little hard to read all the text on your screen...but well worth the squinting. It's clear that Richard Kelly put a LOT of work into this story, and it's nice to see all that work in one place.Perhaps my favorite part of the DVD were the &quot;Cunning Visions&quot; infomercials. You have to turn the commentary on to appreciate the sheer comedic genious of these things. So so funny. I also recommend reading the website stories before watching the infomercials. It'll all make sense that way. Regardless: &quot;I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE!&quot; HA!In sum, this DVD enhances and explains this wonderful movie, actually improving on the original film. Highly recommended, especially to those who just didn't quite understand what happened in the movie. If you liked the movie the first time around, you'll be as floored as I was with this DVD, and understand why I think this is probably the best DVD I've ever seen. So many features, such great commentary, and beautiful design. BRAVO!	5.0	The DVD enhances this great movie, making it PERFECT!!	2002-07-02	4	4	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3ATTCCO32ZXET	"A. Ryan ""Merribelle"""	"I would go with ""something"", but Superhero is a close second.Just when you think you've seen every plotline under the sun, along comes the most brilliantly tweaked teen angst film in over a decade.  Donnie Darko is a highschooler living in upper middle class suburbia circa 1988.  He has all the usual problems with parents, siblings, teachers and friends that are standard elements of any story about teenagers, but just to top it off he's a bit of a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  One night he sleepwalks out the front door and down to the golf course at the command of a new imaginary friend ""Frank"".  A few minutes later a stray piece of a jetliner falls from out of nowhere and crashes right through the roof of his bedroom.  Donnie realizes that since Frank has saved his life, he is now bound to serve Frank's will.  Oh, and Frank also predicts the end of the world in 28 days.I think that what makes this weirdness work is the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhall.  He was a relative unknown at the time this was made, and I think this allowed him to pull off a very believable performance as a basically decent guy who just happens to have this weird personal rabbit-alien thing telling him to do disturbing things.  Donnie is a kind of secret superhero.  You see this tall, solidly built teenager who is good looking enough to have been popular with the jock-and-cheerleader crowd, but who is too much of a free thinker to care about that sort of thing.  He stands up to bullies in an almost detached manner, hangs around with all kinds of kids and cares for his family.  He is charming in an off sort of way.  You would almost forget that he has a dark side at all if you didn't see this slow, twisted smile creeping across his face at key moments.I would love to delve further into the meaning behind the plot, but that would make for a real spoiler.It's been a long time since I've enjoyed such a quirky, cult-classic-to-be movie.  I loved the social caricatures, the creepy mood and the punctuations of raw emotion in Donnie Darko.  See this movie if you have an appreciation for unusual psychological thrillers, science fiction, a nostalgia for 80s culture and maybe a little bit of weirdness in your own mind.  You will come away thinking about Donnie's universe for many days afterward.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"	5.0	&quot;Sounds like a Superhero or something.&quot;	2004-06-06	8	7	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2BJ41A3PESGV6	Ashley Cavey	Donnie Darko is a wonderful movie. It really can't be placed in one single category, because that would be denying other aspects of the film. There is the psychological aspect (Donnie, a schizophrenic, sees a man in a giant rabbit costume named Frank who tells him to do things), and there's a family aspect (older sister fights with father about voting issues, younger sister is in a dance group, mother is constantly showing worry for Donnie). There's also a kind of relationship aspect with Donnie and the new girl at school, Gretchen, but its extent is lesser than the ones I've already mentioned (if you wanted a sappy romance, go get a Jennifer Lopez flick).I'd really recommend the DVD version, because it has the Mad World music video (I cried the first time I heard it), it has deleted scenes, and if you can stand the ubertiny print, the Philosophy of Time Travel in the movie is available to read on the DVD; it helped me understand the whole jet engine thing.Overall, it is a grand movie; don't pay attention to the bad reviews, because they either didn't understand it or didn't get the message concerning isolation from the rest of society. Or maybe I got it because I myself am thirteen and having a prolonged anti-social thing. Either way, it's a great movie that some people might just not get if they don't give it a chance.	5.0	&quot;How does it feel having a wacko for a son?&quot;	2003-08-17	8	6	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	Donnie Darko had me intrigued within the first two minutes. The music, the tone, and Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliance completely swept me away. Writer/director Richard Kelly has created an altogether awesome movie that is thought-provoking, funny, and sad.This film is a psychological/sci-fi thriller about a teenager named Donnie Darko who is shown prophetic visions by a six-foot tall rabbit named Frank. Are you thinking Harvey? Think again. This is the scariest rabbit I've ever seen in my entire life. The film begins with a jet-engine crashing through the roof and into Donnie's room. Donnie's not sure what to make of this, and spends the rest of the film on a sort of spiritual journey of faith, love, life, and death.This movie left me with so many questions, but after trying to pick this movie apart so I could better understand it, I decided to just give up on it. Take this movie as it is, don't try to nitpick it because it will seriously make your head explode.Everything about this movie is great. Jake gives such a great performance, and he has yet to disappoint me. Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone co-star to create a truly all-star cast. The music is probably my favorite part of the film. The original score evokes the sci-fi/futuristic feeling, but it's also extremely haunting. And the use of the song &quot;Mad World&quot; at the end of the film is the most effectively used song that I've ever seen in a movie.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	5.0	Best Film I've Seen In A While!!	2004-07-29	0	0	0

It was amazing to see everything fall into place and I found my own meaning to the movie and its amazing ending.

Donnie Darko takes on all three and does it admirably. Richard Kelly's first screenplay and directorial debut challenges everything you think you know about time travel and sets it in a wonderful 80's family setting. I loved his family and even though we never know why Donnie's seeing a psychiatrist, we see a slice of his life at home, at school, and in his dreams that alter his and our own ideas about realities.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1IBC9XP2LICQL	A. Wolverton	Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager living in 1988 suburbia.  Sure, there's lots of troubled teenagers in suburbia, so what's new?  Well, for one thing, Donnie keeps seeing manifestations of a guy named Frank dressed in a bunny suit telling him that the end is approaching.No one really understands Donnie, so he rebels against just about everyone and everything except his therapist (Katherine Ross).  Extremely strange things begin to happen as Frank predicts Donnie's approaching rendezvous with destiny.The film is unfortunately loaded with clich&eacute;s:  the troubled teen, the idiot parents, the sympathetic science teacher, the class bullies, the new girl in town...it's everything we've seen before in dozens of other movies.  But `Donnie Darko' does have one thing going for it: it's as strange as a flock of flying pigs.  That weirdness almost makes the movie work, but the film ends leaving so many loose ends that are never tied up.  The extra features should have been a warning sign: when you've got 20 deleted and extended scenes, you've probably got a chopped up story.  Maybe the movie makes more sense with those scenes included, but after two hours, I didn't really want to spend any more time with Donnie Darko.	3.0	Almost Works...Almost...	2003-05-27	13	2	11
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q4OOH30RBJA4	Ayodele Jegede	&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an indie movie, meaning that it's geared towards an audience that doesn't like to sit in front of their televisions like unmotivated stumps. Throughout the entire film Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a dangerously schizophrenic high school student who lives in a California suburb, finds himself losing his mind after his adventures guide him to places he doesn't understand but gains some pleasure in nonetheless. Through and through Donnie finds the world to be an  unforgiving mess that, through a series of lucky manouvers, has not rotated off of its axis. That is, until Donnie discovers how he can change the world.Unfortunately, Donnie isn't the only one confused. The manner in which the [highly talented] cast were callously sprinkled throughout the film, the incessant thematic flip-flopping, and the erratic film style makes it look like the crew was trying too many things at once. It's understandable that films do [and should] pack in numerous ideas and themes--take Darren Aronofsky for instance--but these ideas and themes are also to have coherent direction. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; seems to have that direction, but when you're travelling down the road a theme or idea abruptly stops so that another one may begin. The result is that the film is complete but not fulfilling.Another problem is the fishy issue of time travel that the filmmakers didn't truly develop. Besides a brief and rather conjectural conversation Donnie has with his Physics teacher (played by Noah Wylie), I wasn't convinced that time travel really was a good idea for the film to run with. Unfortunately there are multiple &quot;conversation bursts&quot; as opposed to easy-flowing dialogue throughout the entire movie so hardly anything anyone says is very palpable. All of this serves as a glaring detriment to what could have been one of the more inspired movies of 2001.But this isn't to disparage one from watching the film. I very much appreciated [what i could understand] the frame of the movie, which I would make into a question as opposed to a statement of somesort. &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is, as a forewarning, *very* indecisive but still an enjoyable experience.	3.0	Good, but confuzzled	2003-03-01	6	5	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AZAJH8C60EMCW	Barbara LeMay	"After reading a number of reviews about this movie (both the original theatrical release and director's cut) and finding them somewhat mixed, I ordered both versions to judge for myself. Having never seen this film before, I was kind of excited to see what all of the hub-bub was about.I watched each of these versions twice, and I have to say that I can now understand why some fans prefer one over the other. Without going into detail that would spoil the experience for future viewers, the basic premise of the Donnie Darko story is a conundrum - what is real and what is the product of a troubled or disturbed mind, and how would one ever prove either without any tangible evidence? It's much like proving the existence of God, which is addressed and plays a part in the plot, as is the concept of metaphorical irony.In short, the original cut offers a more thought-provoking experience for the viewer by omitting certain details included in the director's cut that seem to tip the delicate balance in one particular direction. However, it also has a few annoying disconnects to references that begged for a little more depth or explanation.The director's cut, though still quite good, goes a little too far in depth or explanation about certain details that has led some viewers astray from the basic premise of the Donnie Darko story, which is the conundrum. I don't believe that the director intended viewers to ""understand"" or ""solve"" it strictly from one perspective or another, but to consider the irony of the human mind - that the very thing on which we totally rely for our perceptions of the world around us as well as our identity can't always be trusted - and how that irony is manifested in all of us to some extent.As far as the visual and audio qualities of both versions, each offers a unique but pleasurable experience to the viewer. The differences in the musical scores and sound effects between the two versions are few but significant in some scenes, yet don't detract from the main plot of story in any major way. The original cut is faster paced and projects a darker ""feel"" to the viewer, but lacks some of the cooler technical aspects of the director's cut.I realize that some of you came here to find a definitive answer to the question about which version is better. However, as disappointing as it may seem, my final opinion is much like the story of Donnie Darko. It's a conundrum.But whatever you decide, don't use the excuse ""They made me do it"" (LOL - Just watch the movie and you'll get it)."	4.0	Excellent movie!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AIXXI4LW5V6HA	barfhead	"I actually saw this version first and was moved by the enjoyable acting, dynamic characters, strict attention to detail, dark theme, and the cold yet controlled nature of Kelly's doomed split-off world.Perhaps one of the best features of this film is its understated attitude toward Donnie's role (and the roles of all the characters for that matter) in restoring the damaged timeline to causal closure.  It's difficult to tell exactly where the story is going and what each event signifies until these roles are revealed, when the plot suddenly comes together and starts rolling, which was (for me) somewhat like a commoner piecing together an ancient prophecy.I was very much surprised when I subsequently purchased this movie and found that a lot of important information had been cut!  (I didn't realize I had seen the director's cut initially, and had bought the theatrical release).  I actually said out loud ""how could anyone figure out what this movie is about?""  the excerpts from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' and the references to Watership Down, the doomed family (pumpkin carving), and Donnie's sanity resolution had been totally removed.Personally, I think the movie is almost wholly ambiguous in meaning without the majority of this removed information, especially the book excerpts.  While this is not a bad thing (the pacing is much better and the wonderful tone of the film is still in tact with the theatrical release) I definitely prefer this version because it's a true science fiction to me, whereas the theatrical version is more of a thriller/introspective.I certainly don't mean to devalue the original version, it is still amazing by my standards.  I just notice a lot of negative reviews regarding the director's cut and would like to voice some of the positives of this version."	5.0	has a specific vision vs. the theatrical cut	2009-07-15	9	9	0

I have heard that people either love or hate this film after the first time they see it. I was definitley one of those that was impressed. After watching it I only wanted to share it with others for the selfish reason to get their opinion. That is what is nice about this film. It brings up so many issues and ideas that everyone develops their own beliefs and interpretations. I have had many discussions about religion, time travel, love and life because of this film.Donnie- a typical teenager suffering from a mental illness is the focus of this sci fi thriller. I don't want to give anything away so that's basically all you can say. But just be open minded and enjoy the ride, after the film is over you're not even sure if you know what you were watching, or if it even happened.An even further way to experience the film is to go to their interactive website, [...] but I wouldn't recommend doing that until after you see the film.

Things get more bizzare when Donnie's bedroom is destoyed by an airplane engine, his delusions make him believe this is a sign that the world will end in 28 days. Over this period while he is waiting, Donnie's behaviour starts getting more eccentric... and he's stopped taking his medication.That's about as much as I will say about DONNIE DARKO, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The recipient of numerous awards, the movie is a triumph for all involved, especially Drew Barrymore who co-produced the film through her company Flower Films, who also has a small part as a teacher. Patrick Swayze is surprisingly good as a motivational speaker who incurs Donnie's wrath. Keep your ears open for the ""Smurfs"" conversation.

I loved it so much, I saw it 5 times at the cinema, in its extremely narrow and short release in Australia. The cinematic experience of Donnie Darko is incomparable, however multiple DVD viewing is essential. I have never seen so many extras pakced onto one disk! I don't usually bother with extras, but the extended and deleted scenes add immensely to this complex fantasy, which I think could have all easily been left in the full feature.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	Donnie Darko doesn't strike me as suspenseful horror in any shape or form.  More like light elements of psychological weirdness that never really hits you on a deep personal note.It basically consists of a teenager constantly questioning his reality, questioning the possibilities of time travel, and wonders what would happen if you were to change the past so it never happened.  Mental problems perhaps a tad worse than usual for a confused teenager contributes to some wild, hallucinating effects.Now when I was a teenager, I went through problems similar to the kid playing the role of Donnie Darko.  I'd confuse and worry myself silly *almost* to the point I'd wonder if my existence was even real or not.  This resulted in questioning whether the universe was actually real among other crazy problems.  Nothing really out of the ordinary there- most teenagers go through the same phase.  We grow out of them eventually (at least, most of us do) as we accept that death is inevitable, so I can totally see why Donnie Darko is a huge hit among the younger crowd.Perhaps I'm too old to really appreciate it, but many of the scenes felt rather cheesy with Donnie constantly seeing odd, orb-like transparent snake images floating directly in front of his family members and friends while they were walking around the house.  Supposedly the theme is that Donnie was seeing images of a terrible situation that couldn't be avoided.  However...I don't want to spoil the ending because that would ruin everything, but you may be shocked by the conclusion.If anything, Donnie Darko delivers with an interesting storyline that makes you wonder where it's going, and that's it.  I honestly didn't sense any truly earth-shattering deep meaning here.  Obviously the rabbit creature *itself* isn't supposed to be scary- it makes you think because it's an unexplainable hallucination.  So people who are putting down the rabbit creature because it's not scary... well, imagine looking in the mirror and seeing something like that.  Yeah, it would definitely be alarming *then*.Anyway, I really do like Donnie Darko.  There's a variety of characters each with their own assortment of problems and the storyline does a great job focusing and giving enough time to each one of them.  However, the ending... haha.  That ending is just not too good if you ask me.  Perhaps I wasn't looking for a simple explanation after all.	4.0	not really horror	2011-01-13	0	0	0

If you are the type to like the popular, big production Hollywood films like Titanic, Independence Day, Armageddon, or anything of the sort... then this film may be too abstract and unpredictable for you.It is a dark and ominous movie, but probably doesn't qualify for being classified as a Horror film. It's more of a psychological thriller. If you are in your late 20's to mid 30's (if you grew up in the 80's), you should appreciate much of the 80's themes and music. I highly recommend this film to anyone in that age group who is able to handle a more complex, deep, and symbolic story.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AR37967IAR6ZT	Benjamin	"""Donnie Darko,"" with a DVD chock full of interesting extras, is a surprisingly good, creepy little period movie. (Of course, the movie's set in 1988, and its soundtrack, featuring a lot of Tears for Fears music is killer.)In the film itself, Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the great new young actors, gives a performance that stays both vulnerable and frightening as the title character, a disturbed boy seeing a psychologist because he sleepwalks, remains disdainful of his parents (who consider him ""changed"" even before the freaky events of the plot happen) and visualizes, at times, a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him the end of his world is coming in less than a month.Around the time he begins seeing Frank, Donnie's house is hit with a piece of airplane fuselage, which destroys his bedroom. The wreckage is unidentified, for no plane at the time reported losing any of its equipment.At Donnie's school, the staff and students have become involved with an inspirational speaker's new program involving a narrow scope of emotional honesty. Donnie, seeing all as hypocrites, is encouraged to rebel violently by Frank, but Donnie also begins to piece together clues regarding hidden secrets, an uncertain future and, strangely, time travel that hint that Frank may not be all that he seems.All of this leads to an ending that, more or less, makes sense and remains haunting, though it takes multiple viewings to quite ""get"" the film and Donnie's choices at its end.Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore, who also served as a producer on the film, are on hand to give key performances. But the movie belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal. His nuanced performance gives the movie its creepy center."	4.0	What to do when a giant bunny rabbit says the world will end	2003-01-21	6	6	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A36O8CBNXFZBRK	Benjamin Hill	Spoiler Warning.The trick to understanding this movie is to realise that Donnie's alternate reality is a dream/premonition of a possible future that could happen if he chooses to get out of bed before the jet engine hits his room.The alternate reality is a creation of Donnie subconscious mind and Frank is a physical representation of that subconscious mind, within that alternate reality.Frank is the part of Donnie's mind that created the alternate reality.Frank guides Donnie, who is one of the characters within that alternat reality down the correct path.Frank knows everything that is going to happen, how long the alternate reality will exist for and every character within that alternate reality.The time travel idea is another part of Donnie's subconscious mind, which gives Donnie a doorway out of the alternate reality and back to normal reality.Frank and the time travel part of the film are not meant to be taken literally, they are just parts of Donnie's subconscious mind.If you look at the film in this way it will begin to make sense.I think that anybody that gives this film a five star rating in some way understands this and understands how clever and mind blowing this film is.	5.0	An Alternate Reality Created By The Mind of Donnie Darko.	2004-01-04	6	5	1

Yes, it is very original, but also it's very thought-provoking.  I think a few more viewings (and by few, I mean a lot) will be necessary.  Especially, I after I buy it.  Donnie Darko is the story of a teen coming face-to-face with his dark reality.  A strange bunny man visits him during his delusions with talks of time travel and mischievous acts.  Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have minor roles in comparison to Jake Gyllenhaal's part, but all the characters have important roles.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3CGOPCF6FR3GS	Benjamin Seeberger	When I picked up Donnie Darko, I didn't know what to expect.  It had been recommended to me for fans of things like Dark City, and other sci-fi psychological thrillers, so there was a certain sense of awe and mystique that surrounded the film before I got it.If when you finish the film and you don't have a deep sense of the possibilities in the universe, the calling of self-sacrifice, and the beauty of both time and the aspects that make us human, watch it again.When you watch it, try to focus not on the surface teen issues, but instead focus on the meaning of the experience of the film.  Make a commitment to trying to understand Darko's complex character, and what he struggles with in life, and how he reconciles those troubles with the gifts that he has been given (and his gifts are extraordinary indeed).  Oh, and remember that if you're confused through most of the movie, that's good.  That means that by the end, you should have a clear idea of what's going on.  If at any point you think you know what's going on, rethink, and rethink, and rethink again.This is science-fiction, remember.  Although it may claim other things, it is a story about a young boy who we understand at the beginning does not have it all together, and he is fated for things much greater than he knows.  The movie is a riddle, so I leave you to solve the answer.  Don't leave without it.Heartily recommended.	5.0	Fascinating and Deep	2003-08-16	4	4	0

I've watched both and I believe the Director's cut is superior. How can it not be if it is what the director wanted? Not only is the insertion of the songs the way they were originally intended important (and one of the things I love about Donnie Darko is its attention to details), you also have the title pages (from The Philosophy of Time Travel) displayed in the Directors Cut. In addition there are key lines (such as Donnie's therapist's telling him he is an agnostic) and visuals(particulary toward the end in the montage) that can totally change the perception of the film.I picked up a copy of Clockwork Orange recently and was suprised to learn that Burgess's original text released everywhere else (besides the United States) had 21 chapters. In a brilliant intro to the re-released Clockwork Orange, Burgess states that each work created has a duration and a reason for its particular order and that editing it alters the perception of it (he states this edited version in the U.S. also effected Stanley Kubrick's retelling in the film version). In short,the story should be available the way the author,filmaker, or artist intended it to be told or you alter the meaning. In relation to Donnie Darko, placement and pacing are crucial to the interpretation of this film, to alter it is to alter what the director/writer was attempting to convey.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AIMR915K4YCN	"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby"""	Donnie Darko has quickly become one of my all time favorite movies. How can I describe it? It is strange, dark (of course), cool, mysterious, enigmatic, scary, funny, serious, sarcastic, bleak yet hopeful, mystical, and even charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie, who is absolutely believable no matter what he says or does. Time travel? No problem! A seven-foot rabbit named Frank who predicts the end of the world in 28 days? No problem! Donnie's earnestness is mesmerizing. The rest of the cast is an incredible ensemble of big stars in small, crucial roles. Drew Barrymore (E.T., The Wedding Singer, Charlies Angels) plays the only teacher in Donnie's school who seems to realize that what's being passed off as an &quot;education&quot; is actually a long, dull course in mind-numbing mediocrity (hmmm... sounds like my highschool). Noah Wyle (ER) is the science teacher who has wild theoretical conversations with Donnie about time travel, then cuts him off competely when Donnie asks if God might be involved. Donnie's mom is played by Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves, Grand Canyon). She loves him while being frustrated and afraid of his condition. Katharine Ross (The Graduate, The Stepford Wives) is Donnie's psychiatist, trying to probe his mind and help him. Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing) plays Jim Cunningham, tele-guru and local self-help author, who is exposed by Donnie (and Frank) for who / what he REALLY is. Jena Malone is Donnie's new girlfriend Gretchen. She's got problems enough of her own. Together, this cast of characters orbits perfectly around Donnie's dark center of gravity. Do not expect the typical hollywood bucket of swill here! Donnie Darko took actual thought to create. It's style and story are unique. I had never even heard of it due to a less than half-hearted ad campaign (I'm a TV addict, yet saw not one DD commercial). I just happened to see the DVD on the shelf and took a chance.

I do not concentrate on the time travelling aspect of the film, but rather on Donnie's realisation that his mother loves him, the blossoming young love between Donnie and Gretchen and the controversial questions within the film about life and the existence of God. Some of the scenes are so perfectly shot, especially those with music played over them. One such scene is Donnie's bike ride to the 80's vibe of Echo and the Bunny Men. Every time I have watched this film I have cried at the final conclusion even though I know it is coming, because it is so heart wrenchingly beautiful. The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is mind boggling- he has the sickening devious smile working for him and the whole confused adolescent style to his acting. Also, he's not bad to look at!My friends laughed when I told them about this film, and then when they watched it they realized how stunning it was. If I could give you one piece of valuable advice, it would be to watch Donnie Darko as soon as possible!	5.0	touched my heart, played with my brain and fed my soul	2004-06-22	1	0	1

Kintner	"this movie came highly recommended by reliable friends, yet i have to disagree with them...  the key problem is the script which many tout as making the movie ""unclassifiable"".  combining multiple and disparate genres it fails to make sense, create a suspension of disbelief, or offer original dialogue.  particularly cliched dialogue served up by drew barrymore and noah wyle made me wince more than once.  while it is commendable to push the envelope by combining genres (and it seems this is what most people are getting all worked up about) this movie doesnt mix so much as hack and chop; one moment youre convinced you are watching a social satire, the next a suspence horror, and the next an after school special, the next a poorly explained science fiction.  the transitions between these sensations are abrupt and illogical.  the viewer is left trying to put together a stylistic puzzle that cant be solved because the puzzle is a result of a lack of clarity and most likely experience, rather than inpired and thoughtful writing."	1.0	don't believe the hype	2002-05-21	36	11	25
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3OXCPZBEKH2YL	"""blackbird357"""	I didn't exactly know what to expect from this film upon seeing it, but it completely blew me away.  It is at once funny, gripping, and extremely creepy.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as the teenage schizophrenic Donnie, and although the rest of the cast is solid, he definitely carries the film.  There were many moments in the film were I found myself going, &quot;Whoa,&quot; and I had to pause it to let my brain catch up.  As the plot deepens, you can see all of these elements and subplots coming together, and it is sometimes enough to widen your eyes and make you shiver as you see another piece of the puzzle snap into place. The film's culmination will stay with you for a long time.  It is probably one of the best films I've ever seen about time travel (and one of the best in general), and it treats the concept with intelligence and skill.  I say &quot;Watch this movie immediately&quot; to anyone who is willing to work some for the answers to the movies they watch.	5.0	This film haunts you and makes you think	2002-04-06	4	2	2

That is the feeling you are gonna get when you are done watching this terribly underrated movie.

Now you are probably waiting for me to explain to you the story or anything else but it is too good. IT's a movie that is so weird but so captivating that it grabs you and shuts you up. You get lost and you just wonder what in God's name is goin on with Donnie and why are all these things happening to him. I have watched the film over 15 times now and I can honestly tell you I still do not have a definite answer for the reasons of Donnie's misfortunes. This movie also contains an all star cast but I don't think that will matter at all in the end because the story itself is one that you will have disect and look through backwards, upside down, and through many different opinions as possible.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ	Blahblahblah	"To oversimplify the film, Donnie Darko is about a boy who may have paranoid schizophrenia who is saved from being crushed by an airplane engine which crashes into his bedroom by an imaginary friend that resembles a guy in a demon bunny costume. This new ""friend"" begins manipulating his actions which creates a chain reaction inevitably leading to the end events. Throughout the film Donnie finds himself confronting such issues as predestination vs free will and the existence of God. The story takes place in the late 1980s, apparently so the viewer will have some expectation of what won't happen in Donnie's future.The time travel plot provides moments of interest, but is ultimately weak and pointless.  I cannot give a full critique without spoiling the ending, but this storyline completely contradicts the point the film is trying to make (see below for more details). However, where the film excels is as a character study of Donnie himself and his interactions with several other interesting characters. Some of the other characters are a bit one dimensional, but that is the point. Such shallow people do exist in real life and never look at the world with the amount of depth or imagination that Donnie does, and seeing the two extremes come into conflict is priceless. This is one of the funniest satires of suburban life I have seen since American Beauty.If Richard Kelly were more confident to stick to straightforward storytelling and directing (the shifts in camera speed for example are just annoying and campy) and left out the superficial gloss and unnecessary time travel storyline, this film would be a true masterpiece. He does appear to have the potential to create surreal masterpieces like David Lynch, but he first has to figure out how how to avoid completely contradicting himself. It will be interesting to see which way he goes in the future; if he'll make the next American Beauty or the next Mulholland Dr. Maybe he'll surprise us and make a more successfull hybrid.SPOILER: The film is supposed to divine intervention leading to Donnie's self-sacrifice. However, the tragedies at the end of the film are solely caused by this intervention.  For example, Donnie would not have flooded the school or burnt down the kiddie porn house or visited Grandma Death's house without the encouragement of the bunny, so his mother would not be on the plane, his teacher wouldn't have been fired, his girlfriend would not have been killed,  nor would the guy in the bunny suit have even died if not for his own intervention!  So the whole film lacks even any internal logic (something essential to any surreal film), Donnie's ""self-sacrifice"" is just plain stupidity, and the emotional impact of most of the events in the film is completely undermined."	4.0	Amazing but Flawed	2003-02-07	6	3	3

It contains the sarcastic wit of a comedy, the thought-provoking elements of a psychological thriller, the scientific edge of a sci-fi film...What made this film one of my favorites was the fact that I was pondering it weeks afterward. My friends and I would discuss several different possibilities for why the way it ended the way it ended. Though I never quite got it until I watched the commentary on the DVD with the director, Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which is very humorous as well as informative to the aspect of the 4th dimension in the movie.As for DVD extras, they are not disappointing. There are several quite relevant deleted scenes that include a scene in which Donnie's psychiatrist tells him that his pills to treat his schizophrenia are placebos as well as an alternate (more gory) alternate ending.Overall, this movie is one of the most inventive and groundbreaking films of the last ten years, if not more.	5.0	Take a waltz in the 4th dimension.	2004-05-24	2	2	0

Then some pseudo-science mumbo jumbo about worm holes and time travel, some pointless 'weirdness' to give it that arty profound aura and top it off with a 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' type ending that leaves the movie in limbo. Was it all a dream, was Donnie completely delusional, was it 'magic', did the director run out script and need a quick out? And why is Donnie so troubled, he seems to have a pretty good life on average, his bleak view is never explained or justified.

I didn't really expect much, but I must say that this is a brilliant film. Great cast, very well shot & has spine-tingling moments (my favorite bit is when they are in the cinema), great soundtrack, Frank the rabbit is a stroke of genius - makes it a bit of a horror film. I could imagine this being a remake of a Japanese Manga film (I assume it isn't) because it has the same style. It left a few unanswered questions, but on the whole the idea is very interesting and original. Made me think (which doesn't happen very often). This definitely is a special film.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2SJXOV5UTYBJU	"Boondagger ""Steve-o"""	"This version of Donnie Darko is superior to any version released before. There are numerous differences ranging from the musical soundtrack to uncountable additional scenes pepped throughout and re-editing of some of the old scenes.I think that the most important addition in this movie are the periodic pages of ""The Philosohpy of Time Travel"" that flood the screen. They fortell the epic ending and cast a bit more light on the unseen story from the older versions. I found myself pausing the movie constantly so I could read them completely. While they are still as vague as you might think, they do serve a purpose to the end result.Sound effects have been added and changed though the entire movie as well. Most notable is the addition/modification of the Abyss-style liquid spears' sound effects. Now they sound more mechanical than liquid. Another major addition/change is the inclusion of the pixelated monitor filter used on many vision sequences. It's seemed out of place at first, but that's only because I was used to the original version. But it works.It's so hard to list everything different in this version, but if you're a fan of the original, you simply must see this version. I absolutely love it, even though the ""Echohead and the Bunnymen"" song from the beginning was changed. It's almost like a new movie. This has always been a dark movie, but now the brighter colors seem to have been emphasized and sharpened more than before.My favorite scene, the movie theater/portal scene has even been updated. It now has an even more ominous feel to it, if that's possible. The one thing that old fans may/may not like about this version is that Donnie Darko is sort of painted with the ""chosen one"" brush. While I don't mind this because it is still done in a crazy head trippin' way, it doesn't feel quite as inexplicable.The movie oozes so much more artistic style this time around. This is truely the director's original vision, and I think a fantastic example of what a DVD re-release should be. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love it when my favorite movies receive this kind of treatment."	5.0	The  flashy enigma returns	2005-10-20	5	4	1

I lied. Not exactly lied, but distorting the truth a little bit - I was reccomended DONNIE DARKO after buying Memento, but it seemed a bit much for my taste - end of the world, time-travel, aliens, giant bunny rabbits - it sounded like an artistic mess David Lynch is capable of delivering combined with a talking animals in clothing (talking chimps come to mind that should be forbidden) - but it intrigued me enough to keep an eye on it.After a few months, I visited a friend I haven't seen a long time and he says: ""I have something to show you..."" He plugs in his PC and shows me the beginning of  Donnie Darko. I was struck in awe after an introductory bicycle scene and the decision was made. I made him stop the movie so I can enjoy it with the real 5.1 sound and picture. I ordered it at the amazon the very same day.Upon writing this review, I thought to myself: ""Rather than telling you what the movie really is about, I'll tell the story of how I came to become a very satisfied owner of it."" So, I did that and hope to induce enough intrigue for someone to buy or not to buy the movie. But, in my humble opinion, everyone who considers himself or herself  movie-buff must have this film.I almost forgot! The DVD is loaded with excellent extras, including a whopping 20 deleted or extended scenes with or without commentary, but believe me - after seeing the movie you won't be able to go through that unless your heart is made of stone or you're a Vulcan... Or simply if you're stupid and say: ""I don't get it."" But then, why bother with this?

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A8TM0MI3D9T29	Brett Corkins	"This is one of the few movies that keeps you thinking about it days after watching it. The basic plot is enough to stimulate even the most genius of people. As far as the acting goes, you really don't get much better than this. What makes this movie leaps and bounds better than other movies of this sort is that the execution is flawless and it makes you think. From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing at what might happen next.The story revolves around Donnie Darko, a teen that doesn't quite fit in. He has two sisters and parents that are making him see a shrink. It's with his shrink that some of his inner-most thoughts are spoken. It's also with his shrink where he tells of his encounters with the mysterious Frank. Gretchin, his girlfriend, does help to take his mind off of the strange happenings that are going on around him at times, but at night is when everything happens to him. Mrs. Sparrow, also known as ""Grandma Death,"" seems to be his guide through what he experiences throughout this film. Her book, The Philosophy Of Time Travel, becomes Donnie's bible through his troublesome 28 days.As I stated earlier, the acting is second to none. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) couldn't have portrayed a troubled teen better. Every second he's on screen you just become engrossed with him, nobody could've done a better job. Jena Malone (Gretchin) is also believable. She too is a troubled teen with an extremely perilous past. Her and Jake's romance is, to say the least, acted out perfectly. Also along for the ride is Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell. All of which seem to have brought they're A game. Donnie's family, I feel, was casted perfectly. The way they interact and talk to each other is so true to real life it's scary. Part of the reason they mesh so amazingly is because Jake's real sister was cast as his sister in the film. Pure genius.Overall this is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. However hard it is to understand you are rewarded greatly for paying attention. The ending, while I was a bit disappointed for them not including the extra bit, was amazing. A great end to a flawless film. I also really admired how they didn't just spell everything out for you, they let you fill in the blanks with what you think might've happened. The movie couldn't have been better."	5.0	Worth every minute of your time	2005-02-23	7	7	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3KMTOFTUUNFHG	Brett D. Cullum	DONNIE DARKO got a very limited release in 2001 because it dealt with an airplane crashing.  Not that the movie had any other connections to terrorist acts, but that was enough to stifle this well-made indie flick in its theatrical run.  But the DVD brings it to life in a very full way, and with LOADS of extras.The story is twisting and would make David Lynch's head spin!  Donnie is just your average all-American teen who sees big evil bunny rabbits on golf courses telling him about a coming apocalypse.  He survives a plane engine hitting his house thanks to his visions.  He may or may not be schizophrenic, or touched in a special way.  He commits violent destructive crimes in his sleep, but they bring retribution somehow.  And he may or may not be seeing destiny forming in front of his family - I mean this literally in a physical sense.  Is he crazy?  Is he a savior?  Maybe both.The cast is SUPERB!  Drew Barrymore who also produced, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wylie, Catharine Ross, and Beth Grant all make strong use of their characters.  The movie is bursting with eccentric well-constructed characters from Donnie's family to his friends.  There are no weak links here!And technically the movie is beautiful.  Set in the mid 80s, the production design is dead on with just small touches here and there.  The music is affecting!  The camera work is sublime!  Even the special effects work incredibly well given the budget.  This is a labor of love for all involved and it shows.And the DVD is the same labor of love.  Two commentaries, deleted scenes, trilers, easter eggs!  You could spend days on this disc and never get tired.This is a no brainer!

The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is not only a cult classic, but a major cinematic phenomenon that has attracted an immense following. Considering the content of this film you might even go so far as to say it has established a ""congregation"" of its own.So sit down, relax, strap yourself into your favorite chair and say a quick prayer in preparation for a hallucinatory journey through the brilliant but borderline schizophrenic mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager dealing with a constantly shifting world of multiple dimensions.Jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection. Add to Jakes' nuanced performance the unnerving visual of a human-sized demonic entity dressed in a very bad rabbit suit and you have the makings of an experience unlike anything you've ever seen.A word of warning is necessary. Beware of possible side-effects after viewing this film. It you start hearing a low, modulated voice speaking to you in the darkness of your room make sure to have some rabbit food handy.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AMGAHUCTYT3F5	Brian Tegtmeier	"Even though the Director's Cut is the ""vision"" of Richard Kelly, the tweaking of the DVD has not been well recieved. From the changing of music, new Frankie voice-overs like ""mail her a letter"" and the cheesy computer graphics, the Director's Cut DVD is better left in the bargain bin. Don't get me wrong... it is still a great movie and I liked the 20 minutes of extra footage. My biggest problem (besides the handholding of the film to you) is the ""computer grid"" effect at the climax with the fireworks.

Look at the jet engine being hauled away and notice the strange red swirl, almost as if it were dreamt up. Buy the DVD I guess, maybe the commentary can shed some light on the matter.

It is definitely something you will be thinking about for days because it isn't super straightforward plot-wise(you are going to have to be an intelligent audience member.. they don't spoon feed you) and thematically there is kind of a lot going on.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2A0YGAQ4V66UJ	Brook Plog	"Part Greek tragedy, part teen-angst drama, part music video, part surrealist set-piece; Donnie Darko tells the story of a young man living, like a stranger, within his own family while dealing with very real demons of schizophrenia and self-imposed isolation and an (imagined?) demon in the form of a hellish looking 6' talking rabbit named Frank.  There is a seething undercurrent of rage, frustration, and teenage existential confusion throughout the movie, which is brilliantly woven together with supernatural and science fiction elements.  Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the title character who's above-average intelligence and disconnected, fatalistic viewpoint and morbidly ironic sense of humor eerily portray the mindset many loners who find themselves on the fringe of high school society.  The ""Sparkle Motion"" dance sequence evokes memories  of Nirvana's ""Teen Spirit"" video with its slow-motion film style and backdrop of anarchic destruction intercut with a school talent show.  Notable performances given by Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and the star's real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (playing Donnie's sister, Elizabeth Darko). The moody score and dark 80's new wave soundtrack heighten the sense that this movie conveys visually and narratively; a sense of foreboding and of imminent disaster and that the protagonist is on a journey of discovery, but one that may lead to answers he may not be prepared to cope with; one which he is compelled, like a prophetic dream, to see through to the end.  The DVD has the added bonus of containing the music video for Gary Jules' brilliant and haunting cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"" which, now three years after it's inclusion in Donnie Darko, is gaining much deserved radio play."	5.0	a wierd journey worth taking	2004-04-20	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AZLC3D46UHOAK	Bryan Weber	"This is absolutely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen. Focusing on troubled teenager Donnie Darko, this movie is set in the month of Oct. 1988, amid the political backdrop of the Bush/Dukakis election.Late one October night, Donnie has a dream about a six foot tall, nightmarish bunny named Frank, who tells Donnie that the world is going to end on Oct. 30. He returns home to find a jet engine lodged into his bedroom, an engine that no-one can trace.The next day at school, Donnie encounters Gretchen, a beautiful girl with a troubled past. She and Donnie become friends.Meanwhile, the school is preparing for a visit by a New Age philosopher named Jim Cunningham (brilliantly played by Patrick Swayze) who tells people that he can eliminate their fear.Madness or prophecy? That's the question we are forced to ask ourselves at each turn, every time that Donnie has a vision of Frank.Donnie confronts Jim Cunningham at a school assembly, seeing past the man's empty promises. Donnie tells Jim that he is ""the AntiChrist"".All the while, Donnie is obsessed with the idea of time travel, fueled by a book written by a woman he knows, a woman who has told him that all creatures on this Earth will die alone.Haunted by strange visions, Donnie is aware of the ever-approaching deadline for the end of the world, falling more and more in love with Gretchen.I can't say much more without spoiling the ending of the film, but I will say this. Donnie Darko is a romantic suspense film about sacrifice and redemption.And the DVD itself is full of extras, with twenty deleted scenes, a mock infomercial about Jim Cunningham and his philosophy, cast bios, a beautiful music video, and pages from the book The Philosophy of Time Travel.With no gratuitous violence, nudity, or gore, this film is purely driven by the characters and their circumstances, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to think for themselves."	5.0	Why Are You Wearing That Stupid Man Suit?	2002-04-12	19	15	4
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A19VGN2IUF7YXY	Bucky Beaver	The name Donnie Darko turned me off. But, a friend insisted I watch it. My first viewing left me confused and depressed. I did not know what I had seen. Yet, it worked on me for several days to where I got up courage and watched it again.Donnie Darko is a film that deals with all manner of existential issues. It does not spell out the answers because Richard Kelly wants each person to think about the film and draw his own conclusions. At least, I feel he does.The best way to aproach this film is to realize that reality is bent creatively to express ideas that cannot be expressed any other way. Donnie Darko is a Christ figure whose sacrifice allows those he loves and even those he does not know to either redeem themselves or have a chance to live a life without tragedy dogging their footsteps. And, while one would think that as Donnie reverses time there would be no recollection on the part of those whose lives have been altered through his actions, the last scene is of the two people he loved the most waving in tentative recognition of who they are and what they know. And, as we see the small neighborhood boy who explains what has happened wave to Donnie's mother, who is to say this is not Donnie reincarnated in another, happier life?This is a thought provoking movie that is not for everyone. It is beautiful and sad and gloriously uplifting all at the same time. It is a life experience, not just a video experience.	5.0	Eerie...confusing...wonderful...	2006-02-16	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2OTX4X3895YXT	BuyCurious	Excellent mystery/drama/sci-fi movie that grabs your attention from the start and keeps it.  Lots of strange goings-ons, which probably will make more sense with repeated viewings (only seen it once, so far).  Fans of the off-beat will really like this.  Even mainstream audiences (i.e., my friends) have liked this (to their own amazement).Unique, one-of-a-kind film will stay with you for days, as the questions it raises are plenty food for thought.  I didn't really get the ending explanation, but that just gives me a chance to go back and see it again (kinda the way Sixth Sense is different after the first viewing, when you know what's going on).  I found the audio commentary by the producer and main actor to be helpful toward the end...They do offer some explanations about some things you might not have picked up on that are significant.  After I watched this the first time, I went back over the last 15 minutes with the audio commentary on and was surprised to see how detailed the storyline was.  This also helped me to understand the ending better, but I'm still a tad confused, but in a good way (i.e., David Lynch movies).	4.0	Thought-provoking	2003-04-02	2	2	0

A future where you are relatively happy and life has some meaning. But in even that future bad things happen. I suppose this is just a slice of everyday life with an alien that looks like a big rabbit given evil shots. I enjoyed the movie but it is by no means entertaining. When a young man has no future even in a dimension where he survives a jet engine hitting his room, but his girlfriend is ran over and killed, I think you get the point. Although this has a cult following it does have limited watchability by the general public. Most everyone will be glad they saw it as the acting and directing are excellent. The movie's story on the other had is a little strange and may not suit all tastes. We see a few days in the life of a teenager struggling with typical problems but hanging over his head like Damocles sword is his life, the life of a girl he loves, and the life of another man that kills someone by accident.

In my book it committed the cardinal sin of movies and dragged.  Right in the middle it just seemed to be going slower than a dead snail on a salted sidewalk.  It was extremely creative and imaginative, and defiantly one of those movies you will be discussing with friends after seeing it.  The end really threw me.  I didn't see it coming at all.  Worth seeing, but not worth owning.  And if you made it to the end, I would defiantly watch parts of it with the commentary on.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1H6OHMNHGEGZN	Carl Eakins	"For starters, I assume if you're looking into reviews for this directors cut, you've seen the movie proper before.  I don't feel the need to rehash what many other people have already said about the movie.  So if you want a more critical assesment of the film, I encourage you to check out some of those other reviews.  But if you haven't seen the movie before, in a nutshell, just know that it involves a fallen airplane engine, time travel, a creepy bunny named Frank and Patrick Swayze(who may in fact be scarier than the freakshow bunny costume on display).  The movie plays like David Lynch-lite, but unlike Lynch, this actually makes a little sense without racking your brain too hard(I can almost hear Lynch's fans curseing at me now).  The purpose of this cut, as Mr. Kelly says himself, is to try and make the movie closer to what he wanted it to be in theaters.Does it work?  It's longer, that's for sure, but your enjoyment of this cut depends on what you think of the movie.  If you're like the poor s.o.b. who shows up in one of the special features on the disc( more on him later ), than this could could very well help you achieve nirvana(the state of mind, not the band, for you kids out there).  Aside from some of the deleted scenes found on the first dvd release being reinserted into the film, we have some new stuff not seen before.  An additional scene with grandma Death, lengthly looks inside the book and close ups of Donnie's eye, which are very annoyingly the brightest shots in the movie, are included.  I personally don't think the additional scenes added much to the overall picture, if anything, they seem to me to be padding out the running time.The main selling point of this dvd, no doubt, is the commentary with Mr. Kelly and Kevin Smith.  This is a fun track, with Mr. Smith cracking jokes and busting Kelly's chops over the more pretentious qualities of the the movie.  Also included are a production diary(listen to it with the commentary or you'll be bored to tears), ""They Made Me Do It Too"" featurette(fans, mainly ones fron the U.K., sound off), a storyboard-to-screen featurette and the director's cut trailer.  And then, the sad-sack I mentioned earlier has his own featurette, ""#1 Fan: A Darkomentary"" .  This guy has his room plastered with Darko stuff, dresses like Donnie and even stalks James Duval.  He also catches up to Mr. Kelly at the comic-con(a comics related convention, for those who don't know) and confronts him with the worst thing that an obsessed fan can do.So, bottom line, is this dvd worth owning?  People looking to this version for additional insights into the movie might be let down.  If you buy into the whole "" Cult of Donnie "" thing that kids at Hot Topic stores around the country slop up like so much goth-tinged gruel, then this may be your bag of meat.  The commentary did it for me, but you just might want to stick with the first edition."	3.0	More, or less?	2005-02-23	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1LCR3VRIKTA5C	Carl Rylander	"For months and months my friends and co-workers raved to me about the ""originality"" of Donnie Darko, so you can imagine how great my anticipation was as I settled in my Lazy-Boy with my popcorn and soda, preparing to view what my friends had assured me was a masterpiece. What a let-down.The film starts off with promise as Donnie Darko wakes up in a forest with mild amnesia and bicycles home in a frenzy to discover that while he was asleep, a plane had crashed into his home. What's more, one of the plane's engines went straight through his bedroom, which would have killed Darko had he not been sleeping outside. Did Darko have some premonition of this event? It is never revealed.Stupid scene after stupid scene follows, most of which are unconnected to the main plot, which I gather has something to do with time travel. In one scene Darko and his friends discuss whether smurfs have sex lives. In another Patrick Swayze's character (who plays one of those hyper motivational speakers) is arrested for possessing child porn. At some point in the film Darko begins having hallucinations of a man in a gray bunny suit who identifies himself as Frank. I found the scenes involving Frank to be weird and ridiculous and couldn't for the life of me discern how they were tied to the plot. Towards the film's end I began wondering if ""Donnie Darko"" was like Frank - a grotesque hallucination. Surely my friends and co-workers wouldn't lavish plaudits on such a pointless, weird and stupid movie. Maybe, I wondered, they made two Donnie Darko's and I rented the bad one? No such luck, alas.

Donnie Darko became one of my favorites the moment I saw it, and maintained it's position in my heart even many viewings later.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	This film appears to be written and directed with the marketing strategy of appealing to mixed up and angry adolescents in that stage of life where they think the whole world is crazy, absurd, and working against them. It is a science fiction film yet we are given enough background to also think that maybe this is a film about a mentally ill or schizophrenic teenager. The lose ends of the film are eventually resolved, but in a way that appeals to the romantic aspect of adolescents that seeks some dramatic way to change the world.We are shown a world of dysfunction around Donnie. His mother seems to think discipline is a bad thing and allows her son to curse her out and then sobs around the house in a depression thinking she failed as a mother. His father tries too hard to be a buddy to his son rather that be a strong father. His teachers range from the intellectual, to the weak, to the right wing fascist type. The school principal fires the one teacher that treats the students as intelligent and supports the most outlandish right wing teacher on the faculty. School bullies dominate the school and community. A crazy motivational speaker begins to dominate the community with an evangelical style self-help strategy. All of this Donnie seems to recognize as out of line and yet he also sees things that are definitely not real, and thus whereas he sees through hypocrisy with x-ray vision, he also is plagued with odd hallucinations of a demonic 6 foot sharp toothed rabbit.Well where does this weirdness lead us? It finally leads to mysterious airplane engines falling from the sky and then to acts of sacrifice and heroism, again appealing to the romantic and idealistic instincts of American youth.It is an odd film, neither outstanding nor terrible. The film uses the classic strategy for maintaining suspense, which is to withhold information from the audience. Eventually the viewer is given enough information to have the structure of the film come together and for there to be resolution of all the issues in the plot, or at least the major issues. I don't think many folks over 21 would find this film to rank high however.	3.0	This film would appeal to mixed up adolescents	2009-04-02	7	2	5
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3IBYRSA490ZOA	C. Chow	Very few movies that I've seen in the past few years have touched me as much as this.It's a very character driven movie with less focus on plot.The previews for this make it look like Donnie is a crazy killer. Not so. The movie does not go to extremes. Donnie has friends and even a girlfriend. He's good kid we like.Some people compare this to David Lynch in that the film makes no sense. It made sense to me.Lynch's films are odd in the way that you feel left out of the movie. The characters know what's happening but you don't. As if somehow they edited out the wrong scenes from the movie. Here we know all that Donnie does. And Donnie knows more than the other characters.For first time director Richard Kelly the production quality is amazing. The score consists of Tears For Fears songs.Be sure to get the DVD with extra scenes. There's some scenes I can't believe they left out. Like when Donnie's class reads Watership Down, which Donnie Darko is obviously based on. They should have left this in.A great movie! Of course no Oscars.	5.0	Wow! Very Original!	2002-09-27	8	6	2

In fact, I think this kid just had to be my personal hero!I haved loved this movie for years, and not just loved it. It is like a beautiful, intelligent woman, where you love every part of it, in every way. It is a flawless creation.The characters are incredible. Donnie is a broodig teenager that any can relate to. He just happens to be visited by the future and traverse space and time. His parents are completely realistic recreations of sad, worried, yet oddly hopeful elders. And his teachers, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and one crazy lady who loves Patrick Swayze, are all tremendously entertaining figures, in every way.Many people at the beginning roll their eyes at such a perceivedly dark piece of work, But by the end, they are enlightened, laughing, scared, and astonishingly overjoyed. This movie has a toll on the senses unlike any other. And the hip 80's soundtrack will make any viewer fill with uneasy glee.There is no need to describe the plot. No one can. It must be deciphered through multiple viewings, and even then, the viewer is left up to their own interpretation. It is an admirable mind-twister, and you will spend many nights awake arguing with yourself over the meaning of the film.I loved the film. it perfectly blends dark comedy, horror, drama, intution, curiosity, and virtuosity into one complex, compelling mastercraft. And the fact that it is independent with a rookie director only heightens the sense of accomplishment felt here.	5.0	The Most Original Film of the New Millennium...	2008-10-19	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ACVBZF3GK3O45	C. Davis	"I highly recommend this movie.This video first came to my attention when someone on NPR provided an analysis of the movie comparing it to the Reagan Presidency.  That alone should show that there are multiple possible interpretations for this movie.  Of course, the 900 plus reviews on Amazon might be another clue as well.As you watch the movie, several possibilities come to mind.  Donnie Darko is insane.  Donnie Darko is going to somehow save the world.  Donnie Darko's friends are pulling the most elaborate practical joke on him and this is facilitated by the psychotropic drugs that are proscribed for him. In the end, all of these are wrong.""Donnie Darko"" is about self-determination. On one hand, it offers hope that we do have control over our destinies and we are not just machines that God has set in motion to follow His plan. One the other hand, it offers the idea that by choosing his own immolation, Donnie will have made the world a better place.Of course, Donnie did this because he believes it will save the life of his girlfriend.  In the end, even that is unknowable.  Does she simply die at the hands of her estranged father vice being run over?  Do enough of the memories from the alternate future remain to discredit the child molester/motivational speaker that Donnie unmasks?  In the end, this movie is disturbing in that it not only has characters that are extremely likable yet bizarrely antisocial but its lack of answers on really any issues other than the possibility of time travel and free choice.Many of the reviewers have painted this as an anti-""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Frank the giant rabbit is organizing and directing Donnie's life.  Frank Capra the director and Frank the giant rabbit.  Yet, in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it was possible to know the result of one's choices.  In ""Donnie Darko"", one does not even know if choice is a possibility until the very end. The final results of those choices remain unfathomable.This is an excellent story and needs to be watched at least twice to get all the subtle points.  For example, who is the overweight Asian girl and why does she have a crush on Donnie?

What were they talking about with time travel, tangent universes, and worm holes?  I have no interest in science fiction and couldn't begin to de-tangle the intricacies of this film's plot.  But guess what.  That didn't really matter.  I still really enjoyed `Donnie Darko.'  (Incidentally, the plot - at least the *probable* plot - has been explained to me since my first viewing ... kudos to anyone who figures out what's going on for her/himself).  Anyway - my point is - you don't have to know precisely *why* a plane's engine crashes through Donnie Darko's bedroom ceiling, and you don't have to know *why* that creepy, giant bunny is lurking around the corner to like this movie.What is likeable about this movie?  To begin with, as almost every other reviewer has pointed out, Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job with the role of Darko.  His character is extremely intelligent, cynical, slightly demented and ultimately charismatic - he reminded me a lot of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye - - which is actually an odd coincidence, considering that, in `The Good Girl,' Gyllenhaal plays a character who renames himself Holden and identifies with Salinger's protagonist.  Anyway - just a thought.  While almost all of the characters in the movie are likewise enjoyable and are brought to life by talented actresses/actors (Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker/pervert? - well done!), I have to agree with another reviewer: Drew Barrymore is atrocious as a high school English teacher.  She is entirely unconvincing and reminds me of a female Keanu Reeves (at his worst).  Anyway ...I also like this movie because, while I did not exactly ""get"" what was happening, it is never boring.  The plot is definitely unique, dark and subtly humorous.  The scene with Darko, his uptight Health teacher (I think she was a Health teacher) and a ""Life Line"" is hilarious.  Moreover, I think that, in general, the relationships in this film are treated in a very nuanced manner and with a great deal of tenderness.  Darko and his older sister (played by Gylenhaall's real-life sister Maggie) demonstrate an especially endearing - albeit playfully hostile - dynamic.Lastly, I think one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack.  There are several great 80s songs - all very nostalgic, moody, brooding, and sexy.  They fit in perfectly.I definitely recommend giving `Donnie Darko' a shot.  It's unique, it'll probably leave you thinking (at least: 'what just happened?!?') and I think most people will enjoy it."	4.0	unusual and enjoyable flick	2005-12-16	4	3	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A35DPSDOQ5RBQ	Charles Dahill	Donnie Darko is my favorite movie of all time, no other movie could deliver the interesting characters, complex plot, or intriguing storyline as Donnie Darko does. Not only that, but the acting is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, he portrays a deeply disturbed character who has visions of the end of the world told to him by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank. (Note that it really isn't a bunny rabbit, it's just a man in a freaky rabbit costume).This movie has humor, romance, intrigue, mystery and ingenuity. I dare anyone who has not seen this movie to go out and rent it or buy it. Watch it at least twice (the first time may leave you completely confused), and try and say that you don't love this movie. I have yet to meet someone who said they don't like Donnie Darko.The movie aside the UMD is incredibly well packaged, aside from the movie itself it also includes the theatrical trailer, complete audio commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, extended and deleted scenes with audio commentary for those that wish to hear it, and a Mad World music video. (By the way, a lot of people, myself included, got absolutely addicted to the song Mad World by Gary Jules. Richard Kelly could not have picked a better song to end the movie with.)The picture quality is great (but then again what isn't off of the PSP's excellent LCD screen?) The only issue I have with the movie (and it's not really the movie itself, but the PSP's design) is that the movie is a little hard to hear sometimes, even with the volume turned all the way up. But like I said, it's not really the UMD, it's the speakers that come with the PSP, they're not exactly the best known to man. This is an easy fix though, as long as you have some headsets or some of the aftermarket speaker systems for the PSP you're good to go.Overall great movie and great deal for the UMD. Highly recommended for fans of the movie (and anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.) I mean, who wouldn't want to have the best movie ever made in your pocket?	5.0	My fovorite movie . . .portable!	2009-03-20	2	2	0

I think the movie hits the literary equivalent of the &quot;personal fallacy,&quot; wherein because something hits someone hard for personal reasons, they tend to rate it higher as &quot;art&quot; than it, perhaps, deserves. Well, I am one of the victims of the fallacy. While flawed, it has some genuinely beautiful moments and captures the strange and dreamlike world of some teenagers perfectly.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A29IYGR7SNPRIV	"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence"""	Any form of media that makes you think has succeeded in what it set out to do.Donnie Darko is a film that succeeds on every conceivable level. The script is original and entirely unpredictable. There isn't a single bit of action or dialogue, not one frame that can be anticipated. The characters, too, are refreshingly well-conceived and highly unique. And it's a treat to see actors we know well (Drew Barrymore, who also produced, and Noah Wyle) stretch well beyond our usual expectations. There is great humor in this film as well as great sorrow. And, ultimately, it's impossible to say if the entire scenario takes place within the dreams of a brilliant but possibly schizophrenic young man or if, as he so desperately wishes, he has, through physics, managed to reverse time.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stunning performance as Donnie. Even his body language--incurving shoulders, questioning eyes, uncertain smiles--reveal a vast, searching intelligence. Mary McDonnell gives yet another in a roster of thoughtful portrayals--this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach. And Jena Mallone is just wonderful, one of the truest, most authentic young actors around today.This is filmmaking at its best--an adventure for the mind--not to be missed.Most highly recommended.	5.0	Remarkably original	2002-08-12	418	361	57

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1IARS383NALNG	Chaz	"Ok the director made a flaw when he mentioned cellardoor. I loved his mentioning it but his mistake came when he went on to assume that it was edgar allen poe that made the comment, in all actuality it was JRR Tolkien who made this comment. Tolkien was the great linguist who actually created his own languages. Poe was a poet. So if you read this then now you know. So the movie is great. It made me think. I generally like doing such activities. You got this kid who sees the future with his powers and ""unconsciously knows"" he's going to die. He wants to change the way things will be and uses his powers to do so by keeping himself from dying the fateful nite. He does this by creating an alternate course of time where he is not in his bed when a jet engine crashes on top of it. So he's always sneaking out of his room at nite on the off beat chance that nite is the fateful nite. Then you have this old lady who also has these powers and writes a book on it and she wants things set right and put back in order, and she does this unconsciously as well by causing Frank to accidently kill Gretchen by unconsciously always being in the middle of the road. I guess Lady Death ""unconsciously knows"" this will help Donnie make everything right. The kid sees that he has to change things back to how everything was supposed to be (where he dies)and makes the jet engine of his mom's airplane fall into a portal which he creates for the engine to go back in time and fall on himself 28 days from the 30th. How the jet engine ever initially falls is beyond me but according to time theory if you have an 8 ball go through a portal to the past then that 8 ball will always have gone into the portal and always come out at the other end of the portal. The thing is when it comes out in the past what changes will it make? Even if say the 8 ball runs into itself somewhere down the line that in itself may have caused the 8 ball to have gone through the time portal initially, but there is no disputing the fact that the 8 ball will have to go into the time portal and come out no matter what you try to do to stop it. The 8 ball initially always came out before the possibility of it going in is conceived. Therefore predestination exist if time travel exist. It's a law of time. If time travel itself is possible. And seeing that he actually does force the jet engine to fall on his previous self in the alternate future then this would bring an end to his alternate universe/the world. So the bunny was right all along, the world did end. The touching ending is what made it all the worthwhile. The end has the director saying that Donnie is smiling because Donnie thinks it was all just a dream. But to me Donnie was smiling because he was no longer afraid to die alone. Which if the director didn't think about seeing it that way then his ...missed a good ending call. Also from a deleted scene you have Donnie and Gretchen playing some 80s racecar game and he describes the visions he has and says they are like dreams but they are crystal clear and right when they are over just like when you wake up from a dream it all slips away little by little really quick. Well at the end you see everyone and they are all waking up from the ""dream"" that Donnie made, his alternate universe. And eventually they all start to forget about it. And that's why Gretchen hesitates at the end but still says that she never knew Donnie. Because to her it was all just a dream that's slipping out of hers and everyone else's memory. If you didn't know, the deleted scenes have a lot of Donnie and Gretchen together as bf/gf. And another scene that was deleted that was not even in the deleted scenes section show him and Gretchen dropping off the roberta sparrow letter. And I feel that the love story here is awesome even though they downplayed it with editing. But yeah there you go. Great ending. Loved it. All time classic movie. If i'm wrong about certain things then I don't care."	5.0	To sum it up. Don't read if you haven't seen the movie yet.	2003-01-12	32	13	19
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3U2QPYK413IQH	chester bennington	This film is, quite simply, brilliant.  Unrelenting in its haunting, mystical and totally engrossing style, it is a &quot;how-to&quot; of entertaining, intellectual paranoia.  The basic elements of the plot involve a troubled, over-educated, misunderstood youth, who is taking pills for his undisclosed problems.  He happens to know that Armageddon is coming, as he was told by a 6 foot rabbit with the voice of Freddy Krueger.  As the days count down, Donnie rebels against the system and causes general chaos, all the while maintaining that the rabbit instructs him to commit these vandalistic acts, and that they will help to save the world.  On the night when Armageddon is supposed to occur, a series of events takes place and all the loose ends are tied up in a way that is both beautiful and utterly confusing.  It will require at least another two viewings for you to fully understand what happened, and even then you may not be sure.  An intellectual delight.	5.0	Donnie Darko, aka Most Original Movie of the Past 20 years	2004-01-10	2	2	0

But, it all came together with the director's explaination and I found that to be unfortunate because this could have been a terrific movie. It just missed something and I am still trying to figure out what that was. My poor 15 year old daughter STILL doesn't get it.

I was expecting a thriller like most other thrillers (people run around, evil bunny rabbit or something etc) but I was soooooo wrong. This movie wasnt what I was expecting, it was better. The whole movie feels like a dream and its great sountrack only inhances this. The 80s songs are great and go perfect with every scene without being cheesy or anything. The story is unique the movie is beautifly shot. I just cannot say enough good things about this movie. Acting-Great. Music-Awesome. Story-Brilliant. I could go on.The movie though isnt for everyone. You'll either hate it or love it. But you at LEAST have to give it a chance and watch it TWICE before you decide. The first time I saw it, I didnt know how to feel about it. All I knew was that I couldnt stop thinking about it and wondering what the heck I just watched. So I watched it again, still didnt get it but I really liked alot better the second time. In my opinion, the movie just keeps getting better everytime you watch it. You notice new things, you make up new thoeries, and you understand it a little better each time. I finally had to buy the movie after I couldnt stop thinking about it and Ive watched it at least 12 times since Ive gotten it the day before Christmas and Im still not tired of it.Im not usually one who would like a movie like this but just something about it that really grabs me and stuff that I cant stop watching it.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2NZR4DRC8D8UK	"Christian L. Findlay ""Kruddler"""	It would be very hard for a person to walk away from Donnie Darko thinking that there was not at least some interest in the film. It is relevant to school life and throws in the typical issues such as censorship, the American obsession with self help philosophy and dealing with mental illness in the family. However these subplots alone do not sum up the meaning behind Donnie Darko. The film is haunting and keeps you feeling like there is something deeper to peer upon hidden in the plot. Even without understanding the movie you must at least walk away feeling something about the movie.Donnie Darko is a confusing movie. After watching it for the first time I found that there was not one point in the movie that made it all fall in to place. Like other contemporary films eg. David Lynch films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive it leaves you feeling extremely frustrated. It makes you feel like you have missed the point and that there was an immense philosophical truth running through the movie that is only reserved for geniuses such as Stephen Hawking.After reading different theories on the net about the meaning behind the film one is left to conclude this is yet another film that forces you to make your own conclusions about the meaning. This seems to be becoming an increasingly popular trend among modern films. I rated it 4 because I for one am becoming more and more frustrated with films whose directors feel they have the right to tease the audience (possibly because of free publicity generated by internet users posting theories about the meanings of movies). I'm not a genius and I hate the feeling that I have missed something when I watch a film, even if I watch it over and over again. Besides this I think it is a copout. A director should be able to imply enough meaning for a movie to make sense. Furthermore it can be done without spelling everything out and and it can be done without making everything obvious upon the first viewing.Apparently the DVD extra features do provide more information about the storyline but still don't explicitly give away the meaning of the film.I think the director was dealing with cliche philosophical problems such as time travel in new exciting ways which would make it a perfect film if it weren't for the frustrating lack of resolution one gets at the end of the film.	4.0	A Good but Confusing Movie	2003-05-01	26	15	11

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ACT2D15MBESK2	Christopher Hall	'Donnie Darko' marks the excellent (and promising) directorial debut of Richard Kelly, a relatively un-heard-of director that has struck gold with this outstanding tale of belonging and exploring the complexities of time travel.Set in 1988; disturbed teenager Donnie Darko begins to experience bizarre visions in which he is greeted by 'Frank', a mysterious entity dressed in an evil-looking bunny suit. 'Frank' instructs Donnie that only 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds remain until the tangent universe will collapse, and begins to ask him to carry out his increasingly destructive commands. An un-stable Donnie wilfully complies, uncovering some of the darkest secrets humanly imaginable about his, and the worlds, existence. But with a universal collapse nearing by the hour, is there a way Donnie can stop the inevitable and save the ones he loves?Everything about 'Donnie Darko' was portrayed to the highest quality. The acting, direction, and special effects were outstanding, and not to forget the beautifully composed soundtrack featuring Gary Jules' heartfelt cover of 'Mad World'.Rather than sticking to one genre, the movie instead explores many, easily succeeding with each. An unforgettable discussion about how Smurf's have sex is hilarious, as is Donnie's sister repeating the vulgarity she hears from her siblings at the dinner table. And the dramatic elements are not to be forgotten, but would be easily spoilt if I mentioned them here.I highly recommend 'Donnie Darko'; one of the most generously original, and instantly memorable, movies to hit our screens in years. Utterly outstanding.	5.0	"""I've been watching you..."""	2004-10-17	2	1	1

This movie is a masterpiece, and unlike just about EVERYTHING that comes out in the theaters these days, this kind of movie has never been done before.  Your common everyday meat head movie-goer isn't going to like it because its meaning is not instantly accessible.  Oh no!!  You actually have to THINK about this movie for awhile after you watch it to try to form an opinion on it!  Movies like this don't always go over well because the mass pop culture can be very stupid.  But believe me, to write this movie off because it is ""confusing"" is ignorant and closed minded.  Well, enough ... bashing.  What about the movie itself.Casting was perfect.  Nothing but good performances.  The style in which this movie was filmed is just beyond description.  The more you watch the movie, and the more your mind lets you see things come together, the more amazing the filming becomes.  I can't say too much because I'll give things away.  (Yes, there actually is a plot and a meaning.  Just don't expect Vin ... Diesel to come on screen and tell you exactly what it is.)  And the icing on the cake is the music.  This movie was made to look and sound like it takes place in the 80's, but the whole eighties feel is very subtle.  Almost as if they went to the trouble of doing things to let you know it takes place in the late eighties, even though it doesn't really matter too much.Anyway, I could go on and on.  See this movie.  It's one of a kind.  I actually suggest buying the DVD instead of renting it, because you will most likely need to see it more than once.  If you want to see a TRULY confusing movie that has no meaning or validity, go see Malibu's Most Wanted at the local theater."	5.0	Mind Bogglingly Good	2003-05-04	59	46	13
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AB9DTZATYY2C8	Chris Yodice	Donnie Darko was released to mediocre reviews and low box-office sales, but its rising popularity since its release on DVD has proven that it is a cult classic of the most unique nature.The film explores teen angst, religion, love, and science fiction, all in an unorthadox presentation that may leave you scratching your head, but nontheless inspired by its haunting brilliance.  The solution is there if you have the ingenuity to ponder it - I'll just say it has a lot to do with divine intervention to teach a lesson and finding resolution to the painful complications of teen life.  (If you want the whole story, you can e-mail me).The film is set in the 80s, and director Richard Kelly does a superb job in giving it a distinct 80s aura.  You'll think you're watching a movie that was really made in the 80s.  Combining this style with the vivid and eerie soundtrack, Donnie Darko is sure to leave a lasting impression on you and will give you a lot to think about.  If it leaves you feeling frustrated, there are plenty of online resources to help you sort it out.  The filmmakers admit that with the editing job done to the movie, certain things do not make definitive sense.  Supposedly a newly-edited version is being released in theaters sometime soon.  Nontheless, it is impossible to see this movie without being stirred.  This DVD is a must-own for any movie collector.	5.0	A Chaotic Masterpiece	2004-02-25	0	0	0

I immediately ordered the DVD because I had to watch it again.  Yes, be warned, you'll probably have to watch this movie multiple times before you fully grasp it.  It's easy to see why this movie didn't go mainstream, but rahter has become somewhat of a cult classic.  Jake Gyllenhaal was incredible, especially considering he was only 19 when this was filmed.  The rest of the cast was perfect too, which you might not think looking at some of the names.  All in all, a must have for any film buff's collection.	5.0	Incredible	2003-01-27	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2R4FZUQPZC3H8	C. J. Hormann	"When the old Tears for Fears hit ""Head Over Heels"" kicks in, early on in the movie, you're taken quite by surprise. Not because it's another case of trying to show a bit of retro cool by referencing the 80's but because it fits in so well. The fact that the scene is in slow motion should be naff but in fact it is close to the best placement of a song in a movie in ages.Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie that will leave you with a smile on your face, despite its bittersweet ending. While being startingly original, it does reference other movies (Harvey, The Sixth Sense) but doesn't seem like a second rate copy or a ""re-imagining"" for that matter (take note Mr Burton). It certainly deserves a wider audience than it got on release in the cinema with a groundbreaking performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a wonderfully understated performance from Drew Barrymore.Richard Kelly can join such young directors as Spike Jonze and Paul Thomas Anderson who buck the trend of what is wrong with so much in American cinema, namely cliched and rehashed pap for the masses. It's important that we cherish movies like these as they have become so rare - a true classic!!"	5.0	Kelly's Hero	2002-08-24	4	4	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"I was really looking forward to this movie, but so much of it strikes me as a really well made, feature-budgeted student film.Why?Because ""Donnie Darko"" is bursting with inspiration (some fresh, a lot borrowed) and yet it just doesn't seem to have the wisdom of very much actual experience. I was both fascinated and frustrated at every turn and in the end I was mostly just disappointed.For starters, ""DD"" is saddled with one of the most opaque and least likeable main characters since ""Brewster McCloud"" (which comes to mind because it, too, is an intriguing and risky but ultimately unsuccessful experiment). Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie with the ""head down, eyes up"" sad-smile glower of a Kubrick anti-hero. Sometimes Donnie is smart. Sometimes Donnie is dumb. Sometimes Donnie is mean. Sometimes Donnie is cool. Sometimes Donnie is crazy. Which is like most teenages (or even most people) but it becomes problematic when we can never get a rough estimate of how many cards the central character is playing with.The other characters aren't much help, either. The villains are cardboard and heavy handedly drawn; virtually free of any sort of complexities, they proudly sing the virtues of censorship, psycho-evangelism, and easy answers. Donnie's rebellion against them almost makes it appear that he's taking easy bait.Everybody else just sort of wanders in and out of the story, and I was really surprised at how ill-used Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, Jena Mallone and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are. They're all very good when it occurs to the script that they should make an appearance, but most of the time the script would rather watch Donnie be kooky.Finally, there are just too many elements of ""DD"" that remind me of, or refer to, other stuff. There's the malevolent infomercial guru prancing around on stage and he seems to belong to another movie (say, ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Magnolia""). There's the mystical rabbit-like wanderer (probably only a coincidence that ""Sexy Beast"" has one, too, but what about, say, ""Gummo"" ?). The troubled wild child in counselling (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Ordinary People""). When the movie wants to be cheeky, it displays a theater marquee with the ""Halloween Double Feature"" of ""Evil Dead"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (zing! crash!). And one would think, since Donnie's mother is versed in Stephen King (she's reading ""It"" when the movie opens), she'd at least have a clue where her story was going.Based on the amount of deleted scenes on the DVD, and the wealth of information that's covered therein (including a particularly interesting but excised revelation about Donnie's medication) I think this was a movie that lost its way during the editing.  Director Kelly doesn't seem to have any real regrets on the commentary track so I doubt there will be a more coherent ""director's cut,"" but I imagine that a longer version would've filled in some of the blanks that I was left with at the end of the film.Nevertheless, as a horror movie, ""Donnie Darko"" does strive for something MUCH more subtle than most of the recent offerings from the horror genre. It does have genuine moments of creepiness and dread. I felt led on and let down by ""Donnie Darko,"" but I'd rather see this creepy failure five times than see another variation on ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" which, fortunately, is one movie ""Donnie"" doesn't emulate.I'll be interested to see what Richard Kelly does next."	2.0	Such an interesting film and yet... somehow not very good	2002-03-20	40	24	16

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ANKMRV9WVHB7A	"ClosedBook ""ClosedBook"""	I love this movie. Let me just get that out of the way first. I thought the casting was brilliant, thus the acting was perfect.Jake Gyllenhaal has been compared to countless, great, young actors. He shouldn't have been. He is in a class by himself. I feel the same way about Jena Malone. She will survive the transition between child star and adult actress with no problem. The rest of the cast was equally inspired. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osbourne, Kathrine Ross and Jake's real life sister Maggie are all exceptional.I think a lot of the criticism of this movie comes from people's need for a neat, tidy ending. This movie doesn't have one. It's totally up to the viewer to decide what they think happened.I have watched this movie several times and each time my conclusion is different. It depends on your mood I guess. I love that it isn't spelled out for me. I don't need to be spoon fed. I can think for myself, and this movie definitly allowed me to. I listened to the commentary and even the writer/ director doesn't really know how to explain it (that's aweome).It's a commentary on a lot of things: society, values, sanity, love. Take your pick, or add your own.This is a pensive film. It's not American Pie. Take some time with it. Watch it 2 or 3 times. It's worth it.And just as a side note: This movie has some of the greatest dialogue in movie history (ie. the conversation about the Smurfs is priceless).	5.0	"""Sometimes, I Doubt Your Commitment To Sparkle Motion!!"""	2002-05-30	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Donnie Darko was one of those kind of films that actually needed theories: people explaining just what was going on and what it all meant. Even watching the director's cut, I was like ""what?"" at times, but then re-reading some of the things, it finally clicked. Whether you should've been left in the dark or finally understood the movie is one of those personal things that you can have it either way best suited to your tastes. For me, I enjoy that I finally ""get"" this thing.Donnie Darko(dumb name by the way) is a troubled teen under medication living in the 80's. One night while sleepwalking, a jet engine manages to land right smack in the middle of his room. That's not all as a 6-foot tall freaky rabbit tells him that the world will end in less than a month. To spoil the rest would of course be a big disservice.Some directors will come out with a huge film, and either make films that surpass or films that are great on their own merits but public reaction is ""they liked the first movie better"". M. Night Shyamalan is essentially trying to match the impact of the Sixth Sense with varying degrees of success while David Fincher was able to grow beyond Alien 3's reaction with Seven and Fight Club. Richard Kelly on the other hand seems to be one of the few who's actually trying to change around its success. Donnie Darko didn't exactly make much money but it developed a big cult following meanwhile Kelly was saying it was wrong thing, wrong that, anything and everything was wrong, hence we get this release.On initial viewing of the original version, I didn't know what the hell happened, it's like some weird story with core elements actually taken out. Here, it's practically spoonfed to you and a quick trip to a site like Wikepedia helps put everything in perspective. All the talk of Tangent Universes and Manipulated Living are just like ""huh?"" to some people but eventually they'll get...maybe. Some prefer the ambiguity, others like an explanation for once. Me? I'm kind of in the middle.Since I didn't watch the original constantly, I have no idea what was added back in but some of the effects got better and music was changed, such as the opening song which I always preferred the original choice better but hey it's his movie. Got no problem with him adding scenes to create his ultimate ""vision"" of the movie, just glad he cast Maggie Gyllenhaal, easy on the eyes that one.This is a release that I have no idea which to recommend. Both serve their purpose of providing a good film and I guess it just comes down to one choice: do you prefer theorizing, or do you prefer understanding everything?"	5.0	Best left to ambiguity or full comprehension?	2006-04-17	7	4	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	This film is a clever fantasy with a suprising twist, which should keep most viewers guessing until the end. In fact, ~Darko~ has a great ending, subtle, thought inspiring and extremly powerful.Donnie Darko is an over-sensitive teenager, brilliant in many ways, who is convinced the world will come to an end on a certain day in the near future. His 'imaginary' friend, a hypnotic and somewhat demonic rabbit, commands Donnie to do certain things, (the famous schizophenic voice) also informing the boy of future events. The screenplay by director and writer, Richard Kelly, is indeed flawless, which manages to connect seemingly disconnected people and events in the boy's life in a very believable and compelling way.The cast is an unusual ensemble that one would not expect to see in an offbeat film - Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Drew Barrymore; all gave great performances, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead, whose haunting expression, particularly his eyes during his strange visions, was quite remarkable.~Donnie Darko~ is one of those rare and surprising films, dark, humorous and original - this is an excellent motion picture.	5.0	Powerful and thought inspiring	2003-02-08	1	1	0

It has already been said what the movie consists of and there are breakdowns of how this worked. I rented this the day it hit the shelves and I was watching with my mouth open the whole time. I urge film students and film lovers alike to buy this movie, you can't go wrong.It's not only about the death of a boy, but a statement about how wrong people are. Hypocracy, jealousy and redemption come to mind.One of my top 20 movies of all time. Kelly's ""Southland Tales"" recieved a lot of flack, but still I enjoyed the chaos just as much. Only ""Donnie Darko"" had a much more coherent story that was easier to follow. I think it's a shame that there was a sequel (S. Darko) to this work of art. No one should touch it if it isn't broke. Hollywood can really suck... I may watch the sequel when I am bored one day, but I won't go out of my way because I just have a feeling it's not going to measure up to this classic."	5.0	DEAD DREAMING, A TRAVELER'S GUIDE	2009-05-19	0	0	0

Donald Darko is the most disturbed charecter i have ever seen in a motion picture.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2L4VKF6650ZOA	Colt	"... it keeps going and going. Donnie Darko is one of those films that, even with a re-release, never really got out of its cult status because most people are too afraid to think. I'll get more on that later.The main character in the movie, Donnie, is obviously borderline schizo. Or so it seems. But I won't spoil anything for you. Basically, he sees a vision of an oversized bunny which prophesizes that the world will end in a little under a month. Donnie gets to experience everything he's ever wanted to do during this time and still has some left to save the world.As simple as that synopsis may sound, it can't do the film justice. There are plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of subplots that are pretty interesting. The characters are also worth a look because, although not every one of them experiences growth, the majority of them who do grows in an odd yet interesting way.The direction and cinematography are pretty good, even if they do hint at past movies like E.T. and Silence of the Lambs. The effects are excellent for an independent film, and the simplistic, ambient score matches nicely with the movie's atmosphere.The plot might be the determining factor whether this film appeals to you or not. As you may have heard, the whole film, beginning, middle, and ending, are open to discussion. Although Kelly did a good job of handing us the appetizer and main course of the meal, the bastard kept the dessert. But I think this helps with the longevity of the movie; it's easily one that begs to be talked about, scrutinized, and criticized.Another determing factor might be its subtle preaching. One might not catch on to it early on but as the film progresses, it becomes more evident. Sometimes I think that the movie tries to address too many things at once, resulting in a, if you will, mental overload. But again, this can be cured with repeat viewings.I hope Kelly didn't run out of ideas after this film. I truly believe that this movie is his welcome call to the artform, both scriptwise and direction-wise. This work is among my all-time favorites not because of what it is but what it tries to be, and that beats the many offerings Hollywood has given us recently, which never tries to be anything even though they can be something.EDITED TO ADD: Director's Cut (Rating = 4 stars, since I can't place two reviews here.)I've recently watched the two versions back to back and decided to compare the two.Pros:- The addition of a few pages of The Philosophy of Time Travel into the movie makes the plot easier to comprehend for first-time viewers.- Almost all of the deleted scenes are placed back into the movie. As a result, it feels more complete and in some instances, adds more poignancy to the film, the best of which shows Donnie's relationship with the rest of his family.- Some of the special and sound effects have been revamped, all for the better.Cons:- For someone who has seen the original version and have discussed it at length with others, the Director's Cut almost feels like it dumbs down the complexity of the former. I for one recommend seeing the first before the Cut. Formulate and research your theory first before Kelly does it for you =)- I have a big, if not HUGE, problem with the changes in music. Echo & the Bunnymen's ""The Killing Moon"" is replace by INXS' ""Never Tear Us Apart"" during the beginning of the movie. While the latter is a good song itself, ""The Killing Moon"" was such an integral part of original version. It's instead relocated to a another scene where one needs to listen carefully in order to hear it. Some of the score have also been altered or moved around.It's an all-around nice version of the film though. There are a few good things added or changed, but there are also bad. This altered version doesn't take away the major aspects that made the original version/story/whatever good though. Again, here's to hoping that Kelly will eventually squeeze more genre-bending, mind-blowing, odd spectacles in his career."	5.0	Part period piece, part fantasy, part sci-fi, part...	2005-09-24	5	4	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AGZXPR3M4NDJU	conney island baby	"I loved Donnie Darko. I thought it was a quirky, crazy 80s period piece and had a killer soundtrack (loved the use of the Killing Moon during the opening sequence, thank god they didn't stick with the INXS song I believe was supposed to go instead). Initially, I thought it was about schizophrenia, to discover later on that this theme merely wrapped itself around a much more complex, albeit ""unrealistic"", centre, concerning theology, the transcendence of the soul, and time travel.I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was very good, he gave body and credibility to a character who appears (and most likely, is) totally unfocused, troubled, nihilistic, yet proves to also be intelligent and aware of all the good and the bad around him. I wasn't much of a fan of the actress that played Gretchen, nor the character itself. I could never tell if she had any motivations, if she was truly concerned about her family situation, and why she was with Donnie in the first place. Other than that, I loved the styllization of the movie, the clever use of imagery, and yes... the Smurf monologue.It is in no way ""avant-garde"" art, but it will make you think, and it keeps you glued to your seat."	5.0	Please enter a title for your review	2006-11-30	9	6	3

There's such a wide range of emotion blended together perfectly.  Jake Gyllenhaal is one of those great actors that haven't been fully discovered yet and needs to be soon.  His portrayal as Donnie Darko couldn't have been played accurately by anyone else.  This part was made for him.  I don't even want to go into the movies scenario because it makes it so much better to watch without knowing.  When your done watching it, your shocked, then you try to understand it all.  Watch it two or three times to pick up underlying plots.  You must watch the DVD version to see the deleted scenes then the deleted scene's commentary.  It helps putting it in perspective.  It's one of those movies that you have to figure out it's true meaning on your own.  It's a Dark Comedy, Sci-Fi, Rebellious, indie-ish, thought provoking, coming of age, sad, horror, movie.  Just think of ""Pi"", Kevin Smith on a Bad Trip, ""Dragon Fly"", ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Contact"", ""Final Destination"", ""Very Bad Things"", and any Dean Koontz book put together.  WATCH IT.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AF50ULMYITS9J	Corey Slack	This is an incredibly dark, comedic, and somber film that largely lacks in linear narrative, but covers its ground well with a stunningly original plot and quirky, tone-shifting atmosphere.  At any one moment, you could be howling with laughter, staring in disbelief, or form goosebumps from overall creepiness.  The most satisfying fact is that it is all done extraordinarily well, servicing up what is--in my opinion--one of the best build-ups and conclusions I've seen in a film since SEVEN.The movie is nothing like SEVEN.  It is the story of a 1988 teenager named Donnie Darko.  While at first seeming to have the cliched problems of teen angst and a dysfunctional family, his world slowly opens up to someone with a deep, psychological malfuntion.  He takes commands from a giant rabbit while sleepwalking.  One night, while out talking to this rabbit, he is told that the world is coming to an end in 28 days.  While he is out that evening, a jet engine that fell off an aircraft destroys his room.That's all I'll say as far as plot, and I only have said that much because it all happens in the first fifteen minutes.  After that is a mystical journey through Donnie's mind.  While serving up a ton of foreshadowing and plot devices (which seem pointless until the film concludes), writer/director Richard Kelly gracefully churns out political satire, comedy, and insightful views on human nature and teenage rebellion.  I was also impressed by how well the characters developed, no matter how small or insignifican their roles seem to be.  They're all important in the overall scope of the film.Like I said earlier, this movie does lack a linear narrative.  However, I feel that is overshadowed by how well it covers all the issues it presents.  This is a hard thing to do, but it is occasionally done really well (MAGNOLIA, SHORT CUTS).  The conclusion is something that will probably turn this into a bit love/hate film, if you throw things like implausibility and suspension of disbelief.  However, I am a big fan of such things, and I am tired of cash-filled, gutless Hollywood endings which are geared towards profitibility.This film is risky, but made with some incredibly promising talent.  I, for one, love it for everything it is.	5.0	Powered by originality	2002-03-09	22	20	2

I read this whole recap of the plot, bit by bit, at Salon.com, and I was TOTALLY wrong about what I thought was happening in the film (I'll spare you the details; this is a movie you cannot spoil for people) and yet I STILL LOVE IT.Jake Gyllenhaal is just awesome. He plays Donnie SUPERBLY.  Every single person in this movie is PERFECTLY casted, from Donnie's parents, sister, and therapist, to that awful awful woman who insists that Graham Greene was on Bonanza. And Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze are ingenious background players. Jena Malone is great, Frank-the-Bunny is great, Roberta Sparrow, even that chunky Asian chick who says ""Chut up."" EXCELLENT EXCELLENT casting is my point.Also, this is one of those movies that you don't have to really ""get"" 100%.  I certainly didn't. And I watch regularly. It proverbially lives in my DVD player so I can just push play whenever the heck I feel like it. (Okay so sometimes I switch it with Fight Club but that's besides the point).  Here's the deal:- the movie is based primarily in the notion of time travel. It's science-fiction disguised as not-science-fiction, which makes sense because it's both and neither.- it's one of those ""makes a big statement about humanity"" movies. I like that. Some people don't.- don't expect the ending to wrap everything up. In fact, it'll probably just confuse you further.- you NEED to watch the ENTIRE movie before you cast judgement, at least in my opinion.- if you don't like to think, ponder, be confused, question, rewind, ask people what the heck is going on, and genuinely say ""huh"" then this movie's not for you. Call me dumb but I've seen this film at least fifty times since I own the DVD and I still can't crack the code of the website.The whole movie is excellent from the storyline to the casting, but it's a mystery wrapped in an enigma shrouded in shadow.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as delusional high school student Donnie Darko in talented director Richard Kelly's thought provoking and stunningly creative award winning flick, which he also wrote.Donnie apparently a borderline schizophrenic who suffers from somnabulism has been having visions of a huge evil looking rabbit who has portended the end of the world in 28 days.  During a dream the rabbit named Frank summoned Donnie from his bed.  In a fortuitous twist of fate, inexplicably a jet engine crashes through the Darko house, specifically into Donnie's room.  Had he been there he surely would have perished.This incident set off more frequent delusions where Frank coaxed Donnie into destructive and bizarre acts.  Psychotherapy conducted by a concerned Dr. Thurman played by Katharine Ross was having little beneficial effect.  Donnie began becoming increasingly seduced by the concept of time travel somewhat fueled by science teacher Professor Monnitoff played by Noah Wylie.  Wylie introduced him to a revolutionary book on the subject penned by an aged and haggard local woman known as Grandma Death played eerily by Patience Cleveland.While this was happening Donnie became enamored with a high school girl Gretchen played by Jena Malone, whose influence would shape Donnie's future.Kelly concludes this extremely unique flick in terrific fashion, requiring rumination in it's interpretation.The musical score was haunting and enhanced the tenor of the flick especially in conjunction with the dream sequences.  The songs used throughout the film were also tastefully selected.  The acting requiring players to portray some very curious characters was very nicely done.  Kudos in particular should be given to Patrick Swayze as spiritualist Jim Cunningham and Beth Grant playing animated and motivated gym teacher Kitty Farmer.	5.0	Provocative fantasy	2005-09-15	2	2	0

No, I'm not talking about The Lord of the Rings (although, my previous statement could easily be applied to that film as well). Richard Kelly's feature debut film as a director, Donnie Darko, is a fascinating science fiction drama. The film looks at the life of a troubled `80s teen named Donnie Darko, who suffers from blackouts, sleepwalking, and bizarre hallucinations. The film features an awesomesoundtrack(which is unfortunately unavailable on Amazon.com) and some nifty camerawork and visual effects. Since its initial release, Donnie Darko has developed a loyal fanbase across the globe, especially in the U.K. where the film first achieved its cult classic status.The story tells us of an emotionally troubled teenager, Donnie Darko, who begins having hallucinations (or are they) of a man in a rabbit costume. The man refers to himself as simply Frank, and he warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days. Meanwhile, Donnie's family struggles with his peculiar behavior and his general disregard for their feelings. After meeting a new girl at school named Gretchen, Donnie seems to find new purpose in life, but his blackouts become more severe. During these episodes he vandalizes the school and even burns down his neighbor's house. Soon Donnie discovers that he and everyone around him are being manipulated by a mysterious force, the Deus ex Machina (roughly translated this means God of the Machine). If Frank's prediction is right and the world were truly to end, the sky to open up, and the universe torn apart, could anyone or anything stop it? This is the ultimate challenge of Donnie Darko. Can he save the world from oblivion?The film features an all-star cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Beth Grant, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, and Noah Wyle. The film's director, Richard Kelly, proves himself to be one of the most extraordinary up and coming filmmakers.For a greater understanding and appreciation of this film, I also recommend the following:The Hero with a Thousand FacesThe Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for WritersA Brief History of TimeThe Evil DeadE.T. the Extra-TerrestrialHigh School Flashback CollectionBack to the Future - The Complete TrilogyThe Last Temptation of ChristStephen King Gift Set	4.0	"""Where Is Donnie?"""	2008-09-12	1	0	1

Wow, man I was surprised and in a good way.  While a dark movie it is still excellent and leave you wanting to watch it multiple times.  While Jake Gyllenhaal is the lead look for Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Seth Rogen, and more to make smaller appearances.

I loved the original, but this version is so much better.  A lot of the deleted scenes that were on the first DVD have just been ""sewn into"" the new version, but they have added more info connecting events to the Sparrow book and it flows much better in this version.  Things make more sense.  The only gripe I had is that they changed the first song (when Donnie is riding his bike home after sleep walking in the opening scene) from Echo and the Bunnymen's ""Killing Moon"" to some dopey INXS song ""Never Tear Us Apart"". (I'm a HUGE INXS fan, but the song just is so wrong for that scene) Except for that, this is the superior DVD to own if you loved this movie"	5.0	cellar door	2005-01-05	6	6	0

You never quite know what's going on, even when it's over.  After you think about it, though, you'll be able to figure it out.  It's definately not your typical, mainstream film.  Don't let the fact that Patrick Swayze is in it fool you.  He's actually very good and wonderfully cast.I know many people probably would try to sum up this film, but this is one of those great movies that's more fun to watch when you don't know a single thing about it.

And, at the end of your first viewing, you too may be asking ""what's up doc?""Tom Keogh, who wrote the review of this film for Amazon, stated that this movie is unclassifiable.  I don't necessarily agree with that view.  Although it is part drama, part romance and part teen movie, it is primarily science fiction, with a sub-category of time travel.  Keogh goes on to add that ""Darko"" is stunningly original--with that I do agree.  Richard Kelly seems to be able to aptly create a David Lynch-like atmosphere that will keep the audience watching--and guessing--until the end.Jake Gyllenhaal does an admirable job in the title role and is supported by an ensemble cast, including his sister Maggie, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell (and even Ashley Tisdale in a small role).  Jake is able to give ""Donnie Darko"" the needed dark off-centered, delusional, mind set that shows in his eyes in the distant haunted stare he conjurs up at just the right time during the story.When it comes to eerie, mysterious science fiction flicks, you'll have a hard time finding another one nearly as good as ""Donnie Darko"".

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	For a movie that got such a raw deal upon its initial release it has since developed a loyal cult following that has championed the film to the point where the studio execs have allowed writer-director Richard Kelly to release a new Director's Cut this year in theaters.This is a movie that really improves with age. Every subsequent viewing only deepens your understanding of the movie and makes you appreciate the complexity of Kelly's narrative. There is a lot going on in this film and every time I've seen it, I've noticed something new or seen something that made me think about it in a different way.I first noticed Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky and was immediately captivated by his performance in that film. He has since produced a fascinating output and diverse body of work. His performance in this movie is nothing short of excellent. He starts off as a confused teenager but Gyllenhaal gradually shows that there is so much more to this character than meets the eye. Is he crazy? Is he some kind of mad prophet? A time traveler? A visionary? A mixed up kid? All of the above? It's quite a soulful, thoughtful performance that is also funny and heartbreakingly tragic.The whole cast is top notch: from ER's Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore to the always reliably Jena Malone and a surprise turn from Patrick Swayze playing a slimy Infomercial guru. More importantly, Donnie's family is so well cast, including Mary McDonnel as his mom and Holmes Osborne as his dad and, of course, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Donnie's sister (and also Jake's real-life one). They really feel and act like a genuine family with all of the little behavioural nuances.As for the DVD, well, if you had any questions as to what it all means, listen to Kelly's audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal. While he doesn't explain everything, he does examine a lot of the themes and does fill in some of the gaps. This is one of the best audio commentaries out there for that simple fact. Best of all, he points out all kinds of images that were buried in the background that you don't notice the first few times. For example, as Donnie rides his bike home at the beginning of the film, Frank drives by him in his car. Or, the bunny motif that pops up throughout the movie. It is these attentions to detail that really give this film an added complexity and I'm very appreciative of Kelly for drawing attention to them in his commentary track.The cast commentary is more of a free-for-all but fun to listen to and the many deleted scenes are very interesting to watch and fill in a few more gaps. It should be interesting to see how many of these are put back into the Director's Cut.This is an incredibly original film that never insults your intelligence. This is definitely worth checking out.	5.0	It Only Gets Better With Age...	2004-05-10	3	3	0

Let me say that I have liked few films as much as I liked this.

The death was an accident, and the guy who was driving the car has come from another dimension in the future to try to make Donnie see what will happen if he doesn't figure out how to go into the past and change it.Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely fabulous, hysterically funny and touching in his more depressing moments. I'm still a little fuzzy on the Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore characters. Did they know what was going on or were they just really overacting?

Drew Barrymore, Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wylie, and Mary Mcdonnell are all exceptionally cast.  Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a tainted young man who hears voices and sleepwalks.  One night he is drawn from his bed onto a golf course.  While there he meets Frank, a 6 foot tall rabbit who tells him that the end of the world is coming.  Donnie narrowly escapes death as an airplane engine falls into his bedroom and lands on his bed where he should have been sleeping.  Upon finding out this information, Donnie begins to notice things that normal people don't see.  He starts to question life, and the theory of time travel.  It eventually becomes obvious to Donnie that he was not suppose to survive the night of the engine crash.  Now he must put all the pieces of the puzzle and figure out how to undo the damage before he loses all those closest to him.  Anyone with an interest in time travel or a love for dark films should see this.  A++ film.	5.0	Dark, Chilling, Reavealing, and EXCEPTIONAL!	2003-01-18	13	10	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A31HN3JZNRB74Y	"daibhidh ""daibhidh"""	"This movie is really tough to describe or classify to somebody who hasn't seen it. It's THAT original. I think of it as a deep movie for shallow people, a darkling ""Dead Poets Society"" run through with heaping doses of ""Rushmore""-ish satire and ""Catcher in the Rye"" bitterness and disillusionment. The title character is a deeply troubled suburban wonderboy going to a private school who is haunted by this spectral, demonic being in a bunny suit, who begins to become, as Vonnegut would say, ""unstuck in time"" (which I recall him saying was a metaphor for going insane). This seems definitely the case.Stylistically, it is very interesting; the director has a great eye in places, putting together some enticing, effective scenes that are pretty to look at.Thematically, though, it sort of implodes under the weight of its own pretensions. The beginning and the end loop together in a way that (in my opinion) ultimately blows down the house of cards set up in the first place. Donnie seems to dish things out without ever taking it, an adolescent fantasy if ever there was one. Without wanting to spoil it, a problem I had with the movie is that it seems to answer the teen angst retort of ""maybe everybody would be happier if I was DEAD!!"" That's as good a way of summing it up as any other.The DVD is worthwhile, particularly because of the 20-some deleted/extended scenes one can watch with or without commentary. They offer additional perspective to the viewer that is absent in the movie. Is it worth your time? Sure, why not? Watch it. But it feels like more an exercise in style for its own sake than something offering any real substance."	3.0	Rabbit food for thought	2003-06-11	7	0	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	Jake Gyllenhaal works masterfuly here as Donnie, a borderline scitsophrenic who sees a disturbing future and talks to some reptilian rabbit who gives him subconsious commands that Donnie in turn acts out.  The subplots are intoxicating and the overall feel of the film is that of paranoia, but it works wonderfully.  As you watch you never know what to expect, you never know whats going to happen, to whome it will happen and when it's going to take place.  The charactors are all played very well from the sister (real life sister Maggie) girlfriend (Malone) and even the [...] town hero (Swayze)...The story of time travel and predestination flow so well here that your almost lost as to what your really believing is real until the final moments of the film.  Everyone here does an amazing job, but the real star here is the script which is so involving and masterfully written that your drawn into the film after the first frame, involving Donnie lying in the middle of the road upon daybreak, and you won't lose interest until half way through the credits, and even then, the soundtrack is pretty good.  This movie is great and recomended to anyone who wants a good mind bending drama.	5.0	A Cult Classic	2005-09-27	3	3	0

I even read some pundit accuse this movie of possibly ""inspiring"" Jared Lee Loughner to kill 6 people in Arizona!  It's not THAT disturbing!

For some reason it never got a real release here in Boston, and so now it appears on DVD having hardly been in theaters.But the DVD of this movie is extremely well made and complements the movie well: lots of commentary, and a ton of deleted scenes.  The movie is incredibly mysterious, and the DVD kind of helps to clear up the mystery.Not only is this movie set in the 80's, but it also has an 80's movie feel: it has a tone that is somewhat remininscent of &quot;repo man&quot;, &quot;heathers&quot;, with a little &quot;highlander&quot; (?!) thrown in.  the high school slo-mo scene set to the tune of tears for fears' &quot;head over heels&quot; is a classic movie moment.	5.0	a woefully underpublicized masterpiece	2002-03-20	11	9	2

Once I finish this very short review, I will be watching it a second time.Without a doubt, Donnie Darko is one of the best Generation X films (not that this film should be categorized in any way shape or form. Perhaps I should delete this line. Bah! I'll keep it.) ever made.The film is poignant, witty, and absurd. Unlike other phantasmagoric/surreal films, the absurdity actually comes together quite nicely at the conclusion. At the end of the film I wasn't left scratching my head wondering if maybe the director was just shooting way over my head (which sometimes [not always] happens to me with Lynch films).To me, Donnie Darko represents everything that American Beauty should have been. And I think American Beauty was a great film. It's just that Donnie Darko enters uncharted territory in the examination of the dysfunctional family territory.

Keohane ""author of Margaret's Ark"""	"After hearing from so many people, ""I can't believe you, of all people, haven't seen this movie,"" I finally watched DONNIE DARKO (2001). I got the movie for Christmas, and it's been sitting there, waiting for me to sit down and watch it. I kept thinking it was a slasher movie or something, and really didn't want to see a slasher movie, but because everyone kept saying I'd like it, including my son, I finally watched. It's not a slasher movie - chalk that up to really bad marketing years back when it came out. DONNIE DARKO is by far one of the best dark, strange, and brilliant films I've watched in a long, long time. And I don't use the word ""brilliant"" for movies lightly. OK, I can be pretty easy to please sometimes, but in this case - wow. Now, it might not be for everyone, it's a little surreal, definitely creepy, but the cast, especially (but not limited to) Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, is so strong, the writing and, hell, everything down to the music, it is an experience you should treat yourself to. Now, I strongly recommend getting the Director's Cut - it's 20 minutes longer but I can't imagine a minute of it being cut, and supposedly the special effects were ramped up - so if you end up missing the stunning visuals towards the end, then you're missing out. Won't get into the plot much, but I will suggest that to understand it, read carefully the pages of the book he finds (you'll know what I mean when you watch it), even pause the DVD enough to do this. They might make no sense, but it'll get your head ready for the ending.

I was afraid it was just going to be weird for weirdness sake (which it is) but it is also weird to be funny, and the movie is hilarious.  The director has seen way too many movies and is obviously Mr. Film Student, the movie uses just about every technical technique that anyone has ever thought of at some point or another during the narrative.  Normally that bothers me, but this movie is so out there that it works.  All the social/political references really helped ground the period in it's time (the 80's), instead of just fashion and hairstyle as most movies do.  Jenna Malone is a really good young actress (hot too).  The rabbit is hilarious.  Best Patrick Swayze performance ever!  Still can't decide whether the director actually took the thematic material seriously and had a point to it, or whether it was just a big joke.  In the end I guess it doesn't matter, you get what you get from it.	4.0	A Riot!	2002-07-05	1	0	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AGEG7MNQ08HHW	"Daniel P. Burk ""Fool for Buying This"""	"Perhaps I went into this movie with unreasonably high expectations, after all everyone who has seen this movie has put it on a pedestal. The movie's fairly boring, mainly because the pacing is slow and the narrative is drawn out to an unnecessary degree (how many scenes of Donnie walking, of Donnie pouting, of Donnie sitting do you really need to see?). However this is not the source of my intense revulsion of this movie. I am a fairly intelligent individual, but I could not figure out the central storyline. I had my own conjectures of what was happening but I decided that perhaps, if I looked at the extras I might be able to understand what the director was getting at. One of the extras on this DVD is an excerpt from ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book (from which Donnie draws his theories) and in three pages it outlined what was going on, what Frank (the bunny) was, the significance of the airplane engine, the concept of a ""tangent"" universe, why Donnie dreams of a water filled landscape, why everyone is trying to stop Donnie (even if they're not aware they're doing it), the black hole at the end, and well...everything. I was confused as to why the director chose to leave these explanations out and conceal the context for the story (SOME WOULD SAY THE CENTRAL CORE OF THE STORY THAT DRIVES EVERYTHING ELSE). I turned to the deleted scenes to see if any of these details had been cut from the movie intentionally and maybe, just maybe if there was a reason why they where cut. Here is where confusion turned to a personal hatred of the director. All of the deleted scenes added vital revelations (more conversations with Frank!, Donnie was taking placebos not actual medication! ect!) and at least a sense of what was going on with whole time travel aspect. What put me over the edge was hearing the director go on and on about this scene was cut because it revealed too much, that he preferred to leave it open to the viewer. I like some ambiguity in my movies, but I don't like a story that is forcibly divorced from context. Watching this movie is akin to reading a book with pages torn out; pages torn out by a pompous, conceited director who believes that a broken, shattered story is inherently better then a film with a complete narrative.  It is this attitude, this mental masturbation (smart people don't need context or explanations, only dumb people and philistines need narrative clarity) that turns this boring, muddled movie into a nexus of disgust and hatred. Do not watch this movie. But most of all do not support this self-important, vain, smug, arrogant, snobbish, haughty, ostentatious ass of a director by buying this movie."	1.0	I Loathe this movie.	2005-02-28	105	50	55

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2GYX971VETQBV	Daniel R. Sanderman	_Donnie Darko_ is an amazing film that is so original that it shakes up your average, movie watching experience.  In the film, Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Donnie, an incredibly sharp teen who becomes fascinated with the ideas of time travel due to the visions he suffers from.  His schizophrenic visions add an intensity to the film that keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to piece together all that is happening.  The acting in this film is quite good, but it is the film's originality that will grab you and shake your spinal column.The soundtrack is superb and the plotline is very engaging.  One can characterize this film has having some elements of tragedy under its belt as we watch Donnie, a character that we become sympathetic towards despite his mental instability, following the groove of fate to its inevitable conclusion.  The real question the film explores is the degree to which we should consider Donnie mentally unstable-perhaps he has tapped into truth that is beyond our grasp.  I highly recommend this film for those who enjoy a bit of a hallucinatory ride and exploring darker themes.  The film has developed a cult following and promises to continue-this film is still being reviewed on a frequent basis three years after its release.	5.0	Original and Modern Cult Classic	2004-05-13	1	1	0

You don't feel as much for Donnie in it, and that's unfortunate. The effects added are distracting and remove me from the film I've immersed myself in. They've also cut my favorite line from Frank. It was the most memorable line from the movie for me.	5.0	Donnie Darko	2011-10-02	3	0	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1V7845AJ5HL0C	dara chalice	The basic plot revolves around Donnie, a teenage schizophrenic, with an imagined friend in a bunny suit named Frank. It is a very interesting concept and leaves viewers questioning.Richard Kelly stated that his version would answer some of those questions and provide better understanding than the original release. Simply put, the Director's Cut does not meet this expectation.I had already paid $20 for the first release, but because I loved it so much, I absolutely HAD to have this new and allegedly improved version as well. I regret this purchase because I really don't have money to waste. There are very few actual scenes added and none are of any great significance or change the meaning of the film. There was one scene regarding his medication that added a bit of a twist... but I don't even think it was in the final version of the movie, but listed as a deleted scene instead. One would have to watch the two versions back to back to catch all of the changes... that is how insignificant the added scenes are. Some of the things NEEDED to be cut - for example, the eye scenes and the pages from the book on time travel (you'll know what I'm referring to if you've seen this version). Those scenes just did not transition well into the movie. Instead of adding meaning, they were distractions. The eye seems completely unnecessary and the information from the book would have been much better if displayed as text on the bottom of the screen or in some other, less intrusive means. Another noticeable difference is one of the ending scenes... in the director's cut there are black lines/boxes over the images, which looks very amateur - as if it was done in photoshop and not done very well at that.The bonus disc of special features is yet another disappointment. It's boring even to a fan of the movie. I fell asleep during it. I did not have that problem during the special features of the original 2001 release.Buy the first release of Donnie Darko (which gets 5 stars from me). Don't bother with this version unless you have a free rental coupon and everything else is rented out. I resisted the urge to rate this version even lower than I did, because it would be good... if a better version hadn't already been released. It's just really unnecessary.	3.0	buy the version released in 2001	2005-03-07	11	7	4

It is more thoughtful, complex, and thought provoking than American Beauty, though on a certain level it is a tad less realistic. I honestly don't want to spoil one second of this movie for you because it is so good. It's a story about a boy, a twisted looking rabbit, and the very concept of time and fate. It deals with issues of faith, sanity, love, fear, and destiny. Truly, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Donnie Darko started small, just playing in very select theaters in select cities.  Basically everyone who saw it fell in love with it and it instantly became a cult classic.  Nobody really understood what was going on, but something about the film grabbed them.  Now with this director's cut, audiences all over will finally understand what the hell the movie's about.  From the visually astonishing cinematography to the incredible acting to the mindbending plot, Donnie Darko is by far the most outstanding over-all film of the past decade.IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS YEAR, SEE DONNIE DARKO!	5.0	The Best American Movie in a Decade	2006-01-12	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A14E9I0FO6EVBT	dave-o	"Donnie Darko is one of those rare suprising films that takes all your expectations and throws them in a blender. This whirlwind of teenage 80's schitzo-angst is a treatise on every adolescent ""outsider"" and their own self-discovery. It takes the idea of justifying ones existence through self-sacrifice and blows it up a hundred-fold to very unique ends.The acting (aside from Barrymore) is subtle and carried through with great care so as not to burden the audience with the state of being that these suburbanites are burdened with. Donnie himself as the center of the film (and later, the universe) is bit player to his own demise and the careful development of his coming to terms with death is like nothing I've ever seen on film. The script and pacing allow for real empathy especially in his therapy sessions where he uncovers the source of his dilemna. Sure, the film is flawed (again, Barrymore's character and some wierd plot devices) but the ride is one of the most original takes on that awkward point in each of our existences.Stunning in every way a film should be."	5.0	Supurb filmmaking	2002-02-22	8	6	2

That is not to say that director Richard Kelly doesn't keep the action moving, just confusing, like some David Lynch films.  The cast here performs earnestly with the material given them.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3GKOMCQTTWPUI	"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL"""	"Writer-director Richard Kelly's debut feature, the Lynchian Donnie Darko, is a tale of adolescent angst ripe with enigmatic sci-fi underpinnings. Regardless of whether Kelly's titular protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is seemingly deranged or merely on the brink of saving humanity from itself, his time-warping fantasies become startling metaphors for confused teenage male development. This endlessly inventive film is the virtual antithesis of happy-go-lucky '80s teen flicks, hauntingly gauging the pulse of a nation gripped by sexual repression and political uncertainty. Kelly's jabs at Reaganism are about as subtle as his devilishly boldfaced ""Vote Dukakis"" shtick. By film's end, Kelly has expertly transformed his comfortable '80s milieu into an apocalyptic sweat chamber nervously situated between moral complacency and heartbreaking could-have-been hopefulness.""Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick,"" says 26-year-old Kelly of his film. The students at Donnie's school free-float through hallways that begin to resemble portals into an alternate universe. Make no mistake, this is Kelly's deadpan notion of what life was like in the '80s. A school bully openly snorts cocaine by a friend's locker in one hysterical slow-motion shot. Kelly allows ample room for poignancy when the bronze statue of the school's mascot (here, a curious squatting dog) keeps stoic watch over a fat girl named Cherita (Jolene Purdy), whose swan-inspired performance at the school's talent show is rejected in favor of a lame Stacy Q rip-off. The group is named Sparkle Motion, spearheaded by Donnie's young sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase). They are the embodiment of '80s cheese-pop; their performance is ghoulishly applauded while Cherita's hopeful gaze into the future is tossed aside with polite disinterest.A sleepwalking Donnie is lured out of his house by his alter ego (here, a rabbit named Frank), who saves Donnie from the plane engine that crashes into his bedroom. As a result, Donnie comes to believe Frank's prophecy that the world will end in 28 days. Halloween's arrival and the Bush/Dukakis race pitch-perfectly compliment the film's apocalyptic wind-down. With doomsday nearing, Donnie becomes an upstart messiah ridding the town of self-righteous false prophets, though he does find time to innocently woo new-girl-in-town Gretchen (Jena Malone) with retro come-ons like ""do you want to go with me?"" A New Age gym teacher who makes little emotional allowances outside her fear/love lifeline is Donnie's main target. Her downfall is followed by and linked to the fiery demise of a self-help guru played by Patrick Swayze, whose motivational shenanigans Donnie hysterically shoots to the ground.Now in a hectic search for enlightenment, Donnie begins to believe that time travel is possible. For help, he looks to the town's 101-year-old biddy (writer of the fictional tome The Philosophy of Time Travel), who is as eerily frozen in time as her hopeful disciples. Taught in English class by quasi-hippie Karen (Drew Barrymore), Graham Greene's The Destructors and its tale of creation/destruction beautifully compliments the film's fateful finale. References to '80s pop-culture abound: Sparkle Motion is invited to be on Star Search '88 while Donnie and Gretchen catch Sam Raimi's Evil Dead before Donnie does away with the town's false prophet, whose participation in a kiddie porn ring seems to shatter the entire town's sense of complacency. Donnie Darko is a blazingly original evocation of better-place-than-here hopefulness, an affront to '80s naivete that is mindful of strange events that seemingly happen for a reason though not always for the better good."	5.0	One of the most original movies ever made	2006-08-12	8	7	1

Many other films have had extended director's cut versions released where there were only a few seconds or a couple minutes of extra footage, which added nothing to the story. That is simply not the case with this particular DVD. In this instance, the director's cut answers many questions that a viewer of the theatrical release may have asked while watching the film. There are a ton of extra scenes, and they're not just ""fluff"" shots, but actually contribute a lot to the story. If you saw the original version and liked it, but didn't quite understand what was going on all the time, watch the director's cut, and it's very likely that you'll ""get it"" this time 'round."	5.0	questions answered	2005-03-08	4	4	0

Each time I watch it, I find even more brilliance in it, more to ponder, more to discuss. So, with that said, how do I review the screen's most complex and disturbing look inside the mind of a borderline schizo teen who is at the crux of possible worldwide destruction described by the poster bunny for rabbit population control while Donnie is on a discovery path to himself?Well, I could start with the fact that so much more lies within the coal plated exterior edges of this true horriffic masterpiece than first meets the eye.I could focus on the few comedic elements that lie on the outskirts of some of the most dramatically striking scenes ever devised in any movie, let alone one of an outsider teen on the brink of seeming madness, but really more sane and smart than most.I could comment on the almost cardboard cutout representations of 80's suburbanite caramel coated goodness that Donnie is so far removed from and how that difference brilliantly skywrites the message of ""just because I am different doesn't mean I am crazy, you're all the nutso ones!""Or I simply could leave you to your own conclusions.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3AMH5XQEW9Q56	Deanna J	"The first time I saw this movie a few years ago, I really didn't like it. I was left extremely confused; I felt there wasn't a point to the movie and it went nowhere, throwing random scenes and characters in for no apparent reason.I've watched it around 5 more times since then, including just last night, and have grown to love it. It is such an intriguing film - almost impossible to not be completely captivated by.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed teenager (I use the term ""disturbed"" very, very lightly) who seems to not fit in with society and begins to see a man in a bunny suit (""Frank"") who claims that the world will end in less than a month. Throughout the month, Frank tells Donnie to commit various acts such as flooding the school and burning down one man's house.What makes this movie difficult to understand is that everything isn't explained completely. Even at the end of the movie, you're still left puzzled, but definately not as much as throughout. Donnie was supposed to die at the beginning of the movie because of a jet-engine crashing into his bedroom that appeared from a worm-hole from one month in the future. Frank's claim that ""the world will end in less than a month"" makes it Donnie's 'mission' to stop that from happening. By the end of the movie, despite Frank's efforts, Donnie goes back in time and changes the path Frank took him on during the month, inevitably 'saving the world', however not in the sense that the world will explode or something equally as ludicrous. It's more like he's saving society from their own ignorant destruction of life in general. As you watch the movie, you'll begin to see how foolish and close-minded Donnie's peers and school teachers are, as they value all the wrong things in life.I still don't understand every detail from the movie, but watching it multiple times really does help. I wouldn't say I am drawn to movies about time travel, but I have always liked all the ""Back to the Future"" movies and used to watch ""Quantum Leap"" on TV a lot. I enjoy movies that have deeper meanings, symbolism, hidden themes, and in ""Donnie Darko""'s case, movies that don't waste my time with unncessary dialogue and action.If you liked ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"" and/or are attracted to the sounds of this deep - albeit twisted - film surrounding time travel, I would highly recommend this movie."	5.0	Learn something new each time	2005-12-03	5	5	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AXGQG0PHFY6JS	"Deidre Knight ""literary agent and author"""	There's nothing better than beginning a cinematic journey and knowing absolutely nothing about the film.  Such was the case for me with DONNIE DARKO--I only knew it had received critical raves and starred Jake Gyllenhaal.  Man, was I glad to be totally unspoiled! If you can, approach this edgy, supernatural film in just that way.The movie begins subtly, making the viewer increasingly uncomfortable and subconsciously terrified.  If you like David Lynch, for instance, especially MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you'd love this.  It also has a sort of Alan Ball feeling to the visual narrative.Donnie is a troubled teen who wakes at movie's beginning along the side of an abandoned road.  How he got there and why he knows nothing about his journey is the stuff of the movie itself.  A film that teases with time travel, personal responsibility, and the worst of teen society, it's definitely darkly humorous.  Think HEATHERS.  Only add in a lot of other inspirations, even a video of SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT.It's been a while since a movie surprised and disturbed me quite so much.	5.0	A Subversive Powerhouse	2006-06-21	3	3	0

I've since gulped down every movie he's been in, including the undeservedly maligned &quot;Bubble Boy,&quot; and this man's range is astonishing.The film itself is aptly summarized in the rest of the glowing reviews.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"It has been ten years since ""Donnie Darko"" appeared in theaters and in within those ten years, fans of the film, people who watched and have appreciated the film continue to watch it over and over  and many still give their interpretations of what they think ""Donnie Darko"" is all about.  Many who have had differing opinions of the film especially with the release of the Director's Cut version of the film.But ""Donne Darko"" has a pretty considerable following and yes, has achieved cult status.Not surprising as ""Donnie Darko"" is one of those films that tends to mix reality, non-reality, time-travel and possibly a parallel universe to give a surreal film that people need to watch this film more than once.  And sure enough, with each viewing of the film, people tend to find certain things that they have never seen before.  And I have to agree because each time I watch this film, I always discover something different, something new.So, what is ""Donnie Darko""?""Donnie Darko"" is a film written and directed by Richard Kelly (""Domino"", ""The Box"", ""Southland Tales"") and while it was not successful in the box office (the film was budgeted at $4.5 million and took home $4.1 million), the film has done much better in home video release.In 2002, a DVD for the film was released.  Followed by the ""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" 2004 DVD featuring 21 additional minutes of extra footage and new special features and in 2009, ""Donnie Darko"" was released on Blu-ray with both the Director's Cut and theatrical version of the film.And here we are with a 2011 Blu-ray release titled ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"".  While pretty much the same release as what was released back in 2009, this edition includes the Blu-ray with both theatrical and Director's Cut release and the special features DVD from the popular 2005 Deluxe Edition release but also includes the original 2002 DVD that came with special features (which were not included on the Deluxe Edition or the 2009 Blu-ray release) and a digital copy of the film.VIDEO:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is the same Blu-ray release from 2009.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:#5:1 aspect ratio), the picture quality is quite soft.  The film is not actually vibrant but there is clarity over the previous DVD release.  There is a good amount of grain and black levels are good.  But maybe its the original film elements but I did notice a good amount of noise as well.Overall, ""Donnie Darko"" (theatrical or Director's Cut) has good PQ and while not as vibrant or very detailed compared to modern releases on Blu-ray, the PQ for the film is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While dialogue and music is what comprises this film's lossless soundtrack, there are times where you hear immersive sound.  From the fall of the airplane engine on Donnie's bedroom, the sound of the worlmhole, the brooding sound of Frank or the sound of 80's music from Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears or INXS, the audio quality for the film is good but don't expect full immersion via the surround channels.  The film is primarily central and front channel driven!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:Blu-ray:Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Richard Kelly and Director Kevin Smith (Director's Cut) - Actually, a very enjoyable commentary to hear these two filmmakers discuss the film.

And even if you do watch the theatrical version or even the Director's Cut, only those willing to rewatch and dissect the film, to piece together the various clues, will find the film to be quite entertaining.For me, I love films that make you think, I love films that have a lasting rewatch value because you tend to have different interpretations of what is going on and what is happening.  What is real?  What is not real?  Are we watching scenes from Donnie's perspective or reality?  Or is it a parallel, alternate timeline?Needless to say, this is not a film that will be easily accessible for those wanting a simple, formulaic storyline.  And to make things even more confusing is the inclusion of the Director's Cut which has scenes that further make the series a bit more confusing and different, that you either will prefer on or the other.Speaking of the Director's Cut, it's essentially almost like you are getting two different films.  The Director's Cut changes a few musical sequences and adds in other sequences that make you wonder why the Director added them but needless to say, the film was complex to begin with and now it's even made a bit more complex with the additional footage.  Especially the addition of the title cards showing the contents of the Philosophy of Time Travel.Personally, when I watched Donnie Darko, I just thought it was sick individual who didn't take his medication and what we are watching are neither reality but a figment of his imagination.  But then again, that would be too easy of an explanation.So, the next time I watched the film, I felt that perhaps there was  deeper meaning and almost what we see with those who have mental issues and end up hurting or murdering people because they have a problem with society, I often wondered because Donnie had so many issues of society, was always a challenge to authority, that perhaps it was his way of trying to free himself from society.  To conjure any thoughts of escaping the reality through time travel and in some way, while a smart individual, it's his inability to fit in that puts various situations in his mind.I often feel that there is also a message from Kelly that he felt towards society.  Where his sister is a dancer for Sparkle Motion, the parents put too much emphasis on their children to achieve but for the wrong reasons.  We see it at the beginning of the film when Rose is talking to her daughter about Harvard, we see Rose more concerned about Sam's dancing and the parents for the other children are no different.  And I felt that Kelly was trying to demonstrate how messed up society is because of this thinking.  That people are consumed by this culture that there are other things that that should be cared about but no one was willing to make that change.  But it's not just Donnie's parents, it also can be seen with the teacher (played by Drew Barrymore) and other adults where society is literally heading to darkness and decay and perhaps Donnie is the one to fix the world.But that leads me back to the people with mental problems who go on to hurt others.  In their head, they are also thinking they are trying to make the world a better place when in fact, no one sees them like that.  More like a cancer to society... the same can be seen with Donnie Darko, hero for a new generation or a cancer to society?Last but not least, there is almost a lax of parental authority. Children are free to cuss on the table, the father just laughs.  Donnie tells a teacher to shove something up her butt and his father just laughs.  And as for Frank, the demonic rabbit, this is Donnie's figment of his own imagination.  Think of it as the devil and angel on one's shoulders, telling them what to do and not do.  Well, remove that angel out of the equation and substitute that devil for a demonic rabbit.  The rabbit is the yearning of Donnie to be destructive because afterall, who will really care?And the irony of it all, is that destruction is going to happen but yet, Donnie seems to have found love during destruction and to see that love taken away.Of course, I have had several interpretations of this film over the last ten years.  It's an artistic expression that reminds me of a Picasso painting where you can see a painting that looks so off, so dark and bleak, but someone else can see it as light, vibrant and unique.  Donnie Darko is a film that is not mean to be understood 100%.  It's mean for the viewer to take what they got from the film and interpret it their way.  Some may find it complex, some may find it as a simply love story.  Some may find it as a film of sacrifice.  It's all subjective to the viewer.As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately there is not much new aside from the downloadable digital copy that is included with this 10th anniversary of Blu-ray and the inclusion of the original 2002 DVD release.  Those hoping for a remaster or newer restoration are not going to find any changes from the 2009 Blu-ray release. But for those who have not purchased the 2009 edition on Blu-ray, then by all means, definitely give ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" a chance!  It's definitely worth checking out if you are open to creative, artistic and a different style of film.I have heard cinema fans who talk about how they disliked the film at first but now consider it a masterpiece.  I've read people who love intellectual films to surreal films but couldn't get into ""Donnie Darko"".  Suffice to say, people do have an opinion of it.  There is no doubt that ""Donnie Darko"" Is definitely a different kind of film and possibly one that didn't do well in the box office because of its unusual nature.  But to see how this film has grown its fanbase in the last decade is quite intriguing!Regardless of how my interpretation or others interpretation of the film may be.  Positive or negative...really, it doesn't matter because this is not your average film where one can watch once and give a definitive answer.  It's a film that requires multiple viewings and because of that, it either may peak your interest or turn you off.""Donnie Darko"" is meant to be experienced and re-interpreted.  It's a film that is thought-provoking, intriguing and surreal but at the same time, I can easily say that it may not be accessible for the general public and it may not be for you.  But if you are into artistic expression of cinema, then ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is worth watching!Definitely recommended for the cineaste!"	4.0	"Blu-ray: You may find Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" to be a complex but wonderful film or even a true masterpiece."	2011-12-16	10	8	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2QZG7ZDZHUKPT	dirge9	DD was a flick that i watched because it was available for something like 10 bucks and i read the synopsis and it seemed interesting so i bought it and i watched it and i liked it and so should you.the story fascinated me because i am fascinated by the concepts of time travel and alternate realities and that is what this movie explores. in addition to those things the film delves deep into the minds and the lives of teenagers who have some problems dealing with society. it presented these teenagers in a relaistic way as opposed to most goofy teenage flicks that are totally unrelaistic. the interaction between brother and sister and child and parent is extremely realistic and i appreciate the seriousness and emotion that it took to write those scenes.  we need more of them.i must also say that jena malone is hot but she looked younger than she really is in this movie. she needs to be in more films and, given her obvious talent, i am sure she will be.i would recommend this movie to readers out there who happen to be reading this review that i wrote because, first of all, this is a very well made film especially considering that it was done by a first timer.  the vivid imagery is fairly mesemerizing and intrigues you to the point where you find yourself captivated with the imagery and then the characers and then the story.  it simply looks beautiful as hell.the acting is alos excellent as jena and the rest do a fine job. jake is his usual self, which is good even though he seems to be the same in all his flicks but he is a perfect fit and plays Donnie well as hell. the parents are even good as is jakes/donnies sister - always good.my only complaint is that i wished that it more fully explained the whole time travel aspect of the story but the way that the story was told left a lot to the imagination and that is a very good thing because it is fun to think and figure things out instead of being spoonfed everything by annoyingly pretentious hollywood directors.by the way, jena malone does a very good job in this movie.	4.0	Donald Darko	2004-09-15	9	1	8
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1OKMIT8B373YD	djhexane	So in this perfectly made indie film from a fear years ago we get nothing but wonderful acting from some pretty well known stars and a perfect script as well as some good affects for the film only being shot for like 4 million.We have a sick and delusional teenage boy trying to live his life through all the horrors of the 80s and being a teenager.  If that wasn't hard enough he starts having delusions of a big demonic bunny rabbit damned Frank.  Frank tells his he must do certain tasks to save everyone, because the world is comming to an end.  So Donnie is set on this path where everything connects so perfectly.  Does he save the world at the end, who is frank really?  Do we have free will, or are we fated?Yes, expect watching this more than once and plan on being open to many different interpretations.  This is one of those films where its fun to talk to someone about what you think it's really about and what's going on.Highly recommend it!  And the soundtrack is awesome as well.	5.0	Creation is a Form of Destruction	2004-02-03	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	"The loss of words I'm left with after watching ""Donnie Darko"" is not one born of fascination or perplexed wonderment, but one of sheer disappointment over being cheated out of two hours of my life for a story that does everything but shove its originality down the audience's throats. A cross between science fiction, horror, and comedy, the possesses but a few fleeting moments where these elements take flight, but never once do any of them connect in a noticeable pattern.The beginning of the film is exquisite, a terrific combination of character introductions and seething dread. We're introduced to Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teenage boy plagued by schizophrenia and severe depression, that which causes him to converse with a abnormally large, surprisingly spooky rabbit named Frank (later revealed to be played, fittingly enough, by Gregg Araki alumnus James Duval). Such moments provide a terrific amount of underlying dread, that which perhaps causes one's expectations to elevate.We also meet the Darko family: Donnie's parents, Eddie and Rose (Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell), and his two sisters, all of whom look upon Donnie as look upon Donnie as the bad seed, though hope for better days ahead. His parents are understanding of his mental state, providing him with therapy and medication; they provide him with all that he needs in hopes of reinstating his mental health.Then one night, things get worse. After Donnie's first meeting with Frank, a freak accident involving a dismembered plane engine results in shaken nerves, though no one is hurt. Donnie, however, is told by his new imaginary friend that there is a window of 28 days, after which the world as he knows it will come to an end. He meets a girl, falls in love, all the while performing strange and sometimes shocking acts at Frank's request.Interesting beginning, and certainly enticing enough to wet one's appetite for more. But the movie's main course turns out to be a less-than-satisfactory concoction of science fiction and the psychological, throwing things like time travel and premonitions into its already-crowded blender of potential ideas. Despite my increasing frustrations with the material's lack of coherence, I found myself strangely entranced by it, blinded by my hope that something would eventually tie things together. In the end, there is an explanation for everything, albeit a very inconsistent and ludicrously disjointed one that only furthers one's discontentment for such a wasted opportunity.The film has a good cast in its favor, though one has to wonder how hard it is for Gyllenhaal to stare dismally into space and look continuously glum and despondent. McDonnell and Osborne play convincingly caring parents, while young Jena Malone is quite the attraction as Donnie's newly acquired girlfriend. The movie features Drew Barrymore as an English teacher who's fed up with abiding by the curriculum, and Patrick Swayze as a fear-fearing fanatic blinded by his fanaticism to his own hypocrisy.In the beginning, I got the feeling that too much was going on; after it was over, I felt as if nothing of any significance had occurred. My main question concerning a film like ""Donnie Darko"" is this: what is this movie trying to say? What is this story really about? Do the filmmakers hope that their bleak portrayal of such cultural elements as censorship and religious fanaticism will mask their inept efforts at creating a coherent storyline that makes no sense in its conclusion?"	2.0	Inconsistent and ludicrously disjointed.	2002-04-08	14	5	9
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1QO7HLN7WBY3Z	DocSmithers	"This review concerns the newly released Director's Cut of Donnie Darko.Fans take notice there is a new kid on the block, but it's not all peaches and roses.Many of the scenes have been changed.  Some have had material added.  The music has been changed and moved around.  A few of the original songs are gone from the original DVD, Under the Milky Way, and The Killing Moon are gone.They cut out some stuff too.  The scene with Sparkle Motion is indeed done to Notorious, which I read had originally been changed, it hasnt.  While the song Notorious is still there, the scene has changed in other ways.  No longer do you hear someone from the audience yell, ""get off the stage Cherita"" and ""you suck""  during here Autumn Swan dance.  Its weird now, b/c Cherita looks around as does others as if someone had just yelled offensive stuff but since the lines were removed, it just seems strange now.So many other changes... I don't want to bore you with that.  Let me get to my point here people.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko in any form, skip this one and watch the original DVD release without a doubt.For the majority of you who have seen or own Donnie Darko already, this DVD is nothing more than a appendix to the original.  It tells you more, answers more questions.  But to a large extent, these questions were better left unanswered.I love this film, but I am rather dissapointed with the Director's Cut.  The original DVD cut is much better, the music choices are better, and the pacing is much better. Enjoy the Director's Cut if you are a true fan, but watch the orignal DVD for the rest of your life."	4.0	Director's Cut: Think of it as an appendix...	2005-02-16	14	13	1

For one that came and went in a flash from the theaters, its word of mouth and its adoration by most viewers and reviewers is amazing. It is one of those rare films where its ambiguity does not frustrate viewers, but engages them. Is it spiritual, supernatural, metaphysical, romantic, satirical ... ?  Gosh - just about everything.  The characters and the actors who play them are wonderful.

The story-telling, the pacing, the visuals, the music, they all contribute to a better viewing experience in this director's cut.The bonus disc has good features and the short about the #1 fan is hilarious in an ""I'm gonna kill John Lennon"" kind of way.

This is a movie which will leave you questioning what it is you just saw. You'll want to watch again as soon as its over. The Directors cut also fills in many of the holes left by the original, as well as change the feel of nearly ever character, Frank being the most important.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AORLF6SCDMAUA	"Donovan Reese ""Wunfevteane"""	Granted, it's a thought provoking movie, which is a bit of an oxymoron, if you think about it. I mean, movies are Entertainment, and the minute you have to think about what is supposed to entertain you, it stops being entertainment, and becomes work, which is what we go to movies to escape from!Okay, I'm not saying this because I don't 'get it.' I'm the weirdo in my social circle. Tape deck: Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Coldplay, conscious hip-hop - the stuff that requires thinking.Favorite movies: Fight Club, Vanilla Sky, Memento - the stuff that the average dude has to see 3-4 times to 'get.'I respect your attempts at philosophy, Sunshine - no doubt you're a college man. But for God's Sakes, this isn't a teen movie made to challenge religion. The Matrix has more religious undertones than Donnie Darko! DD is an acid trip, in the most poignant sense of the word.Bear in mind, I rated this movie five-stars, so I'm not belittling it. Still, so many of my friends have the tendency to overhype things. If it's just okay, it's good. If it's good, it's great. If it's great, it's a classic piece of art that dwarfs all things in its presences. You get the picture.About the movie: Donnie Darko, like the last review said, is a challenging movie, with a scenario that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen. Even after all is said and done, it's still difficult to tell whether Donnie Darko has imagined the whole thing, or if he has somehow been able to turn back the hands of time.Donnie's an iconoclast; he (forgive the tired cliche) marches to the beat of a different drum. He's a little darker than those his age (duh), but he's also a lot smarter, dabbling in obscure sciences, and often wrapped up in an obsession with the study of time travel.This would make him a respectable fellow, if not for forte for theories about the apocalypse, as well as the fact that he sees a life-sized talking rabbit (we've all seen that in the trailer).All of the performances, both from the veteran actors, of which there are a few, and the newcomers, of which there are also quite a few, are very well-delivered and believable. It's really surprising to me that this wasn't a big movie, propelling Jake to stardom (sure, he's popular, and he got to go out with Kirsten Dunst, but he's no A-Lister).It's very surprising that this was the writer/director's first film, as every piece of dialogue, and every camera angle seems like it came from the hands of a pro.In the end, I highly recommend this movie. It is a great film, a thing that young aspiring directors may look to in the future for inspiration. So, in conclusion, people, watch it, enjoy it, but please don't take it too seriously!	5.0	Uh, Dude, Calm Down - it's just a movie...	2005-06-11	9	2	7

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A6LUXI8I8BU6P	"D Strick ""Entertainment D"""	"Donnie Darko is one F'ed up movie, but in a good way.  The movie makes you think and you know from the first frames of the film that this is one of those you'd better pay attention to or else risk missing something important.  If you're not prepared to challenge your mind then you may want to wait until your brain is ready to watch this.The movie gives the viewer humor, horror, teen angst, family drama, psychological thriller and sci-fi rolled into one and remains fun to watch and interesting which is the feat, I think, that makes it as popular as it is.  Donnie, the perfectly cast Jake Gyllenhaal, is a darkly troubled teen that is either, crazy, a genius or a cog in a universal scheme that has the power to save the world.  The only consistent thing is that we have to see what he's going to do and say next.Frank the Bunny is his horrific companion in his adventure and helps direct Donnie along his path, helping him to escape death and commit acts of violence that may or may not serve an important purpose.  Or is it all schizophrenic delusion?  This is a movie that a few minutes in you will know that many questions will arise and maybe not all will be answered by the end.Many people who were faithful to the original cut of the film will point out that the director's cut may not be as ambiguous as the original and therefore not as challenging for the viewer.  That may be correct.  I was very proud of myself for figuring out the main plot (well, mostly) on my first viewing, but then I had the help of the time travel book text to assist me whereas, as I understand, the original did not.  I do know that even if the director's cut is ""easier"" it is still one of the most thought provoking and intelligent movies around.  It is also of note that the director does not expect us to forget the original but states this is just a re-mix and can co-exist with the original release.  Considering the subject matter of the film I don't see why that can't work.  He's not pulling a George Lucas on us anyway.To sum it up, the movie is just too interesting to pass up.  It may sound like sci-fi but it has so many elements that it really defies that simple tag.  Watch it and enjoy the ride."	5.0	Darkly Donnie Darko Does It	2006-04-07	6	5	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A84Z6XUMGRMJ1	Duane Thomas	I can understand how someone who saw this movie in a theatre as a stand alone experience could find it confusing. Fortunately, the deleted scenes in the DVD kind of take you by the hand and clue you in to what actually happened to Donnie, and why.Having said that, though I'm truly glad I watched them, my overwhelming impression of every deleted scene was that there was a good reason it was deleted, that the movie was better without it.For instance, the scenes with Donnie carving pumpkins with his sister and her attempt to help him, and his heart-to-heart with his Dad, were very well-acted but lessened the sense of Donnie as being isolated, of having to deal with this hideous problem alone.The scene with Elizabeth on the phone gives us way too great a clue toward one of the big surprises later in the film.I'm very, very glad they cut the scene where the shrink tells Donnie his pills are just placebos. Again, that greatly lessens the sense of Donnie as being in a totally crappy situation, a big part of which was being forced to take anti-phychotic drugs. It also paints the doctor, a character we're supposed to like and respect, as being extremely deceitful and manipulative, to have lied about this, not only to Donnie but his very concerned parents. &quot;I think we should increase his medication,&quot; indeed. Nuke that one.Watch this movie. Enjoy the very many good things it has to offer. Then watch the deleted scenes to understand what you've just watched.	5.0	If you found the movie confusing, you need to see the DVD	2003-10-30	4	3	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1PMR24J40P9B1	Duncan Shields	I don't think that the theatrical release of this movie is superior to the director's cut but they're both pretty good.  In an age of formulaic movies and action blockbusters that were getting worse and more numerous with every passing year, this was a welcome change.  I heard it described once as John Hughes (Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Weird Science) meets David Lynch (Wild at Heart, Eraserhead, Lost Highway).  I think that sums it up.  It's a lovely film that I can watch over and over.  If you haven't seen it, check it out.	5.0	Donnie Darko is king	2006-06-26	4	4	0

The entire cast is fantastic (except for Drew Barrymore, but we can forgive her since she executive produced the movie), the soundtrack is wonderful, the effects are beautiful for a movie that didn't cost much by Hollywood standards to make.  This is a cult fave in the making.I have found that 20-30 somethings love this movie; but people from our parents' generation do not get it, just as they don't get the other movies I listed above.There are plot holes and other imperfections, but overall this movie is a revelation.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A17LD2AH9K9GJD	Dylan	"Review of the Theatrical Release:It was poorly advertised. It failed at the boxoffice. Nobody I know has ever heard it mentioned...Yet, Users of the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) rank the movie among the 100 greatest films ever made. The film has gained what many would call a ""Cult Status"" among it's viewers. It seemed that this film barely shook the box office, or for that matter, the nation, when it came into theaters near the start of the decade. A recent Director's Cut was released, adding a near half hour to the film, which, provoked my interest even more. Well, I wouldn't even say that. Prior to the releasing of the Director's Cut, I had never heard of such a film. I never knew it existed, and as I read the summary, I knew I had to see it. So, I did. I didn't get to see the Director's Cut, I honestly didn't want to, I wanted to examine this film from when it was first released. I knew the premise, something about a giant rabbit and the end of the world. Sounds right up my alley.So, I went into the film with high expectations. A movie about a giant rabbit and the end of the world? And it's one of IMDb's top 100 films? It has to be good, with a premise so out there, and to be appreciated to the extent it would be given that honor, of course I went in with very high expectations. The opening shot of the film already raises a question. Donnie atop a cliff, appearing to be thrown from his bike. He lifts himself up, then smiles at the mountain tops in front of him. Already, the audience is confused. The movie takes place in 1988 in Middlesex, Virginia. Our main character is a troubled 16-Year Old who's recently refused to take a number of medications. At the moment, I was already disappointed. Yay, clich&eacute;s. However, in a matter of less than twenty minutes, I found myself liking Donnie Darko's character to a very large extent.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the growing tension in every scene. You know something is going to go very wrong, even if it takes awhile. To see the characters develop around this growing tension, is what caused everything to have some sort of meaning. As little things were shown on screen, very minimal, I knew they had to mean something. I would hope this movie would not have thought I was stupid enough to either ignore them. Though, they were not too obvious either. I just have an eye for these things. Early in the film, Donnie awakens, and appears to be sleepwalking. He walks outside into his yard, where a grotesque bunny is waiting for him in the yard. He informs Donnie that the world will end in less than a month, it's presented in such a disturbing way that, well, you think the world is really going to end like this being is saying.That's exactly what the film is though, terrifying. Is it scary? No. It's on a whole other level of emotion, one which penetrates you, and scares you in an emotional way. As the film continues, an apocalyptic tone is thrown all over it, with atmosphere that I have yet to see in any film. Underlining this film about the end of the world, the social commentary is dead on. It's a universal film, one that speaks of the corruption seen in our everyday society. Never have I been so disgusted to watch a rather common dance done by grade children. Once again, that's another element of the film. It's disgusting...But in a good way. Does that even make sense? The film needs to be looked at as if it were a 3D-Model. It needs to be watched numerous times for us to find meaning in it, even if that meaning is different to every single person that watches it. Everyone will see a different film. If you're looking for a End-Times Sci-Fi Thriller that will entertain you, look elsewhere. This is a film for those who want to analyze it, want to think about what they're seeing. Not saying that it is not entertaining, it's amazingly entertaining.The film counts down the days until it's conclusion. Each day, the sun in the scene seems to be ab it dimmer, until it's completely pitch black. Never have I seen such creativity and imagination in a film, nor have I ever been so amazed by a piece of cinema. Dare I say I prefer this film over EOE? Dare I say that this film is the most amazing I have ever come across? I think I do. After the credits rolled, I was stricken with a feeling of sadness. It felt like it was ten seconds long. This film needs to be explored, and most importantly of all, remembered.Review of the Director's Cut:I gave the original release five stars, and is quite possibly my favorite film, right up there with EOE.The Packaging:Very good, honestly. The slip cover is a white image with Donnie's front and back as an example from the Philosophy of Time Travel. It's very attractive, and it's one of the few DVD slip covers I actually keep on the DVD. When you take it off, you get an even nicer cover. A very cool shot of Donnie with his axe, smiling into the camera. One of my favorite shots from the film, and with the dissapointment of the very ugly cover of the 2001 release, it's a sigh of relief. The discs are the same covers as the slip covers, which actually look very nice.Special Features:Very good. You get a very insightful, and funny, commentary with Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith. That alone is worth the money, and I see myself watching it again in the future. There is a very entertaining documentary on ""The #1 Darko Fan"" which is either a very funny parody, or a very sad true story. I have not looked up to see which one it is...There's a theatrical trailer, which is the Director's Cut trailer. The original trailer, man, I hate it so much. No wonder it did horrible at the box office. With a tagline such as ""Dark, Darker, Darko"" how do you expect to get viewers? There's also a documentary from the UK on the cult of Darko, which both provides a very cool look at the fans and Frank in alot of odd situations, that make it somehow creepy. Frank in a phonebooth? I don't know why, but was really odd.Movie Picture:The movie never did look very well. Colors run together, in some places there's white spots and glitches, nothing too special. It doesn't look bad, I would just expect more from a DVD from this century. Not sure if it's the way the film was shot, or just a bad DVD job.Sound:Very good. There's more background noise, easily noticed in class scenes and outside shots. Frank's voice never sounded so good, and pretty much everything is heard better than before.Movie Review:On one hand, the cut scenes added alot to the film, and made it pace alot better. It added awhole lot to Donnie himself, as we learn more about him and the people around him. On another hand, some scenes completely ruin the power the movie once had. I mean, I never thought such little changes could ruin an entire scene. In Donnie's famous scene with Cunningham, even the short segment with Jim running back and fourth in fast foward with slides in the background made the scene alittle less powerful. Some lines were even taken out! One of my favorite lines in the film, Frank saying ""I'm so sorry..."" to Donnie in the theater was ripped out. That made me so angry. I mean, if you know the meaning of the film, it's such an emotional statement. ""I'm so sorry I have to put you through this. I'm so sorry you have to die. I'm so sorry I killed Gretchen.."" The scene is dumbed down. Also, if the scenes with the books had been completely taken out, the film would be just as good, if not better as the original cut. They're so poorly done, I mean, just absolutely horrible. They come up on screen with very bad animation, and they are either cut too short and you can't read everything, or they fade so much with the background you can't make out the words. They're distractions. They take away from the previous and next scenes. Instead of just throwing in a cheap (Photoshop looking) book segment, why not reveal it some other way? Perhaps have a closeup of the book itself being read by another? Or just leave it out compeltely. Half the fun of the first film was not knowing what was going on by the end. Now that's all gone. It seems like a mess....And what happened to the countdown scenes? Those really added to the film, and now the film loses a whole lot of it's suspense because of it.The ""Mad World"" scene, which was my favorite scene in the entire film, is now ruined by an overlay of a chapter of the book. Ugh. It just makes me so angry that he would ruin such a beautiful scene just to put in information. The mood of the movie is gone, and so is the disturbing aspect the original cut had. However, I don't regret getting this. The special features and commentary are worth it alone, and me being such a fan, I will keep this no matter what I think of the new cut. The old one is only $10 anyway, I'll get it eventually. I just wish they would have put both cuts on the DVD, I mean, then I wouldn't be dissapointed at all...But oh well. You can't win them all. The film is still good, but not great. The first cut was near perfect, but now this one shows Kelly's first time glitches unlike before. Sometimes you shouldn't fix what isn't broken. In no way is Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut a bad film. It's a good film...But by comparison to the original cut, it just falls flat.It's no longer a film that disturbs and intrigues you, but rather with a bad taste in your mouth. You felt as if you missed something, even if the film is longer. It's less constructed, and almost feels as if it's just a bunch of scenes thrown together with anything constant.The Director's Cut gets Three and a Half stars, and the original gets five. I averaged it out to five, simply because I'll feel horrible otherwise."	5.0	Wake up, Donnie.	2005-02-27	10	9	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A15BJJVD5IKKRE	eastvillage	Film student here.  This is a good example of a modern expressionist film.  In other words, the filmmaker made it for himself, not for an audience.  And of the few people who are receptive to it, no two understandings of it are the same and certainly not the same as the filmmaker's since this is basically a look inside his own mind.  Anyone who thinks they understand this film only understands it for themselves.  I think this movie is interesting for it's bizarre way of provoking philosophical and supernatual wonder, however, do not mistake that and the plot complexity for cleverness.  This is not a 'clever' film; it's just one particular filmmaker's canvas strokes which, on the surface, is somewhat random.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  A clever film would be one that has an overall conceptual or narrative hook that keeps all spectators on the same page.  (Remember, moviemaking was invented as a communal spectator medium; not a home video stoner gathering on a basement couch with friends.)  A film doesn't have to tell a coherent story or even have a story; it just has to be engaging in some way.  This movie it worth a shot if you haven't seen it, but I suggest starting with the theatrical version.Also, the Blu-ray transfer is very unimpressive as far as picture.	3.0	Masturbatory Filmmaking	2008-11-19	3	1	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2R8TND4PTAQ47	E. Conforti	I purchased this DVD this past Tuesday since I heard it was a great film from my friends and cousins. Coming into this movie with the plot outline I read a few weeks back really led me to a totally different place, but after seeing the movie I am thankful it went the way it did instead. It is truly amazing. This is an excellent movie which sort of defies classification: thriller, mystery, sci-fi, horror - it just doesn't seem to fit altogether in one category in particular. I have not felt so in awe after a movie since Fight Club. It is just so beautiful. The camera shots, the scenery, everything is so beautiful. The mood is set so well. There is a certain &quot;ambience&quot; which the director/writer Richard Kelly (27 - 28 years old) is able to create which alternately gets you laughing, thinking, or just sends chills up and down your spine. The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing. So much information to process, so many mysteries, so many thoughts it is hard to say anything but &quot;Wow&quot;. I am lost in my chills and my hollow stomach, and I feel thoroughly satisfied. You can not watch this movie just once, it just won't let you. The experience watching this movie is one of the most gratifying experiences I have ever felt. I love this movie. And even if you didn't get the ending, you can't but help enjoy the creepy atmosphere which runs through this film.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A24003XWL00WNL	"E. E. D. ""musing kitten"""	This is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen. The cinematography and the actors' performances were superb (especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who ought to be nominated for an Oscar). The score was spellbinding. The intricately-woven themes resonated deeply for me -- a lost and confused youth, seeking meaning and spirituality in a world where the sane are called crazy, and ultimately discovering for himself that the force called God manifests itself in unexpected ways.The special features on the DVD are a MUST - watch every deleted scene both with and without commentary. They will give you a fuller, more textured vision of the film's purpose. They also show the greater level at which Drew Barrymore's character should have interacted with Donnie; I think it's really sad that so much of the real meat of their relationship was cut out. Watch for the restaurant scene with Donnie's parents - it's short, but hysterical.Go online and check out the movie's website, too: it's phenomenal. Oh, and buy the soundtrack, if for no other reason than to hear the beautiful rendition of &quot;Mad World.&quot; I guarantee you won't be able to stop humming it for days.	5.0	The search for God is absurd?	2002-06-14	0	0	0

Before I actually started watching this, I sat in the darkness of my living room and opened my mind.  I told myself that I have no expectations.  It is going to be different, yes, but that is why I am watching it.Richard Kelly is so amazingly creative!!! He is the Quention Tarentino of the new Millennium!!!  While this movie is not violent like Pulp Fiction, it's screenplay is just as original.""Donnie Darko"" certainly may not be the feel good movie of the year nor was it a blockbuster hit.  It is now my favorite movie.Why?  Well, first off, it is unique and I am so tired of the usual romantic comedy or the formulatic action/adventure that has come out in the past year.  2001 had so many movies come out of it that i just did not care for.  This film is one of the select few that really moved me and made me think and was also very intensly entertaining.  If you are of the group of people that just wants to have some silly laughs or want something light and airy, this isn't a movie for you.  I do often like to laugh, and did find myself laughing a few times at this movie, but it is so original>  It's a beautiful story that is told through Donnie's mind.Secondly, the acting is brilliant.  Jake Gyllenhaal, also of the moronic ""Bubble Boy"", is utterly amazing and so in tune to his character, Donnie Darko.  It's as if the character was written for him.  The expressions he makes often appear a bit creepy, but he isn't supposed to be competely sane.  Donnie is, however, a good person, and Jake makes him seem so real and true.  I pay a great deal of attention to what the characters say and do in movies, and I think that Donnie Darko is one of the greatest characters ever written.  Sure he may have some emotional problems, but he is a nice guy who in some respect is willing to do anything for someone he loves.  The film itself is set in October 1988, and Donnie, who is on medication for emotional problems, has this very frightening and menacing looking bunny rabbitt called Frank come to him into a dream.Frank makes Donnie do things, things that maybe in Donnie's mind may seem like the right thing to do but aren't; however, he feels there is some justification in doing them.  While he may feel this way, his school(except for one teacher, played by Drew Barrymore), and the self-help preaching Jim Cunningham, played by Patrick Swayze do not.Talk about the 80's!! Swayze hasn't been in much since those days.Drew Barrymore is the worst thing about this movie.  Is her character supposed to be acted so badly? I have never particularly liked her as an actress.  She was born into an acting family, and I think it is the name that has gotten her into films.  She is the executive producer of Donnie Darko, and I think that they just gave her a role in this because of that reason.  She plays Donnie's English teacher, and while her acting is pretty bad, the character is one that Donnie actually appreciates and to some extent admires.Mary McDonnell, who's most celebrated work is in Passion Fish, plays Mrs. Rose Darko.  She is very good in this and convincing as the mother who feels as if she hasn't done a good job as mother to Donnie.Katharine Ross plays the therapist that Donnie goes to.  She takes the role seriously, and plays it very well yet subdued.No real other names stick out for me in the acting category, but all of the actors and actresses are all very good in this.  They all work very well together.My other reason this is a favorite of mine is that it is set in the 1980's, which is my generation.  I was in junior high and high school then and this brings back great memories for me.I think they could have made more use of 80's music in the film.  The only song I recognized is Tears for Fears, ""Head over Heels"".The main reason I call this favorite is because of it's originality and it's message.  I paid very close attention to Donnie and what he says throughout the film, and I found the message to be a bit complex and hard to understand what was going on until the end.  That is all I will say.One really must take this movie with a complete open mind.  I really can't classify this film into one genre, it is a bit science fiction with it's subplot about time travel, but there is so much to this movie it's just hard to classify for those who contemplate watching it.  If you are up for something completely different and go into it with a mind wide open, I think you will be very pleasantly surprised.This is a sad, demented at times, powerful, and thought provoking film that was so overlooked while in theaters.  It never came anywhere near me on the big screen, only in Cambridge.I rented the dvd, which was so amazingly well done.  I watched a lot of the extras, for fans of the film, it is worth buying with all the extra goodies such as deleted scenes with audio commentary.  I, myself, like to watch with the commentary on after viewing the movie as it brings me into a deeper understanding of what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish."	5.0	My new Favorite movie	2002-03-22	1	0	1

It's a wild ride through the teenage mind of Donnie Darko.Donnie's ride begins when he is visited by a rather large and scary rabbit who predicts the world will end in a matter of days.  The same night his room is obliterated when an airplane engine comes crashing through the roof.  This sets in motion a chain of events that lead the already troubled youth to become obsessed with apocalyptic visions, time travel and the nature of reality.Is he delusional or a visionary?  What is the nature of reality and time? How do we fit into the universe?  All of these things are part of the sometimes strange, sometimes funny world of the denizens of Darko's universe.	5.0	Donnie's Wild Ride	2006-03-03	0	0	0

This is film that you must come at with a very open mind, if you dont you will hate it.This is a film for people who like to step outside the circle, for people who arent satisfied by just another blockbuster, not that i hate those i thought that Pirates of the Carribean was one of the best films of last year I even rank it alonside my favourite of last year Kill Bill, and thats saying a lot as I preach to anyone that listens. Just ask my fellow horseman and Amazon reviewer The Birdman.But seriously see this film or else your world will end on an empty and sad note.	5.0	young man visited by rabbit, stops world ending.	2004-03-16	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3RU2P4FAACQ1J	"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger"""	"I haven't seen this DVD yet because as of the time I wrote this review it wasn't out yet, but I know the extras include an audio commentary with writer/director Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith, a production diary of the film with optional commentary by director of photography Steven Poster, a storyboard-to-screen featurettes, They Made Me Do It Too - The Cult of Donnie Darko featurettes, and #1 Fan: A Darkomentary.However, I have seen the actually movie when it was in theaters and I own the DVD of Donnie Darko. Some people don't think the Director's Cut adds much, but I think it adds a whole lot. It's a lot easier to understand than the original cut and it flows so much better with most of the deleted scenes from the Donnie Darko DVD included plus splices of the Philosophy of Time Travel and a few changed songs.For those of you who know nothing about this movie I can't tell you anything about it =P It's a movie that you can't summarize other than saying that it's deep and awesome. It starts out with a boy being saved from an airplane engine falling into his room and killing him by a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named ""Frank"" who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. See? It sounds hokey, but trust me, it's not. The cast is impressive with Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhall, James Duval, and Mary McDonnell. It's written and directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, who has also written the upcoming film Domino.The dialogue in this film is smart and intriguing. The acting is spot-on, and you can't even tell that it was made low-budget. The Director's Cut gives you more of a feeling that every single scene matters, and it does. It has these beautiful scenes that were cut for the sake of having it under 2 hrs, but they add so much to the overall feeling of the plot including information about Donnie's medication, a scene about Watership Down, and some other scenes I'm not at liberty to spoil. If you're trying to figure out which one you should get, get this one! Some people argue that they don't like how he changed the songs, but it's his vision and he put in the songs that he couldn't afford to put in before, it really doesn't change the plot."	5.0	The must-see cult hit	2005-01-05	7	7	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1I0O37Q7G7UAI	Emily	"In my opinion, this movie is pretty terrible. I bought it about a year ago, after reading that my favorite celeb likes it and seeing the high IMDB rating. I finally watched it several months back and could not understand why on earth so many people enjoyed it. Then a couple weeks ago, my brother, two cousins and I (mixture of males and females, ages ranging from 24 to 40+) were searching through my collection for a movie to watch. I warned them that I found ""Donnie Darko"" terrible, but they still wanted to check it out because of the buzz. I gave in, hoping I might form a different opinion after watching it again. At various points during the movie, my family members commented about the slow pace and/or the bizarre dialogue and occurrences. By the end of the movie, all three of them had come to the same conclusion as I had: this is quite a bad movie. So perplexed by the ratings and reviews, we watched the bonus material. Even with a few things we didn't pick up on explained, still a bad movie.When I think about ""Donnie Darko"" and the positive reception it gets, I almost feel like this has to be a joke. Today I randomly Googled the movie to see if there was still something I was missing. I read this entire article: [...]. It didn't change my opinion. I can't believe the creators went so far as to make an elaborate website: [...]. I can't believe both the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes pages for the movie have such high numbers. I can't believe there are all these positive reviews here. The problem is not that I don't understand the theories about how everything ties together and the overall meaning. The problem is not that I can't suspend reality. Or that I judge movies harshly (I rarely consider a movie ""terrible""). I argue it's that, no matter how you slice it, ""Donnie Darko"" is sucky. I am giving it two stars because at least it makes you think about relatively interesting things and because the awfulness of it is a little entertaining, as is the fact that so many people think it's great. I probably wouldn't be leaving this review if it weren't for the deficiency of similarly poor ones. I almost feel a duty to write this."	2.0	Bewildered by the high ratings and positive reviews	2012-06-11	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1OSAXMX241JQ5	Erica	I give this movie 5 stars because it is original. Each time I watch it, I sink deeper into Donnie's mind. I think that there are alot of people, young people, out there that are somewhat like one of the many characters in the movie. I never knew why I thought so much about life, I often thought I was strange, and then I saw &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and I noticed that I am not the only one that sometimes thinks &quot;too much&quot; about things(although of course his thoughts consumed him). I think that also alot of people are like Chanita,a round, plump,but adorable young asian girl who is picked on. Also people are like Gretchen,a teenage girl with a good heart but hurts of her own. I think that this film was wonderfully directed,not perfect, but great. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal is an adorable and talented actor, sometimes I watch this movie to see his work. I recommend Donnie Darko for those who are dreamers.Those who are not just walking on the earth without a thought or observation about our world.If you do not have a capacity to think and do not have huge capacity for imagination then I do not recommend this because the point of the movie and the intellect of the movie will not be absorbed the way I personally think(opinion) it should be and was intended to be.	5.0	I dont have a title	2003-01-09	9	6	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A373S0T1HF1K6P	Eric M. Van	Obviously I haven't seen the DVD yet -- but I did see the Director's Cut three times during the two weeks it played in Boston last September.  The restored footage does two things.  First, it enhances and fleshes out what was already a wonderful troubled-adolescence story.  Second, and more importantly, it moves the movie away from David Lynchian ambiguity and makes it, instead, what the director always intended: an airtight, completely explicable work of science fiction, one whose basic, essential storyline can be fully grasped on the first viewing (as evidenced by the half a dozen DD newbies I dragged with me, all of whom got it and all of whom loved it).  There is still, of course, an astonishing amount to be grasped on repeated viewings: the more I saw it, the more it moved me.Donnie Darko would be a ***1/2, 9/10 movie if it had no sf element at all, if it were just a conventional story of a troubled teen.  Combine that with a mind-expanding, intricate sf story that says profound things about the nature of destiny and free will -- and you get what is almost certainly the greatest non-futuristic, non-eye candy work of sf cinema.	5.0	The Definitive Version of an SF Masterpiece	2005-01-25	8	4	4
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1JCN10T0TPOPH	"Esn024 ""esn024"""	"Now before you write off my review as useless, I'll say this much: most people (especially western-culture teens) will like this film.  People apparently like it very much when a film ""messes with their heads"" (in the words of one avid reviewer), especially when it espouses ""trendy"" teen philosophies such as the stupidity of mentors (be they teachers or parents) and the meaninglessness of everything.  Classic ""teen angst"" things really.What this film does is it presents us with an antisocial, depressed  teen nutcase who embodies all of the above philosophies, and then justifies his actions.Donnie Darko, who comes from a VERY rich family judging by their house, commits one crime after another in the film, speaks dumb jokes to his ""friends"" and wipes out a whole branch of physics with a single sentence (""wouldn't it be possible to travel backwards through time by travelling faster than light?"").  The movie glorifies him through all of this, presenting him as some kind of messiah who is the only one who has seen the light.Yes, I can see why so many people like this. Wouldn't it be nice if it were REALLY that way? If those stuffy scientists, teachers, and parents were really wrong about everything, despite all of their hard work and dedication? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do to know the Truth would be to have some hairbrained notion in your drug-hazed head about what is really right (yes, Donnie Darko is constantly on anti-depression drugs throughout this movie)?This film will indeed ""mess with people's heads"", but it won't clear them, which in my mind is what trully great filmmaking should do.  Donnie Darko, with its false and depressing interpretation of the world, is flawed at its most fundamental level.It's full of plot-holes as well. Here's one: how does a TORNADO make someone travel faster than light?The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that the cinematography is rather good.In closing, if you are the type of person who likes enlightening films, avoid this one like the plaque! There are far, far better films out there about life's mysteries that warrant viewing, like the 1972 Solaris, Come and See, The Passion of Joan of Arc, Au Hasard Balthazar (due out on dvd in 2005) and Wild Strawberries.This film may be ""smart"", but it takes itself too seriously for a film whose underlying ideas have no basis in reality."	2.0	Empty pretenciousness for a teenage audience.	2004-09-02	40	7	33

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1OK9M013BF5RC	E. Willi	"Review based on DIRECTOR'S CUT.As GROUND HOG DAY made use of Nietzche's idea of the ""Eternal Recurrance"", DONNIE DARKO uses Nietzsche's ideas of ""Beyond Good and Evil"" -- using terms of the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze): ""Fear and Love"". Nietzsche thought that life experiences are too variegated to simplistically interpret as being either fully good or fully evil, and this is the critique that Donnie says to his teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) during the ""Fear / Love"" class exercise. Now, as far as plot structure, and where reality begins and ends... It seems that [PLOT SPOILER] Donnie is destined for tragedy, but gets a chance, through some odd combination of divine intervention and time travel, to save the world from the day of destruction. He is led in this by the Rabbit figure, Frank (James Duval), who could be Christ/angel/demon. The events cannot be interpreted simply as good or evil: [PLOT SPOILER] Burning the house down seemed evil (fear-based), but the result was good (an act of love) because the porn ring-leader was busted. [PLOT SPOILER] The scene with Donnie and Frank in the movie theatre: Frank reveils his eye wound (from when Donnie later shot him), but appears fine at the end of the movie. A risen Christ figure? [Going back and reading some of the reviews, there are some who argue that Donnie IS the Christ figure since he sacrifices himself to save others. I'm sticking with Frank, however, because Frank has the Christlike knowledge and power. ""Jesus will walk with me down through the valley..."" Frank was there for Donnie, just as Christ is there for us. Any sacrifice Donnie makes is done in imitation of Christ -- a disciple following his master.]Then again, it could simply be a case of possession, either demonic possession or possession by the Holy Ghost.WWDDD? What Would Donnie Darko Do? Ever since watching this movie, whenever I get an urge to do something maybe not completely rational -- something impulsive -- I see Donnie shouldering his axe with his heart glowing."	4.0	Beyond Good and Evil	2011-04-11	1	0	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"To Fox's credit, and to cultists' delight, none of the extras on the extended version of ""Donnie Darko"" were ported over from the original 2003 DVD. The extended film and bonus features create an alternate home video experience -- totally in the spirit of ""Darko."" ""I'm just as proud of the first cut as of this one,"" director Richard Kelly says. He likens the new film to a remixed record. In the digital age, ""There can hopefully be two versions of a film that exist.""Wise guy director Kevin Smith and Kelly keep each other amused on the commentary, with Smith occasionally playing the interviewer. (He'd be a talented journalist, it seems.) They set off on some entertaining tangents. More commentators should bring along their smart friends.The director took deleted scenes from the first DVD's extras and returned them to the film. He added ""comic book"" visual elements like a giant eyeball. The audio was reimagined to heighten the supernatural vibe. A couple of songs were returned to their rightful positions, and an INXS tune now opens the film.The new audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) proves a dramatic, subwoofer-smoking upgrade. Not so with the letterboxed images (2.35:1) -- reproduction is as soft and uninspiring as on the original disc.The hourlong ""production diary"" is more a collection of on-location footage, with optional voice-over from director of photography Steven Poster (""Blade Runner""). ""Donnie is the embodiment of Jesus,"" a fan explains in the British docu ""They Made Me Do It: The Cult of Donnie Darko."" She's being interviewed by a man in a cheap bunny suit. The piece tells how ""Darko"" had its first successes in London.The highly interactive donniedarko.com found the ""No. 1 fan"" via a home-movie contest. In his short film, the beefy zealot shows off his ""Darko""-infested bedroom and kisses Kelly, who is understandably alarmed.There also are a good 8-minute storyboard-to-film segment and blazing trailer that makes you want to see it all again."	4.0	In the Darko	2005-03-03	3	3	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ACVNA57PI4DLV	Francois Tremblay	"This movie is a load of crap, but it's an entertaining and endearing load of crap - until the directors veer into the real story, of which we care not one whit about. The more I watch movies, the more I find that directors thinking that the story should lead when it shouldn't (and vice-versa), is a common fundamental fault.It stars, obviously, Donnie Darko, a strange and smart disturbed young man who forgets to take his medication, with alarming results - an apparition makes him sleepwalk out of the house. That is fortunate, because an unexplained plane jet falls on the house, but being outside he is undamaged. Oh yeah, and the end of the world is near.Donnie Darko is an interesting movie, in that it refuses obstinately to fit into the mold of ""disturbed teenager"" movies - it is almost cheerful and enthusiastic about finding comedy in the unlikeliest of places. Unfortunately, this energy is eventually set aside for plot and symbolism, which in the context does not make much sense, and we don't care.At the end of his review, Roger Ebert comments :""(...) somehow the control fades in the closing scenes, and our hands, which have been so full, close on emptiness. ''Donnie Darko'' is the one that got away. But it was fun trying to land it."""	4.0	Does not fit into the mold	2003-05-18	5	2	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3BA5ISHG5AHF2	Frank Gregg	Okay, I've seen a lot of movies, and this is definately up there, but I wouldn't have said that after the first time I watched it.  The first time, I was talking to my girlfriend, blah blah blah, and basically had NO clue what was going on at the end of the movie, and hence, hated it.  The second time, though, I paid attention and it was a totally different experience.You will enjoy this movie if you pay attention.  I mean close attention.  Like don't go to the bathroom attention.  If you have ADD, move on now.  But this is a teen movie like none you've ever seen before.  It has time travel, violence, craziness, love, and a slew of other ideas going on.  It's a very psychological movie, and is made all the better by my personal favorite actress, the beautiful Jena Malone.You might want to keep your friends out of this one.  Lock yourself in the room after going to the bathroom, eating, whatever you need, and dont come out until it's over.  Believe me, it's worth it and you will NOT be dissappointed.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A30R4VQEXHOYHG	Frank Werner	I saw this movie after it was recommended that if I enjoyed Mulholland Drive I would enjoy this one. I found this movie to be even more disturbing than Mulholland Drive, and just as difficult to figure out after the film had ended. At times the movie also reminded me of &quot;American Beauty&quot; with its portrait of suburban dysfunctional family life. I thoght Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance but I found his character to be somewhat creepy as well of course as the circumstances and visions that he experiences. I thought his therapist was not so competent and I was surprised he didnt get as angry with her as he did with the other fanatical adults that he encountered. The movie was just a little too intense for me at times and was often painful to watch. The ending I found totally baffling as well as totally unexpected, but I guess if I watch it again I might possibly figure it out. In short if you want to watch a movie that will induce in you the urge to take tranquilizing medication, I recommend this movie.	4.0	weird	2004-01-30	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A382H513KAC9YT	"Freak-free Metalhead ""Formerly known nowhere"""	"You know, it is truly irritating to read the reviews from negative people who cannot back up their close-minded opinions with solid reasoning. I respect others opinions because we live in America where opinions can be said, but opinions are useless without reason.Anyway, onto my review. A friend of mine suggested we watch this when invited over for a movie night. I said something in the context of... ""sure, whatever"", thinking this movie was going to be really stupid, because of the title (which I now think is good).I had no idea what I was getting into - one of the BEST movies I have EVER seen.If that's so you're probably wondering why I gave this only 4 stars. First reason is because I am very very stingy on writing movie reviews because like I said I am more of a music guy. Second reason is because as perfect in many aspects as this movie is, it still has its flaws, like ANYTHING ELSE.Let's start off with the good. Plotline - yes, negative reviewers, usually the reason why you think this is a terrible film IS because you don't get it. Just because you can't comprehend something right off the bat and it is not handed to you on a silver platter doesn't mean its bad. It also doesn't mean it is bad when they leave a plot to open self-interpretation. It just means that you *GASP* may actually have to think for yourself for once.I'm not sure I want to sum up the plotline - because I can't do that without putting my own opinion into the picture. What this movie does is subtly link every event that happens and every little detail that takes place and leaves you to interpret the meaning of it all. If you want opinion, here's what I got from it - SPOILERS - Set in 1988. Donnie Darko comes down with a severe schizophrenic disorder in which the character Frank the Rabbit represents the type of repressed human fear that dwells in us all - it just so happens that it surfaces and shows in Donnie. Excellent use of characterization. Then what happens is that Donnie starts to question the universe in which all human existence takes place... and starts to form a satirical opinion of the mechanized existence which he sees. He is then informed by Frank, who saved his life by preventing a jetliner engine that crashed through his roof from crushing him, that an apocalyptic event is coming soon because of a rip in the time-space continuum. What Donnie must now do is make a choice, a very important choice, determining the fate of humankind. I'll leave it there to not spoil the end.This movie is right up my alley, anyway. The type of obscure, science-esque film that does not have a plot and/or meaning handed to you. The type of movie that you can't just sit back and switch your brain to the off position while watching. Then you throw the ideas of time travel, alternate existences, and tangent universes into the mix, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be gold to me!Of course, this nowhere near even STARTS to tap into the intricate detail that this film presents to you, but to do that would require pages of writing. As for the graphical presentation of this movie, for a relatively low-budget film, it was top-notch. The special effects resembled those seen in high-budget hollywood sci-fi productions such as The Matrix. The camera angles and motion techniques used by the director were breathtaking, using wide, sweeping camera angles, a camera ""one-eighty"", a blue-masking effect overlaying the film, and subject transitions that some big-name directors would envy.Talent - decent, but this is where some of the blank star is taken from. The only unconvincing role was Drew Barrymore, who I was never a huge fan of to start with, but her role is not very quintessential to the film besides the phrase ""cellar door"" (if you haven't seen the movie yet this won't make sense). Everyone else played the roles very convincingly except for one point, where Jake Gyllenhaal was with the character playing the psychiatrist and he was going into a panic mode - it was an abrupt transition and overly dramatic, making that a flaw in his acting. But I can live with that.Soundtrack - one of the best ever. The music is used to great effect throughout the film to enhance the mood, a technique that is dying out in film productions nowadays. The Gary Jules cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"" is better than the original, and at the moment it was used in the film, made me feel as though I've never felt before, if you know what I mean, and that feeling doesn't come easy for me when speaking of media or entertainment (I feel emotional usually with actual real people, I don't usually get way too emotional over media productions). Not only does this song chill you to the bone, but it actually describes the point of the film well, through the use of imagery.All in all, it was one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch - I beg the negative people to give this film another chance - watch it with an open mind and try to think for yourself for once. Try to break out of the concrete thinking mindset, that I once used to be in. I'm 16 going on 17 and have already shattered it. Believe me when you realize that this movie is meant for open-ended interpretation and how it makes you feel when it forces you to think, you will realize what a great movie it is and the positive connotation of it."	4.0	I'm more a music guy.

There's just so much metaphor, story, and symbolism here that you can't wrap your head around it after one sitting.  The story is brilliant, although it isn't spoon fed to you.  Like events in real life, where connections aren't always so clear, what's really going on in Donnie Darko isn't obvious the first time around.  That's what's so great about it!  Unless you're one of the many people out there who hate to think, watch this movie!One caveat:  I spent nearly 20 minutes in Barnes and Noble trying to find this DVD.  Because it hops genres, I was looking all over the place.  I found that it was shelved under ""drama."""	5.0	Mindblowing!	2004-09-05	3	1	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A5JLAU2ARJ0BO	"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money"""	Donnie Darko is another time-warp movie.  There's some originality to the plot, but the overall idea is not too original, or particularly coherent.  This is another example of a movie made by drug addicts who put their crazed minds on screen, to pollute the American general public.  Stupid movie with terrible acting.  Avoid.  You won't get anything interesting; only to make the drug addict filmmakers and their souless studio executive backers richer so they could buy more illicit drugs.	1.0	Overdone time-warp movie	2003-07-26	32	6	26

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A15JFODPMUGF0M	GangstaLawya	A universe existing along side ours where Frank comes back as a rabbit to warn Donnie Darko that closure of the other world occurs within 28 hours (give or take a few minutes) and will take our universe with it unless Donnie, savior like, uses his supernatural powers (we don't know where they came from or what precisely they are) to stop it before the plane engine kills Donnie in Universe A to stop Universe B from taking us, with the water spout giving more nebulous information, is too much to take.  The subplot involves a pervert.  Let's go make a movie on the seat of our pants.  I have a better plot: a tea cup breaks and the universe is going to end unless the owner of the tea cup can find the superglue within 28 hours.  A puppet which looks like Obama keeps giving the owner of the tea cup grimm warnings which all come to pass.  No matter where the owner of the tea cup hides, this puppet makes its appearance: on the radio, on televion, on nonstop infomercials, and last of all, the toilet.  As it pokes its head out from under the tiolet seat, the out of control puppet continues to torment the owner of the tea cup.  The owner of the tea cup discovers that destroying the teleprompter that the evil puppet is reading from is key to stopping the realization of any more ominous omens.  The story ends with the universe A of the puppet imploding when an airplane engine falls on the puppet as the puppet is giving a speech to an audience of gullible people who live on every word of the mad puppet.	1.0	baffling bull --	2010-03-21	22	3	19
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3JUMMIGJ7B38X	GarionOrb	"Donnie Darko is one of the most original and compelling films ever made.  I give the movie a firm 5 stars.  For details of the film, read the other reviews.  Suffice to say that it's a haunting, brilliantly cut film-noir with very interesting characters and superb acting by the entire cast.The Director's Cut, however, lacks.  I firmly believe that director's cuts should add new footage, not change existing footage.  With 20 extra minutes, there's a new scene here and there, but the most obvious changes are in the way certain scenes play out.  The eyeball thing every time Donnie encounters Frank the rabbit doesn't quite seem to fit, and the time travel sequence at the end is just way to busy-looking to be enjoyed.  I much preferred the simplicity of the way that scene played out in the original.  A few tiny segments have been cut entirely, and that bothers me because in this movie, it's the little things that make it interesting.  The 5.1 surround sound has also been re-edited, and again, I prefer the original.  During the Sparkle Motion scene at the talent show, the sound quality of the Duran Duran song is terrible, but halfway through, it fixes itself.  The picture quality is far worse than the original cut.All in all, I think the original is better.  The excerpts from the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" book is a nice change though.  Rent this first before you buy."	4.0	Just as great, but slightly lower quality DVD	2005-03-13	6	6	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3SHLIOC1U3FD9	"Garrett Strantz ""gilbert125"""	As far as titles go Donnie Darko&quot; is about as unassuming as they get. Go figure then that the movie is one of the more original, thought provoking contributions to cinema in recent memory.What makes this film so engrossing is the effective balance that is achieved between the more technical aspects of the film and the story itself. This balance cannot be overlooked as there have been innumerable movies over the years with interesting ideas but poor execution, as well as the inverse. The Thirteenth Floor and Cameron Crowe's Ope... Vanilla Sky come to mind.Technically, this movie is wonderful. The lighting, the camera work, the pacing, etc all fit the movie perfectly. Also, the use of music is done quite well as it adds to the mood of the picture and does not distract. The script is also a triumph, which is noteworthy given that the film does tend to ebb and flow, 'changing' from 80's teen flick, to horror, to dark comedy, and back again. The casting is spot on as well. Patrick Swayze finally has a career-defining role and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect in the title role.And then there's the story. At first glance, the plot could come off as a jumble of ideas tossed together, I suppose. But, the way the pieces fit together (and they really do) and the shear originality of it all make it work. Amazingly, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is one of the few modern movies that cannot be directly compared to something else, which is noteworthy in this era of big budget remakes and explosionfests that are supposed to pass as legitimate cinema. Sure, certain aspects of the movie may seem familiar, but whole of the movie is original.If you like movies that require thought, attention, at least a second viewing, and an open mind, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; would get my highest recommendation. And even if you prefer movies that require less work, ignore this and go rent Con Air (again).	5.0	An Excellent Surprise	2003-03-27	53	45	8
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3W2QV7V3LQCTL	Gary	This a great movie, one of those that will blow you away and have you thinkign about it long after the credits roll. In repsonse to the debate of which version to view first: I say view the original theatrical release - no question about it. Just as I don't care for the mess that is Star Wars Special Edition, I don't really care for the Director's Cut version. IMO it adds too much unecessary fluff and gives too much of what makes the movie unique, and that is to explain what everything is about. Plus the change to the opening song in the Director's Cut completely altered the mood and poorly fit some of the scenes. My advice - Just watch the original version and if you have questions, get online and search for the explanation and speculation to your heart's content. I did that and had a rewarding experience.	5.0	Great movie - the orginal version, not so the Director's Cut	2014-04-02	0	0	0

In fact, I've changed my perspective on this movie every time I see it. I've never experienced a movie so thought pervoking as 'Donnie Darko'. 'Equilibrium' has come close, but I figured that movie out the first time I watched it. I kept coming back to 'equilibrium' for the drama and the fantastic story line. 'Donnie Darko' had me waking up the next day thinking about it. Painfully wondering what I'd seen and what had happened. I suddenly found myself on a quest to understand this movie. It drew me in and I didn't even see it coming. It seemed like I was watching a normal movie, all the signs were there, but something hooked me in and I havent' been the same since. Seriously, be warned, this movie is addictive. I think that's why it's such a favorite of many reviewers.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3GC6DCNENVC5E	George Krompacky	Somehow I missed DD in the theaters. Maybe it was the way the film was promoted. Maybe I was out of the country.This film has some incredible acting and superb writing. I am transfixed by the performances, particularly J. Gyllenhaal's. As one of the actors says on the commentary, it would have been an entirely different film with a different lead.The inclusion of cut scenes on this DVD is a WONDERFUL asset that gives a lot of insight into what was going on, along with the director's commentary. J. Gyllenhaal also speaks on that commentary but is a little irritating at times, interrupting the director when I want to hear what he has to say.This is essentially a scifi movie with insightful protrayal of our society.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ	George Waters	"Donnie Darko is, quite simply, one of the most unique and thought-provoking movies of all time. Originally released just six weeks after 9/11, the film - with its early scene of a jetliner's engine crashing through the roof of a suburban house and its open-ended questions about life and death - initially unsettled many people. On first viewing, you likely will find yourself left with more questions than answers. And therein lies the very goal of the film: to weave a tale that is so multi-faceted that second and third viewings let the viewer into the story that much more.The role of Donnie Darko is brilliantly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal. He completely transforms himself into the title role of Donnie. His sister (in the movie and in real life) is played by the delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. The film opens with Donnie being found ""asleep"" on a golf course. And so the story begins. Patrick Swayze's performance as a self-help guru selling simplistic solutions (think Tony Robbins with a very, very dark side) shows the man's incredible versatility and his ability to commit to a role. Throughout the movie, constantly brilliant dialogue is intertwined with a soundtrack of 80's era pop that sets the scene perfectly. When Frank, the giant rabbit, first appears, what are we to make of him? Is he a medication-induced hallucination? A being from another dimension? Or something else, something running in parallel with Donnie's life? I think part of the answer lies in the exchange between Donnie and Frank: ""Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?"" ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?""The Director's Cut restores some critical footage to the film, footage that helps flesh out some aspects of the story while also opening up other avenues for thinking about the story and its meaning. Bonus features include a ""Darkomentary"" about the cult following the film has garnered, that is quite an interesting watch as well. Donnie Darko is a film that I find myself watching again to look for new clues and theories. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a movie that encourages thinking in new and interesting ways, Donnie Darko is for you."	5.0	Do you believe in time travel?	2013-10-15	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1IL8R0M0CU83O	Geronimo	"My first thought after seeing this film for the first time was, ""What the ****?"". It was like watching ""Ordinary People"" on drugs. I am sure I am not the only one that felt this way. After having co-workers recommend this movie to me a couple of times I decided to rent it. By reading the description I was expecting a horror movie or a slasher film. That is very far from the truth. I would almost call this a comedy. But it's not really that funny. It is a movie that does not fit into one category or even two for that matter.The darkness of this movie and its lead character are overplayed at times. His psychological problems are not the first to be seen on the big screen. But his visions and hallucinations may be. The more scientific the movie gets the more it gets away from what I thought its intended purpose was. It seems by end of the movie you are forced to ask questions and there are some loose ends.The soundtrack is fantastic. Every song rings true of the eighties and is selected for a reason. Every song played in the movie is perfectly placed. I do believe this film could take place at any time in the last 30 years but the eighties seem to work. But other than the soundtrack and 1988 references like Mike Dukakis and Joe Gibbs you wouldn't know when it was set."	4.0	Still trying to figure this one out.	2002-12-13	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1X0YN7OWC69QQ	Ghost Writer	I finally got my hands on this film after reading all the reviews here. It certainly is very well-made, and quite original.I think some people are going over the top in their comments though. I mean this could've also been an extended TWILIGHT ZONE or OUTER LIMITS episode. That being said, it does draw you in with it's moody, matter of fact storytelling. The acting is fantastic. Oddly, this film does parallel with the style of AMERICAN BEAUTY as everything seems hyperreal, and the actors make you believe you're almost watching a documentary of a story that just happened in some neighborhood even when it's being somewhat sarcastic or purposely strange with the dialogue. Definitely includes great 80's song choices, and a beautiful score. I can't wait to see what the writer/director will follow this up with. Still, I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt some of the quirkiness, and jumbled style is unsubstantiated. I couldn't help feeling as if something was missing overall. Perhaps the answers lie in the deleted scenes? I guarantee the film raises more questions than it answers, so it won't appeal to action fans or those who prefer a tidy ending. Otherwise if you like films that leave you wondering about things in general afterwards, this comes highly recommended!	4.0	Very good, very twilight zone, and a bit sad.	2003-07-28	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A11TQOJF28GV7L	Gin-Gin	I stopped watching Hollywood movies a good while back, with the occasional exception, and this, though not Hollywoodian, was refreshing. I'm not sure why it took me so long to view it.The Giant bunny man seriously had me scared and speculating throughout the movie and the fact that I truly couldn't make an easy prediction about how the storyline would unfold made it a big plus for me. You can do your own analysis, think out your own theory and it will be good in a sense. It's not so complex that it completely blows you away and leaves you dumbfounded, but has enough for an evening of plot analysis amongst friends.I'm also happy I had no idea who Jake Gyllenhaal was, as in general, any often asked actor or actress that isn't less than brilliant still fails to come across as the character they portray. (I still see the 'moviestar' no matter what)The expression that seems carved in Donnie's face is something worth alone to watch the movie for in my humble opinion.As most people around here seem to be Americans, may I drop in some European films for you to view and form an opinion on?

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AQSQLWD3NLMAS	Glenn A. Buttkus	The young Richard Kelly, director of this film, graduated from USC Film School in 1997. This was his first feature film. He has spun a dark multi-layered vision, part dramatic comedy, part science fiction, part fantasy and allegory. The movie almost needs to be classified as three genres stirred gently. He set the world of the film as autumn 1988. It is, in part, a story of adolescent teenae angst, the familiar turf of a John Hughes project, but actually it is more like John Hughes meets David Lynch meets Steven Spielberg. Kelly has put several interesting twists into the high school yarn. It is like a hip FERRIS BEULLER'S DAY OFF.Jake Gyllenhaal, from MIDNIGHT MILE &amp; OCTOBER SKY, played Donnie Darko brilliantly. He was a young man smarter than his teachers, his parents, and his friends. An intrepid curious lad who could ask those questions very few wanted to answer. He is a kid who is being treated for mental illness, even though he may not have been clincially ill. He was outspoken, outrageous, and socially boorish...like most smart teenagers. Roger Ebert wrote,&quot; Donnie is appealingly smart yet sarcastic, more quixotic than eccentric, more curious than frightened.The film's prologue is bang on target. A bright sunrise on dark foothills, suddenly interrupted in the frame by the insertion of the black silhousette of a young man's head. Donnie Darko, there on the hard ground near his bicycle, far from home. After he cycles home, his arrival is treated as familiar behavior; sleep sojourns, adventurous forays into the darkness. That very next night, we witness him roused from his slumber by someone calling his name. He slips outside and we meet the presence that has beckoned him...a medium longshot of someone in a rabbit suit...someone named Frank. But this rabbit, tall as HARVEY, is not a benign companion. Its face is twisted into a demonic death mask. With Darko away from the house, we see an accident happening. Something has fallen out of the night sky, and crashed directly into Donnie's bedroom; a 707 jet engine. If he had been there when the engine came acallin', he would have died instantly. Frank sends Donnie off to do devilish chores; flooding the school, and burning down a house.Nothin is linear or logical in Darko's dreamlike world. His parents are too understanding. His new girlfriend, Jena Malone, is really too easy to get to know. Physical laws, like an axe being buried in a bronze statue, are tweaked and violated. The film can only approach some level of cohesiveness if one is able to conjure up a premise, a through line. For me, most of the characters presented are probably actually a part of Donnie's&quot;real&quot; life, but as they were mostly presented in the bulk of the narrative, they were peopling his &quot;dream&quot; life. One possible explication for the whiplash lunges from drama to comedy to satire to science fiction and fantasy, was that most of the film's narrative occurred from the time Donnie was awakened in his bed, either by Frank's voice, or the faint sound of the 707 engine whistling and plummeting down toward his bedroom. Time was compressed, like in THE INCIDENT AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE on the Twilight Zone, a sort of Alice through the Looking Glass dream squeezed into those precious elongated seconds.This film poses more questions than it offers answers for. There are theories that we, as spiritual entities, can sustain more than one version of our &quot;Self&quot; in parallel dimensions similtaneously. Somehow, it seemed that Donnie called on one of his alternate selves to swing through those last few brief moments, those seconds that stretched out into 30 days. Perhaps time is relative, and does not exist on the other side. I think this movie requires several viewings to begin to be fully appreciated. It is an original vision, bizarre yet strangely familiar, and immediate with it's punch to the emotional gut. It is eccentric, yet appealing.	4.0	Lagomorph Odyssey	2004-07-14	11	10	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1VRINL2DMCQK7	Glen Ramirez	First off, the original release of this movie was incredible: the director's extended addition is FANTASTIC! This is one of the few times a movie improved by adding in the cut scenes (approximately 20 scattered additional minutes). The scenes that first-time writer/director Richard Kelly added enhanced the movie tremendously. The original release at the theater got off to a rough start premiering one month after 9/11 (2001) grossing only $500,000 at the box office. The nation was in mourn and this movie has an aura of gloom. It became a classic once released on DVD and gained a HUGE following. It's extremely mesmerizing and still popular.Most have explained a large part of the premise and theories on this thought provoking, eerie and intriguing movie. Frank, the 6-foot-tall rabbit with what looks like the head of a science-fiction insect is worth seeing alone. Jake Gyllenhaal leads an all-star cast (including his real life sister Maggie as his screen sister). Actor Patrick Swayze plays a surprising role... The movie also includes one of the best soundtracks of any movie in recent years. Definitely a MUST PURCHASE!FYI: Critic Roger Ebert rates this movie 3 out of 4 stars.	5.0	Hypnotic & Fascinating even after Multiple Viewings !!	2006-05-18	2	2	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A21CFAK6J6H2UI	Goatface Killah	Funny, sad, and mind-blowing, 'Donnie Darko' is, quite simply, an excellent movie. The plot is complex and engaging, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the protagonist, followed up by a cast that doesn't leave Jake holding up the movie.Depending on what version of the film you see, the plot can be simple, or very hard to understand.  I saw the original version on television and it was easy to comprehend.  However, I had a lot of questions about little plot strings that weren't tied up.  Just the other day I saw the director's cut. I spent the rest of the night explaining things to the people who watched it with me while simultaneously figuring it out myself.But, let me explain first. In the original version of the movie the plot line goes like this. Donnie Darko is introduced as the protagonist.  He smokes, sees a therapist, and is rude to his parents.  Then comes the fateful night of October 2nd.Donnie is asleep when he hears a voice that tells him to follow it. Donnie gets up and walks out of the house and onto a golf course where a human sized, demented bunny rabbit called Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. At the same time as this encounter a jet engine falls through Donnie's room, which would have crushed him had he not gone out to the golf course. For the next 28 days Donnie goes on certain missions by the bidding of Frank, gets a girlfriend, and finds out about time travel.  I wont tell the ending for the sake of preserving it.In the director's cut there are a few differences.  The beginning is the same. However, this time the end of the world mentioned by Frank really comes into play.  It is explained (and this is explained only in the director's cut) that Donnie is in a tangent universe separate from the primary universe, and it will collapse after a few weeks, creating a black hole in the primary universe destroying all of existence.Donnie goes through the same adventures with a few differences here and there from the original version with the same ending result, only it is much clearer why he does what he does.I highly recommend this movie to those intelects who like to think about the plot, and to those who like dark comedy, and also to anyone and everyone, for this is truly not a film to be missed.	5.0	The End of the World	2005-08-15	41	39	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZS82R4RC0I2N	gonn1000	One of the most surprising and memorable indie gems of the last years, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a gripping and intriguing cult movie and a fine addition to the coming-of-age genre. Well, to define this movie`s genre is not easy, really, since it goes into sci-fi, teen drama, thriller, suspense and black comedy territory. But the most surprising element is that it actually suceeds at combining all that genres.A powerful experience about growing up, the building of personality, communication, schizophrenia and the frontiers between sanity and madness, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a superb achievement. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the confused, smart and offbeat Donnie, that spends most of his time going to school and talking to a giant rabbit.Richard Kelly`s debut as a director is strong and convincing, providing captivating and absorbing cinematography with an unique mood and an ethereal, oniric and dream-like atmosphere (similar to some David Lynch, Atom Egoyan and even Tim Burton works). Delivering enough surrealistic and gothic details, Kelly truly creates a personal and identifiable style here. The haunting score also helps to keep things interesting, capturing the zeitgeist of the eighties and providing a nostalgic dark feeling (Gary Jules` song &quot;Mad World&quot;, a cover of a Tears for Fears hit, is particularly deep and compelling).&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an amazing cinematic experience that wisely focuses alienation in suburbia, giving a peculiar portrait of teen depression and the coming of adulthood in an original way. This is what independent cinema does better, to offer innovative perspectives about old, been-done-to-death subjects. Richard Kelly`s directorial debut is one of the most interesting american movies of the last years that looks like nothing else. A real alien.Highly Recommended.	4.0	Mad World	2004-04-23	0	0	0

After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. So I watched it again.I have to say that I think this one amazing, powerful little film.  While I did not get every clue as to what was going on, I understood enough to see how clever this movie and story is.Basically this film is about a corruption in the timeline ... where an object from the future gets transported into the past ... and the need for reality to ""fix"" itself before everything collapses by manipulating characters directly and indirectly ... shaping reality so that the events that cause the tangental universe to occur actually happen ... plugging the hole, so to speak.Now I realized, for the most part, what was going on ... but I have many friends who did/do not.  This is a very obscure movie ... where you have to figure out what is going on as the characters are doing so ... some clues are obvious ... others not.Regardless, I would recommend reading the book ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" which can be found on [...] or at [...] ... additionally this second site has a synopsis that explains what is going on in this film.Read this information and then watch the film again ... you will see that everything makes sense ... everything seen or said has a purpose (in terms of fixing the tangental universe) ...I just wish that this film had been given a better chance in the theatre ... thank god for DVD."	5.0	An amazing film!	2003-07-29	4	4	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2PVUFJ8SQHPS7	Gordon Smith	Don't know where I was when this came out (probably avoiding Hollywood movies in general), but I'm glad I finally saw it. I had it reccommended to me by several friends and they were right. It's hard to sufficiently praise the risk-taking that the makers were willing to undergo for this movie. It's is very abnormal for such a big budget movie. It has a very convoluted message, and very psychedelic visuals. Not the typical nerd with a computer stuff at all. The characters are dynamic and imperfect and very well rendered. And the tension it creates and maintains throughout is quite impressive. I really just feel like praising this movie endlessly, because it did so many things your average movie won't even consider. I think it's great!	5.0	Very Original	2002-12-15	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A11133KC9ONJFW	G. Parker	Donnie Darko is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, independent films in history.  A story of the choices we make everyday and their relations to divine intervention, Donnie Darko lives up to every expectation I have had to compare it to and leaves the viewer wishing for more.When a plane engine crashes through the house of the Darko family, Donnie's life is spared by a hallucination.  After a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit calls Donnie out to a golf course and tells him that the world will end in 28 days, Donnie realizes that he would have died had it not been for the strange awakening.  What is happening to Donnie?  Of course, you will have to see the movie to find out.The very powers that created this film - such names as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Jake Gylenhaal - don't ruin it at all due to their Hollywood status, but instead are able to shine in a movie such as this.  It really shows the true range of emotions these actors can portray without the sugar-coating of a Hollywood production.The extended scenes and extras on this DVD are well worth it for fans and newcomers to this movie.  Not only does it add more drama and family connection, making the eventual climax much sadder, but it also adds more depth to the characters.  My only regret with this film is that they did not shorten Drew Barrymore's lines during her character's main scene, in which she is fired from the school in which she teaches.The music and composition in this movie is excellent.  I personally prefer the tracks from the original theatrical debut, but the director's true intentions for the songs in this version do not interfere with the story at all.Richard Kelly shines as director for this film, showing a depth and creativity rarely seen in movies anymore.  The success of this movie is his own doing, and hopefully Kelly will produce more films like Donnie Darko in the future.	5.0	It Will Knock You Flat.	2006-07-26	5	4	1

Not to be a jerk, but let me explain why, just to stimulate some discussion here.  It pains me to see a film so rife with typical ""Hollywood-isms"" get so much praise. Not that this is a horrible film, but I thought the dialogue was kinda transparent and rather pandering to ""our"" generation (those who came of age in the 80's) and I'm shocked how strongly some people feel about it. Honestly, I've only seen praise for this film, so I just felt I had to provide a different viewpoint, that's all. I eagerly await your hatemail!!"	3.0	Not a bad movie, but brilliant filmaking?

Who cares about &quot;understanding&quot; it anyway? How about the fact that there's a DEMONIC RABBIT in it for God's sake? I personally think this may just be the best movie about adolescence and youthful alienation ever. As bizarre and unlikely as Donnie's story is, you feel like you can relate to it, because it simply embodies the confusion and anxiety of being a teenager in extreme form.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1FFCOIPO26KBV	Gray	Donnie Darko is the most ferociously independent movie i've ever seen.  It has more plot twists and suprises than most people are ready for but, for people who like to watch a movie that they actually have to put some effort in understanding and keeping up with Donnie darko is perfect.  You will not be able to get it all at first(It will probably take many viewings for you to understand everything). Everytime you will be interested and compeled.Donnie is a six-teen year old boy from suburban Virgina.  In addition to having anger problems(for which he is taking medication) he is continually seeing a demonic 6ft. reptile-like bunny.  Who tells him the world will end in one month.  That night a 2,000 lb. jet engine falls on his bed(which was empty do to The Bunny Frank leading him out his room and onto a public golf course).  Over the course of the next month he oberves the world around him and begins to question the universe's boundaries.  After the climax of the action where 3/4 of the films questions are answered Donnie has to make the descion of saving himself or mostly everyone else he knows.  I'm not going to give away the ending but Frank was right about the world ending in one month.Besides being an indie( which gives it atomatic respect from me) The movie has the best message of any movie ever made ( i would know since i've been through a great deal of them ).  There is no other movie that will leave you feeling like you have just been on such a journey, or that you will get more out of.	5.0	Best movie I've ever seen!!!	2003-08-26	4	3	1

Most people can't explain it, andto those people I say this: ""Your retards.""  Better not to getit and say it sucked than to claim it was so excellent, sogood, best movie ever, wow, and not be able to back it up onebit.  Others have said that the film is just another piece ofpsuedointellectualism for gothy kids.  Not so in my opinion.Gothy kids have been stealing art for awhile now, and they justfall right back into my previous comment: ""Your retards.""Now to actually explain the movie.  The film is a depiction oflife that resembles Kafka more closely than anything else.  NotKafka's level of talent, but the same vein of thought.  Donnieis a teenager that causes lots of trouble for his family,willingly or not.  He is saved from obliteration by a man in abunny suit, note: this is not real, this is the same kind ofrepresentation that Gregor went through in the Metamorphosis,and thus starts a chain reaction that will end the world.  ButDonnie is given an option to save the world (a metaphor for hisfamily and the girl he met recently, the most important partsof his life, therefore his world) by going back in time.  Dyingessentially, much as Gregor had to die once the family moved on without him.In short, the movie is about the strained relations that existbetween people, and how those relations can negatively impactothers, and how sometimes, it is better to leave, representedin the movie by the ultimate leavetaking, death."	4.0	Kafkaesque	2006-03-08	8	1	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ANJGZJL5GYS8F	"Greg Goodsell ""Kitsch Man"""	"Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a suburban teenager who has it all. Rich parents, a beautiful home, an exclusive private school where the students openly do cocaine in the halls, Drew Barrymore as an English professor and a $200 an hour analyst. In the movies, such a privileged, complacent milieu is bound to weather some unsettling moments, and Donnie soon meets up with a mysterious benefactor -- a six-foot tall man in a bunny costume with a skull face named ""Frank."" Frank comes to Donnie in a dream state, and saves him from a freak accident. Such a favor can't go unpaid, and soon ""Frank"" has Donnie running errands -- and the mystery deepens.Surrealistic and dream-like, ""Donnie Darko"" weaves in a lot of elements that intentionally don't all add up. Time travel, teen angst, apocalyptic visions, madness, budding sexuality and eye-popping special effects find their way into this tantalizing rabbit stew. Set in 1988, the soundtrack offers sing-along favorites such as Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" and ""Mad World"" along with hairstyles that will make many older audience members cringe in recognition. In addition, Patrick Swayze plays a motivational speaker who spouts mixture of Reagan conservatism and Nietzchean ruthlessness. Like most everybody else in the movie, he harbors a very, very dark secret.""Donnie Darko"" wears a lot pop culture references on its sleeve. Even the least astute will pick up on the references to ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Harvey"" this cursory summary mentions. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the sly nods to Swayze's ""Footloose"" and have a good chuckle over the very unlikely double feature of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead playing with Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" playing at a near-empty theater!""Darko"" is a visually compelling feast for the senses.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3H1MO8WH8M18R	Greg Rubin	I've seen Donnie Darko a handful of times and it is one of the most infuential, amazing, symbolic movies I've ever seen. There's no way to describe this movie or how awesomely well done it was. It's given me a bit different perspective on life, I actually even incorporated Frank the bunny into the tattoo I recently had done because of the impact it had on me and the symbolism I see from it in my life. The movie's all about time travel, and it's not about time travel. It's hard to say. It's about the way it has an effect on life depending on which way you view it but there's just no way of describing it in words. You have to see this movie I have the directors cut and regular version because they were both amazingly done in that the original is awesome and did some things better, but the directors cut adds some explaination that was really good, but the time travel part at the end with the grid and flashing lights didnt make much sense and kind of takes your focus off the purpose of the scene, so advantages and disadvantages in each. See either one or both. Doesnt matter. Excellent movie.	5.0	BOMBA** MOVIE	2009-09-06	2	1	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1MJS1YRKNMU04	Grrgoyl	"After reading all the reviews on this board, I rushed right out and rented ""Donnie"" and watched it with my girlfriend.  Strangely, when it was all over I was markedly undecided about it, but she, who prefers historical realism like ""Gangs of New York""-type films, loved it.  We both compared it throughout to ""Heathers"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" in its surrealistic portrayal of high school life.  I watched it again with the first commentary track with the director and Jake Gyllenhaal, and all was made clear.  A lot of our assumptions turned out to be incorrect (which is also true of some other reviews on this board) but I love movies that can be interpreted in different ways and require multiple viewings to see all the clues and story nuances.  After listening to the commentary, now I can't get the movie out of my head and I talk about it all the time.I agree with others that for a small budget, this film is shot beautifully.  The acting is superb, of course, with Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze (who all worked for pocket change, another testament to a great script), and especially newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal. The music is great too, adding great power to some scenes similar to the soundtrack in ""Rushmore"".  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, for such a small budget.  There are a huge number of (mostly forgettable with a few exceptions) deleted scenes, but the funniest bonus is the ""Cunning Visions"" infomercial with commentary.I would absolutely recommend this, but only if you can listen to the commentary to appreciate fully what is going on."	5.0	Brilliant.....but make sure you listen to commentary	2003-03-19	2	1	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AGQX54X8D0IZG	"Guillermo Valverde ""Emo"""	"Before starting I want to get it clear that Donnie darko is a brilliant movie, one of my top 10 favourite. My low rating isn't due to the movie itself, but to the director's cut.I saw the movie's theatrical version a year ago or so. I loved it, all of it. The acting is great, the story is fantastic, the script is clever and brilliant and the movie gets you to think, not only about it's own meaning, but about everything else.It's a movie that leaves its print on you.I couldnt wait to see the director's cut, most Director's cut's I had seen before where much better than the theatrical versions (like the butterfly effect for instance?. But with Donnie, I was terribly dissapointed. Many unnecesary changes had been made in the movie (like changing the music in the ""burn to the ground"" part, which was beautifull in the theatrical version), some strange scenes had been added which didnt suit the movie. Those extracts from ""the philosophy of time travel don't fit in the movie at all,  the opening eye they had introduced between scenes is just odd... In my opinion the theatrical version is much better, and I think that with the succes the director  must either have done this to sell more or he has just got carried away with his idea and not done it properly.The worst thing in the DVD, however, is not the  movie itself, but the extras, they are the worse extra features I have seen in a DVD ever. The ""documentary"" where they show you the filming of some scene and  show you the guys looking for the right places to film is boring and badly done, the one about the Donnie Darko fans is quite useless too, it doesnt bring anything, but its better than the others. The ""darkomentary"" about the number one fan is just too much for me to handle, the guy is a complete moron, and he shows it all the way through the ""darkomentary"". I can't understand why Richard kelly got that number one fan thing going on, but he must have chosen the worst one he got. Its not even funny, its just sad.If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't buy the director's cut, if you have seen it the do it to your own risk, I am sorry I did, but its still interesting to see it.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A121X1GOQV01DW	Gwac	This is one of those few cases when I think the vast majority of reviews thus far are mistaken. I don't think this movie is nearly as good as these &quot;ravers&quot; say it is.For starters, when you're watching a movie and you're continuously aware that your listening to a script, something's not right. The dialogue is mediocre at best, unfortunately preventing any characters from establish themselves as believable. Also, this &quot;political commentary&quot; that supposedly makes this an intelligent film consists only of fleeting references to 80's politics and culture. These additions do not culminate in a deep, philosophical statement, as one expects of films which utilize this element, and they certainly don't add to the plot.Fortunately this movie is not entirely a lost cause. Several things make it just slightly more than bearable. First, the soundtrack is interesting. I like most of the 80's tunes throughout the film, and the ambient dronings contribute to the varying, though predominantly dark, atmosphere of the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal makes Donnie one of the few (almost) believable characters in the movie. Its a shame he didn't have a better script to further develop his character. Also, the concept of the plot is actually quite good. I can see how one could develop a very good story around it. Lastly, the scant attempts at humor are generally successful, and make the film roll by a bit faster.Unfortunately, the movie's shortcomings ultimately lead to its failure as a legitimate competitor among other recent releases. The ideas are too scattered and unorganized, the script is terrible, and the characters are cartoonish. It's obvious this is a debut film. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing Donnie Darko for its thought-provoking plot ideas and entertainment value.	3.0	doesn't live up to the hype	2003-04-13	69	22	47

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1K5KYE4MNQXG	Halo Jones	I won't bore you with a synopsis, but will just say that this movie reminds me of The Wizard of Oz with a meds-ridden- Holden Caulfield replacing Dorothy.It's a great modern fairy tale/fable and it's obvious that a lot of love and heart went into the creation of the this story. Sure, there's interesting ideas and theories(albeit it confusing and little rushed) being thrown out in this movie that can allows you hours to speculate about the film's conclusion and multiple meanings. But the commentary on the human condition is what attracted me the most. In one therapy session, the psychiatrist mentions to Donnie that if the sky did open up one day and the world ended, all that would be left would be Donnie's memories, the choices he made, and the people he had touched. That line really sets you up to understand the ending(perhaps emotionally if not logically), and the haunting version of Tears For Fears &quot;Mad World&quot; just really emphasized that point. The sequence where that song is playing is just cinematically beautiful. Kelly is a natural storyteller and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.ps(the whole smurf discussion is worth the video rental price alone!).	5.0	Suprisingly thoughtful w/alot of heart	2002-10-05	0	0	0

Excellent setting the movie in 1988 it gives the film a completely different feel. Jake Gyllenhaal is also great as Donnie Darko and the character kind of reminded me of Haulden Caulfield in the catcher in the rye, the kind of kid that you'd want to sit down with and talk to for ages.  The entire cast is actually very good, I loved the whole family and Beth Grant is perfect as the intolerable gym teacher: Kitty farmer, Patrick Swayze is also a very funny choice giving the movie an even better 80'feel.  All in all it is just a very gripping, mysterious movie and the fact that it was filmed in only 28 days, the duration of the story it self is amazing. The words from one of the last songs in the movie stuck in my head and are still there: I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the dreams in which I am dying are the best I have ever had.

He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.  His first piece of advice proved dead on, to leave his home in the middle of the night, which prevents Donnie from of all things, being smooshed by a giant jet engine which falls mysteriously to earth and crashes into his bedroom.  Now the troubled Donnie must cope with his secret and very scary friend taking him on eerie and fateful sleepwalking adventures, his troubles with his family and school, and dealing with growing feelings for a girl with her own set of problems, Gretchen, (jena malone) whose Mom is in the witness protection program. The film is imaginative, intelligent, well acted, challenging and thoroughly original.  Gyllenhaal underplays Donnie's mental problems which makes it all the more unnerving and hypnotic to watch.  I can't believe I missed it in the theater, word of mouth now that it's out on DVD and Video is this film's best friend, I cannot recommend it enough!	5.0	How did I miss this in the theater?

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1NSNX6KELFE4H	Hermione	I'm in love with this movie.  With a six foot bunny predicting the end of the world, a bad girl teacher (Drew Barrymore), teen angst that isn't annoying, a 100 year old deep thinking neighbor woman...and a time traveling jet engine that crashes into our protagonist's bedroom, you won't mistake this movie for some other one you've seen before.  It's wonderfully dark and manages to be a coming of age story with intense psychodrama, but with bits of satire and irony that made it that much richer.  Insightful and creepy turns out to be a surprisingly compatible combination.  I'm a sucker for skillful cinematography (that supports but doesn't upstage the story) and a powerful (but not overpowering) music score.  This film made great use of both, which made the overall effect extra gripping.  I saw the original movie, but the director's cut gave me lots of new perspectives that make the movie that much more meaningful to me.  It's too bad that this film didn't do well at the box office: a lot of people missed out on a gem.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

But if you are a fan of film you will enjoy it. My advice if you have not seen the film is to see it. My review can not do it justice and it is hard to describle.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A457S8SW690NM	hi	I had not actually really heard about this movie and knew just a little about the plot, but I still decided to buy it. And, wow, that was a good choice. This is the most original movie EVER!! It has lots of dark humor (absolutely hilarious moments), drama, science-fiction, and horror. So, it basically just mixes every genre possible in a blender to make a highly orignal and awesome movie that will make you think a lot.The movie also has great acting, notably by Jake Gylenhaal as Donnie and his dad was great also. Jena Malone also does a great job as Donnie's cute and sweet girlfriend. The movie also has stars Patrick Swayze (he was hilarious and great) and Drew Barrymore. The movie is about Donnie Darko, a troubled youngster who goes to a psychiatrist. He is visited by his imaginary rabbit reptilian, human sized friend called Frank. He talks to him, telling him to do things and about what will happen in the future. One very strange but amazing moment comes when the engine of a plane lands in Donnie's room. Donnie is bothered by some bullies at school and is very open to tell everyone what's on his mind (his teacher and a public speaker). But, Frank tells him to do bad things, which I won't give away but the greatest mystery is when Frank tells Donnie when the world is going to end. The voice of Frank is powerful and absolutely brilliant, but the actor that carries the movie is Jake Gylenhaal. His emotions, expressions, movemets, and powerful sentences are brilliant. Everything in this movie is brilliant and the ending still has me confused and shocked. That's why this is like Memento a movie that you need to rewatch. This movie is so original that you just have to be amazed and absolutely love it. This one will make you think and think over and over. And lastly, another compelling aspect of this movie is the awesome 80s pop music. It's fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. Believe me, this one's awesome and a must see.	5.0	The most original movie I have ever seen	2005-06-26	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1Z1YA3C8NWC36	"Hildegard Friday ""information junkie"""	"I am buying this on half.com, but I think I might just call in sick for Thanksgiving tomorrow, rent it, and stay home and watch it again. I can't wait 5 days for it to come in the mail!!I am a bit frightened by how much I loved this film. I don't rent movies very frequently, and heard about this movie on a listserv. I vaguely remember when it came out, but it seems like there was other stuff going on around that time ...Set in 1988, an obvious adoration for Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" is apparent throughout Donnie Darko, from the eerily similar skin-crawling mood to the obvious hat-tip when Donnie takes his girlfriend to see ""Evil Dead"" at the movies.Donnie is forced to endure one ordeal after another by Frank, a demonic man-sized rabbit that torments him and controls his life. Frank saves Donnie's life early in the film by appearing to him in a vision, leading him out of his house, and warning him of the end of the world, which will happen in approximately 6 days. Shortly thereafter, Frank compels Donnie to commit a series of destructive crimes, including vandalism and arson. The repurcussions of these evil acts eventually completely destroy Donnie's sanity.I have read others say they were confused by the ending, but I think the ending makes perfect sense. Sometimes there are worse fates than death.The deleted scenes of ""Watership Down"" add a literary level to the movie, but the movie does just as well without them.Those interested in time travel, theoretical physics, the space-time continuum, horror movies, schizophrenia and related psychological conditions, updates on themes from classic movies, love stories with unhappy endings, apocalyptic visions, 80s music, and twisted black humor will LOVE this movie."	5.0	I have to see this again tomorrow	2002-11-28	1	0	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1KLNYFROE90OV	Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...	"I saw this movie about a year ago because I thought it was going to be a comeback vehicle for Patrick Swayze who is my all time best actor. I celebrate the entire Patrick Swayze collection, my favorites including his portrayal of the post-apocolyptic warrior ""Nomad"" in Steel Dawn, his masterful footwork in ""Dirty Dancing"" and as a ghost in ""Ghost"".As of late though, Patrick has been a little bit out of the mainstream, so I figured that Donnie Darko would be his equivolant of Travolta's comeback in Pulp Fiction. Boy was I wrong.First things first, when I rent a movie that I hear involves Mr. Swayze, I automatically assume that he will be featured in the lead role. Patrick is a major player that shouldn't be pushed to such a small part in favor of the kid from Spiderman. Where as this kid just mumbled and drooped his way through the Donnie Darko part, Patrick Swayze would have provided much more life and charisma which was sorely lacking.Now on to my second (and biggest) bone to pick with the movie. The role that Patrick was cast in seemed promising at first. That is until.....well, let's just say that I'm disgusted with the film industry for the vile direction they made his character go towards. I still haven't decided wether or not I'm mad at Swayze though, since I'm quite positive that had he known what was in store for his character he never would have signed up in the first place. He, like I probably just assumed that he would be playing Darko and that Spiderman would just be in the rabbit costume or whatever. Unfortunately, due to reasons still unclear, Patrick's career has not been revitalized, but instead sabotaged, possibly on purpose.Anyways, on to the rest of the movie, summed up as Howard sees it (that's me). Basically the main character is a kid that is crazy and I guess he kind of repeats parts of his life or whatever. And there's a guy in a rabbit uniform after him (not like a sports mascot, much more creepy). I guess from what I gather it's kind of like the movie ""Groundhog's Day"" but without Chevy Chase. Oh yeah, and Drew Barymore is in it for like a minute, apparently trying to kill her momentum built up by actual good movies like Charly's Angels. I swear that she was probably only in it to pay off a drug debt or something.Now as a Patrick Swayze lover, (no gay jokes please, I know what some of you are thinking and you need to grow up), to say that Donnie Darko is a dissappointment is an understatement. In retrospect I think the best part of the whole movie is when we get to see the wall-sized handpainted mural of Patrick Swayze. If such a thing exists outside of the movie world, I would do ANYTHING to obtain it. I have been searching for a way to get my hands the actual presentation featured in the movie to no avail. When I went on vacation to Universal Studios in Florida I even asked some of the workers but they said they didn't know. I have also written dozens of letters to various art galleries, film studios, video camera manufacturers, and even Patrick himself.In conclusion, I am looking forward to buying this Director's cut of the movie just to see if they have fixed any of the problems with Swayze's character, and hopefully beefed up his part. Also the movie could use more action to make it better. That usually works. One way or the other I will at least have a reference of the enormous Patrick Swayze painting, so if worse comes to worst I can at least commission a local artist to recreate it, or even try to paint it myself if I have to. Please e-mail me if you know the wherabouts of this piece. I wonder if it is hanging in Mr. Swayze's estate, which I guess would make me pretty happy.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1L1QKRUGIADG7	"H. Sanchez ""heavyhitter12"""	My brother recomended this film to me. At first I was trying to hate it just to piss him off. About five minutes into the film it got interesting. This film is one of a kind, it is kind of a romantic, horror, Drama, Sci-fi and comedy film altogether. The best part is the ending, everyone will have a different understanding of it. The movie is kind of slow and confusing until the last fifteen minutes where everything starts to make sense and then the movies gets really interesting.  After it is done you are left in shock trying understand what happened , was Donnie crazy?, was he giving a second chance by god to change fate? Was it the end of the world or the end of HIS world?I dont Know. All I know is that this movie is coming out in an extended version and i'm going to make sure I get it the first day.	5.0	Best movie I have ever seen	2004-09-02	4	3	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3VR6IK7XPJUQR	huge idiot	This movie is a psychological thriller, a mind-bending science- fiction work, and a piece of social satire all rolled into one.  Although I would not consider it a horror movie, it can be a tad creepy at times.  When it's not being creepy, it is quite often hilarious.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a smart movie that deals with a number of different issues (sometimes at the same time) and delves into a number of different movie genres.  I do not recommend this movie to someone who lacks the patience to watch movies more than once.The acting in the movie is generally pretty good.  The big names (Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle) will attract many of the movie's viewers, but after watching the movie, few will doubt that it's the teens of the cast that really make it special.	5.0	not for the lazy viewer	2004-06-01	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3K09PPTQ87KQ0	I am Jack's Name	"Donnie Darko was one of my favorite films of all time... Until I saw the director's cut.  To make this short, the DC took out ALL the good music and replaced it with other stuff which didn't even fit the scenes.  Secondly, they added the ""scene titles"" which literally try to explain what's going on so you don't have to use your brain.  In short, the DC killed everything that was unique and interesting about the film and made it into a film for the masses (just to make more money).  If you really enjoyed Donnie Darko, don't watch this horrible version of it... go buy the original.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AVDMPXIPTLCWW	Ianbrown	I was told by many of my freinds that the director's cut of this film is very dissapointing because of the change in the soundtrack. For the first 45 minutes I too was bothered by the apparent lack of musical background which provides alot of light to the film. With the sparser soundtrack the film seems more eerie, more like an art house thriller and less like a sci-fi teen drama/comedy. This really changes the nature of the movie, as does some of the added content.However, as the film progressed I felt the weight of all the eerie quiet and more drawn out scenes where starting to build alot of inertia. The details in the plot, as well as the more rich universe the director creates build on each other to make a very deep and heavy film. And of course, much more is explained than in the theatrical cut, so it is a little easier to comprehend the film even if it ends up being even more complex.Here too, the added information, especially from the Philosophy of Time Travel also change the film dramatically. What had before appeared to be a story of Donnie on a sanity challenging mission of his own actually becomes the story of the web of characters and events pushing him and leading him on his path. Things that I once took at face value as simply interesting plot twists seem to be the hand of God manipulating people's behavior to create the path for Donnie's time portal. You begin to question who the characters really are and what is the REAL purpose of their actions. I even began wondering about Gretchen and her role in the story. Before her relationship with Donnie appeared to a simple love story, but now it becomes deeper and more mystifying.Also the director's cut explains Donnie's transformation from nihilism and hedonism into altruism and belief in God. This is the thread traces from Donnie's sexual digression in hypnotherapy, to the scene where Donnie and his freinds discuss the sexual habbits of smurfs and finally the classroom scene with the rabbits. Gretchen and Ms. Pommeroy's comments about the meaning of the rabbits seem to be the crucial turning point in Donnie's understanding of the nature of the events surrounding him. The scene in paricular seemed random at first, but after I returned to it became very important.I was not dissapointed by this version of the film. I think the original is more entertaining and palatable, and it brings the films elements together in a much more emotional and cohesive way. This version does soften some of the overly simplistic pop elements of the original, but it loses some of the warmth. However, having seen this version the original gains alot more meaning and depth that would have been difficult to spot. The director's cut almost seems to be like supplementary viewing, or even an appendix to the original film. I enjoy both, but now that I understand the richness of the plot I would probobly rather watch the original. Despite that I think the director's cut is essential to fully appreciate this movie.	4.0	Very Different Film	2007-02-08	12	9	3

Now, after about 4 other times of watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. As has been said before on hundreds of reviews Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, I cannot imagine anyone playing Donnie any better than him. This movie has great dialogue, very realistic in how awkward some of the conversations are, and hilarious at times, while just weird at other times. It makes me mad at the reviews who get on here just to bash it, and say stuff about how it will be for kids who wear black clothes and get their parents to drive them to the hot topic, yeah well if that's true than how come the biggest audience this has is probably college students?

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1YRV8ICHSL41F	"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com"""	"Darko is a movie that will speak to an entire generation of youth and survive the test of time. We say this with a certainty because of the elements where it succeeds. It has a horror element but it is not horrible in the sense of visual or mental disgust but instead a quiet fear--that same fear that Aristotle says is so important to theater because the audience must feel as if it could happen to them just as easily as the characters. It has an element of science-fiction but its plot (despite a charming continual reference to Deus ex Machina) is not reliant upon some kind of techno-babble postulation or solution. It has a lifelike ensemble of characters--of truly gifted actors giving fine performances--but none of the characters are overtly mean-spirited or caricatures of real people but rather a set of people earnestly attempting to do what they feel is right. There is even a striking moment at the end of  a film where a criminal is shown weeping at his own sense of guilt and hatred towards himself. Finally, it is a film that speaks directly and unflinchingly at the confusion of teenagers but still gives them a sense of something to believe in and the necessity for personal achievement.WHO SHOULD WATCH:Current teenagers and adults who remember their teenage years probably all the way back to 1980 will find watching this film to be a moving experience. Kelly is deadly accurate in his many portrayals and the relevance to youth in this decade is still sharp. Aside from the coming-of-age elements of this movie, it shares some of the most similarities with some striking films involving romance and the chronic pathos of life. For example, the movie Happy Accidents starring Vincent D'Onofrio has thrilled many a romantic audience despite its speculative elements and those people would probably find a great deal of merit here and vice-versa. Also, more mainstream movies--decidedly ""unspeculative""--such as Magnolia and Quiz Show also have audiences who would appreciate Darko and vice-versa. These are all movies that speak to life in the most important ways and we should not ignore them.WHO SHOULD AVOID:Obviously, there's no cathartic rush of violence here. Movie-goers may be misled by the cover and title in to thinking it's some kind of R-rated Alice in Wonderland type romp which it most assuredly is not. For films of this excess--but still done well--look to Predator or perhaps A Clockwork Orange or other similar venues. Also, this is a confusing movie that leaves its audience with a heavy sense of ambiguity. This can be highly irritating to the movie-goer who wants to understand what is happening and yearns for a sense of closure. Indeed, this ambiguity disturbed Roger Ebert quite badly in his initial review.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"	5.0	One of the very best films	2005-03-29	4	2	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AZRRBQS1O9QGP	Inez Rosa	The movie's images have long stayed in my mind ever since viewing it over a week ago and I can feel as if it happened in real time. The whole movie was a non-stop ride wishing it to never end, the movements the words, the music everything was beautifully pieced together to create a beautiful film. Jake Gyllenhal is incredible as Donnie, it makes one believe as if his character is so real, as if he actually existed in our world and so watching it to the very end it really made me feel this love for him that I didn't want him to go as he did towards the end...you need to see this film to better get an idea as to why I am saying this. Even after the movie was over it made me question my own existence and where in time and space I stand in, much less this movie can lead everyone who sees it to question the whole point of destiny and existence in the universe we live in. I don't want to go and talk much about how I feel about this movie because its over the five star rating and I have to give it 10 stars, for the quality and the originality this movie has done that it deservers the justice of two great movies. The movie has so many wonderful moments that its hard to pick just one, but if I had to its got to be the last frame of Donnie and his facial expression that god if you really pay attention throughout the movie you finally put the last piece of the puzzle together and you understand that moment and why its the connector of the film from start to finish. I admit I see that scene and feel that there could be a final justice to this life on earth and maybe there could be something greater in the end. The 80s music is beyond any affection its like an addiction that you want to long for that simple time where music was so fun and original. Every frame of the movie is a masterpiece, a dark masterpiece, I recommend this movie be viewed by every physics class either high school or university it does not matter, this movie is beyond anything ever imaginable.	5.0	A DARK MASTERPIECE!	2003-03-07	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AOIPPEZ66R2UP	"Into ""voidness"""	It just so happened that this is the first movie I saw after surviving the bloated, pretentious, and interminable, Magnolia; and, by comparison, Donnie Darko was like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. In addition to the palpably dark and eerie atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, it is one of the more accurate depictions of &quot;teen angst&quot; ever committed to film; and, as a period piece, it also manages to be a very effective depiction of life in those crazy 1980's. This film is a great example of how the budget of a film can often be inversely proportionate to its quality, especially in &quot;Hollywood:&quot; it is better than most films with 30 times its budget. The special features on the DVD are very worthwhile (for once) as well. If you enjoy the movie, I recommend that you take the time to watch the extended and deleted scenes: there are a few, that you might even feel, could've been left in; although you may just admire Richard Kelly's efforts to keep the finished film at around two hours, as the editing never allowed this movie to &quot;drag&quot; (perhaps he felt, as do I, that beyond the two hour mark most films seem to collapse under their own weight). A second viewing of the movie with the audio commentary by Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Kelly is also very worthwhile. Although the director considers this a sci-fi movie, it comes across as more of a supernatural/psychological thriller, and an intelligent one to boot. Also, as many people have commented, the casting and performances are inspired. The darkly ambient soundtrack is brilliant, as well (even without the pop songs that were too expensive to license for the OST album), and the creepy cover of Tears for Fears' Mad World is just amazing in the context of the film. Also, I'm not much of a Drew Barrymore fan, but praise should go to her for championing this project as an executive producer, and for providing an interesting portrayal of a progressive and idealistic young teacher trying to bring some enlightenment to a conservative private school.I haven't seen a movie that was such a &quot;complete package&quot; (great script, directing, casting, acting, editing, lighting, soundtrack, sets; effective-but-not-overblown special fx, etc.) in a LONG time. One final note: if you have heard about the &quot;demonic bunny thing&quot; prior to seeing this movie, and are put off by it--as, initially, was I--you needn't worry: far from coming off as silly, the &quot;bunny&quot; just adds another dimension of creepiness to this movie.	5.0	Restored my faith in American film.	2004-07-06	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q8XID3R1CZ3Q	IVAN JIMENEZ CORREAL	I know there may be lots of interpretations about this film, but to me there is a huge depth hidden beneath the surface, like an iceberg, that finally strikes your mind. So don't make the mistake of trying to get a trivial meaning from a simple glance, neither a conventional meaning. This film can be called everything except conventional or trivial.One has to watch the film to the very end to understand its sense, to face as well that the end is completely open to interpretation, which is a curious paradox. However, every moment, every fact, every character, turns out to have a purpose. You even understand why Grandma Death is always expecting the mail and why she whispers that awful truth to Donnie.I agree with some people who said that the film gets too over-analysed. I don't think that a too rational comprehension is needed at all, but an intuitive comprehension. Otherwise, you can get lost in a labyrinth of interpretations.The search for God, the meaning of life, the meaning of freedom as the ability to choose, the purpose of suffering, the difference between reality and fiction, the complexity and darkness of the mind, redemption by love (in the final act, when Donnie is about to complete the circle), the utter loneliness of human beings, the role of chance or fate in our lives and the inability to remove the veil of God's designs, which must ever remain mysterious and inscrutable, are some topics that I've extracted from the film.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is superb, so are the rest of the casting, perfect in their roles. Plus the music is excellent.In short, this is a true masterpiece that makes you think. It resists every attempt of labeling...and of banalization.	5.0	A philosophical masterpiece	2007-09-14	7	7	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1I60AO06W5BMB	Ivo Shandor	"I came very close to not buying this DVD, based on the bad reviews, but I am SO glad I did!  The negative comments from others led me to expect a horrible abomination from the theatrical cut, but it actually wasn't as bad as I feared.  Different, yes, but not bad.  Yes, the sound effects are different (for a reason), yes the song tracks are different (for a reason), yes, some of the visual effects are different (for a reason).  (The reasons are all fully explained in the commentary of this edition.)  What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a ""remix"" version of the film, not a ""replacement"" version.  He's not pulling a George Lucas and trying to usurp previous versions with this one instead; he was given the chance to make an additional version, so he did.What is awesome about this edition, however, is not the changes from the theatrical version, but Kelly's commentary track with Kevin Smith, because it finally makes everything so perfectly clear!  When I first saw the original film on the theatrical DVD release, I kind of understood it, but not completely.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and the extras (the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts) on the original DVD and I got a much better understanding of the film.With the director's cut, the deleted scenes and the POTT excerpts have now been added into the film, so if you've never seen the theatrical release you might find this one easier to understand.  Completists should be aware that some of the deleted scenes that have been restored to this version are NOT available in the deleted scenes on the theatrical release DVD - they are making their first appearance here.But it's when you listen to the director's cut commentary that we finally get the full explanation of what Kelly meant to convey.  I won't spoil anything here, but even if you think you sort-of understand what the ""manipulated living"" and the ""manipulated dead"" and the ""receiver,"" etc all mean (from the POTT excerpts), it's never really made completely clear until this commentary with Kevin Smith -- even Kevin Smith admits there are things he didn't understand until this meeting with Kelly, like what the other characters were (subconsciously) doing throughout the story to influence Donnie.  And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.Now, this might mean that Kelly is just really bad at getting his point across on a dramatic, script level - otherwise why would it have taken this many tries to get the true plot structure clear to the audience?  Unless he meant this film to be the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for its generation: deliberate vagueness to leave it open for individual interpretation.And for those wanting to know why Kevin Smith was chosen to assist in the commentary, it's because Kelly was attempting to make the movie more like a comic-book film (despite his own admission of not being knowledgeable about comic books) and asked Kevin Smith along to talk about whether or not he succeeded.Bottom line, which version do I prefer?  Well, the theatrical version, but mostly because I prefer its song selections to the director's cut song selections (song choices and song placements, which both changed).  But to truly understand this film, you need to be familiar with the deleted scenes, the extras, AND the director's cut commentary - all of which are in this edition."	5.0	Buy This for the Director's Commentary!	2012-07-15	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ORPBLS490W63	Jack	First, I must adress some of the not so great reviews here.  It's obvious they didn't get the film, at all.  In fact they were  so wound up in trying to figure it out and trying to compare it to Harvey of all things that they could not have missed the point more.  If you are not used to weird films, mind-benders, or original films in general, be warned.  Maybe warm yourself up on Memento or Fight Club, then try it out. Or if you think this is crazy, try Mulholland Drive, hehe.It is a smart movie, and just when you think you know what's going on, you don't (a common thing in films these days that just happens to work really well with the story). Acting is right on the nail, Jake Gyllenhall is incredible as usual and Drew is fine. Directing is great, and very unique.  I especially liked how the film itself didn't look as polished, giving it so much more depth and texture, it was a very nice effect.  The music is errie, and sets the atmosphere perfect.  There are so many plot twists, sub-plots, and characters going on in this film, that it makes a perfect DVD, because you really will want to watch it again and again just to try and make sense of it all. The story is great, it oozes 80s and captures that time.  There's so many genres floating around in it too.  It can be laugh out loud funny at times, creepy, dramatic, horror, sci-fi, and even romance. If you get anything out of this review, let it be this: It's not Magnolia, its not Harvey, it's not Final Destination, it's Donnie Darko, and it's fantastic.For those that have seen it, ask yourself these two questions, and really think about it, you might just appreciate the film even more:-Why would Frank want Donnie to burn down that house in particular?-What is the connection between Grandma Death and the english teacher?Feel free to email me if you know, want to debate it, or really want the answers (although I'm not completely sure ethier).	5.0	Most underated film of 2001	2002-05-13	5	4	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2X3025TZFOQ1O	"Jacob A. ""braintoad"""	"One of the coolest films ever made, DOnnie Darko is different fro manything else I've seen. The story is confusing and comples  and requires repeat viewings a visit to the website and the commentary track to understand. To some that may seem like overkill, ""shouldn't the movie explain itself?"". But personally I love the way it works out. You have to really explore and think about this film before you truly understand what has happeend by the time it ends. Visually the film is stunning. Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere. Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it. As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead. He shows little emotion when normal, however when he goes into his trances he gets this strange glazed look on his face. Great acting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore. The movie seems very real. The family acts lie kany normal family would. It doesn't feel forced or faked. The teenagers seem like ttenagers, they arent exaggerations of teenage stereotypes. The film is very reminiscent of the real world. Overall this is a very intellectual film. THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting. It would be very hard to find a catagory to fit Donnie darko. Many people will find it confusing and dull, many others will think that it tries to hard to be an intellectual film. However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick. Probobly not the best choice for the casual FilmGoer who is just in it for a good time. This movie has a very independent film feel to it, without getting too pretentuous or bogged down in drawn out dialogue. Darko is excellence in cinema."	4.0	What Dreams May come	2002-07-03	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1TWKXM0AZOH07	Jake Davidson	"The public is getting sick of hollywood. Times are changing, movie plots seem to repeat themselves more then those awful songs on the radio. Innovative directors (like Richard Kelly) are commitied to bringing art based movies to life. That is exactly what Donnie Darko penetrates...the risky chance of creating a new type of movie.In the DVD itself, the director points out that this film, while having a structure and definate ending, is certainly open for personal interpretation. Similar to a conceptual painting, viewing this movie takes an incredible amount of intimate focus. The plot is not served on a silver plate like most movies. One must concentrate, evaluate, love, trust, and solve the many mysteries of the characters and goals. Truely unique, you slowly start to comprehend Donnie and his situation (i liked the comparisons to ""catcher in the rye""). The ambitious mix of genres is just a desperate way to try and define this conceptual drama. Those who rated it poorly did so because the film insulted their intelligence. And it will insult your intelligence, too.I gave this film 4 stars simply because while it is undeniably original, it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. There are many issues that needed to be cleaned up (continuity, some acting (jake however was amazing), cutting VERY IMPORTANT SCENES). I hope to see this new generation of film making in the future. It has given me faith that the enertainment industry of this disgustingly capitalistic society still might have a chance. Maybe my generation will actually be encouraged to think. As a senior in highschool i will hope to show this film to as many friends as possible. You should do the same..."	4.0	The New Era of Genres	2003-07-30	5	4	1

I wasn't able to watch all the extra features or listen to the commentary, so after watching the movie a few times, I had an idea of what it was about, but i still felt unsatisfied. Watching the DC, with the added ""pages"" of the book placed on the screen, I feel that more questions have been answered, although any answer is left up to each persons interpretation. I would say that if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, rent or buy the DC, then if you loved the movie, go and buy or rent the original (which i am going to do) and compare the two movies, and see which one makes more sense in the end.In conclusion, a must have film, either way.""Oh, they have the internet on computers now."""	4.0	Review for people who have never seen the movie	2005-04-08	6	3	3

It is simply brilliant Science Fiction.  Don't get me wrong, though... it's not boring like many science fiction movies.It is hard to describe the plot without making the movie sound moronic or giving away too much, so I will not try.

Is Donnie Darko a seer who can see the future through time travel, through a worm hole shooting out his chest? Or is it something else?Donnie Darko is filled with Lynch like puzzles, ambiguity, surrealistic realities. Good acting abounds from a great cast, filled with dark humor, smart dialog, & the end is something you'll be contemplating for hours after watching this film. Which is the main reason this film has replay value, but is a tad overrated by it's cult following, though one of the better films influenced by David Lynch. It does lack the visceral images of violence, sex, & general complex ambiguities of the best surrealistic Lynch, like ""Mulholland Drive, ""Lost Highway,"" & ""Twin Peaks,"" or the memorable characters & dialog from Lynch's, ""Wild at Heart,"" but never the less, a very good film in the head games department.3 1/2 stars = Very Good"	3.0	"This is Not ""Harvey"""	2011-09-03	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A24D0DENA8N7GH	James Sadler	"Sorry about the awful sentence structure in the review title. Just ask any copywriter (okay, I happen to be one), headlines are murder.And about that rabbit reference, anyone who's seen or even heard of ""Darko"" knows that there's a rather odd-looking, man size rabbit-like character named ""Frank"" appearing in this film. While he's definitely no Bugs Bunny, he does set some looney toons type moments in motion.Example? At Frank's behest, Donnie floods his school and buries an axe in the head on the school mascot statute. It's funny too see at first, but after a moment you also realize it's pretty creepy.But despite Donnie's tendency to turn a little destructive when Frank talks to him, this movie isn't about a tennager going off the deep end and turning into an axe murderer.In fact, it's hard to generalize as to what this film is about. It's about being a teenager in the eighties. It's about relationships. It's about time travel. Trust me, it all makes sense in the film.It certainly doesn't tie everything up in a neat package at the end. But that doesn't mean the ending isn't one of those that leaves you hanging. It does come to a definitve conclusion, one that actually pretty much brings you back to it's starting point.Okay, you just have to see it to appreciate it. It's a film that makes you think about what you just saw and what the meaning of it all was. In fact, a small cottage industry has grown based on ferreting out the meaning of,  and events in, ""Donnie Darko.""The acting is great throughout. The storyline provacative.After viewing it for the first time, you'll probably do as I did and start combing the Internet for the book ""The Philosophy of Time."" Oh, a bit of a warning if you do start googling ""Donnie Darko,"" the original site, [...], has been hijacked by some Internet squatter. Don't click on any of the links there and reward this guy for hijacking a url.But do visit some of the other sites you find.

Its not till the movie ends that you realize just how wonderful this movie is.The story is about a delusional teen Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) who sees a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie is saved for some reason by Frank and is forced to do his bidding. Donnie goes through the film affecting charectars one way or another which all ties together in the end. The ending is one of the best film endings ever and is well worth whatching over and over.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular preformance he keeps his charectar restrained and makes you believe this guy is insane.

As others have said, it's hard to classify: funny, confusing, disturbing, odd, and imaginative all rolled into one. But nicely done, keeping your interest and making you wonder where things are going and what will happen next. Jake Gyllenhaal is cute and pensive; he could be mistaken as a brother to Toby Maguire. Watch the DVD extras; the deleted scene commentaries shed some light on a few things.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AUKLLB4J4YHNA	Jason!	"Watching this version made me realize what made the orignal so good: the subtelty, the things left to the imagination.However, I find it hard to really compare it to the original. I think its best to look at these two versions as seperate movies best for different audiences, the director's cut more suitable for mainstream American audiences and the original for people that like what mainstream Americans call ""weird"" movies.If you are a fan of the original movie, then you might think these are bad things...- like another reviewer points out, most of the subtelty is gone.  Things are brought up and made apparent in the director's cut.  The ambiguity made the film more powerful, for me.  This is why Hitchcock films were great.  This is why the chainsaw scene in Scarface was scary without actually seeing the action.  The viewer's mind is much more powerful than anything on the screen could ever be.  This might be a matter of opinion or one's taste though.- The addition of sound design is way to apparent.  Too much birds chirping, classroom noises, background chatter, etc.  This is especially bad in the first 40 minutes of the film.  It makes the film seem less real.  That stuff isn't supposed to take attention away from a film, and it does in this version.  This is probably the only really bad thing about the movie.- It would have been nice to have the choice of watching the original version OR the director's cut on the same disc.  That way people new to the film can see the differences. Nobody really wants to buy a movie twice.If you liked the original version, you will probably appreciate the things that are revealed in the director's cut as new insights.  The time travel stuff is explained a bit more.  Whether thats good or bad is arguable.  I think that is the main aspect that makes it seem like another movie.  In the original it was more mysterious so you just looked at it like something you can't know anyway so you focused more on how this phenomenom effected the characters, rather trying to understand the phenomenom itself.There is dialogue about Donnie being agnostic that I think was better left out.  Now there's going to be a million teenagers suddenly becoming agnostic because its cool.  In my opinion this isn't even really important to the story and seems like a distracting attempt to add depth to Donnie's state of mind.Overall I think the differences make the director's cut a different movie altogether. Its not a better movie or a worse movie, just a different take on the story.  Now you have a movie about time travel itself, parallel universes meeting, a teenager's contemplation about god and dealing with the average troubles of being a teenager.  In the original all these things were presented vaguely enough that you were left to consider the characters and their interaction with each other more than the actual stuff they are going through.If you already have the original, you might as well get the director's cut for the simple reason that you get a new way of looking at the story.If you have never seen either version, I highly suggest both though I prefer the original because its a bit darker and ""weirder"".  If you don't like ""weird"" movies, then check out the director's cut."	4.0	Almost a different movie	2005-02-20	5	4	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2EHDZG3RRWGDN	Jason Incraboplis	This film is undoubtedly one of my favourite films of all time. Having viewed this film countless times, I thought it necessary to make a comment given the negative opinions expressed by some people.What with the brilliant acting, witty and clever dialogue, intriguing plot and magnificant musical score it's hard to fathom how someone could dislike this film. At the heart of the film's brilliance is its open-ended plot. Unlike Memento and 12 Monkeys (and Mulholland Drive to a degree), the viewer is required to form his own conclusions as to the ultimate meaning the film imparts. It requires the viewer to think; it is indie at its absolute best.It is not a mainstream film in any sense of the word. And it is, as others have said, a film that you will either love or hate. If you generally like films that have a discernable plot and comprehensible conclusion it is likely that you will dislike this film.But with an open mind, multiple viewings and patience (of which some people obviously lack), you too shall fall in love with this film. It is, quite simply, brilliant.	5.0	Simply (no pun intended) brilliant!	2004-02-19	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ASD96926EJWI6	"Jason L. Brown ""Jason Lee"""	I absolutely love the symbolism used in this very original movie.

A large person, who represents an angel of God, dresses in a large bunny suit and informs Donny of when his world will end, though the movie portrays it to be the whole world.  Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker, draws a deranged belief that all things come from the emotions of fear and love, the basic principles of Christianity.

It makes you wonder, then laugh, then tense in fear, then cry, then put a satisfied smile on your face, only to repeat the process a few more times. It's psychological and philosophical enough to provoke deep thought, which is a lost art if you ask me.When I finished watching the movie the first time, my first thought was &quot;Watch it again!&quot; The movie gives you just enough to make you satisfied, but holds back just enough to make you think about it for days. One could get lost watching all the extras on the DVD and exploring the website, just to learn more.The movie is put together so convincingly that it makes you feel like you live with Donnie. You miss the main characters once the movie is over; they become your friends, unlike the artificial characters in most of today's movies and television shows.Five stars just won't say enough about this movie. Once you have fully enjoyed it, you feel the need to say &quot;Hey! Watch this movie!&quot; to everyone around you. So watch this movie, OK?	5.0	Dark, Darkest, Darko	2002-06-18	11	10	1

But she is nothing to the movie, so I'll forgive it.  If you want to see a movie that excels at psychological obscurity/clarity, rent or buy Jacob's ladder--and PAY ATTENTION!  That movie  will blow you away if you give it a chance.  Obviously, I know there are huge differences between the two films, but they're not apples and oranges.  Jacob's Ladder has affected many directors and writers, and you will see what I mean once you watch it--it is as underrated as Donnie is overrated.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1IX0NC997O0NS	J. Austin	"I was having dinner with some friends about 6 months ago and our conversation somehow became about time travel and parallel realities. Possibly because I mentioned at some point how much I love the TV show Fringe. Later that evening they asked if I had ever seen the movie Donnie Darko. I replied that I had never heard of it. They handed me the movie and told me to check it out, that it is probably something I would enjoy. Looking at the cover and jacket, I thought it was some kind of slasher flick and I wondered why they thought I would like it as they know I am very much against violence and cruelty towards any living thing. I graciously accepted it and when I got home I put it in a drawer. A few months later I came across the DVD and decided to watch it so that I could return it to them afterward. Imagine my surprise. What a brilliant thought provoking movie. Great acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a plot that makes you want to watch it again and again (which I did) to keep uncovering new things that you may have missed. I reluctantly took it back to them and told them how much I loved it and that I was going to buy myself a copy. They insisted I keep it saying they didn't care for it but they knew I would.I recently saw the original and enjoyed that as well. I think it compliments the directors cut nicely and I hope everyone will experience both versions. The original is a bit more mysterious as you don't have the clues from Roberta Sparrow's book and a few more defining scenes. Both will leave you with unanswered questions. And when you wake from a vivid dream ... could that mean ....?Only negative to the director's cut is that I wish they had left the Watership Down scene on the cutting room floor. And Rose Darko smoking at the end of both versions was a distraction as she doesn't smoke anywhere else in the movie (and I'm pretty anti-smoking anyway).Eddie Darko was way cool. What a great father.And the 'Mad World' ending, which I have watched over and over is so beautifully done, I get chills thinking about it. Especially Frank touching his right eye and Patrick Swayze grieving for all the evil he has done. Wow.Cellar Door has become one of my favorite sounding phrases.And as I see all the suffering in the world, I see the brilliance in Roberta Sparrow's line ""Every living creature on Earth dies alone.""Very highly recommended."	5.0	Director's Cut and the original are both brilliant	2011-01-21	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3EQKZU7U8CZY4	Jazz Jackrabbit	I rented Donnie Darko in August, of last year, and I was totally blown away. Finally a year later I was able to buy the DVD. This film is truly one of the most original films ever with an incredible story by the director/writer Richard Kelly. My rating is 5 stars and I truly mean that. Donnie Darko is a flawless film which is rare to find in movies.The DVD is good too with special features, that can explain the story more for those who were confused the first time they saw it, (I know I was) like The Philosophy Of Time Travel book and the audio commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3BYMKUJZL2XNY	"JB ""MeanCreek"""	I remember watching this movie when it first came out on the theaters in 2001 and I was very moved by it. Needless to say, there was no one in the room with me and very few people heard of Donnie Darko during that time. I moved to England in 2004 and the movie was a huge cult success. It obviously got there much later as most movies do, but it put the movie into the spotlight.Donnie, a mentally ill teenager starts to get visions of a giant bunny rabbit who warns him that the end of the world is coming soon. He suddenly is given a book that describes his experiences so he tries to change the future by changing the past. Good performances, great soundtrack, original and remarkable script make this movie one of the most representative of its decade.The director's cut is more slow paced and makes things easier to understand.Here you will find all the deleted scenes for the first Dvd release,some extra special effects,and a slightly altered soundtrack. The special features have this Donaldson character who is elected as The number one fan of the movie...He is quite creepy and funny at the same time, seeing him kissing Richard Kelly and freaking everyone he meets out is pretty amusing.This dvd is certainly worth buying.	4.0	"""They made me do it"""	2006-03-11	1	1	0

""There was no logical conclusion"",  ""I dont get it"" etc. are the usual ramblings by these false prophets. heh heh  No film combines social commentary and conflicting philosophies of life better than this movie.  Why would you expect there to be a neat and tidy resolution?  Has that resolution been made in the real world?  As for the references to other movies like ""Harvey"" or ""Evil Dead"", OF COURSE HES GOING TO USE ELEMENTS OF THOSE MOVIES.  Like any great artist, he recognized those who have come before him and knows that art builds upon itself.  Where would ""insert any horror director's name here"" be without Hitchcock?  This movie is actually just a reverse of Its a Wonderful Life meets Last Temptation of Christ.  Rent this DVD and you will realize you really never die alone."	5.0	BEST EVER	2002-12-01	1	0	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2G9ROL94663VM	J. Davis	"As most people do, I think this is a great movie.  I've seen it several times over the years, but decided to buy the blu ray version despite mostly bad reviews for the transfer.As far as why the movie itself is so great, it's unique, there's a lot to figure out, and many of the theoretical physics type of topics such as time travel are interesting to a lot of people anyway.The blu ray has both the theatrical release of the movie and the director's cut.  Each of them explain what's going on in different ways really.  The director's cut version explains a lot of things which the theatrical release leaves more open ended.  It explains by showing the pages from the time travel book on the screen between some of the scenes.  However, I personally like the ending of the theatrical version better.  A lot of ""helpful audio"" is present at the end of the theatrical version, but not there in the director's cut.As far as it being on blu ray, I disagree with those saying not to buy it.  Most places sell it for close to $10, including here on Amazon.  The transfer seems BARELY better than the DVD version to me.  However if you don't already own BOTH versions of this movie on dvd, why not spend $10 to get to have both on one disc and compare them back and forth?  Then I still believe it has SLIGHTLY better picture quality also.So if you own BOTH versions of the movie on dvd I guess skip it.  But otherwise it's easily worth the $10-$15.  The movie itself is one of my favorites of all time.The director's cut mostly just adds in deleted scenes already on the original dvd abd then overlays those time travel book pages, but it also has different music, added audio, removed audio, a little more in way of deleted scenes, etc...  It's different enough to be interesting to anyone who loves the movie.  The music is better in certain places in the theatrical release though, so I still rate the theatrical as the better version."	5.0	One Of The Best Movies	2010-02-15	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"One of my rules of thumb is that after running across three unrelated references to a film, book or TV show in the same week, it's time to see what all the fuss is about. Recently, several ""Donny Darko"" references drove me to pick up the film. And am I glad they did!""Donny Darko"" is dark, hypnotic and stimulating. A young man, living in an affluent home, is obviously mentally ill. For reasons that are not clear, he leaves his home at  night and wakes to find himself sleeping on backs roads and golf courses. His parents seem concerned, but attribute his odd, though harmless, behavior to his condition. But soon, Donny Darko is hearing voices, and seeing a frightening, adult-sized metal-faced rabbit called Frank who tells him that the world will end within the month.I'm not going to give up any more of the plot, except to say that it involves time travel, lost love and a chance at redemption.Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donny. His dark features, sleepy expression and stiff movements perfectly capture the off-kilter inner world of his character. Mary McDonnell does knock-out work as Donny's mother, Rose. She has an incredible ability to portray two or more emotions simultaneously. The scene at the end of the film, in which she waves ambiguously and perhaps knowingly to another character, has had me thinking for days. Did she know? The real star of the movie, though is the music. Brooding, solemn and creepy, it gives the movie a thick, turgid and menacing aspect that perfectly complements the theme and acting.I got a kick from the movie's social commentary. Though Donny seems mad, the world he inhabits is similarly irrational, often making crazy Donny the sanest one in the room. The film is set in a conservative Catholic school in 1988, more for reasons of mood than anti-religious ones. The health teacher worships a local self-help guru and forces the class to watch his amateurish self-help videos. Donny's dad has an irrational hatred of then-presidential contender Michael Dukakis. Donny's friends brag unconvincingly about their exploits and fantasies. Donny's madness seems driven as much by a reaction to the inanity and insanity of his straight-laced, ""normal"" classmates as by his brain chemistry.Which makes it all the more ironic that he finds himself at the nexus of a cosmic tangle.I'm not sure any linear narrative would do justice to the crazy plot of this film. There must be a logical disconnect somewhere. But for a terrifically well-crafted film that comes at you from everywhere and everywhen, ""Donny Darko"" is hard to beat. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time."	5.0	Classic tale of madness and time travel	2009-08-07	5	5	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AC99RKT3OW7CO	Jeff Crosley	"The first time I saw Donnie Darko, my jaw was hanging on the floor as the credits began to roll.  I was literally staring at my TV, dumbfounded at the spectacle I had just witnessed.  The only other movies I've seen that have produced a similar effect were ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Mulholland Drive.""  If you liked those two movies, you'll like ""Donnie Darko,"" especially if you found ""Requiem"" too depressing and ""Mulholland"" too jumbled.  Granted, it's a downer, and it's convoluted, but not as much as the other two, thus sort of being an in between of those two movies.  First time writer and director (and hopefully not last time) Richard Kelly has created an unclassifiable movie, that truly defies description.  However, since I want to be an informative reviewer, I'll do my best.""Donnie Darko"" is about many things.  On the grand scale, it's about choice, God, and inevitability.  On a smaller scale, it's about time paradoxes, disturbed minds, and coming of age (sort of).  I prefer to look at the movie on the former, but the well acted characters force me to treat the movie more personally, and involve the emotions as well as the intellect.As far as direct plot is concerned, I'll simply give the set up, because there's no one thing that the movie is ""about.""  Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is about 17 or 18, in high school in the 80's, and mentally disturbed.  He's a morbid person, but perceptive, and both smart and wise.  He is awakened one night by a voice that calls him away from his bed and outside.  There he meets Frank, who is a guy in a demonic rabbit costume.  I suppose you could look at the film as what would happen if David Lynch directed ""Harvey.""  Anyway, Frank informs Donnie that the world will end in 28 days (later, hehe), 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Donnie wakes up on a golf course.  Meanwhile, during the night, a jet engine (that's right, a jet engine) from a plane crashes through the roof of Donnie's room.  The tricky part is that the rest of the plane is nowhere to be found, and no flights were scheduled for such a flight path that day.  Donnie now feels indebted to Frank for calling him out of bed, and thus saving his life.  So begins the story.  I can't tell anymore, because a) it's just too complicated, and b) I don't want to spoil it.The writing is incredible.  Aside from the scattered main plot (which is drawn together beautifully), there are some excellent conversations and pieces of dialogue, my favorite being the discussion on the sexual habits of Smurfs.  It's scenes like that that keep the movie with a lighter side.  The backdrop of the 80's (1988, namely), which is very well done, provides an excellent setting, and provides an excellent soundtrack, which consists of original music and 80's tunes, with music by ""Tears for Fears"" being the standout.  The slow, mellancholly, cover of ""Mad World"" at the end is devastating, and fits the moment so perfectly it's almost as if the song were created specifically for this movie.The acting is top notch.  Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself a fantastic actor at last, after skirting with glory in other movies, like ""October Sky.""  This is the movie he needed to recover from ""Bubble Boy.""  The supporting cast does their job, even with admittedly trivial characters, like his english teacher (Drew Barrymore).  His girlfriend (I don't know the actress) is a perfect match for him, and their relationship is heartbreaking in its content and in its context.  In other words, the perfect match of sad people is that much more sad.  Patrick Swayze is delicious in his role as a popular, but obviously phony, motivational speaker and writer.  Mrs. Farmer (again, I forget the name, but she's the lady who fell under the bus in ""Speed"") is an excellent uptight teacher, and gets one of my favorite lines: ""Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion!""This paragraph will have a few spoilers, so read on to the conclusion if you haven't seen it yet.  The most recent time I viewed the movie (again), I picked up on the religious dimension of the film.  I noticed the placement of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" each time before, but this time I actually took note of Donnie's religious parallel.  I understood in the moment right before the credits roll when Gretchen and Mrs. Darko have the strange connection that insinuates that they somehow ""know"" each other.  I picked up on that a little bit the first few times as a connection transending space-time from the universe in which Donnie wasn't killed...Anyway, the last time I realized what the real connection was: without Donnie's sacrifice, they'd both be dead.  For Donnie so loved the world that he gave himself to save Gretchen, his mother, his sister, Frank, and all the others on the plane...  This movie is smart, emotionally powerful, and unbelievably original.  Go see it.  Now."	5.0	Cheers all around for a magnificent movie	2003-09-01	9	7	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1LQLQUJJZUBTC	Jeff  Farrow	"Preface: Apparently there are several versions of DONNIE DARKO floating around. I watched The Director's Cut, true--but it was a Net flix version all on a single DVD.I must have been well bolted down in my coffin when this movie was first released because it went completely under the radar. I had seen Jake Gyllenhaal in 2 later films & I thought he was a really good actor. So, I was finding out a little more about him & sort of stumbled on DONNIE DARKO. The film, of course, is fantastic (both literally & figuratively), but I can't help but wonder what it would have been like without JG in it. I felt the same way about AND THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD with the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfection itself in the leading role. And those eyes! As ambiguous & mystifying as the character he plays. KG could well be the equivalent of a Daniel Day-Lewis for his generation.If permitted, I would have given DONNIE DARKO 4 & 1/2 stars. In the end I witheld a star because I felt there were a few cliches in the film. The ""overweight"" girl & the gym instructor seemed a bit sterotypical. The girl's graceful dance could have been lifted from a TV TWILIGHT ZONE episode where the same idea of the plump woman who fantasies being a ballerina is featured in it too. The chief bully was a bit over the top as well--I mean, snorting coke by the student's lockers--give us a break!Then there's the scene where Donnie's therapist tells him that she has only been giving placebos. If not outright illegal, in the real world it would definitely be seen as the height of unprofessionalism...not to mention dangerous. I suppose it can be chalked up to another one of the ambiguous & ambivalent themes that run throughout the movie.Other than the above, I was very excited by DONNIE DARKO, primarily because it visualized aspects of the Parallel Universe theories that have popped up in the scientific explorations of quantum mechanics. One theory promotes that idea that every possibility of our physical reality plays out with every possibility of outcome on each level. There's a certain element of Nietzche's ""Eternal Recurrence"" in these rather mind-bending concepts as well.Any work of art (especially an American film) that generates the interest & cult-following (true, largely fostered by the ""official website"") has got to have something real going for it. I watched the movie twice in a row & twice the second day. To turn a phrase of Leonard Cohen (""Democracy is coming to the USA""), maybe appreciation for surrealism is finally coming to the USA."	4.0	Starring The Guy With The Bedroom Eyes	2011-06-23	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ATL84JW0KKIMJ	"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1"""	"Like many of the movies I truly love, this one might not be for everyone. It's challenging, original and does not spoon feed itself to you. While some reviewers have complained that Darko borrows elements from other movies, I don't think this movie is merely a sum of it's parts and I think it's ridiculous to accuse it of doing something that all fiction has been guilty of since hunters told stories around camp-fires. There are few stories, and it's the way they are told that make them stand out.While watching DD, I was constantly reminded of another movie I saw earlier this year...I find it difficult to believe that Ghost World was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay while Donnie Darko was completely snubbed in every category. I loved Donnie Darko for all the same reasons I hated Ghost World. While Ghost World seems to celebrate apathy and selfishness (to me anyway), Donnie Darko rages against it.What's most striking to me about Darko is that on the surface it's dark, twisted, disturbing and even a little depressing, but beneath the surface it really does celebrate life. I described it to one friend as ""12 Monkeys"" meets ""It's a Wonderful LIfe"" with an evil bunny rabbit. Ok, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but while most people will fail to see anything other than another dark, sci-fi, time travel movie, the open minded viewer will be deeply rewarded... Donnie eventually discovers the beauty and joy of life against inhuman odds. Life is finite, fleeting and precious, and Donnie represents those fortunate few who discover this in time to appreciate it even in complete defiance to the horrors he witnesses. It's easy to be positive when life is a bowl of cherries, but to delve into the darkness and emerge with hope takes real courage."	5.0	Overlooked and Underrated.	2002-03-25	0	0	0

I was also shocked to learn that it took 28 days to film this movie (The movies story spans over a period of 28 days 14hours). The budget was around 4 million also, very surprising considering drew barrymore, patrick swayze and Jake gyllenhaal star in it. It's better going into this movie not having heard anything. It really is an extrememly fresh appoach to an otherwise stale redundance that the movie industry is in right now. The DVD has lots of ""hidden eggs"".

Especially if you were in high school in the Totally Awesome '80s.I think the most stunning image is the face Frank shows Donnie Darko.  Obviously a rabbit, but it takes one fascinating imagination to create such a macabre face for a rabbit.  Blank eyes like boiled eggs, chipped teeth, ambigious threatening expression.  That director/screen-writer has a FIERCE imagination.This is truly a movie for repeated viewings, so the DVD is certainly a perfectly reasonable investment!  One must listen to the 2 commentaries to grapple with the odd doings in Donnie's life.  And the deleted scenes are lovely.  Drew Barrymore and Watership Down fans are bound to be delighted.  The commentary for the infomercial  (which is used by Patrick Swayze's sadly clueless self-help guru)  is daft and hilarious.Put this in your collection.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1G1PX4U6RSZEA	Jeremy P	Donnie Darko is a stunning movie, complimented by a dark/eerie sense of urgency to find out what the hell is going to happen.  The acting,directing,and setting was astonishing.  The movie was very consistent with no gaps inbetween, yet very unique and questionable pertaining to the storyline.  Many people will have many different interpretations as to what this movie is all about, however I find this movie to focus primarily on time-travel.  Time-travel gives Donnie the opportunity to control future occurrences from happening.  A movie about manipulation of FATE.  Ok enough of my philosophical analysis.  The movie will leave you in question no doubt the fist time you view it, however this movie has an emotional replay value.  Meaning you need not to put this movie away in your library.  It will certainly be a movie in and out of your dvd player on a consistent basis, and with no surprise it without a doubt would spark a very interesting conversation with whomever you watched it with....(and please don't talk yourself like Donnie).	4.0	Questionable rather Linear?	2005-03-25	7	1	6

Watch it like it's a comic about an ordinary, not-so-mild-mannered schoolboy that's been given a mission from up high.  I liked the film a lot when I first saw it, but what makes this one special (like so many others) is the way you get something new each time you see it.There are so many great things to say about the plot that it's not worth it to write.  Suffice it to say that it's never boring, always original and will remind you of.......nothing.  There's no other movie like this.  It's some crazy blend of thriller, comedy, drama and sci-fi. Maybe that means Kelly has created a new category.  I certainly think that any movie that's hard to classify is a winner.The cast is superb. Each play their part to perfection; you sympathize with Donnie, hate the health teacher, love the two young teachers, fear Frank, and despise Jim Cunningham.  When bigshot actors like Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Mary McDonnell all play small parts, you know that they did this movie not for the money, but because they believed in this film.  They trusted the rookie director, and they were right to do so.Religion pervades the film, and with careful viewing, you can get a whole new perspective that hopefully will serve as an inspiration to both agnostics and believers.  It might remind you of another young man that willingly gave his life for the people and the world that he loved.  If you get the DVD, watch all the extras, and you'll get a lot more out of it.  Rent it, buy it, borrow it, but whatever you do, don't go without seeing this stunning achievement.	5.0	Donnie Darko the Superhero	2003-09-06	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2I7WMKY96EB30	"Jerry Q. Winle ""hammock king"""	"Although I didn't care for the metaphysical uber-interpretation of this movie, I think that it provides more than enough for you to come up with something on your own.  ""Donnie Darko"" reflects profoundly on the state of our mainstream suburban culture in America. I might even go so far as to say that it is a companion piece to ""American Beauty"" as well as ""Fight Club"".This movie is definitely a candidate for multiple viewings, as there is much to be discovered after the first view. The website also tells a lot about the underlying metaphysics of the story created by Richard Kelly, but I would argue that you ought to form your own interpretation and talk to others about theirs rather than accept some silly SF BS."	4.0	Metaphysics aside, this is a ride	2005-09-25	4	3	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2PSY821R3ZRA	Jesse Hilsenrad	Donnie Darko is a film about existence, death, and teenage angst. Donnie Darko is beautiful, and powerful, and funny all at the same time. Though the film isn't perfect, freshman writer/director Richard Kelley delivers enough great moments to make Donnie Darko a must-see.I always say that I love seeing a film that shows me something new. Donnie Darko isn't a cliche teen horror film, and it's not a silly sci-fi rehash. I didn't know anything about the plot of Donnie Darko beforehand - and I'm glad I didn't. This film is deep and thoughtful; thoughtful in a way that stays with you intensely for several hours.I must give a specific mention to the original music in Donnie Darko. All of the music is a perfect complement to the film's mood - somber, yet positive. Additionally, the theme song for the film is just stunning. Who would have thought a remake of the Tears For Fears song &quot;Mad World&quot; would work so well here?Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job playing the disturbed lead character. His task is not an easy one. Gyllenhaal has to play a character that is simultaneously smart, scared, and drugged. Also very good is Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother. A lesser director might have painted Donnie's parents as mean or unsympathetic. The only bad performance was Drew Barrymore. Thankfully, she only has about six minutes of screen time. Other than Barrymore, almost all of the performances are very good.	4.0	Donnie Darko is so good, it's on my top 100	2004-01-09	2	1	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ENSXIGAZE1CZ	Jess	I was out of the country for the last half of 2001, and out of the loop as far as movies went, so upon my return I had to catch up.  I have been interested in comic books for as long as I can remember.  I read, I collect, I write.  My good friend does the artwork and inking for most of my stories, and he is the one who recommended this DVD to me.It truly is a comic book story.  Donnie Darko, a sixteen year old boy with emotional problems, is a superhero who must save the world, or so he is told by Frank, the 6-foot tall bunny rabbit.  Donnie, his family, his girlfriend Gretchen, and everyone around him can feel the subtle aura of something not quite right.  What only Donnie realizes is that the countdown has begun.The film has a great cast, including Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, and, of course, Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (who plays his sister in the film).  Each actor fit their part perfectly, and portrayed their character very well.It is a bit confusing the first time through, the second time it gets better, and the third time I recommend turning on the director's commentary.  The director, Richard Kelly, along with Jake Gyllenhaal, offer an amusing and clarifying commentary that allows for better understanding of the film.	5.0	A Remarkable Film	2003-10-14	5	5	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2EBLL2OYEQJN9	Jessica Lux	I finally checked this movie out, after hearing all the hype that's it's one of the best quirky off-beat movies of the decade.  It's hard to categorize this movie.  Sci-fi?  Teen angst/coming of age?  Horror?  It has elements of everything, and there's nothing to compare it to.I'm not going to detail the plot, because that's been taken care of in the description and in many other reviews.  It's not an easy plot to follow, and the end is confusing.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie more than once, because it makes a lot more sense on repeated viewings.  If you really want to get into what the movie is about, check out the kind-of-cryptic website at donniedarko.com, which has a lot of background info.  In order to get into the time travel/parallel universe, you need to read some of the documents on the website.  You aren't going to figure it out just from watching the movie.  I also suggest doing a google search and seeking out some of the better fan sites, which have explanations of the different universes and how the plot works.Jake Gyllenhall delivers an outstanding performance in this movie.  His character is off-beat, brilliant, disturbed, and handsome.  He's an outcast at school, but so funny that he gains respect of his peers when he has intelligent outbursts railing against the hypocrisy of education.  Another not-to-miss performance is Patrick Swayze as an annoying self-love self-help guru worshipped by the teachers at Donnie's school.Watch this movie once to see what it is all about, and if you are at all intrigued, get ready for some repeated viewings and some research into the backstory.	4.0	It's tough to categorize this movie, and it requires repeated watchings	2005-07-27	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2SJ7L8QB52WDW	jgcrackerass	I watched the theatrical version of Donnie Darko multiple times. I loved it, and really enjoyed how it played with my mind. It was just one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and the humor never got old. It is a comedy, with sci-fi undertones, but it is also so much more. Everything in the movie clicked just right, and watching it is always a real joy. When I saw the directors cut, I immediately realized what I had been missing just watching the theatrical version, and I liked it even more. I think personally, you have to watch the theatrical release first, and really think about it, and then watch the Directors Cut and enjoy all the added explainations. The directors cut is a much more solid movie, and everythiing is more crisp, and clear. All of the questions I was left wondering about after watching the theatrical release were answered for me in the directors cut, and that was great. I hear complaints that it took the mystery out of the movie. Well, if Donnie Darko had been a mystery movie, that would suck, but it wasnt', it was a Dark Comedy. The directors cut didn't take any of the darkness, or the comedy out of the movie, it simply made it make more sense. I don't see how any true fan of Donnie Darko could not like seeing a fuller version of the movie they claim to like. The directors cut doesn't take anything away from the movie, it just adds to it. Everything that is added is done so with great care, and only enhances the original film. It made a really, really good movie into a great movie.	5.0	Directors Cut is better.	2010-07-25	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AL5GW946HA38X	"J. Harding ""jwh61"""	I agree with the editorial review in the sense that this movie cannot be pinned down.  Is it a science fiction thriller?  A movie about schizophrenia?  A movie about the late 80's in America?  It is all of these things and more.  This is a stunning debut from Richard Kelly with superb acting by all, especially the star, Jake Gyllenhaal.  Jake is an admittedly troubled teen in psycho-therapy who is called upon to save the world.  The way that Richard Kelly renders this comic book plot however, is incredibly complex.  Like the plot, the meaning of the movie cannot be discerned even after repeated viewings.  The experience is exhilirating even after repeated viewings and the movie continues to provoke thought and debate.  One thing that's not debatable; this is one unique, heartfelt movie, and is highly recommended.	5.0	Unclassifiable	2003-02-11	2	2	0

If you like to watch Jay Gylenthall play the pathetic self loathing egotistical adolescent you should also check out ""The Good Girl"" with Jennifer AnnistonIt is very easy to see why this movie is popular among 15-25 year old white middle class suburban males who feel they are mentally unsuitable to live in this world yet believe they are intellectually gifted and ""special"".  This is an embarrassingly pretentious and corny film written by an egotistic and socially awkward adolescent that feels that he didn't ""fit in"" in highschool and probably scored high on the AP English exam.  On the plus side it is weird and original.  The best part about the new release of this DVD is the audio commentary track with Richard Kelley (director/writer) and Kevin Smith.  It is amusing to listen to Smith mockingly patronize the ""genius"" of Kelley and at the same time probably wondering how such a crappy film became so much more popular than all of his own films."	3.0	Darko	2005-09-26	31	9	22

And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it.Regardless of anything, sincere thought and expression went in to the making of Donnie Darko.

It sounds like a stupid premise, but don't let that fool you.  The film is very creepy with it's music score and sound.  An all-star cast supports this film, which include: Drew Barrymore as a teacher at the school; Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend; Noah Wyle as another teacher and Drew's boyfriend; Patrick Swayze as a mentor who teaches kids about fear.The film is heading back to theaters because of a very big request for it.  About 20 mins. of additional footage is being added into the film also.  If it hits a theater near you, check it out.  It's great.	5.0	Donnie Darko Rocks	2004-07-03	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3GTH1VXNRYZS5	"""j_james"""	I'm torn on this one, and so I ultimately have to disagree with the reviewer who said there's no middle ground. That you'll either love this film or you'll hate it. I'm living proof that there is middle ground.On the one hand this is a fabulously made flick. The screenwriting is sensational with some bitingly original insults, which for reasons of censorship I can't cite here, and the dialogue throughout is amazing. The characters are fantistically developed, the high schoolers take you back to your high school years and the adults show you what adulthood is all about--that we don't necessarily have things figured out any more than kids do. The audio track is flawless, sound effects fit into the puzzle just as they should, the soundtrack is fabulous (despite the fact that Donnie's little sister dances to a song (Notorius) that wasn't released until 1992). And as for the lighting. Obviously Kelly has done some Gaffer or Director of Photography work before because he has an astute sense of what angles, what shadows to employ. You could almost get the characters' emotions without actors by paying attention to how faces are lit. Or the camera angles and movements they're shot in. With that said, with one exception--Drew Barrymore, who is horribly miscast here--the acting is bitingly true. Jake Gylenhaal debuted to the limelight with October Sky very well. He follows that performance up with an even more accurate performance here. Jena Malone continues to show that she will someday soon be a massive star, despite her ripe young age of 16 and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Donnie's mother, who when she's on it, steals the screen) fit their characters flawlessly.So you wonder: with all these great things said, what can possibly be wrong with this film? two things. First Drew Barrymore, who I usually love and who produced the flick, thus having the ability to pick her role, fails as a hard-nosed, but well intentioned young teacher. And secondly, and much more importantly, it never seems that Kelly has a clear vision of what he wants his debut film to be. At times it seems he wants it to be a teen, high school flick, at times a commentary on pretentiousness or gullability, at times a look into the effects of mental illness on those that suffer the malady and on the family and friends of the mentally ill, at times it feels as though it's going to be a coming of age story, at times it looks into sexual perversions, at times it a psychological analysis of different characters, at times it tries to surprise you with interesting twists and then just to convolude itself as much as humanly possibly, it's a science fiction movie about time travel. Each of these themes are fabulous film fodder, but they can't be clumped into one hour and a fifty minute movie. A combination of a few of them, sure. Or a deep investigation of one or two of them, even better. But ultimately Donnie Darko is too amibitious (something you can rarely say about films today) and can't possibly do all of the things it seems to do want to accomplish. This, on one hand, is a strength. I'd rather have a film be ambitious and scale many genres; it inspires more thought and emotion that way. But sometimes, as a writer or filmmaker, you have to narrow your scope and pick what's most important. It feels as though Kelly never did that. And if he did, I'd loathe seeing the original first couple drafts of this script.	3.0	What are we watching? Genius, yes. But after that what?	2002-05-06	6	2	4

I mean, I admit, the premise is a little goofy. I mean, a 6 ft bunny predicting the future? I was skeptical. But after watching this, I realized that this movie has so much to offer. Its all about getting a second chance, and proving that, despite what other people think about you, there is good inside you. Please note that this is not a teenie-bopper flick either. All the characters in this movie were very well developed and it seemed like Richard Kelly really put a lot of time and effort into them. Please go into this movie with an open eye. After the first time you watch it, you may think its stupid.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A5YOMBZZ9RYC7	JKI	The social commentary was annoying in the extreme after awhile - the consistancy of it. Shut up already. I like that it was weird and it did make you think - not about life and the here and now - more like a what if...Decisions... had he done it before? because he never should have known what he knew - Why did the rabbit follow him (because he cheated death - did he, if the plane didn't exsist yet?All so dramatic... and yet, I liked the characters. Even the annoying and crazy ones.Love was the all important motivator in this movie, because despite it all, that was what kept the characters going and what most all their actions were based on when it was important (ie mom taking sister to dance contest, most all of Donnie's decisions) Nice message if you saw it. It's subjective though. The movie is.The song Mad World so popular now - and so OVER PLAYED - I loved it in this movie. And the 80s references were fun.

I asked them what it was about and they said, ""It's about this guy who sees a demon bunny.""WRONG!It's about so much more. Mental psychosis, time travel, and yes, a demon bunny. But mainly, the story deals with a teen who seems to remind you of a certain Holden Caufield - strange considering Jake Gyllenhaal and lookalike Tobey McGuire both mention Caufield in two films they were in - The Good Girl(Gyllenhaal) and Pleasantville (McGuire).Donnie, the name of the character played by Jake G, is being stalked by a human-sized demonic bunny that tells him to do things. Donnie makes himself listen because the bunny, named Frank, saved his life from a plane engine that crashes into his room. But Frank wants Donnie to do more things, seemingly evil things.....Okay, now that we've officially got the originality factor into play, let me just say that this screenplay, the acting and the mood compel you to watch more. I went from laying on the ground as I watched this film to sitting up on my dumpa at the end, bracing for what might happen next (well, not bracing, but close).The musical score is amazingly fitting, and the acting - even from Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, is first rate. This is a film that will make just about anyone keep sitting and watching.Warnings to those who care - LOTS of profanities in the beginning of the film. Not much violence throughout. A few sexual references while Donnie's in psycho therapy, and no nude scenes but there is one sexual scene that lasts maybe ten seconds but involves kissing on a bed - nothing more.I've seen Bully, At Close Range and War of The Worlds in the last three days and this was hands down better than all of them.One last parting shot - if you don't pay attention all the way through, you'll miss out. Yeah, it's one of those films. So don't watch this with a room full of your A.D.D. pals. And if you're one of those A.D.D. pals, good luck, man!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	I honestly don't know how to describe Donnie Darko.  After I got finished watching it I wasn't quite sure what it was that I just saw.  This movie defies classification. It is set in the late 80's during the Bush-Dukakis presidential race.  This fact is not so important other than it gives the movie a concrete sense of time.  This is the when.The film follows teenaged Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Donnie is in therapy for his schizophrenia and the movie switches between what we see as the reality of the movie and his visions of some creature that looks like it has a mask of a disturbing rabbit.  This rabbit is man sized and it instructs Donnie to act and to do things.  Exactly what these things are would spoil some of the wonder of the movie.  In the reality, the film opens with the engine from a plane falling from the sky and crashing through Donnie's bedroom.Donnie's family is fairly normal.  He argues with his sister (played by Jake's real life sister Maggie).  His parents try their best to provide for the family and to help Donnie with his therapy.  He is somewhat of an outcast at school but has his group of friends.  He meets a new girl at school (Jena Malone) and they begin a relationship that feels real despite the strangeness of their meeting.The strength of this movie comes from Donnie's belief in his visions.  It provides motivation as well as tension throughout the movie.  As an added bonus this movie is so original that we don't quite know where the movie is going.  There is discussion of time travel and hints of what might really be going on.As a whole, this is a fascinating movie.  It requires multiple viewings and since I have only seen it once, I'm not entirely sure of everything that happened in the movie.  It is a  little confusing, but definitely worth watching.	4.0	fantastic and confusing	2003-07-01	3	3	0

Its very wierd, yes, but its origonal, and it tells a story not many other directors would attempt to tell. Its open to interpretation. Its beautiful. If the story seems wierd at the beginning, it is. But let yourself be drawn into the movie, and wait it out. You won't be dissapointed.As for the people who try to classify this movie into genres, this movie dosen't follow those guidelines. Its a mishmash of all sorts of emotions and stories. But it works, it never feels skitzophrenic.The soundtrack, by the way, is steller. Check it out.	5.0	Allow Yourself to Become Part of Donnies World...	2002-05-06	4	4	0

In fact, the ideas and concepts involved in the film left me shaking at the end. This is ""some deep shi*"" as my friend put it.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3116ITCY40DC6	"John ""Ira"""	"Every once and a while, we come across a movie that just sticks with us in the back of our mind. Maybe because its greatness was too much for us to comprehend in one sitting. Or maybe because the lesson is much greater than what we as people are not used to in cinema. With a generation watered down by Hilary Duff films where somehow everything works out okay, even though it seems irrational and makes almost zero sense. Donnie Darko though, is an emotional slap to the face for all that think that is how the world works. This is a movie, that does not just have not one scene that tugs at the strings of your heart, the core of your soul or the center of your mind. Every scene does that and it's not everyday we come across that. from the serious scenes to the depressing yet humorous scene involing hungry, hungry hippos and well.....regret. To the discussion between Sean, Ronald and Donnie involving ""Smurfs"" which almost felt like a more blunt version of the famous Star Wars discussion in ""Clerks""I must admit though, I judged this before I watched it. Which I kick myself now for. I judged it because it seemed to have a cult following of pudgy Hot Topic obsessed poser kids. Being a dedicated REAL metalhead, hot topic posers are the bane of exsistance in my eyes. So, I wrongfully wrote this off as a cliche joke of depressed stereotypes. I was wrong.Anyway, the story starts off with Donnie Darko, a young man in the 80's going through,  depression, moral issues, arson issues, wonder of what the world brings and well a huge demonic bunny named Frank which brings news of the end of the world. He is surrounded what seems to be a normal family, a normal sweet younger sister, an older sister with obvious attitude issues and parents who are simply ""worried"" a love interest with the new girl in town, bullies and friends that really don't seem to be doing much in life. Watching Donnie transform through this movie was amazing and shwos his range as an actor. The last 10 minutes is truly thought provoking cinema.I have cable, so that is how I stumbled upon this movie. So, I can't give youexact details on extras for the dvds. However, they h ave played it alot and i've watched it 6-8 times this month and I must say, you won't be dissapointed. I will leave you will a few memorable quotes. Enjoy.Gretchen: My mom had to get a restraining order against my step dad. He has emotional problems.Donnie: Oh, I have those too. What kind does your step dad have?Gretchen: He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.Donnie: Oh.Karen Pommeroy: [to Principle Cole] I don't think that you have a clue what it's like to communicate with these kids. We are losing them to apathy... to this prescribed nonsense. They are slipping away.Donnie: My parents didn't get me what I wanted for Christmas.Dr. Lilian Thurman: What did you want?Donnie: Hungry Hungry Hippos.Dr. Lilian Thurman: And how did you feel, being denied these hungry, hungry hippos?Donnie: Regret.Dr. Lilian Thurman: The search for God is absurd?Donnie: It is if everyone dies alone.Donnie: [in a letter] Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep. I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to."	5.0	I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.	2006-07-26	4	4	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3LGFYDVKLICY8	John Morgan	"I really wanted this film to be a GREAT film. Based on the things I'd read about it, and what I'd heard from others, it sounded like the kind of film that would enter that pantheon of films that I must watch at least once every year or so. And I do believe that ""Donnie Darko"" is a very good film - I have watched it three times thus far, and there aren't many films on which I would spend that much time, if I didn't find them intriguing.  The film is extremely well-made, and evokes an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding very effectively.  The gleaming unreality of 1980s suburbia, which seems to just barely cover over some mysterious darkness lurking beneath which threatens to erupt and overwhelm the surface world at any moment, compares favorably with ""Blue Velvet,"" which achieved a very similar effect.  And the characters and dialogue are richly drawn, and we have high school kids who actually look and act like how high school kids really look and act - a rarity in American film.But there are still some quite serious problems that I have with it. One is that I don't find Donnie to be a particularly sympathetic character. He's not especially likable - he's smart, but completely self-absorbed, nihilistic, and the friends he hangs around with seem to be a rather unsavory bunch (the ""Go back to China"" comment from one, said to an Asian student, being a particularly brutal example). He doesn't have any real problems, either, being the privileged only son of affluent and loving parents who give him anything he wants.  There's a bully who bothers him occasionally, and his ""emotional problems,"" although by the end of the film it seems that the latter is, in fact, essential to the ""mission"" he's called on to carry out.  Otherwise, Donnie's life seems quite golden, in the American suburban sense, so it's unclear as to what it really is that troubles him, other than the usual teen angst with which all of us must come to terms.Another weakness is that the film seems to simultaneously try to evoke nostalgia for the 1980s, while some sort of critique of `80s values seems to also be implied.  Such ambivalence isn't necessarily a flaw, particularly in view of the light/dark duality that I mentioned earlier in its depiction of suburbia. However - and I'm entirely willing to admit that this as a personal quirk of mine - as I'm only two years older than the film's creator, Richard Kelly, and come from a very similar suburban background, I can't help but react negatively to this setting, as I experienced the same period in the same way, and found everything about the `80s to be vacuous and repulsive.  I'm still not sure exactly what Kelly's trying to communicate about the `80s - whether it's meant to be ironic or not - but I personally found it to be a turn-off.  This may be deliberate on his part, but I remain uncertain, even after multiple viewings.Although for me, the greatest flaw didn't strike me until I made the mistake of attempting to ""understand"" the film.  I was fortunate enough to see the film for the first time in a theater that happened to be screening the Director's Cut - and the Director's Cut of ""Donnie Darko,"" I must say, is one of the few such re-releases that I felt actually added something of substance to the original theatrical version (which I have seen subsequently), and I recommend that first-time viewers seek out the Director's Cut for this reason.However, even given this advantage, there were still a lot of things about the film that struck me as odd or inconsistent.  I should have just chalked it up to the film's surreal atmosphere, and left well enough alone, but I couldn't help but wonder if I'd missed something on my initial viewing, so I started searching the Internet and going through the special features on the DVD to see what I could unearth.  What I learned changed my view of the film, and not for the better.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!) One thing that stayed with me after my first viewing was the jet engine that plummets from the sky at the film's conclusion - what caused it to fall off the plane in the first place?  There's no way to know this from the film itself.  So I discovered an interview with Kelly in which he explained that the engine was, in fact, ripped away from the body of the plane by Donnie himself, with his ""new-found psychic powers,"" and that Donnie discovers at the climax of the film that he's a kind of superhero, replete with super-powers.  I found this to be kind of a cop-out.  After all, there's absolutely nothing in the film itself to support this...no hint that Donnie has ""super-powers,"" and yet clearly it's a crucial plot point, since the entire plot revolves around this jet engine.  Further reading only soured my view of the film further.  I made the mistake of reading the text of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book (an extra on the DVD) which is featured in the film, although within the film we never find out exactly what's in it.  This is for the better, since I discovered upon reading it that most, if not all of the characters in the film are being manipulated by whatever unseen forces are driving Donnie toward completing his ""mission.""  Frank, the guy in the bunny costume, it turns out is a ""manipulated dead,"" meaning that he was sent back in time from the moment when Donnie kills him in order to instruct Donnie in what he must do.  As for some of the other bizarre moments in the film, it turns out that these unseen forces can also manipulate the living, and that when Donnie's psychiatrist warns him about ""the sky opening up,"" or when Donnie's teacher tells Gretchen to ""sit next to the boy who's the cutest,"" this is all the result of them being manipulated by these mysterious beings.  This, for me, was a huge disappointment.  Basically, what this means is that ""Donnie Darko"" is basically about a bunch of characters who are all automatons without free will, being manipulated by unseen forces for some purpose that is never fully divulged in the film.  My reaction to this revelation was, ""So who cares?""  I watch films to see humans reacting in human ways to human situations.  Discovering that the characters in a film are basically puppets being forced to behave in particular ways is, for me, a devastating blow to the film's integrity, and, as I said before, a cop-out, since it gets the characters out of any responsibility or motive for their own actions.  (END SPOILERS) I was willing to attribute the strangeness of the film to its surreal character, but now that I know Kelly's intent, it's hard to put it out of my head when I'm watching it.  Maybe Kelly is trying to say something about free will and determinism that I haven't figured out, but as it is, knowing that the characters are all being manipulated to do and say certain things, it really takes away a lot of the compelling interest in the story for me.When I've watched the film since finding out these things, I've tried to put what I've read out of my head, more or less successfully, but it's still weakened the film in my eyes. So, my advice to prospective new viewers of this film is: DON'T try to understand it, just take it at face value for what it is. It doesn't stand up to sustained investigation."	3.0	A good film, just don't look too deeply into it	2006-09-26	19	9	10

But he's also a troubled young man, and in this respect, he's actually *not* special.  The nature of his unhappiness with the world in general is probably what most adolescents go through.  Donnie's actions, however, are not ordinary in the least.The question is, what is it that ultimately motivates Donnie?  Is he just schizophrenic, or is something deeper going on?  Is Donnie just a suburban hoodlum, or is he a hero, or is he a pawn?It's a good story, extremely well acted, directed and shot.	4.0	A genuinely haunting movie	2010-09-22	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AL4QCMD9VJASA	John R Kochefko	"Donnie has problems.  Big problems.  His classmates find him weird.  He isn't too great with the ladies.  A jet engine fell on his house.  And a giant bunny is telling him that the world's going to end in just 28 days and change.Well, what can I say about this movie?  I went into this film knowing nothing more than a couple of my friends liked it and it starred the kid from ""Bubble Boy.""  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found it gripping, intriguing and all the other words you can find in the thesaurus that mean the same.Richard Kelly is the man to thank for this.  He is the first time director and writer behind ""Darko.""  You just got to love those rookies that come out with a movie that makes you anxious to see the next one.  The script is intelligent, very well thought out and terribly cryptic.  Now, about the characters...Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal, ""October Sky"") is an odd little lead.  Not quite sure whether to embrace him and try to empathize or just distance yourself and try to find someone else to connect with.  Then there's the girl, the ""love interest.""  Gretchen (played by Jena Malone).  We hardly know what this girl is all about, despite the information we're given.  I'm not sure if it's a script thing or an acting thing or if that's the way it's supposed to be.  We have the parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) that I would have loved to have seen more of.  The rest of the characters seemed pretty damn two-dimensional, which actually is fine by me.  This isn't a PT Anderson epic, after all.  However, I do believe that Mr. Kelly is capable of producing such an epic were he to try.The film deals greatly with the subject of time travel.  Basically I'm saying get ready to open your mind a little bit and start thinking.  This isn't a ""Back to the Future"" type of film.  You'll be quizzed on the material later.So, to recap:  I loved the movie.  I loved watching the ending and being forced to think about things.  I loved learning about a new director who obviously cares about film and puts thought into his projects.  I'm curious as to what he could do with something he didn't write.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  As for now, I'm going to go to sleep and hope the darkness and depression that can come from this movie doesn't consume me or give me nightmares.  What a great closing line.  See this movie."	5.0	Ive Made A New Friend......	2002-06-03	2	1	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1EKA9XSI641C9	John S. Milas	When I first heard about this it sounded like some sort of cheap teen horror slasher movie and I really wasn't interested.  Eventually it became evident that it was quit a popular movie among the more cultured people in my local society, so I became a little more interested in it and finally bought it at the local Best Buy for about $10, which was an excellent price condidering The Matrix is still about $10 and it's about 2 years older than Donnie.  I watched this movie for the first time with my family and was sort of nervous because I wasn't aware of the subject matter to come, but I was pleasantly surprised that everyone including me liked the movie, although my parents were somewhat confused with the meaning of it, I just liked it.  For the calibur of film that this is it's excellent.  By calibur I mean that it wasn't originally made for a large theatre release on a huge budget.  There isn't really anything I can say to you about the movie that gives it away other than the fact that it is extremely funny, creepy, and unsettling all at the same time.  The performances by the cast are true to life.  The film is supposed to take place in 1988, and I guess that the budget and time sort of crippled the feel of it, but when I looked closer I saw a little more 80's soul in it.  The DVD is great also, the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake G. (will not attempt to spell) is very informative.  I learned several things that would be impossible to figure out by just watching it that make a little more sense now that I know them.  The deleted scenes range from very well done to very pointless (Donnie's rightfully deleted death shot).  The Mad World music video is only good because of the song, the actual video is prety much clips of the movie.  One thing I find odd is the website gallery.  It's just screenshots from [...] and they're very unclear so I don't see the justification in it being on the DVD.  Same thing with the production photos.  While the production art pics are pretty cool to look at, the production photos are pretty much screenshots from the movie, some so dark you can't even tell what they are.  Overall this DVD is pretty cool, and the movie is necessary for film buffs and film regulars alike.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Like Nothing You've Ever Seen	2005-04-28	6	4	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AK81WLVD5KGUX	"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan"""	This brilliant film didn't make much of a splash in the U.S. when it appeared in theaters. On DVD, though, it's getting the attention it deserves.Which makes sense, really; it's not the sort of film you grok fully after one viewing. There's a lot going on here, and some of it isn't actually explained within the movie itself. (For the SF time travel/alternate universe skeleton on which the story is hung, you'll probably need to look online for excerpts from _The Philosophy of Time Travel_, a fictional book that figures prominently in the movie.)The time travel bit is pretty well worked out, and this film would be a success purely as an SF film even if that's all it were. In its time-travel logic, it's not quite as tight as the first Terminator film, but it beats the heck out of _Timecop_.But it's lots of other things too: a charming late-80s period piece (with lots of music -- including a gorgeous remake of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' -- to satisfy anybody out there who happens to be nostalgic for the 1980s); a scorching satire of public education; a dark comedy about puberty, teen angst, and psychological disorders; a comeback vehicle for Katharine Ross and Patrick Swayze; and an extended parable the moral of which is that kids had better save themselves because adults are too screwed up to do the job. (First-time director Richard Kelly wrote the script.)That's a lot of balls to keep in the air -- but, amazingly, the film succeeds in _every one_ of these aspects. Its success is due in no small measure to the mesmerizing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role; he carries the entire film on his shoulders. His real-life sister Maggie is also delightful as Elizabeth Darko, and the adult Darkos (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) are a refreshing change of pace from the usual teen-film parents. Jena Malone, as Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen Ross, is well matched with Gyllenhaal (and this is the second time in five years that she's appeared in a movie with wormholes in it: she also played Jodie Foster's younger self in _Contact_).The rest of the cast is good too -- especially Swayze, who camps it up as a smarmy self-help guru.Oh, and there's the rabbit. If you're reading this page, you're surely aware that Donnie is visited by a human-sized bunny who persuades him to engage in odd behavior while he's sleepwalking. (You may be reminded of _Harvey_ at this point, but director Richard Kelly says he wasn't thinking of that film at all.)If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may be thinking that a film in which a teenaged boy is visited by a giant rabbit cannot _possibly_ work. I guarantee you you'll be pleasantly surprised once you actually watch it; this one is every bit as good as you've heard it is. In its way it's every bit as mind-blowing as David Lynch's _Mulholland Dr._ -- but with a gentler, lighter touch, a fine sense of humor, and, in its way, a more hopeful message (though every bit as dark as Lynch).It's being rereleased in theaters in an extended 'director's version', but the current DVD includes about twenty deleted scenes that will presumably constitute at least a lot of the additional footage. If you want to see what you've been missing, grab this one while it's still available; if a director's-cut CD is ever released, you can buy it too. And you'll probably want to.	5.0	'Donnie Darko'?

Many of the key scenes were alterd, ruining some of the best moments in the film, and the eye ball thing that was added before incounters with frank was just plain retarded. Also this version was way too dumbed down, the showing of portions of the book as well as the added scene in the end with grandma death, told far too much. The original release really made you think, and took several veiwing for you to truely grasp everything, but this version lays everything out for you, turning one of the most complex movies I've seen into just your average ordinary run of the mill film.

No deep thought provoking, earth-shattering wonder. It was just a movie.A teenage boy with paranoid delusions can see into the future. He gets his prophecies from a dude in a psycho bunny suit who he ends up shooting. With special effects similar to The Deep or The Abyss, watery auras extend from people's chests and lead them through life. Drew Barrymore plays an English teacher who tries to do things her way and gets canned.The world ends on A certain day as told by the rabbit, but time only stops for Darko because he does not leave his room. A piece of falling airplane falls through the roof and kills him. Of course that sets time back a month and everyone knows they have 30 days or so to live again.All in all the flick was OK, but I wouldn't watch it again. Nor would I want to listen to Tears for Fears in the soundtrack.Patrick Swayze plays a whacko who has a VHS set that helps people handle their fear. He later gets nabbed as a psycho with a child porn ring that is run from his house.	3.0	It didn't rock my world	2004-11-17	24	3	21

Jake Gyllenhaal, who i already think is an awesome actr and has incredible talent, played down a little to much for this role but it was still entertaining. The way they made ""Donnie"" look like a complete schizophrenic was really cool because in reality he had created almost seperate reality for himself in which he found it possible to delay his death and therefore trade it in for his mothers plane not crashing those 28 days later. I would ave to say one thing that really upset me, was the fact that this movie was said to take place in the late 80's, but yet, had i watched it wth no time frame, i would have honestly believed that it was made in the present.

It made me think about concepts such as predestination and fate and the possibility of altering such destinies. Sure, this film is science fiction, but such factors should not- do not hinder the lasting effect of the film. You can't help but ponder existence. It's a hair's breadth from impossible to watch this film and not feel something stir within you.This is a film best viewed without the threat of interruption. If you don't watch it in full, I guarantee that you will miss something, and will therefore not be able to form your own conclusion to the tale. What was the ending's purpose, what were the significances of certain events, and what exactly the movie was about can only be answered when you've experienced a thorough viewing."	5.0	Enlightened By Darko	2004-12-15	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AT9SVREGHZGVF	"Josh K. Shamblin ""jsham24"""	I was skeptical of this movie after reading some short plot summaries. But I am glad I checked it out because it is a great movie. Don't be fooled by all the time travel/giant bunny talk; this isn't a big time science fiction film. Those are just occurring events in the plot, that's not what the movie itself is about. I would relate it closely to The Butterfly Effect in terms of the idea of the movie. If you could change things in your life in order to protect those around you, even if it meant maybe never having some of the beautiful memories, would you do it? Jake Gyllenhall does a great job at being creepy and yet sensitive and loving, like most teenagers. It's a haunting movie and may stick with you a while. The reason I only gave it four stars is that I thought the plot could have been a little tighter; the premise is great and the resulting movie is as well, but there were moments when a little more could have been added to really put this film over the top.	4.0	Surprisingly good movie	2004-06-16	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1RR6EZ58D0YMG	"JP ""fattyjoe37"""	The theatrical version of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I liked it so much that I went to the world premiere of the director's cut.  Unfortunately what I saw there was a great movie turned into merely a good one.  I'm all for filmmakers going back and making their work available in the way they want it be seen before a studio messed with it (such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Legend), but I don't like it when filmmakers go back and change stuff that they didn't have a problem with in the first place (which is what happened here).  Richard Kelly said that he was happy with the theatrical cut and would only change the opening song to an INXS song that was in the script.  But he changed a lot more in the director's cut then that and makes the movie lose much of its mystery and charm.  Here are some of the major changes:-Music changed: In the opening Echo and the Bunnymen has been changed to INXS.  Even if Richard had wanted to use INXS in the first place he was lucky to find Echo and the Bunnymen because that song works much better.  A lot of other songs are mixed around in the soundtrack now too and not for the better.-Added visual effects: Shots of Donnie's eye filled with crazy imagery doesn't fit with the style of the movie and they look pretty cheesy.  Effects like these also ruin the ending of the movie.-Pages of the book: Throughout the director's cut pages of the Philosophy of Time Travel will appear onscreen basically telling the audience what is happening.  The old version worked much better because you could decide for yourself what was going on.  Now the director is jamming an explanation down your throat.-Added scenes: The only thing the director's cut does right is adding in about 20 minutes of deleted scenes that really flesh out the characters.  But they do make the movie seem overlong and not all of them add anything special.-Audio changes: Some audio has been deleted from the theatrical version.  Not really any reason, but it's for the worse.  And an important scene with Drew Barrymore was cut in half.Now onto the DVD.-Commentary: Richard Kelly and filmmaker Kevin Smith (Clerks) talk about the changes in the director's cut and the movie's cult status.  A very good and entertaining commentary, this is the best extra on the set.  But the commentary with Richard and Jake Gyllenhaal is still the best of the Darko commentaries.-Production Diary: Some behind the scenes footage.  Semi-interesting.-Documentary on the cult of Donnie Darko: A documentary made in Europe that is sort of interesting, but the participants spend most of the time bashing Americans and how they can't understand a movie like this.-#1 Fan: A short film made for a contest to find Donnie Darko's #1 fan.  The guy in this piece is really weird and kinda crazy.  But at the end you'll be laughing your head off.-There are also storyboards and a trailer.The director's cut of Donnie Darko isn't bad, it was just right the first time.  I'd say pick up this DVD to see a different vision of the movie and for the special features, but keep your old copy because it contains the better version of the movie and more special features.	4.0	Director's Cut DVD Review	2005-04-05	15	14	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"There are so many good things to say about ""Donnie Darko"" that this review could be pages long. But, first of all and most important, this is a very original, thought-provoking and intense film.The script is like something Neal Stephenson and Stephen King would write togheter: dark, multi-elemented, fantastic characters, it grabs the viewer and tranports him to Donnie's reality without effort. Maybe you won't turn the TV set off feeling very well after watching ""Donnie Darko"", but you also won't forget it easily. Donnie sticks to mind. Relating things like depressive behavior with time-travel made this movie one of the most incredible I've seen in the last decade.Donnie is brilliantly played by one of the upcoming stars of the young generation of talented actors, Jake Gylenhaal. Donnie is a schyzophrenic, uncomprehended kid with lots of relationship problems. Sleepwalking, he does ""errands"" for a fantastic figure, a giant reptile-rabbit named Frank. These errands, always using violence and being supposedly pointless, are all part of a greater scheme conceived by Donnie and his immaginary pal, Frank. And this greater scheme is what is most interesting and original about ""Donnie Darko"". I don't want to give anything away, you'll have to watch it to understand.All characters are well-developed, no matter how little their on-screen time. For example: Noah Wyle's character, one of Donnie's teachers, is always eating someting, because the actor decided his character was diabetic (!). This is the kind of acting I'm talking about. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and, especially, Jena Malone, all of them created believable and coherent characters.But the best thing of all in this amazing movie is the dialogue. It's intelligent, fast, funny. There are many, many memorable quotes, one better than the other. Log on to the Message Board pages about ""Donnie Darko"" at Imdb.com to see what I mean.Watch it over and over again, pay attention to details, characters, situations and dialogues. Search the web for things related to ""Donnie Darko"". There's much more to it than it seems.Grade 9.3/10"	5.0	Donnie Greato	2003-07-21	5	5	0

This grid makes no sense at all, especially when you hear the Director's weak rationale for the artifice. The other additions are more effective and the sound is vastly improved over the original.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A28GCEHD00JFZG	Julian Kennedy	Donnie Darko: 6 out of 10: Some movies just pass me right by. I found Amelie by the end more irritating than cute, I didn't laugh once at Rushmore, and only a hostage situation could coerce me to watch The Piano again.Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.So what went wrong' the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even a six foot demonic one.	3.0	Donnie Darko... Silly rabbit Time Travel is for Kids	2009-10-23	4	0	4

Period.I knew pretty much nothing about it when I saw it, other than there was a guy named Frank, and my friend really liked it.  I was blown away.  I have seen it countless times since, and spent a long time analyzing it.  This movie is the perfect mix of funny, touching, beautiful, and very meaningful.  It is not at all scary, unless you are frightened by bunnies.If you like philosophical discussion, you will love this movie, but just because you don't does not mean you won't like it.  You'll probably love it anyway, and maybe you'll start to like philosophical discussion.No matter what, this movie contains one of the funniest lines in the world: ""He asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus!""From the relationships within the family, to Frank's prophecy of doom, this is the perfect movie.  The director's cut contains several sweet, funny, and informative scenes that were cut from the original.  It also contains some more explanation for those who don't enjoy being completely confused.  I myself found it fun to try and figure things out on my own, but i still enjoyed this version which in no way spelled it out."	5.0	only the best movie ever	2004-11-29	6	5	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1OJA99YT911TA	"Julien R. Fielding ""Bodhi Grrl!"""	"It took a trip to the U.K. to discover the merits of this mesmerizing, deeply personal film. Although released in the United States in 2001, ""Donnie Darko"" never came to a cinema near me, and thanks to a relatively silent press, I didn't even know what it was when it came out on video.Then in October 2002 I was in Northern England and began seeing reviews of the film. (It was hailed unanimously.) But what sealed my fate was hearing the hauntingly beautiful ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules. As soon as I got back home, I rushed to the video store to rent the film. Within two days I had watched it twice and before I returned it, saw it another time. I have since purchased the DVD and watched the extras and listened to the commentary.I love the film because every time I watch it, I notice something new, which causes me to engage in a whole new set of mental Olympics. This is thought-provoking, genre blending filmmaking that helps me forget all the dross that, more often than not, Hollywood inundates us with. And it proves true visionaries still exist. But what's more, ""Darko"" paints a more realistic portrait of the '80s. Although many '80s films focused on insider trading and drug use, few tackled the political situation as created by Reagan and Bush. Many of us living during the ""finger on the button"" '80s lived with a real sense of doom, which was very reminescent of the ""World is Coming to An End"" rhetoric spouted by Frank.Furthermore, ""Darko"" creates a more realistic portrait of teen angst. Then, and now, everything couldn't be put in a box and topped with a bow, as John Hughes wanted us to believe. Life is more complicated than that. Teens experience dark moments that can't be cured by a wild party and buxom babes.Richard Kelly's script goes beyond your typical Hollywood fare. It represents something archetypal and deeply symbolic. This is a stunning freshman effort. What's more the music immediately struck a chord with me as I loved Tears for Fears' superior album ""The Hurting."" ""Killing Moon"" also has been my favorite Echo & the Bunnymen song.""Donnie Darko"" is, without a doubt, the most important film to come out of 2001, and will exert an influence for years to come."	5.0	More realistic view of the '80s	2002-12-08	0	0	0

And this Director's Cut is even better.  Five stars plus.  But the ""Director's Commentary"" extra is abysmal.For a movie that cries out for in-depth analysis by its visionary creator, the choice to have writer/director Richard Kelly be ""helped"" in his commentary by friend Kevin Smith is epically misguided.  Self-centered Smith just won't shut up about his own movies, Mallrats, Dogma, and Clerks.  Some may say these are fine movies,  but I for one have no interest in how any scene in Donnie Darko is ""just like what I did in MY movie, Mallrats.""  Kevin Smith, your movies aren't even in the same league.  Richard Kelly can't seem to get a word in edgewise, and the result is an annoying and frustratingly unenlightening commentary.By all means watch Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut.

However, that doesn't mean that the first time around is dull.  This film is dark, twisted, funny, sad, well-acted, and, above all else, like nothing you've seen before, or will see again.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character seamlessly, which, considering the complexity and ultimate weirdness of Donnie, is a tremendous accomplishment.  I loved the ending, and the way that all of the characters were a touch strange.  Drew Barrymore did an excellent job at creating a meaningfull, in not large, character.  The story line, and I mentioned, takes a severe twist at the end and is complicated throughout, but you'll love it the first time, even if some things are unclear until the next.	4.0	Amazingly Strange and Enjoyable	2004-03-05	0	0	0

The original, more compact and eliptical, plays as a moody meditation on the omnipotent, interconnected and paranoid aspect of adolescent fantasy.

The concepts and themes in the movie are explored excellently, although in the middle of the book one might find there to be too many such themes.The wonderful thing about Donnie Darko is that it'll haunt you. The ending is not particularly explosive, or particularly violent, compared to action flicks such as Die Hard, but once the movie ends, you'll find yourself constantly reexploring the movie, finding plot points and character developments.The direction of Richard Kelly is particularly fantastic. The way he makes each scene connect with the viewer and symbolizes so many of the characters is fascinating... One might assume him to be a seasoned director, but he is really young, and his gifts and talents are not to be taking for granted.Donnie Darko, however haunting, makes you want to just cuddle up in a corner as well, wishing you had never watched the movie for the great amount of depressing characteristic it presents. Donnie Darko is the cult classic that is beatifully dark and tranquilizing... you'll never be the same once you watch it.	5.0	Beautifully Dark	2007-08-09	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1UDMXYN12AS6A	Kate Trimmell	What happened when I first heard of this movie? A giant bunny comes to a high school student throughout the movie and tells him to create certain acts of crime such as arson, vandalism, etc. Ya, I had that same look on my face. Seems a little odd, but this movie is definitely one that will get you thinking. With the dark themes and a rather odd sense of humor at times it just makes the movie all the more pleasing. It's a great movie to watch if you really want to get the wheels in your head turning.The cast was wonderfully put together with familiar stars. The lead role of Donnie Darko is played by the handsome Jake Gyllenhaal (not a bad thing to look at ;) ).I'd recommend this if you are looking to start a conversation with someone on what you think the main points of the movie are and what it means to you. And because it can get somewhat confusing at times I'd suggest that you clear your mind and be open to the journey that is awaiting you.I would definitely put it into a category with my top 5 favorites. This is a a movie that you definitely don't want to miss. It has a deep meaningful message and such interest that you will want to watch it over and over again.	5.0	Excellent Ride	2004-02-26	3	1	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3UR8MBDZSBB2	Kat	I had never been as blown away by a film as I was when I first saw 'Donnie Darko' a little under a year ago.In fact, when I saw this at the cinema, I went back the next afternoon and saw it for a second time. It's that good. Like 'Fight Club', it's definitely the sort of film where a second viewing is really beneficial.I went in knowing little to nothing about this film, and that's the best way to approach it. The less you know about 'Darko', the better your enjoyment of the film will be. This is the sort of film that doesn't treat it's audience like children. It doesn't provide a simple story, it doesn't offer up any easy answers. This is the sort of brave and innovative filmmaking that makes up for all the insipid 'paint-by-numbers' films that have become standard multiplex fare. It's this sort of film that restores your faith in cinema. Every performance here is no less than first class, every moment no less than totally engaging.The DVD is wonderful, and the two commentaries - one with director Richard Kelly and star Jake Gyllenhaal, another with various other cast members including Drew Barrymore and (a very subdued) Jena Malone - are the highlights out of the multitude of bonus features on offer.

He also seems to be experiencing a rift in time, but it's not until the very end where you find out if it is entirely a product of his mental illness or something else.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A17HPORPGEAFYK	Katie Billias	I highly recommend this film to those who prefer something that is not what it seems, to those who do not judge a book by its cover.This film takes you on a journey through troubled mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who to some &quot;is Toby Mcguires Ungerdog&quot; which I find to be so far from the truth. Jake goes beyond the borders of Mcguire and takes you inside the mind and through a parallel of time travel and theory, all as a highschool student. With the help of a bizzare accident, and a strangely mangled Rabbit Companion only reffered to as...now would I give that away...With a classic soundtrack, lighting and vivid color, camera work (pay note to a particular scene as the camera lingers the highschool halls) and cast of Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, and Patrick Swayze in the mix this film does justice to an eventual classic cult. See for yourself, through the eyes of Donnie Darko.	5.0	Mind Mysterious	2004-05-31	0	0	0

When i first rented Donnie Darko i wasn't sure what to expect. I loved it from beginning to end and went out to purchase the DVD the next day. Even though it was pricey at $.. when it was first released it was a good buy. The DVD is packed with bonus features such as a couple of commentaries, many deleted and extended scenes, trailer, still galleries, etc.Where to begin on just how good this movie is? I'm not quite sure where to begin. The story itself is very original and enagaging. The cast is perfect and there is some marvelous acting throughout the picture. The visuals are simply marvelous, it is a treat for the eyes. The soundtrack is also quite excellent from 1980's pop tunes to droning ambience.This is one movie in which you notice something different every time you watch.

Call me stupid - but I didn't. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride because the plot (basically a story of a boy who is either disturbed or spiritually in tune with time travel and the future)is so engaging. Jake Gyllenhall is dead on perfect as the teenager whose grasp of reality seems to be slipping and who occasionally sees a very spooky looking giant rabbit. The kid is seeing a psychiatrist because his parents are worried not only about his visions but about his past troubles (burning down an abandoned house, etc).What sets this movie apart from other spooky movies is the way the film shows the dark side of high school life. Patrick Swayze, no longer a regular in films, is good as the leader of a cult movement which is more than it appears...and so is its leader. Drew Barrymore is a teacher who wants her students to question their lives and who isn't afraid to confront the principal if she thinks he is wrong. Each character in this film is fresh, original and interesting to watch.And yet...I confess...the ending left me a bit puzzled and feeling left out of the loop. So if you understand it, please, please explain it to me.	4.0	I'll tell you and then YOU tell ME....	2002-04-27	2	0	2

If for nothing else, buy this movie for the score. The music in the film is perfect. It uses just the right mix of lesser-known (but still recognizable) 80s and original music.Whether you'll like Donnie Darko really depends on what sort of movies you like. If your idea of a good movie is something you can sit back and enjoy with a tub of popcorn, then Donnie Darko isn't for you. There is also little (really no) action in Donnie Darko. No car chases, fistfights, or major explosions. If you want a lighthearted comedy, action flick, or sappy drama, this movie will bore you to death.But if you're in the mood to pay close attention and think about everything you're being shown, this is a great movie. Almost all of my friends who saw this immeadiately said ""I need to see this movie again"" because you really can't get it all on the first try.The commentary on the DVD was interesting, but didn't really do much for me in terms of enhancing the storyline."	5.0	Not a popcorn flick	2003-03-10	3	3	0

This movie is the perfect example.I've heard so many different interpretations upon having conversations with friends about this movie.  Just when I think every angle has been covered, someone else comes up with a new perspective.  One friend has even suggested that the whole story can come across possibly from Cherita Chen's point of view because of her silent affection for Donnie and the book in which his name graces the cover.I'm not one for flashing back to the 80's, but this movie reminded me of the good music that came from those years. There is nothing like Echo and the Bunnymen's &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; to get me going.  Hell, every time I hear it now, I automatically think of the movie. Plus, the Bush and Dukakis presidential election debate clip along with the excellent use of Duran Duran's &quot;Notorious&quot; was an added bonus.It's cliched to say this, but this is a movie for people who like to think instead of just soak up pointless plots.  It's not as complicated as some may make it out to be and if this is Kelly's first major project, I can't wait to see what else he's got up his creative sleeve.Great performances.  Great music.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2BD3Q8MWFEI4R	Kent Wall	This is remarkable. Richard Kelly (II) has done something quite unique here. It will stay with you afterwards; figuring out exactly how the plot holds together is not the easiest thing in the world either. Why should it be?Have you ever slept in your bed when suddenly an engine from an airplane crashes through the roof? Have you been inclined to time travel, or to talk through things with some rabbit? Like James Stewart. Have you been frustrated in school, or with how things work out in general? The portrait Jake Gyllenhaal does here is extremely suited for the plot, exact and without ever over-playing his character. He becomes Donnie Darko. Mary McDonnell does the mother, as usual she's very reflective and precise as an actress. She's a success in her troublesome role. Many other roles are equally fascinating - Drew Barrymore, among others. Every character in this movie has something amazing going for them, and they certainly melt together beautifully in the overall context.It's also 113 minutes full of surprises. You will not be able to even guess or have a clue what will happen in the next scene, in the next development... The whole plot will keep you on edge. Enough said.

He's visited in his dreams by a rabbit that tells him of the terrifying  things that he will soon experience. Can he change the future or is he doomed to stand by and watch his nightmares become a reality.Despite having a cast that I don't particularly care for, this movie is awesome. I usually think Jake Gyllenhaal is kind of flat and boring. In this movie he is exactly that. The good news is that his character is very strange. His acting style suits the role perfectly. I'm not really sure why, but I've never liked Drew Barrymore either. Fortunately her role isn't big enough to hurt the film. Patrick Swayze,0 Mary McDonnell, and Jenna Malone also do a great job at their respective roles. This a movie about the future, the past, and most certainly the present. The concept of time traveling through a wormhole is also a major theme here. The soundtrack, the screenplay and the dialogue all come together beautifully to make this one of my favorite all time movies. The story is complex and the movie needs to be watched several times to get everything that is thrown at you. I definitely believe that everyone should see this movie.

Loria	"2001 cult-film ""Donnie Darko"" is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic Slaughterhouse-Five which Billy Pilgrim, becomes unstuck in time. Donnie, a textbook paranoid schizophrenic is ""spared"" when passenger-jet engine inexplicably, drops from the sky onto his bedroom, while he is out sleepwalking with Frank, his macabre bunny-suit wearing ""imaginary"" friend Frank. Darko explores wild variations on Dr. Hawkings theories on time in a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity. The film is loaded with interesting characters and interesting performances by a host of notable names like: Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze (really), Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA), lead by the talented Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, JARHEADS)as the temporally troubled teen.This 2004 Director's Cut includes, the 80's soundtrack reworked as originally intended (with all of the royalties and paperwork completed), also UK Darkomentary, cult shorts and commentary with director Richard Kelly (he made them do it) and comic-book fan Kevin Smith (who wasn't involved but liked the movie).This version is a great film to both disturb and amuse with its multiple genre nature (teen drama/horror/comedy/sci-fi/ etc.)"	4.0	A Brief History of Donnie Darko	2006-03-19	1	1	0

It has a man in a rabbit suit as a main character. However, it is well made, well acted by pretty big names, and very entertaining. As writer/director Richard Kelly's first movie, it had a limited budget of $4,000,000.As mentioned in the commentary, probably more people are listed in the credits than saw it in the theaters. However, it has gained a following (judging by reviewer comments, inclusion on top 10 lists, and Amazon sales rank, etc).I've watched it a couple times with and without commentary.

Well, Donnie Darko rips off two of them:  ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Harvey"".Do you remember the last 15 or 20 minutes of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", when the angel, Clarence, shows George Bailey a horror scenario about what the world would have been like had he never been born?Well, Donnie Darko is exactly like ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Except it takes that 15 or 20 minutes of gloom and stretches it out for 2 hours.  Wow eh?  Really heartwarming stuff.Also, instead of Clarence the angel as Donnie Darko's guide, enter the giant bunny rabbit from Harvey, who instead of speaking plainly, whispers to him cryptically in a creepy nightmarish sort of way.And, at the end of the film...instead of discovering that life is precious, every second of every minute is a gift and that he can touch others through his life...is not alone...etc.  Instead of all of that, what does Donnie learn?  That the world would be better off if he were dead.Wow eh?  So edgy and different huh?Well, actually...tell you the truth...I think the premise sounds pretty dumb.  And the kicker to it all is...the movie doesn't make sense.  Nothing is revealed or disclosed.  Donnie has to die.  Why?  So that it can be gloomy and dark.  But why?  Who knows.  Oh right...he saved the world...by killing a guy for no reason, letting his girlfriend get runover by a car, burning down a house and flooding his school.  Don't worry...it will all make sense in the end...not.And believe it or not...that's what people like about it.  They like that it doesn't make any sense.  Why?  They confuse poor storytelling, and an unnecessarily confusing script as being brilliant and ""deep"".  And then they can go around proving how smart they are that they ""get"" the movie, that it's a masterpiece, etc.A highschool kid is given a quest to die.  The boy is depressed about this...and feels alone in the world...blahblahblah.  Insert some coming up age stuff, family problems...skip ahead, skip ahead...and he kills himself and the world is a better place.Yup...really makes you think...Butterfly Effect was better...even if it lost steam down the stretch and Kutcher was pathetic at times.

It communicates emotional resonance in each glimpse it gives us of the faces of any of its characters.  Hints about what it's about?  What more do you need than The Last Temptation of Christ?I found it deeply moving, a filmic poem as alien to rational thought as is the best work by W.S. Merwin, Wallace Stevens, or even Keats.I guess maybe this review isn't very helpful, but this isn't a popcorn picture.  Rather, it's for one who wants to feel, to be reminded of the immediacy of life, and to believe that one really could change his fate--which is, after all, that each of us will die alone.	4.0	Sad, thoughtful, touching film	2003-01-10	1	0	1

The story is layered, and very open to interpretation, so I'll amend my former statement by saying this: if you want everything to be resolved and clear-cut, perhaps this isn't a movie to impulse buy, but you should still check it out.  The plot is ambiguous, but where the movie really shines is character development.  You will know each of the characters by the end of the film, even the character whose only words are 'Chut up!'  It's a very emotional film, touching on feelings of loneliness, love, compassion, and others.  Slow-moving at times without dragging, and humor is present (plentiful, if you look hard enough) without being juvenile or infringing on the film's integrity.

Hopefully, it will find its more deserved recognition as a sleeper cult film.The subject matter of the decay of middle america, the concepts of mental illness, the stigma of life in parichial towns and the layers effects of time travel and fate carry a beautiful love story and themes of metaphysical growth and triumph.I can't give this film enough praise.

Similar to Night Schylaman's more popular film, 'Sixth Sense', it explores Time Theories in a unique fashion.Donnie Darko is a teen with 'mental problems', (actually, likely more a product of the attempted 'cures'), who begins to see a man dressed in a rabbit suit with a human skull mask for a head.  The rabbit sends him off on adventures of vaguely then increasing destructive behavior.  The first and most destructive mission was a trip to sleep at the golf course where the rabbit informs him that the world would end in less than a month, on Oct. 31th.  While he was gone, a jet engine falls through the roof into his bedroom, thus his absence saves his life.Donnie becomes interested in Time Travel, partially through the rabbit's goadings, and begins to 'see' people's paths as they walk through space and time.This film was a good watch, and well executed given the difficult subject.

It takes a little thought and a bit of understanding of symbolism.  Remember those movies in lit class, where everything meant something?  Donnie Darko is like that.  If you look once too often into your popcorn or tip the coke can more than an instant, you will miss a phrase, or a scene that will allow you to understand something later in the movie.  I read a lot of the 900+ reviews on this site and the low reviews (excepting those directed simply at the Director's Cut version) are due to the viewer being more than a little obtuse. They don't and won't ever ""get it"". The Peanut's comic strip would have too much symbolism for them to understand.  Better they spend the evening watching something they can understand, American Idol, Fear Factor or something loaded with a lot of T&A.;I am 50 years old and love the movie, both versions.  Each had something to give if you looked close enough. The Director's Cut tried to make it more accessible to the general audience by spoon feeding some of the concepts.  I think it is a great movie and could watch it once a week.  It has so many nuances.  No I am not a tree hugging former hippie burnout.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"Most movies fit neatly into one of the categorical drawers in your DVD rack. Each is either a drama, romance, teen, action, mystery, western or some other episode in film genre. ""Donnie Darko"" is simultaneously none of these and a half-dozen of them.Similar to but better than ""Final Destination"", ""Donnie Darko"" is the story of a psychotic high school kid that hallucinates what appears to be a malevolent rabbit that orders bad things to happen. Sometimes Donnie participates in these events and they always affect him.The plot moves eerily in many directions from this premise, at various times approaching science fiction, horror, family drama, teen angst, comedy, adventure and school hijinks. Not all these types are equally well done and the film occasionally loses focus and direction.An all-star cast -- Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, Drew Barrymore as a misunderstood teacher, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom -- lends consistent credibility to this movie, which sometimes goes quite far afield to make its point.The movie is full of surprises you don't expect. The ending is  a cult classic and watch how moralist-weight loss-lifestyle expert Patrick Swayze -- who is cast wayyyy against type -- gets undressed later in the movie by an act of violence that offers an ironically satisfying twist.Make no mistake, ""Donnie Darko"" is not a great film and will never make to the AFI 100. It is ultra-original and nearly impossible to categorize, however, and therein lies its interest.I'm sure this was marketed to teens when it arrived in 2001 but its appeal is far broader; anyone bored with formulaic moviemaking should take in ""Donnie Darko"" to see how near the end of the box film can still move in the era of copycat prequel sequels."	3.0	Impossible to categorize	2006-07-26	4	1	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A22BVT6LZVE13W	Late Reader	"This challenging and though provoking film needs to be seen more than once to really appreciate it. It has many themes and ideas, from teenage angst, to first love, mental illness and theories of time travel. Some of the motifs come straight out of mythology, for example the old witch-like madwoman ho lives as a recluse turning out to be a scientific genius who authors the the book Donnie Darko uses as a guide through the "" tangent dimension"" he is in. The character of Frank dressed as a giant and mysterious rabbit, is no less than a version of the Pooka reminiscent of a 1940s film "" Harvey"" starring James Stewart, a mischievious spirit who takes the form of a giant rabbit. I could not begin to describe the science nor would I want to ruin things for a potential viewer by revealing the end. But I will say that the film is atmospheric, and frightening in places. It is also remorselessly sad with a genuinely tragic ending. Extemely well acted by the entire caste with great cameos by Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys involving themselves intellectually as well as enjoying the sensation of viewing good film."	4.0	SEE MORE THAN ONCE	2009-08-20	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2FHR46E1NF625	LATOYA MOORE	A few months ago, I watched Donnie Darko (the theatrical release) here on Amazon Prime. I cannot get this movie out of my head. This is one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen. I cannot add anything new to this review because most of the other reviews pretty much sum it up. The script is excellent; The music is fantastic (one of my new favorite songs and ringtone is Head over heels by Tears for fears); The acting is also great. Because of the bunny I thought that Donnie Darko was a horror movie and it took me months to get up the nerve to watch it because I don't like horror movies with demonic type stuff. After reading several of the reviews here on Amazon, I concluded that that bunny may look like that but there is more to the bunny than meets the eye (no pun intended. You have to watch the movie to understand what I mean *Smile*) I don't have a full understanding of this movie. I have to watch it again but it is well worth viewing several times over alone and/or with others; definately with the input of your family, friends and associates. I must own this movie!  I feel that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. *I am LC from NC*	5.0	One of my top 3 favorite movies. **I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SEMICOLON BUT I TRIED IN THIS REVIEW.**	2012-12-09	1	0	1

Not to mention the giant metallic rabbit, who, for some strange reason, managed to look ridiculous while frightening simultaniously!The story is as follows: a young man miraculously escapes death when he is drawn away from his bed by a rabbit-like creature, who tells him the world is going to end. While away conversing with this...'being', a jet from an aeroplane falls from the sky and desimates the guy's room.As the film progresses we being to get inside the mind of a man who could be thought as crazy, misunderstood, psychotic, schitzophrenic...who knows? Yet with the help of his girlfriend and a recluse physics teacher, the fate of the world lies in his hands.The film is a non-stop rollar-coaster ride of psychological exploration, romance and fear; which comes to a dramatic climax and an incredibly intelligent end.A superb film, and one which I can't reccomend enough	5.0	Eerily haunting and wonferfully surreal	2004-07-02	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1W0ODR0SK9H4R	LeftManOut	"The first time I saw Donnie Darko almost 3 years ago, I, like a lot of other people, understand very little about what I had just watched. However despite that fact, I was intrigued and extremely drawn to this movie, even though I didn't quite understand what had just happened. Upon multiple viewings of the movie I have more or less come to my own conclusion or meaning about the plot, which like everyone says, will give you something new every time you watch it. That's the beauty of this film, because no two people are going to come to the same conclusion on what the movie is about. With brilliant direction (kudos Richard Kelly), an excellent (an extremely underrated I might add) cast of characters, and a confusing, yet beautiful story, ""Donnie Darko"" is not just another cult film. This is a movie that is timeless.There are very, very few movies that have been able to capture my attention the way Donnie Darko has, and even fewer have prompted me to view the movie multiple times to actually find more and more out about it. However Donnie Darko is one of those films that the first time through, you may not necessarily understand what is going on. To briefly summarize the plot, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal who gives a phenominal performance) is teenager who has had frequent psychological problems in his life recently, and feels alienated from his family and friends. One night Donnie is awakened by Frank, a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit, who instructs Donnie to follow him. Donnie does, and this ends up saving Donnie's life as a jet engine crashes through his roof that night. Frank informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 Minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie then feels like he must obey Frank who makes him do many questionable things, because Frank saved his life. This includes flooding his local high school and burning down the house of a perverted self help guru. Not only that but it appears that Donnie is slipping in and out of multiple realities, leaving you wondering what are hallucinations, and what is really happening. This ultimately leads Donnie into the research of time travel and tangent universes, which becomes one of the most important aspects of the movie. That should give you a basic idea what the movie focuses around. While this might not sound like the most award winning premise, Kelly definitely turns this into one of the must see movies of our generation.There are so many themes and underlying messages running throughout this film, and only upon multiple viewings will you truly discover them all. Like I said one of the best things about this film is that everyone is going to draw something different from it. However Kelly has deliberately made the Donnie character one that everyone can relate to. I can honestly say as a teenager I felt almost exactly like Donnie does in the film, and that makes relating to this movie on different levels so easy. There's also a sense that this alienated teenager is in the end the real hero, despite being looked down upon by his peers and his community. The love story between Donnie and Gretchen is exactly what you would expect it to be like between two teenagers who don't necessarily understand what they are feeling at the time. Part of the charm of this movie is its overwhelming honesty and portrayal of things as they are in real life, not glamoured up for hollywood.Whatever Kelly's intention was when he wrote the movie (which to this day has never been clearly explained), he has made a movie that has touched and connected with a broad audience of people worldwide. It is safe to say that ""Donnie Darko"" isn't just a cult film now, it's a worldwide phenomenon. I promise you will never think about things the same way as you do after viewing this film. I strongly encourage you to see this movie. It is definitely something that will stand out from anything you've ever seen. I still don't feel like I have done this movie justice with my review, but I don't really think any review is capable of doing that. To put it simply, you must see this movie.

It is at times hilarious, to where I couldn't stop laughing, at other points, so sad I cried, and other times it had me shaking my head because it hurt trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.  No matter how many times I watch it, I feel this way.One of the best things in this film is the interplay between Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, it is hilarious to watch them at times, and you can see the chemistry between them.

These people can (...). I've seen films in which a nude man with an S and M mask and dog collar on, with his head in a toilet, discusses how going to houses of domination is the only thing that eases his destructive and homicidal urges... So don't tell me about what truly strange and original films are. I also got a high school diploma at 14, and started going to college at the age of 15.So don't tell me about intelligence. That being said... The first cut of this movie was great. One of my favorite films. But this directors cut is total %$@!. There are almost no extra scenes, and pretty much so every scene they added could be seen on the special features of the original. This was more like Donnie darko with alternative editing techniques , and inferior ones at that. This directors cut just didn't feel as smooth as the first. This is just a scam to get everyone to buy 2 copys of the movie. If you already have a copy of the first don't bother with this, and if you don't have it, pick up a copy of the original. Like I said, Im a big Donnie darko fan, I liked it before it got popular (at least in the U.S), and Im sure I'll still like it once its popularity fades.Hope this review saves some one from waiting their $.	2.0	Donnie darko DIRECTORS CUT	2005-04-11	33	4	29
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1JJ8R0NTMF8DE	Little Old Me	"Hollywood's steady downfall into high-priced visual theatrics and recycled storylines with wittless characters has done nothing good except reestablish my faith in the underdog.  ""Donnie Darko"" in this case, is one of those underdogs - a completely morbid and fulfilling storyline, with dazzling presentation and a cast of amazing actors playing multi-layered characters.The story revolves around the charismatic, wayward teenager, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  This troubled teen is the black sheep of his middle-class family, already having trouble with law for stealing a car and attending psycho-therapy sessions to handle his sleepwalking.  Only after a brief introduction into his life, does the movie immediately dive into the action - in a dream, Donnie is beckoned out of his house by an evil (almost satanic) looking man-sized bunny, Frank.  Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days - the 28th day being Halloween.  Back in reality, a jet-plane engine has fallen from the sky and crashed in Donnie's bedroom - Donnie survives because he had been sleepwalking.  Frank becomes a regular figure in Donnie's dreams and delusions - coercing him to commit random acts of vandalism and arson.  In the meantime, the world around Donnie Darko seems embedded with strange characters, mind-bending encounters and philosphical if not humorously poignant conversations.  Among these are are Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), the self-help guru, his highschool teachers: (Noah Wyle) - who is obsessed with the ideas of time travel - and (Drew Barrymore) who is disillusioned with the education system feeding into Jim Cunnigham , Grandma Death -a prophet of some sorts and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend and another troubled teen, who's mother is hiding out from an abusive ex-husband.  As doomsday approaches, Donnie's visits from Frank the evil bunny become more frequent, as he points out the relivance of time travel in his visits into Donnie's psyche.  Soon, Donnie realizes that many of his encounters with Frank, leave very real impacts on those around him.  (Spoiler:  For instance, Frank tells Donnie to burn down Jim Cunningham's house, that reveals a child pornography ring in his basement).All events and characters lead Donnie down to his final day, where he realizes that certain events have to take place and some people must suffer in order for others to survive.""Donnie Darko"" is magnificant in keeping one's interest, keeping its audience in suspense and sometimes in laughter.  Jake Gyllenhaal does a superb job of playing Donnie as a dark confused teenager in search of understanding and conscious, with the sexiness of Tobey Maguire but with a personality.  The dynamics of family make this story seem very real and close to home, as we are not only drawn to the supernatural, but to the plight of Donnie's mother, who is desperate to guide and understand her son.The basic story, visual effects and music are simple and play well off each other.  However, the much greater story and concept is certainly hard to understand and up for interpretation.  With time travel being a major theme, one might need to watch through the movie two or three times to finally have an idea of what actually happened in what order.  The ending (no spoiler, sorry!) can leave one with the questions: what just happened?... What did he accomplish? But the movie has enough of an impact and plain entertainment value, that I doubt anyone will complain about watching it over again.This movie is superb for a drinking games, Halloween parties or just sitting back and watching one stormy evening.  If you haven't seen it yet - you're missing out.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZEMBYWITAZP0	"Locke Scholar 815 ""h-bomb"""	"Even though I usually only write music reviews on amazon.com, I just felt obligated to say how awesome this movie is.  The acting is superb all around, as is the dialogue, which turns what could have been an over-the-top and ridiculous premise into something believable and somehow strangely familiar.  Set in the fictitious late 1980's suburbia of Middlesex, this film at once stuns you with its accurate portrayal of family and social life in such a locale, and it extends itself beyond the cliched boundaries of typical suburban teen dramadies (for example, Donnie's father is not a complete jerk).  This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, drama, tragedy, suspense, and even comedy into one eclectic yet effective amalgam that grips you from beginning to end.  Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly believable as Donnie, a teen suffering from what seem to either be psychotic hallucinations or ominous visions of a six foot tall rabbit named Frank, who upon their first encounter informs him that the world will end in ""28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds"".  This meeting occurs late one night, when in some sadistically sardonic twist of fate, a jet engine plummets from the sky and lands right on Donnie's room.  Fortunately, he is not there at the time because Frank has drawn him outside, and thus ""saved"" him from what was sure to be an extremely unpleasant demise.  Because of this fact, Donnie feels indebted to his new ""friend,"" and follows any instructions Frank gives him.  This leads to no small amount of trouble in Middlesex, as Donnie becomes increasingly reckless and unstable, much to the dismay of his parents (skillfully played by Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne) and especially his gym teacher Mrs. Farmer, played with an effective amount of self-righteousness and obliviousness by Beth Grant.  The rest of the cast is spectacular as well, especially Noah Wyle as the cautiously helpful Prof. Monnitoff, Drew Barrymore as Donnie's sympathetic English teacher Mrs. Pomeroy, Katharine Ross as Donnie's caring psychiatrist Dr. Thurman, Patrick Swayze as oblivious self-help guru Jim Cunningham, and most of all Jena Malone as Donnie's troubled girlfriend Gretchen Ross, who becomes one of the only things keeping Donnie going.  As the movie progresses, Donnie begins to feel more and more isolated, his only sources of solace being Gretchen and a book given to him by Monnitoff called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" written by Roberta Sparrow, a local recluse whom Donnie and his friends lovingly refer to as ""Grandma Death"".  With the aid of both Monnitoff and Sparrow, Donnie believes he has discovered the secret of time travel.  All of these characters and plots converge on one fateful Halloween night, causing Donnie to finally lose it in one of the films most heartwrenching and chilling scenes.  In the end, Donnie makes an extremely sad, but somehow optimistic decision to, ah, well, you'll just have to see the movie.  Along with all the magnificent elements already defined, this movie features several other things for which I must commend it, the first of which is its soundtrack and score.  Utilizing a combination of popular songs from the 80's and a stellar, beautiful, and melancholy score of instrumental works by composer Michael Andrews, this film is appealing on more than one level, which is more than I can say for many movies.  Another thing which I must take the time to acknowledge is the extremely realistic and effective subplot involving a student named Cherita Chen (played very well by Jolene Purdy) who is teased by her classmates for being overweight and foreign.  This sad scenario is all too real in many schools, and is brought into the spotlight in this movie with a haunting and sorrowful authenticity.  Overall, director Richard Kelly has outdone himself to say the least (especially considering this is his first movie), and one can only hope that he continues to manufacture material of the same caliber as this.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, then by all means do so:  I can honestly say that it is one of the best films I have ever seen.  (NOTE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT: I know there is some debate as to whether the entire movie was real or just Donnie's imagination, and I just have to weigh in on this matter:  The jet engine that crashes through Donnie's room obviously came from the plane his mother and sister were flying in when it ran into the wormhole that manifested when the end of the world was set to occur, so therefore he must have discovered the secret to time travel in order to allow himself to go back and alter the course of time and restart the entire thing.

The acting is superb with excellent turns by Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayse, Maggie Gyllenhall, Katherine Ross, Jenna Malone and Mary McDonell. The music in the film is outstanding since it conveys the feelings and message of the characters.The bonus materials of the DVD is excellent.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A18A5SRFIX8WRF	"L. Reynolds ""Montessori teacher, lover of the..."	Let me first say that I LOVE Donnie Darko.  It's a beautiful, heartfelt movie about a troubled young man who sees a giant (scary) bunny.  This movie caused hours of debate between my friends and I when we first watched it.  The fact that it does leave questions is only a part of why I can watch it again and again.  Let's get to why I gave it only four stars.  The director's cut is flawed.  Richard Kelly added pieces from the Donnie Darko book and other images that break up the movie so it doesn't flow as well.  Also, I like the movie starting with Killing Moon by Echo and the Bunnymen as opposed to Never Tear Us Apart by INXS (which is a great song and it works, but it just throws me off cause I had watched it several times before I saw the director's cut.)  Personally I loved the feeling of things being unexplained, which Kelly tried to fix in the director's cut.  There are some great additions though. One of my favorite additions was a scene where Donnie reads a story he wrote in his English class.  So in conclusion, I recommend the movie whole-heartly, but watch the original version before the director's cut.	4.0	Watch the theatical version first	2012-08-24	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2MJCI3LN93RQI	Luke	I watched the VHS version, so I don't know if there are other clues in the DVD features that I missed, but the key to understanding this film lies in reading the &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; by Roberta Sparrow posted on the Donnie Darko website.  This fictional (i.e. made-up by the movies creators) book states the assumptions that the movie's plot works off of. Specifically, the details of the parallel universe, time travel and the role of people in the parallel universe are explained.  After watching the movie and going through the web site, I watched the movie again and everything made sense.  It went from being &quot;good but confusing&quot; to &quot;brilliant.&quot;  What you come to realize is that everything in the movie, literally almost every conversation, is intimately but subtly linked to another and building to a final outcome.  If you walk away understanding the important role that Drew Barrymore has in the series of events (who at first watch seems insignificant) - which really is no more or no less important than any other character in the grand scheme of things - then it should all make sense.  All of the other themes such as teen alienation, pop culture, etc, provide commentary on the world while at the same time working to advance the plot.  An amazing movie.	5.0	The Web Site is Key	2003-05-12	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ODFNHZF5I7R1	"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go..."""	I wish I could understand in this day and age what exactly it is that makes a cult film. Quite possibly, it could be the following that film has and how rabid they are about the film itself. It's true that Donnie Darko has one of the most intense followings a film could ever ask for. The fans of this film has dissected it from the inside out, trying to explain each and every little facet of the film. Which is cool, if you're into having information spoonfed to you and not really interested in figuring it out for yourself.However, I find that to be the most interesting and entertaining aspect of this film. Nothing is really explained in full, but it's not so vague that it's completely impossible to understand. Richard Kelly wrote a brilliant script, full of true emotion and at times horror, complete with science fiction elements so strange it will be hard to wrap your brain around them if you're not entirely into this kind of film. It certainly is not for the casual viewer.But with the Director's Cut, we get a whole new look at the original Donnie Darko, with over twenty minutes of additional footage and a whole new soundtrack.Before Bubble Boy and Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal established himself as an incredible actor with his portrayal of Donnie Darko. Indeed, it is the acting in this film that makes it so powerful. The interaction between the family, especially Jake and real-life-sister Maggie, and the dinner conversation between the two, makes you believe that these two really are siblings in the context of the film and doesn't feel like just two actors going at each other's throats. Maybe it was just the fact that they grew up together that made it so believable, but I tend to lean more towards the fact that the two were just great actors as it was, and used the influence from their lives together to craft a bond between the two characters. And of course, Jena Malone is fantastic, as she always is, as Gretchen Ross, Donnie's girlfriend and unfortunate victim in the whole scheme of things. But there isn't really a weak actor in this film, they all do excellent in their roles, and it all just seems completely believable.The cinematography is also top notch. For a first time director, Richard Kelly really knows what he's doing and always manage to find the most beautiful and effective shots to emphasize what's going on in the scene. That's what's beautiful about this film- there isn't a shot that is just there to further the movie, every shot is there to increase the impact of what is going on in the story. Even in the simplest shots, there is something special about each one that I rarely see in films.Also with this Director's Cut, Richard Kelly changed the score around, which was hit and miss. Most of the time it was a hit, but I miss hearing Echo and the Bunnymen playing during the opening scene. INXS's Never Tear Us Apart isn't bad, but I remember falling in love with The Killing Moon because of the original cut. Basically, that's my only gripe about the change in score, as everything else works perfectly.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko and want a film that isn't a spoonfed 'here's what's going on' formula, do yourself a favor and see it. If you loved the original cut, chances are you'll love this one too. This is a film every should see at least one time, even if just to say you did.	5.0	Have you ever seen a portal?	2008-12-07	3	3	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AEJ9342SFNLPP	MacFactor	"After seeing the director's cut first and the original version of the movie second, I must say that the director's cut is a far better film. The director's cut has is subtle differences from the original, but they are enough to drive the movie into a different direction. In the original many of the themes are explained in a concluding monologue almost leaving the movie rather transparent. The directors cut is a far more rewarding experience than the original. The director's cut adds much more depth to the plot than in the original. The added depth breeds an even more confusing movie, however if the movie is watched closely (and you will want to watch this movie closely) everything is explained. The original doesn't show the pages of Sparrow's book which introduces the concepts of the ""Manipulated Dead"", the ""Vessel"" and many other elements. The original does contain a spoiler at the end that explains much of the movie. The monologue at the end was wisely removed for the directors cut and the pages of the book were shown. The director's cut also has additional scenes and parts of scenes that were removed from the original movie.While the movie may have achieved a cult following, the soundtrack certainly hasn't. The soundtrack is littered with hidden gems that have started to find their way into the mainstream. Gary Jules' ""Mad World"" is simply brilliant, which was recently used in an Xbox commercial. In fact, the soundtrack to this movie contains all standout tracks. The soundtrack mirrors the movie extremely well, and really embodies the spirit of the movie.The existentialist concepts are thought provoking, prompting my second viewing of the film. The website is just as confusing as the movie. If you haven't visited the movie's website, it's a giant game that gives background information on the movie and even offers an epilogue.Overall it's an excellent movie. The directors cut makes the movie a little bit more confusing, but adds a tremendous amount of depth to the movie that wasn't in the original. However after watching the movie a second time, the true depth and concepts of the movie are revealed and my initial confusing gave way to awe. This is an excellent movie that has been overlooked for a long time. Even if you've seen the original, watch the director's cut, it adds the extra depth to the movie, transforming it from a great movie into a spectacular movie."	5.0	The Director's Cut is far better than the original	2006-12-06	16	12	4

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1PICWXVZHP61T	"Maeve of Tara ""Avid Reader"""	"I had never heard of DONNIE DARKO before, and got it only because I clicked on several recommended lists by the hardy amazon compilers, and then liked the reviews I read.At first, I did not know what to make of this film. The opening scene with Donnie awakening from sleep in the middle of an asphalt road on a misty mountain side, was beautiful, but confusing. Although his bike was lying on the side of the road, when he jumped upon it and began pedaling back home, I figured that he had not been in an accident ... so, was he a sleep walker? And, a bit later on, came the infuriating scene where he called his mom a ""bitch.""Naturally my motherly porcupine hackles rose and I prepared myself to hate this film and write a scathing review.And I will write a review (in my part of the world it's almost midnight now, the bewitching hour), but tomorrow.For now, briefly: this is a good film. Intelligent, intuitive, creative. The teenage Donnie Darko (despite calling his mom a bitch, and of course he deserves a sound trashing for that, especially because his mom as well as his dad are good people) is a likeable character, and soon you find out that he does appreciate his parents, his sisters, even his small picturesque American town. However, he is tormented by hallucinations and is taken medication and undergoing therapy. The way I interpret it, Donnie is deeply sensitive, and a genius as well as a psychic. Yes, he's got too much brains, too much heart, and can see into the future as well. The six foot tall monstrous bunny is his sixth sense which he of course does not recognize as such, and I'll bet many of you will disagree with me. That's OK, though, DONNIE DARKO invites you to make your own assumptions and interpretations.If you want to think, watch this movie. But do watch it sober, no booze or what-nots please during viewing! Its effect is psychedelic enough, and you don't want to miss the nuances.I certainly liked the ending. Though completely unrelated, it reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and Kevin Spacey. And of course there is always the possibility that if we want it strongly enough... we might turn back time to right wrongs... and give our loves ones a second chance ... even if it means to sacrifice ourselves....Parents, this is a good film you could watch with your teens.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1FCC15BJD2EDR	MAGA	"This is without a doubt the best film I saw this past year. Now, that might not seem like great praise in such a weak year, however it was meant to be. This film is hard to describe, because there is so much going on. Part drama, part science fiction, part romance, part horror and part comedy. A very ambitious project and you cannot help but respect that.The story centers around a very intelligent high school student named Donnie Darko. Donnie has what is described as ""intimidating intelligence"" and borderline schizophrenia. One night, Donny is summoned outside by a demonic rabbit. Later that night, an engine drops off of a jet and lands in Donnie's room. Had Donny been there, he would have been dead. Was he destined to die that night? The rabbit continues to visit Donny and give him instructions. Donny senses that his life is taking on dramatic changes. Donny starts to question fate and freewill. Was he destined to die that night or is there no such thing as fate? Is the rabbit real? Is he in fact going mad? Will the world end, like the rabbit tells him it will? I think that by trying to describe this film, I will confuse you, so I will stop. However, I will conclude by saying that this film ranks right up there with the best film debuts ever. The writing is intelligent and the direction expert. The film will challenge you to expand your mind and will stay with you for a long time. I think the film was marketed rather poorly. This is not ""Final Destination,"" but more like ""Memento."" It also has a great soundtrack! Do yourself a favor and watch this film, do yourself a bigger favor and watch it twice, it will help."	5.0	Brilliant Film!	2002-04-03	3	3	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I probably don't have to say this is a very weird movie, but the movie defies description on so many levels that I didn't know any other way to segue into my review. What can you say about a movie whose themes range from teenage angst, mental illness and the perhaps fragile split between reality and fantasy, to science fiction themes like time travel, to the existence of capricious violence and random evil in the world (such as when the jet engine slams into the house), to the more mundane relationships between the characters in the movie. The film effortlessly and seamlessly combines these disparate and bizarre elements into a single whole, resulting in a very unusual and rivetting film that as I said, almost defies description. I suspect it will become a cult classic of the genre although this is one movie that will be hard to beat and really belongs in a class by itself.	4.0	A few comments	2005-04-27	4	3	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	Let me first get this part out of the way.  This movie has moments of absolute cinematic brilliance.  But, I wouldn't leave it at that.  Calling this a great film would lead to a lot of disappointment because it has some serious flaws, not the least of which are plot contrivances that simply don't work.  It is as if the writers wanted to squeeze too many ideas into a single film, and then couldn't intelligently wrap up the many loose ends.  The film's ideas are oftentimes terrific, but they pull the viewer in too many different directions and end with a far more &quot;conventional&quot; and unsatisfying conclusion for all the effective build-up.What I liked most about the film was its ability to depict a nuanced view of psychosis.  It is perhaps the best cinematic portrayal of a schizophrenic mind that I've ever seen, and in some ways reminded me of Polanski's &quot;Repulsion.&quot;  Unfortunately, rather than playing to this strength, the movie then attempts to &quot;explain&quot; the psychotic state through a somewhat silly &quot;Carlos Castaneda&quot; explanation of secret knowledge, emanations from the solar plexus, time travel, and extradimensional physics.  The lovely ambiguities of the first three-quarters of the film melt away into time-looping conventionality, with a lot of inexplicable throwaway issues.  (The burning down of the &quot;positive thinking&quot; guru's house is a good example.  We're never given any clues as to why the future is informing the present about his involvement in a child pornagraphy ring--and directing him to burn the house down.  Kept more ambiguous, the event would have had far greater and more interesting significance.)With the exception of Drew Barrymore, the performances are top knotch.  Barrymore comes across as a not very bright person overacting and just catching a superficial layer of her character--a character that seems to be a bit of a throwaway in any event.  I think Jake Gyllenhaal is someone to watch.Get this DVD, and think of it as a first draft by an extremely talented novelist.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AW2IQNWLNTUIT	Marc Horn	Donnie Darko can be viewed as a brilliant reinterpretation of Frank Capra's classic film: It's a Wonderful Life, since its basic theme appears to be the effect each of our lives has on society. In Donnie Darko a young and highly intelligent teenager has found a way to move forward in time so that he can experience his future and decide if he should take actions to change it... As Donnie projects himself toward a propitious date another young man of approximately college age is traveling backward through time to connect with the inquisitive Donnie; Frank (Capra:) having already experienced a pivotal event which involved Donnie's future contacts the teenager and begins to manipulate the sensitive young man in ways that appear designed to resolve issues from Frank's past. One of these is exposing the true nature of a public icon who may have molested Frank when he was a little child. Although the creators of Donnie Darko may have based their story on the theories of quantum physics they seem to have also included Newton's Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Donnie and Frank's travel's through the fabric of existence causes a catastrophic rift in the energy surrounding them. It is at the point that their world seems to becoming apart that Donnie must make the same decision the protagonist in It's a Wonderful Life is faced with: would the world be better off with him alive or dead?In addition to the complex and thought provoking plot, the actors play their parts very well on a stage of superbly crafted backdrops that serve to portray an idyllic suburban milieu that is perhaps only a veneer of normality. This is one of those rare films that seems to touch the universal consciousness...	5.0	It's a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra)	2005-12-09	4	4	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	This is a nearly unclassifiable film.  You could call it noir occult with more than a dash of science fiction and wry social commentary thrown in for leavening.  I tend to thing of it as a Gnostic restatement of 'Back to the Future.'  But the truth is that it is in its own little world of creativity and spookiness.  What director Richard Kelly has done is taken the story of a mildly psychotic teenager caught in someone else's cycle of guilt and expiation and turned it into something that deserves cult film status if nothing else.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is our semi-psychotic hero.  His insanity sets him apart in the religious sense, making him liable to insights and visions which are crazy by our standards, but pierce one of reality's veils in an almost prophetic way.  When a jet motor comes out of nowhere to crash on his bedroom, from which he has been lured by an evil rabbit time becomes the crisis of Donnie's existence.  Mumbling old women whisper to him and a teacher passes him a secret text in a darkened classroom.  The book 'The Philosophy of Time' is Donnie's only guide in a building whirlwind of events.Donnie is surrounded by a family almost as odd as he is, a psychiatrist determined to drug him into sanity, a kiddie porn maker who does motivational speaking on the side, and a love interest (Jena Malone) that lays the groundwork for a stunning conclusion.  Gyllenhaal's performance captures the inner discontinuities of a character whose world alternates clarity with hallucination, leaving us to wonder what is real and what is inadvertent juxtaposition.As a film, Donnie Darko is as deep as you want to take it in a range between pure spookiness and metaphysics.  By the time I hit the closing credits I found it hard to believe that a modern director would take the risks that Kelly did with this film, and very glad that the risks were taken.  There is a lot of fine detail in the settings and scene action that only gradually sink in.  This was a much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.By all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.  Stay to watch it a few times and you will find it eerily optimistic despite the tragic thrust of its central story.  In the end you may very well feel as happily perplexed as I did.	5.0	"""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"""	2005-04-24	7	6	1

I felt there were characters in this movie which did not pertain to the main story line and added little to the plot. It took me three days to watch this film. Althought some parts of it were amusing, and interesting, I overall thought it a dull movie and not worth the time or the money I spent to rent it. And watch it TWICE??!!???

Imagine a world that you aren't supposed to be in, then imagine receiving all of these clues that you don't understand telling you so, and all of the repercussions that your very existence can have.Once you try to put that together throw in a scary looking giant rabbit, a child porn king, your little sister's dance competition, and a turbine jet engine falling out of the sky.If you can even begin to stitch how these all fit together then you will begin to understand Donnie Darko as a film. If you can begin to understand the film you may begin to peel it back again layer by layer and see how much more the movie says about the human psyche and how we all interact and relate to one another and how everything we do has some rebound effect somewhere else.It makes you think. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because you really do have to watch it so many times to understand everything that is going on, and in the end I don't think the director wants you to.

What other movie would actually have Joy Division's &#34;Love will tear us apart&#34;?I'm sure the other reviews out there over the last decade+ cover all the merits of the movie, but I'd like to focus on what the movie made me feel.  The movie brilliantly drew me into the main character.  He's part superhero, and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the world, or maybe just the world most closely connected to him.The movie draws you in with the haunting soundtrack (which I highly recommend for insomniac's who like closing their eyes :-) ).  The score and the song selections are fitting and revealing.  What is most amazing to me is how out of their element so many well known actors and actresses are:  Drew Barrymore, Noah Wile, Jake Gyllenhall, Patrick Swayze, etc.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3PDTNA99EXEHG	Mathew A McCrea	"It is always sad to see and hear of such original movies that never get their shot on the big screen. Somehow being robbed of their grand vision. Donnie Darko is another one of those victims. I had read and seen many trailers and previews for this film but never got to see it. Much to my surprise it popped up on dvd this past week. I bought it straightaway. What an unexpected, mind-bending treasure this has turned out to be! First of all, the trailers I saw (which are included on the dvd) were misleading. It seemed as if it was a typical slash and stab flick. Far from it, I say! Part American Beouty, part eighties teen drama, part dark comedy. This movie has it all. Jake Gyllenhall is brilliant as the troubled title character. With the slightest smile or frown the scene goes from childlike fascination to mischevious malevolence. The entire cast was perfect, and I hope that this movie gets more of a following now that its out everywhere. If you saw it in theatres, check out the dvd. The deleted scenes are so amazing, they really unravel the story for you. If you ever wondered if there was something wrong with you, or if you were broken, watch this movie.

The interesting thing about the story is that the more you look into it, the less you see these things, and the more you realize the paradox of the story. It will leave you with many a question.

I own the original and have watched it a lot, but this was like watching a completely different film.  I won't describe all the changes, but now the film plays out very differently; it is slower, more unsettling, and explains some things that didn't really make sense in the original.  The film still (wisely) doesn't explain itself completely, but watching this there were a couple different moments when I suddenly thought ""Oh, that's what was going on!""  If you are a fan of the original you'll almost certainly like this version more, but if you've never seen either versions you should probably see the original first...watching this is kind of like watching one of the LOTR extended versions; more information is given and allows for a greater appreciation of this film.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	I have read several reviews that said that &quot;Donnie Darko' is difficult to classify; indeed, it is composed of an exotic blend of sci-fi, horror, teen angst, and comedy, all seasoned with bits of physics and philosopy, While not a perfectly realized film, it is the kind of movie that many people, myself included, wish there were more of. These are ones that pose challenging or interesting questions, then ususally leave it up to the viewer to come up with answers. Often, there are no real answers, of course, but the thought process is definately stimulated. I appreciate that. I suppose that &quot;Donnie Darko' is best recommended to people who do not like pat answers.This is the story of a boy who is suffering from some major mental problems. He hallucinates, often seeing a hideous, man-sized bunny rabbit which commands him to commit all sorts of anti-social acts. He thinks he can see a sort of time travel path leading people on to whatever is next in store for them. He believes the world is about to end. Is Donnie insane, or has he stumbled upon some truith about existence? Is he a victim of the American upper-middle class lifestyle, one which truly does have some 'Alice Through the Looking-glass' elements to it, or is he more highly evolved than those around him? Did the world, in fact, end, as Donnie foresaw? An Edgar Allen Poe quote came to mind near the film's end: &quot;Perchance everything we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.'What I can't describe here are the visuals, which are fascinating. Perhaps it was just my imagination, but it seemed as if every scene had a slight dream-like quality to it, implying that everything I was seeing could be either a memory or a fantasy about some future event.Richard Kelly has the right stuff to become a major new force in movies. I have been convinced of Jake Gyllenhall's tremendous acting skills since 'October Sky', another highly recommended movie.NOTE: I gave 'Danny Darko' four stars. My real rating is 4 1/2. I had a problem with the path and development of one character [Roberta Sparrow], and this prevented my giving it 5 stars.	4.0	Intriguing, original first film by Richard Kelly	2002-03-31	9	6	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1XPL7K30Z8VXD	Matthew Lanka	"Director: Richard KellyWriter: Richard KellyStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah WyleDonnie Darko has become a modern cult classic. It is Richard Kelly's masterpiece (at least from a screen writing perspective), and easily Jake Gyllenhaal's most famous role.The movie follows troubled teenager Donnie Darko's experiences in the weeks after a jet engine falls from a phantom plane and crashes into his room while he is out for the night. He then begins to have some odd visions and out of body experiences. He starts experiencing the world, or rather the universe, in a very different way.For me, this movie blends many different concepts into one bizarre, very visual, sometimes disturbing, and occasionally hilarious creation. It is a tale of existential philosophy and interdimensional time travel, full of paradoxes, and has some intense, deep meanings if you care to dig enough (and see it more than once).With the major exeptions of Jena Malone's character and Gyllenhaal's masterful performance (only his second lead role, after 1999's October Sky), the acting and directing are nothing special. The set and costume design evoke something of a Stepford Wives or Edward Scissorhands visual vibe. They both compliment this idea of a very dark story taking place in a ""perfect"" suburban setting. However, the real reason to watch this movie is for the story and the evolution of Gyllenhaal's character into something metaphysically aware, and possibly posthuman.Final Score: 7/10"	4.0	Review: Donnie Darko (2001)	2009-10-04	3	1	2

I thought I'd rent it, since it seemed to have a loyal following.The story, in a nutshell, is about a troubled teen (Donnie) who has visions of a rabbit who tells him the world will end.The film, written and directed by Richard Kelly, captures the high school angst that I remember so well.  Kelly is young, and some of the film's themes are executed a bit heavy-handedly, but  the heart of the film is constant.  The time travel aspect of Kelly's script was a bit confusing -- I admit, though, that DONNIE DARKO probably requires a few viewings as there are themes and story points that make more sense after repeated viewings.DARKO's cast is really incredible.  What a potpourri of talent!  Mary McDonnell is soooooo good. Katharine Ross (THE GRADUATE, BUTCH CASSIDY) is a welcomed presence as Donnie's therapist.  Patrick Swayze (!) is great as a guru with a secret.  Drew Barrymore (who produced DARKO) stretches herself as a liberal teacher at Donnie's school. Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie, is really wonderful.  He's tortured and sensitive.The DVD looks great and the bonus stuff is kinda cool - especially when you can view pages from the Time Travel book!	3.0	Dark DARKO	2003-04-21	4	0	4

Not saying this one does that, but I just thought I should share that.  This movie's pretty cool though.  In the ever popular manner, the main character realizes he  will be the one to save the world, but he has to sacrifice himself to save the rest.  Sound familiar?  Jesus Christ, anyone?  Whatever.  It still makes for a good story.  I would personally like to attribute this movie with the whole '80s is cool' thing.  Because in my mind it started with all the 'cool kids' and we all know they liked this movie.  The 80s sucked.  And they still do.  The music was terrible, the politics were even worse.  Fashion, art, color schemes.  Everything was terrible.  I'll thank this movie next time I'm wearing my neon green tank top with shredded acid wash nut huggers, listening to Motley Crue, and reading that privitization is the answer to all of the world's problems.  Supply side economics only works if you cut spending, douchebags.  But aside from that abomination, it's one of my favorite movies.	4.0	not too shabby	2006-01-13	8	1	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AFJCOP0GKZH6C	M. B. Trapp	Richard Kelly is a twisted genius. Watching Donnie Darko is akin to having your brain pulled out of your head and stretched out like a rubber band. It is depressing and exhilarating, offensive and poetic, all at the same time. If you are only a casual moviegoer, do not watch this movie. If you are offended by vulgar language, do not watch this movie, as it has a lot of it, which seemed quite unnecessary to tell the story. But if you can get past that fact and the fact that this movie may well leave you feeling like your life is meaningless, by all means go ahead. It is essentially a sci-fi tale about time travel, but it takes a while before the viewer can actually figure that out. To many people it doesn't make much sense, and I had to read a few online explanations before I really understood it. At the very least I can say that Donnie Darko is original cinematic storytelling, even if I'm quite sure I never want to partake in this particular story again.	4.0	An interesting mind-bender, now a cult classic ...	2005-11-02	4	4	0

Well, a problem for some anyway.It's a scifi story in that it deals with time-travel, but not the ""what will happen when"" kind. It's a very very dark psychological drama too.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3DBHO9ZN7GXZI	m-chan	"My rating and the following refers specifically to the Director's Cut. I would rate the original theatrical release five stars.This director's cut brought to mind William Faulkner's line about writers often having to ""kill their darlings"" in order to meet the demands of a work's wholeness and integrity. Evidently, Richard Kelly was forced to kill his darlings with the theatrical release, and the result was close to perfection, if not perfection itself. The film's emotional force was stunning; its mysteries challenging; its pace so good that hitting pause to get more popcorn was impossible to do; its soundtrack (to my mind) a tour de force. It worked terrifically as a film experience, being a beautiful ""whole"" work of art. Extras that included Roberta Sparrow's book were great ... who really wanted to read the book during the movie anyways? (Which we can now do in the DC.)Which does not mean a director's cut had no hope of working. Or even, maybe, revisions to the soundtrack (although I really think that was touchy business better left untouched). There were some good scenes deleted from the original, mainly between family members, and they didn't seem major pace-cutters. Fortunately, we do get those scenes here, but we also get the overwhelming force of the director's enthusiasm ... and WAY too much embedded detail of his personal vision.On the upside, there's a nifty freedom to that enthusiasm which translates well into the Darko world IF you are also enthusiastic and into ""playing"" with Darko. In other words, if you love Donnie Darko already, you may find this cut a lot of fun. The pacing's completely blown, and the ending comes across flat compared to the original. (Kelly gets too detailed and baroque at the end, thus the impact of the ""Mad World"" music montage--don't want to include spoilers--and last scene is severely undermined.) Yet it's great to have more Darko, however we have to get it. And I don't regret buying this.But if you've never seen the original DVD release, I cannot recommend this DVD set to you over that one. You will probably wonder why a cult ever built up around this film ... what anyone saw in it. You'll be missing that visceral power and compelling wonder that makes movies great and leaves you wanting to see a movie again ... immediately, if possible.Donnie Darko was a little miracle of a film that cast a huge shadow. The director's cut joins many other films that try for bigness and achieve little ... unless, of course, in Darko's case, you've already seen the light and are into shadow-play."	3.0	Sometimes less is a lot more ...	2005-02-20	115	101	14
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3IRAQ780H0FMB	"M. Dillard ""Fulleyes"""	&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a dark and intrigueing film from first time writer/director Richard Kelly.  The film is about a troubled teenage boy, named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal), that receives visits from a creature that looks like a giant rabbit.  This creature takes Donnie on sleepwalking experiences, and ends up making him do some things he most likely would not have done otherwise.  The creature also relays to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days or so. Donnie has a caring family, however they don't seem very protective at all.  The parents allow the children to curse without ever really getting mad at all.  Then one night, while Donnie is sleepwalking, a 747 jet engine falls through the roof of his bedroom.  The FBI investigates the incident, but finds no answer to where the engine came from.  Donnie also has a psychiatrist(Katherine Ross), who uses hypnosis on Donnie to understand his thoughts, and his actions.The film then goes on an original, invilving path, that makes the viewer anxious to find out what will happen to it's characters.  Richard Kelly plays fair in allowing little clues here and the as to what will happen later in the film, though I highly doubt much of anyone will be able to figure out before hand what will happen.  Kelly shows talent here, and demonstrates that he can write one heck of a good screenplay.The ending to &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; I will not say, but I would like to say that this is no where near a straight forward ending, and even repeated viewings may not solve the puzzle.&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; has a great young cast.  It features of course Jake Gyllenhaal, who shows some real talent here, and also shows that he is one of the stars of the future.  Also showing talent is Jake sister in real life, and in the film Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She has an odd, mysterious look to her, but shows she has an ability to act, and is leading lady material.  However, my favorite of the bunch is Jena Malone, who plays Donnie's girlfriend.  She has been in earlier films such as &quot;Stepmom&quot; and &quot;Cheaters&quot;, but here she looks beautiful, and gives a beautiful performance.  &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a great film, and will have viewers talking, and watching again.	5.0	Dark, Intriguing, and one of the best of 2001	2003-06-20	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2OY8SSESOVKGL	medical student	"Growing up is difficult, especially for Donnie Darko. Set in Middlesex, New Jersey in October 1988, this film revolves around a pubescent boy who wakes up one night to find himself hearing a voice (belonging to a giant bunny rabbit) which guides him out of his house. Having slept on a golf course he returns the next morning only to discover that a 747 jet engine has crashed directly into his room. He has, in effect cheated death. Donnie realises that he has 28 days 6hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds before something terribly important will happen and the only guide he seems to have is this imaginary friend, the rabbit.Sound like its going to get confusing? Trust me it does, right up until you see the end credits at which point you will no doubt ask yourself what the hell just happened, and find very little in the way of answers. If you do, however manage to work this film out, you will undoubtedly understand why this is the cult film of the year.So what is this film about? Well, that's surprisingly hard to answer; script writer & director Richard Kelly himself has said that it can be pretentious and condescending to an audience to say that his film is about a certain subject. You might say that it was about fear and love, although Donnie would argue that nothing is ever that simple. I think it is about a whole host of things, not least love, time-travel, divine intervention and of course, growing up.For those that do not know, this film was actually due to be released in October 2001, but because of the terrorist attacks in New York and the potentially inflammatory subject matter of the first 10 minutes of this film, it became `aviationally challenged' and when it finally did reach US cinemas, following the air crash in the Queens district, it predictably failed miserably. When it became available on US DVD though, it did very well, owing its success both to film critics & word of mouth publicity from great numbers of avid fans.Darko was made on a budget of around $4 million, but still Kelly managed to pull together one of the hottest upcoming casts seen in a film for a long time. Heard of Jake Gyllenhaal? His acting as Donnie is first rate & you can expect to see a whole lot more of him over the years. Drew Barrymore plays a somewhat unique teacher and her talent & above all reputation & influence is clearly just what this film needed. As an executive producer she is said to have provided much of the required foreign investment, as well as smoothing out a potentially disastrous legal battle between themselves & the creators of Smirfs, regarding comments over their possible sexual preferences. The most unexpected performance though is that brought by Patrick Swayze as the very dodgy self-help guru Jim Cunningham (not entirely dissimilar to Mr Jack Russell who recently spoke to the L6), best known for his book ""Cunning visions of love"". This film really kills Swayze's image, whatever it might have been, which makes this film all the more refreshing to watch.Donnie Darko is a film which I strongly recommend watching, if only because its innovation & style mean that in the future many references will be made to it. The only area of this film that is possibly up for criticism is the ending, which many will find too irritatingly open-ended & plain difficult to work out. It is a film that will stay in the back of your mind for as long as it takes you to piece the puzzle together, but its well worth the wait.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ADTUS88NFTW23	"Melkor ""dark lord"""	"I am a little torn on the ""Donnie Darko Director's Cut"".  The differences from the Theatrical Cut in presentation are subtle, and the differences in character are grand.I really enjoy the Theatrical Cut.  I think it leaves so much to the imagination that the impact of the film is felt greater.  At the San Diego Comic Con, Richard Kelly told the audience how the Director's Cut came about.  ""Donnie Darko"" never got it's fair shake when it was first released.  This was probably due to the film being released soon after 9-11, when people (quite understandably) were not in the mood to see a dark movie about plane parts falling from the sky and the end of a world.When the film did surprisingly well on home DVD release, the studio allowed Kelly to add in a few things that he had always wanted to, in order to give them an excuse to release the movie theatrically again and give it another chance.  This was very good on the studio's part (unfortunately, they didn't market it very well on it's second release).  Anyway, now we have this new version.I was set off by the new opening.  Don't worry, there are no big spoilers here.  The only difference in the new opening is the music.  Richard Kelly said that the opening was designed to go with ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS, and I can see that; but it works SO WELL with Echo and the Bunnymen's ""Killing Moon"".  Now that INXS would finally sell them the rights for the new release, I can see why they used it.  It still seems odd, though, since I'm used to (and prefer) the other song.After that initial startling change, I settled into this new version of the movie.  I did enjoy the further interaction between the members of Donnie's family.  I think that added a lot to the film.  I'm on the fence about the additions with the explanations of the book and time travel.  I think, sometimes, not knowing details can be better.  Sometimes the audience's imagination can be much more impressive than the film maker's.  Not completely understanding the Theatrical Cut when I first watched it is one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed about it.I'd write more, but I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it.  Even though they are 90% the same, these two films feel like very different movies.  It's one of those rare films where I'm going to own both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.  I've done this with The Exorcist, Legend, Brazil, Army of Darkness, and maybe a few other movies where both versions have left me with very distinct feelings, and different things to think about.  If you have never seen ""Donnie Darko"", I think you might want to start with the Theatrical Cut.  After that, if you are confused or simply want more of this great movie, then watch the Director's Cut."	5.0	Director's Cut Review	2005-02-16	8	6	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AO8SL8T5I5VPM	MGB	"First I would like to say that this review is more targeted at the Blu-Ray transfer of this movie. When I first found out this movie was available on Blu-Ray I had to have it since it's one of my favorite movies. I already owned the DVD, and was happy with the quality of the video on my up-converting DVD player. I figured the Blu-Ray would have to look better since it advertised as HD 1080p. Unfortunately that was not the case; in fact the DVD looks better up-converted than the Blu-Ray does. How does that happen? It appears the studio did very little to prepare this film for Blu-Ray. If anything they made it worse by trying to doctor it up rather than spend the money to re-master it properly. The movie has a lot of dark scenes which are almost all grainy and not very detailed. The light scenes are not as noticeable but you can still see it unless you're sitting a good distance from your TV. I guess the point I'm trying to make would be to hang on to your DVD until they fix the Blu-Ray transfer. At the new price it's worth buying if you don't already have the DVD, but don't ""up grade"" to this from your DVD."	3.0	Awesome Movie - Transfer to Blu-Ray Not So Good.	2009-12-01	148	133	15
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1ZZUFS33RVY3T	M.	I just watched this movie for the second time with my mother, we wanted to watch something original. I agree with my husband that there aren't many good films out there like there used to be. Donnie Darko, has it all, a great 80's feel with great cinematography, great acting, dialog, and story line. Were his meds. making Darko hallucinate it all? Was he a Super Hero? Was there divine intervention? Any of those questions and any other questions is left up to the viewer to decide. I like some of the 'irony' in the film, for instance the movie theatre featuring The Last Temptation of Christ and The Evil Dead. Overall I think it's worth watching however the end of the movie makes me feel a tad empty, it reminds me of It's a Wonderful Life, only with the opposite results. I wonder if that's a good message to send? It does put a damper on the film for me but I can't bypass the other great attributes the picture has to offer, hence the 4 star rating.	4.0	Thought provoking	2013-08-03	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZQ990AWKIO8W	Michael A. Nelson	A film we'll be trying to figure out for years to come.  A cult classic that was never going to find a mass audience.  Even if the filmmaker has taken some missteps since, this is a near perfect film.  Love the 80s setting and soundtrack, love the wacky rabbit and time travel, love the high school parts (more honest than moist HS films), love the actors and their characters.  What's happened to Jena Malone and where was she when I was in HS?  Anyway, highly recommended.	5.0	mondo bizarro	2012-10-19	1	0	1

Brewster ""Brewster"""	"95% of the people reviewing this movie are either drooling over it to put themselves above the fray or bashing it to put themselves above the fray. Ignore those people.Donnie Darko is a movie about the alienating and contradictory forces that act upon people in our modern world. Though many would write it off as a teen angst movie because the protagonist is a high school student, the movie shows that the same forces which alienate teenagers are acting on the adults and authority figures as well. That said, many of the people giving this movie five-star ratings are not worth listening to either. Here's the deal:Excellent plot, acting, cinematography, dialogue, and musical score.That's all I had to say. I figured this movie could use an endorsement from somebody who isn't crusading against ""hollywood crap"" or bashing this movie as ""pretentious teen drama.""

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A137LMB12RJU1Y	Michael Fondi	When talk of a director's cut for one of my favorite movies in recent history was buzzing around, I admit that I was quite excited.  Especially by the prospect of seeing Donnie Darko in a theater.  However, the theatrical release of the director's cut was short lived and only found its way into certain (two, maybe?) cities.  So like most everyone else, I had to rent this version.Be warned that this version is inferior to the original theatrical realease of Donnie Darko.  All of the fun of piecing the movie together thru repeated viewings and trips to donniedarko.com was sucked out of this release.  Some of the music was changed (some new pieces added, some old ones taken away), some pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel were added in at differnt points of the film (here is where the fun sucking started) and something happened to the sound mix.  The original version had an aura of mystique around it; hard to explain, but as you watched you found yourself entirely focused on the dialogue.  This is not the case anymore with the director's cut.  It sounds as if there is too much noise going on.In any case, don't spend your money on this product.  I'd recommend picking up the original version, which is a five star film.  After a few viewings, head on over to the website and see what you can see.	2.0	Inferior to the Theatrical Version	2005-12-15	15	14	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3O75PJL7R0Q4U	Michael from NY	When I first watched this movie, I really wasn't sure where it was going.  But movies that make you ask questions are usually the ones that turn out to be the best.  It's funny, it's sad, it's wierd, it's worth it.  When I first saw this movie, it was when I bought it on DVD and I do not regret buying it.  I don't want to spoil the plot so I won't get into it. As a DVD I think it is great also.  They offer the video to Gary Jule's remake of Tears for Fears &quot;Mad and World&quot;  and not only is it a great remake but a great video.  The deleted scenes are very good also, though I would watch it with the commentary first then without it because when the commentary is on you can't really hear the dialogue.  It also gives you a list of the actors and crews past works and gives you some ideas of other movies to see.  On the back of the DVD it compares the movie to Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  It really isn't like either of those movies except for a topic or two related to Donnie Darko.  Even if you don't buy it, at least go out and rent it.	5.0	Very Different, but Very Good	2003-05-04	2	2	0

I thought the plot was good and how it made you think he was still going on with his life, but in truth he was have a vision of what would happen if he happened to break away from what was destined for him. The only thing that truely confused me was with the plane when it did loose its engine. I also like the effects, like how it showed those things coming out of them and how that was where they were supposed to go and how frank showed him that in the end (if he did break away from what was destined for him) that he was supposed to kill him.	5.0	Mad World	2004-06-24	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	How to describe &quot;Donnie Darko,&quot; the dark psychological drama written and directed by Richard Kelly? After seeing it I thought of the film as a sort of &quot;Ordinary People&quot; meets &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; with a touch of &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; thrown in. But ultimately that equation is unfair; &quot;Donnie&quot; is, in the end, a true original.The film takes place in 1988. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character: a troubled, sleepwalking teenager who has recurring, frightening visions. Donnie is a quest to understand the forces that are affecting his life and sanity.Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance helps to hold the film together. He is a quirky, offbeat leading man; at times frightening, at times appealingly vulnerable. Gyllenhaal's work is superbly complemented by that of an eclectic ensemble cast which includes Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle. I was particularly impressed by Patrick Swayze's turn as a creepy, oily motivational speaker.&quot;Donnie&quot; defies genre classification. It blends together elements of serious family drama, 80s period piece, horror, satire, and science fiction. In a sense, it is a deconstruction of the whole 80s teen movie genre. The script makes intriguing use of 80s pop culture.&quot;Donnie&quot; has scenes of weirdness and absurdity, and is often punctuated by bizarre dialogue and strange, frightening imagery. And there are some really moving scenes that tap into the universal experience of human loneliness and the need for love. If there was ever a movie that had all the elements to make it a cult classic, it's the haunting &quot;Donnie Darko.&quot;	5.0	Gyllenhaal is outstanding in this haunting film	2002-05-28	19	18	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	Donnie Darko is one of those movies you've always heard about but never saw.  Here's why:Donnie Darko is about a young man in high school who sleepwalks at night, just in time to avoid a jet engine smashing through his bedroom.Right around September 11, 2001.So Donnie Darko, like the titular character of the same name, disappeared with nary a trace.  Fortunately, we now have a DVD version and there will be a new theatrical re-release of a director's cut of the film in July, 2004. Perhaps Donnie will still get his day.Donnie Darko is about the Darko family.  They're an average family, with an older sister heading for college (Elizabeth, played by Jake's real life sister Maggie), a cute-as-a-button younger sister (Samantha, played by Daveigh Chase), a white-collar mom and dad (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne), and then there's Donnie.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie as an alternately awkward, exhausted, strung out teenager who exhibits brief flashes of rage at the inanity of modern life.  Donnie also suffers from a troubled past, a past that requires him to see a therapist and take medication.Donnie's life is a textbook troubled soul on the road to nowhere.  We could easily see him committing suicide, getting involved in drugs, getting some girl pregnant, maybe joining a gang, or even shooting up his school.  All's the pity, because Donnie is also extremely bright and has a piercing wit that embarrasses adults.All that changes when Frank shows up.  Who's Frank, you ask?  Why, Frank's a deranged bunny rabbit.That's a simplification, of course.  To be precise, Frank is a deranged being in a bunny rabbit suit.  The distinction matters.In fact, in Donnie Darko, EVERYTHING matters.  Every word, every nuance, like an Edgar Allen Poe poem, has significance and meaning.  Ironically, the director and writer, Richard Kelly, feels the movie has only one interpretation as a science fiction story.  In spite of himself, Kelly has created a movie that alternately weeps at the desperate loneliness of so many humans living next to each other and exults in the sheer joy of existence.Frank whispers suggestions to Donnie, things that, at least on the surface, seem like very bad things to do.  Donnie, in his sleepwalking, always performs these acts of vandalism.  And each time, Frank tells Donnie how much he has left before the world ends.  He starts the film with 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Screen shots remind us that the end of the world is coming in a manner similar to The Ring (which came out in 2002, one year after Donnie Darko).Reality lurks in the background.  No one can explain where the jet engine came from.  Government agents shadow Donnie's every step.  In the mean time, town life goes on: Samantha's dance group gets discovered by an agent, a self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze) spreads his mind-numbing spiritual pap, a book gets banned by the conservative elements for fear that it influences students to commit vandalism, bullies make fun of kids, teenagers do drugs and fool around...in other words, it's a microcosm of Everytown, USA.All around him, Donnie's life slowly falls apart even as it starts to make sense.  Each person in his life is challenged by their mediocrity and must face whether to rise above or succumb to their fears.  The movie emphasizes the madness of putting &quot;Fear&quot; and &quot;Love as diametrically opposed elements, emphasizing that the world is never that simple and often involves a mixture of the two.  It also struggles with the issue of God's existence, of personal choice vs. destiny, of life and death, of madness vs. sanity, and more.Drew Barrymore stars as an English teacher who attempts to open the student's minds. She's also executive producer.  Unfortunately, her character comes off as stilted and unbelievable.  Noah Wyle makes an appearance that's appropriately low key.Kelly's camerawork is exceptionally mature for a new director.  He doesn't shy away from wide-angle scenes and takes on some breathtaking shots; the most memorable being one sweeping panoramic scene that manages to encompass all that is high school in the span of a few seconds.At least as integral to the film is the 80s music that permeates it.  This movie is a love letter to the misbegotten youth of year 2000 twenty-somethings.  The music is always appropriate and conveys the slow tumble of Donnie's life very effectively.  The song &quot;Mad World&quot; sums up the essence of the film and its fundamental disagreement with what passes for our own mundane reality.Donnie Darko has a lot in common with movies like Groundhog Day and Fight Club. The themes of personal choice, of growing beyond one's own selfish nature, of facing down one's demons in a universe that doesn't exist make for though-provoking cinema in the tradition of the silver screen. We don't get many films like this anymore.As the movie comes to a close, Donnie must make a choice. It's not the choice that really matters, but that he was comfortable with his decision in the end.  Viewers who stick with the movie and pay close attention will not be disappointed.Besides, Frank told you to see it.	5.0	We don't get many films like this anymore.	2004-06-22	5	5	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ARTST8JB04TBC	Michael Kear	Donnie Darko is an allegory. Not only that, but it is one of the finest movies ever made. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance in the title role. His body language - the curving shoulders, freaky smiles and brooding eyes - reveals an instinctual knowing without the benefit of a complete revelation. His acting is truly outstanding. I'm not saying that anyone else's acting is particularly great or that the special effects are the bomb (they are quite good for a low budget film). What I am saying is that this movie is a multi-dimensional rollercoaster ride that you don't even realize that you are on until it's too late to get off. The closest thing I can relate it to is Twelve Monkeys. But Donnie Darko goes farther and deeper and asks more questions. It is haunting and humorous and even a little scary. If you are a person given to flights of philosophical fancy or theological speculation, (or even if you like reading Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku), you will love this movie. But be prepared! You will have to watch the movie over and over again, and each time you do the allegory becomes fuller and fuller as the revelation opens.Now, my interpretation of the allegory may not be anyone else's. I would be quite interested in hearing other points of view. But here is my idea in a nutshell...The wrinkle in time is this present worldDonnie Darko is the Christ figure (hence, his mother = Mary; father = Joseph)Jim Cunnigham is the devil (Or is Frank the devil and Jim the Antichrist?)Gretchen Ross is the ChurchKittie Farmer is Self-righteous churchianity (as opposed to The Two Teachers, below)Roberta Sparrow/Grandma Death is the Bible (by way of her book The Philosophy of Time Travel)The Two Teachers (Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore) represent conscientious but silenced clergy - the prophetic voiceThe wrinkle in time in which the story takes place is the world as we know it. Donnie gives up his life so that his beloved might live, but in the process he changes everyone and everything. Even Jim Cunningham - the evil molester who, because of the death of Donnie may not even be found out - is reduced to tears, perhaps knowing that everything has changed. The world as a whole will never be the same again.Okay, you philosophers and movie wizards... what does the fat man in the jogging suit represent? What about Frank? What is he really? Or the psychiatrist? Or Sparkle Magic? What does Donnie's older sister represent? Frank is her boyfriend! Frank also is the oracle that cause Donnie to act. Lots of stuff I just haven't figured out yet!!!!First time writer/director Richard Kelly has created a real gem here. The film already has a hardy cult following and will become, I think, the theologian's and philosopher's Rocky Horror Picture Show.	5.0	Donnie Darko Is An Allegory	2005-05-25	13	11	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2M1N8G4W4END8	Michael R Gates	Donnie Darko is an intelligent but somewhat befuddled teenager who lives with his idyllic family in an upscale American suburban neighborhood, attends an exclusive private school...and has nighttime visions of a huge, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank who gives him information about the future.  Sometimes the nightmarish nocturnal hare puts Donnie into a sleep-like trance and sends him out to perform an act of vandalism or two, and it is during one of these somnambulistic excursions that a massive jet engine from a commercial airliner falls from the sky and demolishes Donnie's bedroom.  Because it appears that Frank has saved his life, Donnie tends to believe Frank's claim to be from the future feels that he must, for the time being, humor the late-night lagomorph.  In the mean time, amid several bizarre events suddenly taking place in his daytime life, Donnie's research into the scientific possibility of time travel leads him to a life-changing epiphany.The ingredients that freshman writer/director Richard Kelly uses to whip up the plot and narrative for DONNIE DARKO (2001) are the familiar materials of everyday life, but he throws in a pinch or two of the bizarre and the absurd to create a subtly skewed and therefore disturbing atmosphere.  The characters are fresh but true-to-life and never formulaic, yet in many of them Kelly still manages to find springboards for satirical comments on diverse societal elements like the American school system, infomercials, spin doctors &amp; public images, the entertainment industry, the popular perception of science, and more.  All of this coalesces into a fascinating and compelling examination of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.The film's entire cast is quite strong and handles the deep material with the appropriate degree of earnestness.  Star Jake Gyllenhaal is especially outstanding in the title role.  His Donnie Darko, though emotionally imbalanced, is both an intriguing and sympathetic character, one that engages the absurdities in life--particularly HIS life--with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film. Of the supporting cast, Mary McDonnell gives a standout performance as Donnie's mother Rose Darko, as she emotes a genuine concern over the seeming psychological downslide of her son.  The cute and talented Jena Malone also does a wonderful job as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen, a young woman who is nearly as perplexed and yet intrigued by life's absurdities as Donnie himself.  In a refreshing departure from the usual hunk and heartthrob roles in which he is usually cast, Patrick Swayze delivers a darkly humorous interpretation of a smarmy self-help guru, and the beautiful Drew Barrymore--also one of the film's executive producers--offers a convincing yet low-key portrayal of an unconventional but popular high-school English teacher.The DVD from Fox offers a very good (some filmic artifacts) digital transfer of DONNIE DARKO in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The wonderful bonus features include two feature commentaries--one with writer/director Kelly and star Gyllenhaal, the other with various members of the cast and crew--a widescreen video of the film's haunting featured pop song MAD WORLD, deleted scenes, and other cool stuff.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and a disc that fans of more cerebral SF will want in their collections.	5.0	The Future Is Looking Kinda Darko	2004-07-12	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A37XAMTQ5WUMSU	Michael Robertiello Martinez	"I saw Donnie Darko about a year after it came out.  I had heard people talking about it for several months, the name more than anything, so finally watched it.  It is a truely amazing film, somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, but not so much as to put off someone who is not a fan of these generas.  So naturally when the director's cut came out i was very excited.  It's well known how big studios have a way of destroying the vision of artists by changing storylines around and elimnating unnessary things like a ""complex plot"" and ""character development"" in order to make movies more marketable.  Many director's cuts have been released after the theatrical versions and have shown the vision of the director, the artist, to be superior to that of the studio exec, the businessman.  Examples include Gilliam's Brazil, Scott's Blade Runner, Beson's The Professional, and of course, Jackson's Lord of the Rings, though i think many of the edits in the theartrical version had more to do with time constraints than content.  This, however, is not one of those instances.  Kelly changes songs in the movie, altering the mood, and not for the better.  He cut a few scenes down; one in particular is the confrontation between Drew Barrymore and the principal of the school, the cut actually stunted the character development of the principal.  Many of the scenes that where added where unnessary (most can be found in the deleted scenes section of the special features menu on the original DVD) and didn't push the film forward, and some just gave the film a repetitous feeling.  One scene is between Donnie and his father; Donnie says that people think he's crazy, and his dad says ""you're not crazy; i used to be crazy, but you're not crazy.""  Nothing more is said about this.  Kelly opens up a whole new dimension to the character of the father and then just leaves it.  It also raises further questions about if Donnie is privy to some alternate reality or if he's just suffering from some mental disorder that his father used to have.  The original didn't even raise this point leaving more up to the imagination.  He also added in graphically some radomly generated series of numbers and rotating pictures during Donnie's flashbacks which made it seem much more sci-fi than the original, which contained none of this.  One of the things that i liked so much about the original is that the story was very sci-fi, but the film itself didn't have any of the visual elements typical of sci-fi, thus making the film more enigmatic and harder to catagorize.Basically, if you're hoping for another film that proves that the artist knows better, this isn't it.  The director's cut is less even and the mood is changed dramatically, and all of this done without adding much of anything to the story.  Buy the original, it's definetly worth the money, but rent this edition before you decide whether to spend the money on it."	2.0	RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!	2005-07-08	20	17	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AKRLE7Q6A6MHL	Michael Thomas	"The original Donnie Darko deserves 6 stars.  This reworking of the classic is definately worth the ride, even though it will disappoint most Darko disciples.  The additions and changes are extensive, and the mood and tenor of the original are modified significantly.  Some new visual insertions are somewhat disjointed, i.e., ocean waves appearing at seemingly inappropriate points.  New insights into ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" through the flashing of various pages from the book add some excitement, but inevitably appear out of place and contrived.  The Michael Andrews score and the classic 80s & 90s songs in the original provided at least half of the eerie and bizarre mood, leading up to the thrilling anticipation of the climax with ""Under the Milky Way"" and finally with Andrews' ""Mad World"".  The remixed music in the Director's Cut is the most muddled and disappointing feature of the redux.  The only music Richard Kelly should have changed is the depressing durge at the ending credits. Additionally deflating is the redone climax.  Although more flashy, it adds no depth or dimension to the inter-dimensional denouement.  The original Donnie Darko is a rich hypnotic fantasy for affectionatos to obsess over.  The remake should be viewed once, and treated as an event that never really occurred, although the memory lingers."	4.0	Director's Darko	2005-02-22	1	1	0

It seems to make only slightly more sense the second time you watch it, and not much more after subsequent viewings, but that doesn't detract from its excellence.  I could watch it about a million and a half times.  Most of the deleted scenes are a little boring, but some of them shed some light on the film.

Movie's this great only come along once in a while, so if you have been putting it off rent it or buy it immediately. It's hard to really describe the movie, but Donnie questions whats real and also time travel in the movie. He also encounters a person dressed as a rabbit who tells him to do various things. This has became one of my favorite movies of all time, so give it a shot..Rated R for Strong language, Disturbing images, and brief violence	5.0	a real mind f**k	2003-11-30	4	1	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	"I've watched ""Donnie Darko"" three times now in the last five days, and still can't say definitively if I like it.  I appreciate the heck out it, am impressed by the imagination and creativity of the filmmakers, and admire the fact that what they put on screen belies their $4 million budget.  Most of all, I enjoy the heightened sense of awareness I get every time it finishes.  It's a feeling that lets me know, without question, that I've been affected by what I just saw.  But when I think about the film rationally, as opposed to emotionally, it crumbles under the weight of its own conceit.Set in October of 1988, the story follows young Donnie Darko, a seemingly unbalanced teenager who is prone to sleepwalking.  On one such night journey he meets a new friend, a 6-foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Upon returning home the next morning, he finds that an unaccounted-for airplane engine has crash-landed on his house, crushing the room where he should have been asleep in bed.  It's the kind of setup that keeps the audience on its toes for the rest of the film.  Where did the engine come from?  Who is Frank?  What do the fates, which obviously want him alive, have in store for Donnie Darko?The problem is that writer/director Richard Kelly has some ideas for answers to these questions, but he either: 1) Didn't have the budget to realize them; 2) Didn't want to give them away too early; or 3) Didn't want to give them away at all, preferring for the audience to fill in the gaps on their own.  I don't have a problem when most filmmakers choose path #3.  The audience should act as a participant in determining the meaning of the film.  But they can't do it alone, in a vacuum.  Kelly provides clues all along, but they are so hidden and so obscure, that even the most discerning viewer probably wouldn't be able to find them on first (or second, or third pass).  It becomes even more frustrating when the ending, supposedly constructed to tie up all loose ends (or at least all loose ends that the writer has bothered tying up), bends and breaks the audience's ability to suspend disbelief.  There's one final thread that I still can't logically rationalize, even though I know what was supposed to happen.Donnie rails against ignore-the-grey-area thinking, claiming that life is more complex than that.  I wish Kelly would have heeded his own advice, for he does a lousy job presenting complex characters.  Most everyone here is either good or evil, black or white.  He loves the beatific Darko family, the progressive young teachers at school, and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend.  He hates, and is unsympathetic to, Kitty, the little girl dance troupe that she exploits for her own ego, and the infomercial pitchman whose theories she buys into wholeheartedly.  No scene holds a more pointed example of Kelly's inability to hide his hand, than an emergency PTA meeting.  Called because someone has flooded the school and put an axe in the head of its mascot, it is inevitably interrupted by Kitty, who has discovered that an English teacher (Drew Barrymore) is teaching Graham Greene's short story ""The Destructors"".  ""Do you even know who Graham Green is?"" asks a concerned mother.  ""I think we've all seen 'Bonanza',"" comes the arrogant yet ignorant reply.  Kelly didn't even have enough confidence in his good guys -- and by association, their quest -- to give them credible bad guys to rail against.  Instead he offers villains whose actions are one step above twirling their moustaches menacingly and tying damsels in distress to railroad tracks.In Kelly's defense, ""Donnie Darko"" was his first film.  And to his credit, there is a lot here that is either very accomplished or shows potential.  I did say that every time I watch the film it affects me in a poignant way, and now I'll tell you why.First of all, it looks great.  Kelly and crew, low budget or no low budget, have made a film that you can stand alongside any big budget blockbuster of the day, and it wouldn't look out of place.  They even manage a skillful recreation of the living water effect first seen in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"".  His camera work is ambitious or simple when necessary.  In a film called ""Donnie Darko"", one would expect that light (or the lack thereof) would be an important player.  Kelly and cinematographer Stephen B. Poster use clean suburban sunshine in the daytime, and extreme darkness at night.  The latter is often punctuated by blinding flashes of light, most notably the brilliant beam that presciently spews from Frank's left eye.Kelly does fine detailed work making sure the authenticity of the time period is maintained.  From the clothes, to the conversations, to, most importantly, the music, everything fits the era to a T.  He manages to get fine use out of not one but two Tears for Fears songs: ""Head Over Heels"" adds power to an effective tracking shot showing the treacherous ecosystem that is Donnie's school; a cover of ""Mad World"" adds melancholy, without adding melodrama, to the affective denouement (like I said, emotionally the film works, but it can't stand up to reason).Overall, I'll give Richard Kelly the benefit of the doubt, and deign to recommend his film.  Like I said, it offered me enough of a visceral rush that I've seen it multiple times, and look forward to seeing many times more.  For all potential audience members, remember this: ""Donnie Darko"" will not make much sense, at least until you've done some further research into the hidden meanings of the film.  Appreciate it as an emotional experience first, and its pleasures will fulfill you.I guess I liked it after all."	4.0	"Everyone Dies Alone; ""Donnie"" Makes the Interim Bearable"	2002-09-02	34	23	11
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A108JVAHQ67T1R	Milan Savara	"It is very difficult to find movies that are ""worthwhile"" these days.  This movie is incredible.  It seems to explain exactly what I am going thru in my life at present.  Although there are many different takes on what this movie is trying to get across, I believe there's a much more spiritual side to it that has not yet been brought to anyone's attention.  It seems Donnie learns that there is a higher intelligence.  He becomes more aware of his surroundings, which eventually leads to the various coincidences that begin happening in his life; Synchronicity.  This is true to our lives as well.  Once u begin to pay attention to ur senses (sight, sound, smell, feeling) at any given moment, coincidences will start happening more frequently.  This is because u have stored more memory of the past to compare with the present; something we rarely do.  We tend to live in the past and future, constantly reflecting on actions we could have made, or eagerly awaiting actions to come.Donnie seems to be experiencing synchronicity once he meets Frank (the rabbit).  He is definitely in some kind of time warp during this period, but it is only for him to learn and understand the depth of existence. His major fear is dying alone. The whole process that takes place after the jet engine falls in his room is for him to conquer that fear.  Once his awareness has increased, supernatural events start unfolding. He is able to view other's intent of action before they themselves are even aware. He follows coincidences to see where they lead (Cellar Door, for instance). Things start to click together for him, and he begins to realize that there is something going on beyond the physical realm; something much more intelligent at play. He eventually comes to the realization that he no longer has anything to fear. There is a much greater plan that he and everyone in the world is part of.  This is why, when time loops back to the jet engine, he's sitting in bed with a smile on his face, laughing.  He has finally realized what life is all about.His death creates awareness in the individuals he had interacted with during the time warp.  This is why at the ending, everyone wakes up with the realization of what they're doing in their life at that particular moment. Maybe now these people will finally realize the direction in life they were heading. Now that they are aware, they can make the choice to head on a different path.Overall, this movie is genius.  I have yet to meet a person who does not enjoy it on some level.  To those who didn't like it; chances are they lacked in understanding."	5.0	READ ONLY IF U'VE SEEN...	2005-04-06	8	6	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A20MOP928FGVCE	Mindscrew Delight	"In the subgenre of pshycological thrillers known as the ""Mindf***"" category, Donnie Darko is among the most liked and well-known. I have no idea why. Creating a confusing mess and explaining nothing about itself is not a Mindblow. DD shows demonic posession, talks about the possibility of time travel, and this is sll supposedly leading up to the prevention of doomsday. No attempt is made to explain how doomsday is prevented using a single jet engine. Nor why the incident with said jet engine repeats itself. Or why Donnie's letter to the old woman makes no damned sense at all. The list goes on and on with all the unexplained *wtf?!* moments in this film.Of course, there are those that argue that Donnie Darko has no plot holes. The theories offered by internet folk to explain DD speak of superpowers, ""tangent"" universes, ""the manipulated dead"", etc. They make sense when you read them. These theories are worth checking out, because there is probably no way your brain will jump to such farfeched conclusions, based on the little-or-no info the film gives you in its supernatural aspects. Here's my theory: DD is a badly made movie that could have been compelling if it wasn't so lazy. Surely the taseless, pointless discussion about how smurfs relieve their sexual urges, could have been lopped to make room for explainations. Same with the sex-obsessed hypnotherapy session. why are scenes like these allowed to exist when they do nothing but juxtapose the movie's cerebral/mysterious tones?I don't necessarily need the solution to the puzzle spoon-fed to me. I do ask that it explain itself SOMEHOW. Because Donnie Darko dosen't, it fails as a psychological thriller, not to mention a Mindblow."	1.0	Vague spoilers - don't worry, the movie still wont make sense!	2013-08-14	4	0	4

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"Richard Kelly's quirky ""Donnie Darko"" was an audience-pleaser at Sundance then a bomb at the box office in 2001 before becoming a cult hit on DVD. It isn't clear what kind of film it's trying to be, which is part of the problem and part of the attraction. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student whose life is disrupted by sleepwalking and hallucinations of someone named Frank wearing a grotesque bunny suit. On October 2, 1988, the bunny tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 6 seconds. That would be on Halloween. It's assumed that Donnie is mentally ill. He doesn't know himself. Between the bunny's commands and other bizarre incidents, Donnie begins to think it all has something to do with time travel, which will come to an abrupt end on October 31.Donnie is a thoughtful young man with a problem of unclear dimensions. He's trying his best to figure it all out, so the audience roots for him. Richard Kelly places ""Donnie Darko"" in the science fiction genre. But it's also satire, family dramedy, teen romance, and a period film of the 1980s. This works, because different themes are compartmentalized, and when they intersect, they do so naturally. The satire involving a gym teacher (Beth Grant) who idolizes a puritanical motivational speaker (Patrick Swayze) is over-the-top. The family dynamic is sincere and good-natured. Mary McDonnell is particularly touching as Donnie's mother, who feels her son's pain and reacts with respect and kindness. But there is a nagging feeling that things in Middlesex, Virginia are somehow out of whack.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2003): On the standard disc, NOT the director's cut, the bonus features are a theatrical trailer and 5 TV spots, selected filmographies of 11 cast and 9 crew members, 20 deleted or extended scenes with optional commentary, ""Mad World"" music video performed by Gary Jules (3 min), a web site gallery that features documents that fill out the past and future of some characters, liner notes for the soundtrack, ""Cunning Visions"" infomercials (6 min) with optional commentary by the company's fictional CEO and director, Cunningham's full ""His Name is Frank"" presentation, Cunningham's book covers, an Art Gallery with nearly 50 production stills and 27 pieces of concept art from the film, and 12 pages of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" by Roberta Sparrow.There are also 2 audio commentaries. The first is by writer/director Richard Kelly and actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This includes their recollections of filming, discussion of themes and characters, Gyllenhaal's thoughts about Donnie, discussion of the film's mysteries, and what the director hoped to reveal as the film progressed. The second audio commentary is by 8 (I think) members of the cast and Richard Kelly. They are a friendly bunch, conversing with the director and each other about the film, commenting on the scenes. Kelly does offer some different ideas in this commentary than in the first, so it's not a repeat. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in French."	5.0	That a Story Driven by Frightening Visions Is So Appealing Is a Feat of Filmmaking.	2008-02-18	5	2	3

I was not disappointed, let me tell you! As everyone has said before me, it's a film that defies categorization or simple description. You'll find yourself thinking about this movie for at least a week after viewing it. It's about so many things - time travel, choices, the nature of the universe, reality . . . . it's just an amazing film.The cast is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhall (sp?), who is now forever etched in my mind as Donnie Darko. He was so natural in this role, I completely forgot he was acting. He *was* Donnie Darko! Now I for sure can't see ""The Good Girl"" because I know I'll keep thinking, ""Why is Donnie Darko going out with Jennifer Aniston?"" (Plus I don't really like her anyway - but that's another story. ;-)I thought Drew Barrymore did a great job as the teacher, and the initial classroom scene with her is really interesting - I wish I'd had teachers like her in high school! The reactions of all the characters were quite realistic too - there were no pat answers or ""movie magic wands"" to take away from the real, human drama taking place on the screen.If you find this film confusing, WATCH IT AGAIN, THEN make up your mind whether you like it or not. Even if you love it the first time out (like I did), you will want to watch it again. Every time, you will see something you missed the last time. It's really an amazing film, and rates right next to ""Fight Club"" (specifically, Tyler's ""Middle children of history"" speech) for defining the angst and confusion of our generation.One final note: You MUST rent the DVD, NOT the VHS. I'm not sure if it's true for all copies, but the VHS I rented was missing a pivotal scene (!) near the end. I would never have known except I was watching the VHS with a friend who'd seen it on DVD and she mentioned it. And believe me, the scene is essential to fully understanding the ending.One of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1EQ02Y8ZCG2M2	mjwatts	First of all, in this review I am mostly going to address the idea of the constant debate over the Theatrical Version vs. the Director's cut. This is not really a summary, so yeah, sorry.I don't know if I can say which is better, it's really up to personal preference. The director's cut is different in the sense that it adds in some scenes, slightly alters others, and changes/rearranges some of the music and scoring.The theatrical cut is much more poetic. A lot of people say that it is better because it leaves so much interpretation as to what all happens to the viewer.The Director's Cut helps explain more of what happens, and the supernatural aspect of it, and leaves less interpretation. It tends to put a lot of focus on the sci/fi side of it.Most people tend to like the version better that they saw first. I would recommend the Theatrical Version, but really either is better. For any Donnie Darko fan, I'd say to have both. I really like the commentary on the Director's Cut, it helps get an insight into all the thoughts that went into the movies, the changes made in the director's cut, and the music. It is quite interesting to listen to.Hope that might help your decision.=)	5.0	Director's Cut vs. Theatrical Version	2009-12-29	2	2	0

It was on late one night, and it certainly kept me up. This is one of those movies that, if you get it, will probably be one of your favorites, but if you don't get it, you won't like. It certainly is not frivolous and you have to watch the movie and pay attention, and probably will require multiple viewings to really see everything. That's ok because it's a wonderful movie, despite its dark overtones. The acting is top-rate from everyone and it was well cast and directed.

I was told &quot;It's weird&quot; and even &quot;It's stupid&quot; but such 2 word reviews don't really tell me anything.Anyway, here goes:We start out with our anti-Hero, Donnie Darko, who is leading a bizarre night life. Every morning, he wakes up far away from his bed in his pajamas.  He also sees things.  Things like giant rabbits. Oh, and air planes fall on his house.  Also, time travel.Yes. Weird.  Many little things set this apart from other movies. From it's wonderful characterization (Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance), to it's slow yet not-boring pace.  I left the theatre wondering what I just experienced. My mind attempted to make sense of everything, and I realized that is exactly the intention.This movie wasn't pretentiously cerebral, dealing with esoteric concepts. This movie was about the struggle of an immensely intelligent kid who is more than a little crazy.  The philosophy comes in the form of his explorations and thought processes.  He sees the world so clearly, yet nobody else does.A fascinating look at the mind of a dark young man.	5.0	I had no idea..	2003-05-27	12	9	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0	Mr G Bowden	"Richard Kelly's remarkably assured directorial debut, ""Donnie Darko"", could be earmarked as the teen movie version of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" with a surreal sci-fi edge. Unfortunately, despite having the likes of Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze in a to-die-for ensemble cast and probably the best poster of 2001 (not to mention a seriously deranged web-site), it fell by the wayside at the box office. Many blame its sort-of unintentional mirroring of September 11 for its lack of drawing power; others claim a misleading ad campaign was to blame (ignore the ""classic psychological thriller"" plaudit on the DVD sleeve); many found its similarities to Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" and the aforementioned ""Magnolia"" too much to stand. However, there is still a lot of enjoyment to be had with watching ""Donnie"", thanks in large part to an admirably tender tone often missing in today's movies.Kelly's script, unfortunately, does bear quite a few likenesses to Paul Thomas Anderson's three-hour opus, not least in Donnie and his psychologist, Dr. Thurman's, discussions about God, an unerringly supernatural ring to all of the preceedings and Swayze's role as a motivational speaker with some rather humiliating dark secrets (and, unfortunately, Swayze doesn't match Tom Cruise's Frank TJ Mackey for audience enrapturement). That said, ""Donnie"" trades in some David Lynch-style moments to keep the audience happy, not least in Donnie's eerie messanger, Frank, the six-foot-tall bunny rabbit. And Kelly's direction is a lot less harsh on his protagonists than Anderson's was, giving the film a more involving emotional centre than Anderson's polarising epic.Though it doesn't match ""Magnolia's"" scale budget-wise, Kelly belies the film's average budget ($5 million) much like Darren Aronofsky did with ""Requiem For A Dream"". The film is effortlessly secured in the '80s with a very decent pop soundtrack (though lack of money prevented the filmmakers from releasing a 'various artists' soundtrack) and is very well shot by director of photography Steven Poster (particularly highlighted in Donnie's scenes with Frank in his bathroom). Kelly also manages to worm in some decent digital effects, from the ""Abyss""-style 'time spears' to the apocalyptic sky effects.And, having gained a hell of a cast for his first feature, Kelly duly delivers on the acting front also, particularly in his lead Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal epitomises the film's sweet, moral centre as well as the thick paranoia set throughout, and emerges alongside ""Ghost World's"" Thora Birch's Enid as 2001's most beguiling teen hero. He is ably supported by the rest of the ensemble, particularly Beth Grant as gym teacher Kitty Farmer, Jena Malone as his girlfriend Gretchen and, especially, Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne as his worried parents. The character Cherita Chen, however, stole my heart shamelessly.A lot's been made about ""Donnie's"" juggling of genres, switching quite quickly from domestic drama to black comedy to teen romance to apocalyptic sci-fi in leaps and bounds. There is no denying, though, that Kelly is a talent to watch in the future, considering the remarkable debut he's made here. The DVD, meanwhile, is crammed full of supplemental material, including two audio commentaries (one of which done by the producers and near enough the whole cast) and extensive deleted scenes featuring more substantial acting work, particularly from Drew Barrymore and Holmes Osborne.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"Donnie Darko is a very difficult movie to characterise and assign to one or even two genres, which is also part of its appeal and fascination. It opens with the title character (Jake Gyllenhall) waking in his pyjamas, with his bike lying next to him, on a highway overlooking his hometown of Middlesex, set in an idyllic tree covered valley. Straightening up he looks out toward the rising sun on the horizon and with a knowing smile he re-mounts his bicycle and makes his way back home to the tune of Echo and The Bunnymen&#65533;s &#65533;The Killing Moon&#65533; in what is an excellent opening sequence. Right from these first few frames it was obvious that I was about to witness something very original and it had me hooked.Donnie Darko is inspired (I would guess) by the weird combination of Philip K Dick, Wes Anderson, JD Salinger and the classic James Stewart movie &#65533;Harvey&#65533;. It announces the arrival of two great new talents in Writer/Director Richard Kelly and the young actor Jake Gyllenhall, in what is a hugely original, ingenious and entertaining movie. Set in 1988, around Halloween time, this movie has the conventional leafy-suburbia-plus-high-school setting, which alludes to the horror genre of Carrie and Halloween but it is no horror movie.  It also has specific elements that suggest that it&#65533;s a psychodrama about a young man with schizophrenia but this is not &#65533;A Beautiful Mind&#65533;. It also ponders the possibility of time travel but this is not science fiction. Stranger still, Donnie Darko is unusual in that (unlike most retro 1980&#65533;s pictures such as The Wedding Singer) it actually has a very cool soundtrack drawn from the period of my youth, which includes contributions from the likes of Echo and The Bunnymen, Tears For Fears and Joy Division.So, what is Donnie Darko about?  Well, without giving up too much of the plot, Donnie is continuously visited by a 6 foot tall rabbit named Frank, which unlike the Pooka in the classic &#65533;Harvey&#65533; is both visible to the audience and strangely satanic. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days six hours and forty two minutes but not to worry as everything is going to be all right. Guided by Frank he narrowly misses being killed when an engine from a 747 crashes through his house whilst he is lying sleeping on a local golf course and the plot thickens when it becomes apparent that the aviation authority has no record of any aircraft losing an engine. Donnie is of course undergoing therapy with a local shrink and hypnotherapist played by Katherine Ross (The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) and the suggestion is of course that Donnie is hallucinating, for as his sister says &#65533;he hasn&#65533;t been taking his pills&#65533;. One of Donnie&#65533;s recurring visions suggests that he can see the future before it happens and so he becomes obsessed with the possibility of time travel and a book written by a retired teacher, who is now a scary old recluse, &#65533;The Philosophy of Time Travel&#65533;. There are also many other sub-plots including Donnie being inspired by his English teacher (Drew Barrymore) and Graham Greene&#65533;s short story &#65533;The Destructors&#65533; into some playful vandalism. In addition to this Donnie&#65533;s subversive thoughts and actions begin to undermine the stability of the local community that is strangely gripped by a slimy fundamentalist guru played by Patrick Swayze.Much of this movie is darkly comic and there are some great scenes including a conversation between Donnie and his therapist, where she asks him what he thinks about at school. Like most teenage boys he inevitably replies &#65533;having s*x&#65533; before proceeding to unbutton his trousers about to m*sturbate. There is also a scene where at a PTA meeting Donnie&#65533;s mother challenges the local bigot by asking ""Do you even know who Graham Greene is?"" she confidently and proudly replies ""Oh please! I think we've all seen Bonanza"".Personally I loved this movie but whether or not you enjoy this movie probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies. If you are not a fan of independent cinema or movies by the likes of Wes Anderson and David Lynch then you probably wont like this. However there is much to recommend in Donnie Darko, not least the cast, which includes, Noah Wyle (ER), Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of A Dangerous Mind) and the previously mentioned Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katherine Ross. Jake Gyllenhaal&#65533;s exquisite comic timing and laidback personality endows Donnie's existence with a dreamlike quality at odds with his teen angst and the suburban paranoia of his surroundings. Meanwhile writer/director Richard Kelly creates a wonderful sense of tension and keeps you guessing throughout the movie that even after the final titles have rolled you are still left to mull over what you have just witnessed.Whilst critics may argue that Donnie Darko fails as a psychological study and/or horror movie, you cant help but feel they are missing the point, as it deliberately avoids easy classification to a specific genre and instead concentrates on being intelligent, ingenious and highly original.  Closing appropriately to a cover version of the old Tears For Fears song &#65533;Mad World&#65533; and the lyrics &#65533;the dreams on which I&#65533;m dying are the best I&#65533;ve ever had&#65533;, neatly ties up the previous two hours and what was for me a very satisfactory cinematic experience. Destined for cult status this undoubtedly deserves five stars!"	5.0	I Think We&iquest;ve All Seen Bonanza!!! *****	2003-03-03	32	27	5

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A363QPYLO68V11	M. Shamir	I've heard a lot about this movie, about how good it really is etc etc... but I've never watched it until now....At first... it just seems like a teen flick trying to do Scream, but then as the plot developed, and the different story arcs started emerging, it became more and more and MORE engaging. Really. I didn't not even pause for a toilet break.And then the end... WOW!! Not the big kind of Blockbuster movie wow... It was a really subtle sequence. But it resonated so loudly in my head... I honestly cannot remember any other movie that made me just sit there and contemplate everything that Donnie Darko had for me, the viewer, for so long. In such deep thought... Sad, happy are just words describing insufficient emotion to what I am really trying to say.I would compare it to American Beauty... Donnie Darko is better, more entertaining, MUCH more engaging than American Beauty. Even the romance part... it didn't need flashy nudity or what... but well, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I just loved the way that part of life was portrayed in Donnie Darko.If you haven't seen, go watch it. NOW. If you HAVE seen it, then I know you just want to watch it again but you just can't seem to get past contemplating the whole movie and so its just sitting on your shelf now while you cannot move on and get off your seat to the toilet. To those of you like that, tell you what, once I press the submit button on this review, I'm going to re watch this movie.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3U11IUSK2YP01	M. Small	Like water in a desert. That's how I feel about this film. The director, actors and everyone else involved poured so much love (not to mention fear) into this little movie that it just shines.  It made me remember why I love film, right in my gut, plot complexity be damned.For all those people who (like me) had heard of Donnie Darko and casually added it to their to-do list based on the buzz, see it as soon as you can. I thought it would be just another witty teen film, above average, but nothing special. This movie is so special it hurts.I can't believe I missed this in the theatres. I'm still chewing on it a week after first seeing it. It's breathtakingly original and ambitious; I was awed that someone had the guts to even try to make a movie like this. It's not exactly philosophy, and it's not perfect, but it's enormously bighearted, earnest, clever, and moving.How Richard Kelly hit the 1988 nail so perfectly on the head is just beyond me. I bet you'll find the movie especially compelling if you were born between 1968 and 1980 - approximately the window for the births of the three Darko children in the film.	5.0	A Gem: One of A Kind	2004-10-24	8	6	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2TO2BN3P4C00L	Music Fan Jeff	"I honestly don't get why this film has received the amount of attention it has.  I liked it but I certainly did not find it great.  It seems to have impressed a large number of viewers (and critics), so perhaps I'm just missing something.  I do like films that require me to think, but unfortunately the thought required to enjoy this film didn't feel rewarding in the end.  Other reviewers here have referred to this film as a puzzle.  That's the way it seemed to me, too; unfortunately after the puzzle is put together (and I believe that there is more than one way to interpret this film), one is left with a feeling of ""so what?""  There isn't anything profound about this film; it doesn't shed any new light on ""the human condition"" as far as I can tell.  Perhaps this film appeals most to people who enjoy puzzles purely for the mental exercise.  I would like a little emotional payoff/insight in the end.I read the most recent 50 or so reviews and did not see anyone comment on the age of the cast.  I must say that I was distracted by the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as an alleged high school student.  Yes, he was only 20-21 when this was filmed, but he definitely looked to be in his twenties and not an adolescent.  Some of the other actors also looked too old to be playing their parts.  Jena Malone, on the other hand, whose looks match her age  (four years younger than Jake Gyllenhaal) only served to call attention to the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal looked more like a man and less like a teenager.  I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was good (though I haven't seen him in anything else and some people are criticizing him by saying he essential comes across the same in every film), but he just wasn't believable as a high school student.  The casting wasn't as bad as, say, the film version of ""The Wiz"" (where a forties-ish Diana Ross tried to pretend to be a young teen), but I was definitely distracted by some of the choices made."	3.0	What's all the fuss about this film?	2004-09-16	19	12	7
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1HALUZL6JHO3Y	M. W. Zeininger	Let me start by saying that I've been aching to see this brilliant film since last fall, but instead had to wait till video.  And boy, oh boy, was it worth the wait!  Richard Kelly presents something stunning here.  At times mordantly funny, shrewdly satiric, eerie, tragic, but always fascinating, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an inspiration for people like me looking for something that will come as a revelation.  Jake Gyllenhaal does tricky, effective work here, and carries the film strongly.  Mary McDonnell is first-rate, and the rest of the supporting cast know exactly what Kelly wants from them.  Touching, funny, surprising and entertaining, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; will remain one of my favorite films of all time.  The only negative to come of my love for this film is that too many people I know who don't have the appreciation for this work of art have seen it and are singing its praises.  I wish I hadn't shown them so I could keep &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and its beauty all to myself and those I think will appreciate it like me.  Thanks to the luminous Drew Barrymore for getting this film and filmmaker where they belong.	5.0	One of 2001's BEST FILMS!	2002-04-11	14	9	5

I bought this as a replacement for a DVD I had gotten before and lost.When I watched it, I realized I wasn't watching the same movie I had seen before.This DVD is the Director's Cut: it's almost a half-hour longer and has alternate/deleted scenes and different music at a few spots. I'll say right now that I love both versions, maybe the DC a little bit more. Some people prefer the theatrical cut. Overall the story is the same, but the plot and theory are explained a little bit more in the DC. You can just search for all the differences between the two versions online.It's a very good movie, just make sure you know which version you're getting.	4.0	Make sure you know which version you are getting!	2014-03-06	0	0	0

Watch this movie, end to end, then watch it again. It's the type of flick that runs your mind through a ringer, and leaves as many questions as it does answers. If you are the type of person whoe needs closed endings, this is not the movie for you. This incredible cast of actors were given roles that they could sink their teeth into. And, with the exception of Drew Barrymore's odd, lackluster performance (I could tell she was going for a certain effect, but it doesn't work), they sink fangs into their roles. Sure to be a cult classic.	5.0	Smurf Logic	2003-03-14	0	0	0

The film has a strong script and even stronger performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role, gives a magnificant performance that makes you forget that he did &quot;bubble boy&quot;(and THATS saying something!)  The movie has its gentle moments, and its moments that grab you and never let go, but the entire experience itself is rivetting.All of my friends who have seen the movie went right away to buy the movie for themselves- its that good.  The ending will keep you thinking for weeks, and it will take a couple of viewings to truely begin to comprehend it.  It ends up like &quot;American Beauty&quot; with time warps and wormholes.Not only is the movie amazing, this DVD has great features.  There are multiple deleted scenes which are interesting to see, and the commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal and the director/writer Richard Kelly help shine light on some of the more obscure parts of the film.  Overall, I'd say that this movie is a must have DVD.	5.0	brilliant and mind bending	2004-03-14	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A38921VU3NJDFK	N. Anno	An astonishing achievement in independent cinema, young writer-director Richard Kelly's sci-fi psycho-thriller is disturbing and audaciously original. Targeting American suburbia, Kelly's film saturates audiences with its dark sense of humor and mind-blowing tale of time-travel and teenage behaviorism. Jake Gyllenhaal is given the title role, a trouble-minded high school student whose psychological state is being rattled by the commands of a destructive voice in his head--that of a 6-foot-tall prophesying rabbit named Frank, who alerts Donnie of the world's end, which is to come in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. As perhaps Frank would've predicted, this treasure of cinema (which also stars Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Jena Malone, and Jake's sister, Maggie) accumulated rave reception and a surprisingly massive cult following.	4.0	Donnie Darko (2001)	2010-02-17	1	1	0

Acting like it invented the satirical look at new-age philosophy and sudden surrealist imagery, the twist at the end makes it look like Donnie was suffering from a teenage martyrdom fantasy, which is hardly worth the price of a DVD. Go rent My Own Private Idaho if you want at least a mildly less tight-assed (no pun intended) film of hot young actors coming to hallucinatory grips with the world.	2.0	Incredibly Slow and Pretentious	2005-12-02	17	6	11

The acting is incredible, my thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal for pulling off an amazing performance (same can be said for his acting in Highway, though it's a completely different performance for a completely different film). But, screw everything I just said, watch the movie, better yet, buy it, and make all your friends buy it.  It's a film every movie fan, hell, every person in general should experience.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Jake Gyllenhaal, star of the godforsaken film Bubble Boy, gives the performance of his young career here as title character Donnie Darko.  In 1988, young Donnie is a borderline schizo who sees a grotesque man size reptilian/rabbit which he follows and obeys.  One night when Donnie goes off sleepwalking, the rabbit (who is called Frank) tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.  The next morning as Donnie stumbles home, we see his home has been decimated by a jet plane engine.  It is here where Donnie begins to wonder if all this really is all in his head, or if he isn't crazy and is meant for something more.  As the film rolls along he meets and falls in love with the new girl (Jena Malone), and becomes obsessed with the theories of time travel.  Patrick Swayze is here as a self help guru who may or may not be who he says he is, and nearly steals the show with his great performance.  Mary McDonnel is great as well as Donnie's mother, and Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (she also was an executive producer of the film) play husband and wife teachers.  Writer/director Richard Kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares, shocks, and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all.  All in all, those craving a different kind of thriller should definitely give this a look.  This is destined to become a cult classic, and the fact Donnie goes to see Evil Dead in a theater makes this film even more of a gem.	5.0	A hypnotic masterpiece	2002-12-28	7	6	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A38CQO0I78645G	Neena	'Donnie Darko' is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. It is a brilliant mix of satire, dark humour and sci-fi, founded on Kelly's fantastic dialogue and direction.The plot is based on a single question: Does everyone die alone? This chilling idea sets Donnie Darko on a quest to discover the existence of God and the idea of time travel. On his way he loses his fear of death and learns to love.  In the end it is these newfound ideas that force Donnie to make the choice between life and death.The symbolic nature of the film is what makes it outstanding. There are ironic parallels with the Bible, 'Hamlet' and 'Catcher in the Rye', and Kelly uses these expertly for a director of such young years.Most importantly, the story of 'Donnie Darko' is in many ways typical of any teenager.  A defiant but bright boy struggles in a world that he cannot understand and does not understand him, until finally he finds strength in the girl he loves.  In the end, Donnie goes against the rules of time and fate wtih consequences that will never be understood by the world.  Kelly cleverly transforms adolescent indulgence into the act of a saviour.  An underrated masterpiece.	5.0	A league of it's own	2004-04-03	9	4	5

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"I saw the Director's Version in theaters last year, after reading an article in the paper that the original theatrical film became a ""cult hit"" on dvd after disappearing in theaters in 2001.  I had never heard of the film before (all I remember was a film called ""Donnie Brasco"" with Johnny Depp and had no interest in seeing that one), which is a shame because this film had the poor sense of timing (no fault of Director Richard Kelly) to be released in the month following the 9/11 tragedy, even though it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival many months earlier.  Had it opened in July or August of 2001, it might have become an even bigger financial success, which it certainly deserves.When I watched the original theatrical version before seeing the Director's version, I didn't know what to make of this film.  Its a strange film that doesn't follow any linear pattern or conventional storyline, but it grabs your attention nonetheless with the awesome visuals, superb acting by a first rate cast, and has many funny moments punctuated by memorable, quotable lines.  This film, more than most I've seen, leaves a lasting impression after a first viewing.  While many films are instantly forgettable, this one stands above others with its unique vision and overall message.What I love about this version over the original one are the inclusion of previously deleted scenes that should never have been deleted in the first place (and it was the studio obsessed with keeping the running time under two hours that demanded cuts).  The added scenes fill in some of the holes of the story, in particular, the scene where the father gives Donnie some good advice about being true to himself in spite of what others might think.  Its a funny moment, and a memorable one between father and son.  I also loved the scene where Drew Barrymore tells Donnie that maybe he and the Bunny can read ""Watership Down"" together.  That's a funny line that should never have been cut from the theatrical release.What makes this film most memorable for me, where the director more than earned his right to direct future films, is the awesome scene when Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" plays and we see a shortened, film-within-a-film, as all the elements of the overall film flow quite well with the music.  Its far better than most music videos I've seen and if they ever gave an Academy Award for best scene in a motion picture, that scene deserves the Oscar.  I also love the haunting melody and images of people grieving when ""Mad World"" plays.  An appropriately brilliant song, as are most song selections for this film.  The Sparkle Motion dance sequence was another memorable scene in the film particularly the way Drew Barrymore moves her eyes and head to the rhythms of Duran Duran's ""Notorious"", while still maintaining the blank stare of complete boredom.  Its hard to pull of something like that, but Drew does it perfectly.  Another brilliantly shot scene is when Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone walk down the stairs in perfect synchronicity with each other.  The only change I didn't like from the original is that I thought ""Under the Milky Way"" fit much better with that sequence and the house party scene than the Echo and the Bunnymen song...but that's the only change I didn't like.All in all, this film must be seen to be believed, and its complex enough to keep you wanting to watch it over and over, but also engagin enough to pull you into its mystery on first viewing.  This film could be a metaphor for many things and is worthy of a film discussion group.  The images of many scenes are beautifully crafted, well acted, and perfectly touched with the right music.  Director Richard Kelly has every reason to be proud of this notable achievement.  I can't wait to see what he will do with his next film, whenever that comes out.One of the special features has a documentary by the supposed #1 Donnie Darko fan, which I found to be quite disturbing, especially at the very end.  That Director Richard Kelly would allow such a documentary to be included on his director's version dvd says a lot about him as a person (a nice guy, in other words).  Fans who are wanting him to write a complete book on time travel to fill out this Donnie Darko project are asking too much.  Let the director move on to other projects, bringing his unique vision to the screen.  As great as this film may be...its still just a movie and the Time Travel book was only a prop that doesn't deserve more attention than it has already gotten."	4.0	The Director's original (and better) vision	2005-02-26	5	2	3

A truly strange and original take on the angstiness of adolescence--it capture the doom-laden, dazed, and desperated phase that so many teens go through at one time or another. (At least I did and most of my cohorts did; we were the pre-Goth kids who dressed in black velvet and sported Death sickles and white makeup long after Halloween.)

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1363DGRVELJVV	N. Sala	"As a science fiction fan and HUGE fan of the original version, this director's cut didn't take anything away from the film.  It added elements of the science fiction aspect of the story that were missing from the original.  Yes, in the original it was more ambiguous whether or not this was all happening in Donnie's head and the director's cut gives a more clear conclusion (that it was all really happening) but why is that a bad thing?  For those of us who were wondering we now have a more definitive answer; especially if you listen to the commentary banter between Richard Kelly (director) and Kevin Smith.That was the real bonus from the director's cut DVD -- the conversational style of the DVD commentary made it the best I've ever heard.  The one thing that sucks about DVD commentaries is most directors will say stuff like this, ""Oh, this was an interesting scene because it was raining that day and it took us several takes to get it right.""  Who freaking cares???  I'd rather know the intent behind a scene especially in a film that it is to be interpreted -- like ""Donnie Darko"".  That's what you get from this DVD and that's why it's a must for Darko fans.Overall, the added footage plus the Roberta Sparrow interpositions make the director's cut a more definitive science fiction classic; one that shouldn't be missed!"	5.0	What are these critical people talking about?	2010-06-26	2	2	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"As it features Echo &amp; The Bunnymen's single The Killing Moon within its first five minutes, and Joy Division's epochal Love Will Tear Us Apart within its last ten, Donnie Darko is the sort of film I have a natural weakness for. It plays like an 80's version of American Beauty. And while it's nicely ironic, well written and cleverly engineered - too cleverly engineered, really - I think it lets itself down badly in execution. An awful lot of signposts the movie needs to make it understandable are down, unclear, or just flat out missing.As a result the film is largely incoherent. Many of the positive reviews praise it for a dark post modernism which I really don't think was intended. There's a fine line between post modernism and incoherence, of course.A case in point: the episode where a jet engine falls out of the sky but which no-one reports as missing. Rather than being a wry satire of corporate responsibility and American victim culture, this is actually intended as plain old daft science fiction: it isn't reported as missing, because it has fallen through a wormhole in the space-time continuum from another universe. You don't discover this until much later in the film. But at least you do find out eventually: there are several aspects which are key to understanding what is going on that you can only discover by watching the director's commentary and having the incidents pointed out:While I was busy soaking up Will Sergeant's jangling guitars in the chorus of the Killing Moon, Frank appears briefly in the first scene of the film, driving past the camera in a red Mustang, having dropped Donnie's sister off after a date. He is also mentioned briefly as having died thirty years ago driving to Donnie's father's school prom. These are important to the exposition (and understanding whether Frank is real, an apparition, or a figment of Donnie's deranged mind) but without the director's commentary you would (on a first viewing) be none the wiser. Similarly underemphasised is the fact that, as Donnie leaves the house on the night of the jet engine incident, he moves into a parallel universe. There is nothing at all in the script that, as far as I could see, gave any hint of that. Nor of the fact that Donnie's pills are only a placebo. The film toys with the question of whether or not Donnie is schizophrenic, but never answers it.In general, Donnie Darko asks a lot more questions than it answers, and by the end of the show I was kicking around a further question: ""what on earth was that all about?""Which I don't think is a good thing."	3.0	Too incoherent to be genuinely great	2003-10-06	20	9	11
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1RZ4C6832YDB9	"Omkar ""I emote, therefore I am"""	"I did expect quite a lot more of this movie as I went through all these reviews in amazon. It definitely wasnt bad, but not thought provoking either. Though it claims to have transcended all genres, this topic was fairly bordering postmodernistic thought (for eg, darko's nihilistic imaginary pal, Frank, the caricature of the determinist, Jim Cunningham, and the meaningless destruction of donnie's room by an unknown aeriel vessel emphasizing dissociation with rootedness), and so this movie immediately springs to one's mind, masterpieces like ""un chien andalou"", ""lost highway"" or ""trainspotting"". However, there is very little basis for comparison as the concept was treated in a very simplistic and linear fashion. Not even vaguely stunning or fascinating. The direction was original but the pace and stylization were mediocre and the concept of time warps and worm holes was treated too simplistically.The characters didnt unfold many surprises either. The treatment of characters was like that in a Television serial with no mysterious aura around anyone else other than the protagonist and his imaginary pal, Frank. The picturization was not even vaguely aesthetically pleasing nor shocking.Regarding performances, Jake Gylenhaal definitely stood out and did an above average job with his role. And so did Drew Barrymore lending some dignified charm to her role as a school teacher intent on breaking deep seated conformistic moulds.On the whole, this movie deserves to be watched once (if you cant get a copy of any other intellectually stimulating masterpieces of lynch, kubrick, jodorovsky, etc). Wanna-be (pseudo)intellectuals who wanna impress their girls, could definitely find some use for a late nite show of this movie."	2.0	Admirable original attempt but flawed realization	2003-08-03	29	5	24

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A30LMTLC9XVWKJ	Only-A-Child	"I have never been a huge fan of ""Donnie Darko"" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an ""artifact"" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first ""free choice"" and elects his original death.""Heathers"" was a major influence on Kelly and ""Donnie Darko"" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know?

I saw it for the first time last weekend, and I'm pretty sure it's the WORST thing I've seen in the last 2 years.  It makes the movie Bats look like Citizen Kane.As much as I can be fond of her, Drew Barrymore and this film seemed to struggle towards the same goal: to appear clever.  This film left me with questions that I don't even want to know the answers to, mainly about the whole time-frame of the picture (how long has this kid been taking medication, how long has he seen this rabbit, what the hell does The Evil Cult of Swayze have to do with anything?).  Maybe I would re-evaluate this film if someone raved about it in an intelligible manner, instead of just saying this Bubble Boy kid is an amazing actor, and it's sooo original.  It just seemed like a tired formula of a misunderstood rebellious teen who is supposed to become martyred in the end.  The era it takes place in is just about as inconsequential as about 8 of the other ""sub-plots"".  Also, note to the director: Cussing at the dinner table, followed by a little kid repeating it is so well-worn that it's depressing.  All this does is make the American Pie kids howl with laughter.  Oh yeah, and that ""Cellar Door"" plot device sticks out like an Eric Roberts Academy Award nomination.If you are looking for something truly psychological that digs its claws into your head, I recommend Barton Fink, The Minus Man, or Straw Dogs.  If you're just looking for a more entertaining movie, that's easy, just see if your local family-owned video store carries Disorderlies, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, or Night of the Creeps.It's a shame that a film like Run Ronnie Run gets shelved while this celluloid turd basks in the sunlight of shallow critics.Of course, this is just my opinion."	1.0	over-rated, weak, and sad.	2002-02-19	124	35	89

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2QDIBEAVW5066	Pandora	This film tells the story of a teen named Donnie Darko. It takes place in 1988, and it shows. Donnie is living in a rich suburban town and goes to a private Christian school. He seems pretty normal at first, but then one day a rabbit appears to him. It's not any rabbit, though. It's a large rabbit who tells Donnie the world will end soon. It also makes Donnie do violent acts like flooding his school. Donnie is seeing a psychiatrist who tells him he is schizophrenic. He's disturbed, but he's still on the search for something else. Something bigger than him. This film is a complex  science fiction flick, but also a dark comedy. The comedy part is where Patrick Swayze comes in. He plays Jim Cunningham, a simple minded self righteous motivational speaker who divides everything into the categories FEAR and LOVE. What I think is funny about this is that it's all so real!! There are thousands of Jim Cunninghams all around the world.Anyway, Donnie Darko is really brilliant and worth the watch	5.0	A Demonic &quot;Harvey&quot;	2002-09-04	4	4	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2CPBGOW7O1VJR	Pankaj SAXENA	"There are probably hundreds of web pages out there trying to explain this movie, not to mention the FAQ, the official web site that tries so very hard to build an air of mystery, the legions of fans who love it, but can't quite explain what it's about.Obviously, this movie is difficult to understand.My own opinion is that the director didn't have a resolution to his story and didn't think he needed one. This is not good. There might perhaps be some stories where the end is well left to the viewer to puzzle out, but there has to be something intrinsic to the story to make such an end desirable. In other words, the story should provide material worth thinking about -- some reward to the audience for their time and effort. In my opinion, that happens when the puzzle is interesting, provocative or profound, as dictated by the content of the movie. It is much less interesting to ponder the question ""what was the director trying to say?"" Who cares. If he cared about the audience, he'd have told us.It is hard to talk about this movie without presenting some spoilers. I don't want to do that, so I'll leave it to you to judge for yourself whether the puzzle posed by this movie is worth killing any neurons. I know there are people out there who like to exercise their mind for no good reason, but even a game of chess or a crossword puzzle has some resolution. The best you'll get from this movie is ""I think I kinda sorta know what the director had in mind.""The acting is good. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) and Mary McDonnel (his mother) are convincing in their roles. Drew Barrymore (the English teacher) doesn't seem to serve a purpose, but I guess she deserved a role, being executive producer. She does, quite arbitrarily, put down a couple of words on her blackboard that just happen to be essential for the plot to proceed. Patrick Swayze is frighteningly realistic as an infomercial host. Noah Wylie is the physics teacher who spouts a bunch of nonsense about wormholes, trying to give the viewer some sort of semi-scientific justification for suspending credulity. Viewed another way, EVERYONE in the movie had a part in the story, if you can wrap your mind around the plot. But it is such a contrived plot that when you figure it out, it sort of feels like you've been conned. One gets the feeling director Richard Kelly knew this, when he had Jake Gyllenhaal say ""Deus ex machina"" at an inopportune moment -- a cheap plot device that became extinct with the Ancient Greeks -- of having a god descend by means of ropes and pulleys from above stage, to explain away a confused plot that was beyond the director's powers of remedy. The gods work in mysterious ways, everyone knows that. What? You dare question a God?The movie is certainly very atmospheric, dark and gloomy in the best traditions. The editing is unconventional; but not weird enough to make you lose interest. You won't be bored -- you'll be too busy figuring out what's going on. But when it's over, you might be left with the feeling that Kelly was indulging his whims at your expense."	2.0	Fashionably weird, quite silly.	2004-10-20	29	21	8

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1Y74H6OZ07HKA	"Patrick C. Kenney ""patrick_ma"""	I rented 'Donnie Darko' and watched it once, last night, alone, with the lights off.  In the movie's favor, I have to say that it did give me that creepy feeling I was looking for; it did keep me entertained; it did make me think twice.  If you're a fan of strange films with dark and uncertain content, then I certainly recommend you check out 'Donnie Darko' - it's worth seeing.But part of the appeal of a strange and uncertain film is that it will come together in the end, explaining much of the strangeness in the film with a clever and satisfying twist.  Donnie Darko lacks any such satisfying conclusion, and that's why I can't say it's great.The link between Donnie's visions and reality is the mystery of the film, and this mystery is really never solved, nor is it left for you to solve.  It's just... there.  Based on this,  I get the impression that the filmmakers themselves were uncertain about the plot.  There are a number of very interesting ideas in this movie, but while each stands fairly well on it's own, they fail to come together in a meaningful way.The strengths of 'Donnie Darko' are its characters (the Darko family is great!) and its strange dark vision (you've got to see this bunny).  These alone make the movie well worth watching.The lack of an equally strong conclusion is disappointing, but it doesn't mean you should miss seeing this movie.

Zimmerman-clayton	"I'm sure there are many attempts on the internet to figure out all the inner workings of this film, but i couldnt help but wonder whether the film itself knew what it was talking about. Sure, you had weird rabbits, numbers, time travel... but with all of these details and elaborate connections, we never really get a sense of the heart of the movie - only a glimpse at a glitch in time which results in a boy choosing to die when he has the chance. This movie promises to be something big and intreguing, but it never tells us why. All we are left with is the green rabbit, ""cellar door,"" and perhaps a vague impression that Donnie doesnt think we're alone. So what? It seems to me that ll the hype surrounding this movie is an attempt to find completion in the mediocre ending.If you are looking for a serious thought provoking, time travel movie, check out Terry Gilliams ""Twelve Monkeys"" instead."	2.0	It just wasn't that good...	2005-05-10	31	10	21

It's a slice of life film with some strange twists and turns.  Time travel, highschool life, new-age psycho-babble...they're all covered in this gem of a movie.  From a demonic man in a bunny costume (a rather frightening figure at that) to Patrick Swayze in a gamble of a role, this DVD leaves an impression on anyone who watches it.  As a matter of fact, this is the ONLY film I've watched, scratched my head, then watched  a second time with the director's commentary turned on (a nice feature on DVD's).  I felt that I understood half of what I saw.  For me that's a plus (I enjoy movies that make me think).

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1IA7P9DY5Y2T3	Paul Gargan	"It's quirky.  It's weird.  It's memorable.  And it has a cool soundtrack.Think ""American Beauty"" style satirical family commentary, throw in equal measures of teen angst, mental illness, time travel and one hilarious monologue on the sex life of the smurfs and you get the idea.  All the ingredients are there for a great film but while I would say the film is certainly Very Good, it never quite pulls all the threads together sufficiently to make it Great.The film opens with our hero Donnie waking up in the middle of the road beside his bike.  We don't know if he was hit by a car or hit by lightening or quite what happened (which sets the tone for the whole movie and in particular the ending - we never quite know what happened).  But one thing is for sure, things started to get weird for Donnie from then on.  (Look out also for the fantastic opening track ""Killing Moon"" by Echo and the Bunnymen).Donnie is a moody, troubled teen with a bit of pyromania in his past.  He takes medication for some type of mental illness, fights with his sister, uses bad language at the family dinner table and sleepwalks.  He also hears voices that tell him to come outside at night where he meets a rather sinister six foot bunny rabbit called Frank for the first time who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.  Interested yet?  And it's just as well that Frank wanted to speak with Donnie because while they were chatting about the end of the world a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into Donnie's bedroom.  You've gotta say that's original.The whole mood of the film is fantastically dark and ominous and there are enough twists and turns to hold the interest right the way through.  I've found myself thinking about this movie for some time after having seen it and pondering its themes of second chances and sacrifice.Where Donnie Darko lets itself down is that it never quite brings together the various threads laid by the large supporting cast.  There is just too much going on.  There's Donnie's girlfriend (is she/isn't she, my what a strange family she has), his father (distant and juvenile), mother (earnest and caring), school teachers (too many to mention other than to say that Drew Barrymore is badly miss-cast and Carter from ER knows more about time travel than he is letting on), a creepy motivational speaker who turns out to be a child molester (Patrick Swayze), Grandma Death (no idea how she was supposed to fit in), a shrink, Donnie's school friends and acquaintances - the list goes on and on.  I'm just not sure what all these characters had to do with the story.  And because there are so many of them, they don't get developed very well and the whole thing just doesn't tie together as neatly as it could.I'd sum it up by calling it an interesting and thought provoking film with interesting themes and a gloriously dark atmosphere.Rent it and see for yourself."	3.0	Has cult classic potential	2004-04-23	7	5	2

Anything more, or less, is considered sacrilege. I left those thoughts behind me while watching and came out with an appreciation for the full Darko experience.Liked:- The talk between father and son about dealing with other's preconceptions of who you should be, and how full of BS many people are- The book overlays that preceded new scenes... gave a sense of fatality, that this path was hard-wired somehow... as Donnie once stated, he felt it was ""God's Plan""- The statement at the end how some might recall events that happened in the tangent timeframe, brought forward into the current... did not recall this in theatrical cut. It gave a sense that what was done in the tangent timeframe wasn't for nothing. It also gives the sense that Donnie Darko was a metaphorical modern Jesus Christ, dyeing for their sins and then giving them a second chance to change things in the proper timeline.Disliked:- The checkerboard pattern and fireworks scene... only thing I felt was a bit overdoneConsidering the Blu-Ray release contains both the standard and Director's cut, fans get to watch the version they prefer.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1KI1BOXX6NSQF	Paul K. Bisson	"There's a nice little scene in ""Donnie Darko"" where his girlfriend reflects upon his full name.  ""Sounds like a superhero,"" she muses.  Donnie gives her a sly glance and quips, ""Who's to say I'm not?""Indeed.  And by the movie's end, we're left to question whether or not Donnie really is such a savior.  At least I did.  In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture.  Not the good kind, either--born of wonder and amazement, but the bad kind: spawn of frustration and delirium.The year is 1988, and Donnie Darko is a dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager growing up in a typical dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager environment.  He deals with bullies at school, falls for the pretty new girl, fights with his caring, concerned family at home, and desperately tries to understand the life he's been given.  Oh, and as our story opens, he begins to receive regular visits from a nightmarish overgrown bunny rabbit from the future named Frank.Frank reveals that the world is about to end and the only person that can prevent it is Donnie.  Thus begins his quest to unravel a mystery that includes a 100 year old woman named Grandma Death, a new age spiritual evangelist who preaches about love vs. fear, a mysterious book called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", and two young school teachers who seem perfunctory at first but then take particular interest in Donnie.I love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation.  ""Jacob's Ladder"" ranks among my favorite films of all time.  And even when ""The Ninth Gate"" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey.But ""Donnie Darko"" seems to think 1 out of 3 is enough.  It's not.  With every dark scene, every social satire, every equitable performance, this movie promises greatness.  But that's all.  The ending is simply another enigmatic scene.  I wish I could say that the sum of its parts makes up for it, but it doesn't.  There are moments where you brace yourself and smile and think: okay, here it comes, here's where it all falls into place!But, unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs."	3.0	This bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.	2002-09-09	7	4	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A26468W112SGMJ	Paul M. Bauer	This is not a review of the movie, but rather of the DVD.  If you are getting this DVD because you think you might enjoy the movie you will, and if you saw the movie but aren't sure about spending some money on the DVD, well, you should.  If you liked the movie, you'll definitely want to get this DVD and the extras that it offers.  Basically, if you took the time to look into this DVD and read this review I think are someone who should buy the DVD.  However, the extras aren't all they are cracked up to be as is often the case in DVDs and I want everyone out there to know what to expect.There are 20 deleted or extended included in this DVD, but each on has to be played separately (no 'Play All' feature) and you must select commentary on/off for each one of them.  This is not the best arrangement for a deleted/extended scenes section.  The actual content of this section is pretty decent with most of the scenes having the possibility of really having added something to the story and most could've made the film had the director not had to cut the film down to 2 hours from the original rough cut of about 2 and half hours it originally had.There are two commentaries on the DVD, one with the Richard Kelly (writer/director) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) and another with Richard Kelly, two producers (Nancy Juvonen and Sean McKittrick) and several cast members: Holmes Osborne (Eddie, Donnie's Dad), Mary McDonnell (Rose, Donnie's Mom), Jimmy Duval (Frank), Beth Grant (Kitty Farmer, Donnie's Health Teacher), Drew Barrymore (Karen Pomeroy, Donnie's English Teacher), Katharine Ross (Dr. Thurman, Donnie's Therapist), and Jena Malone (Gretchen, Donnie's Girlfriend). First, the sound quality of the commentaries is below what one has to come to expect on commentaries.  You can hear the commentary track fine, but the track of the movie itself is all but silent during the time in which the cast or crew is speaking, almost shut off which is a turn to many people (but you can put on closed caption, although that can often distract you from the commentary if you are reading it), and it is back to full regular volume when their is no active commentary. My only complaint on the second commentary is that Drew Barrymore often `hogs' the commentary and was way to close to the microphone (which only accented her shrill voice on this commentary) during the recording of the commentary, she tried to hard to be `deep' in her comments way too often and it gets annoying at times.  Many of the tidbits and insights provided in both tracks are interesting and above par with many other movie commentaries, but by no means exceptional.  It is fun listening to what Kelly and the others have to say and then watching the movie looking for these things on your own, but don't only watch the film looking for hints that the director left for the audience and nothing else; this takes away too much from the film, so don't do that.The theatrical trailer is above average and can be appreciated by both those that have already seen the film and those than haven't.  The several TV spots, all 30 seconds or less, are largely repetitious.The cast &amp; crew information section is above average listing all of the actors' other films through late 2002 (most DVDs list only some films and are not current beyond the movie on the DVD).  There is a total of nine crew bios (as opposed to a simple list of past work) including Richard Kelly, Sean McKittrick, Nancy Juvonen, Steve Poster (director of photography), Alexander Hammond (production designer), April Ferry (costume designer), Eric Strand (editor), Sam Bauer (editor), and Michael Andrews (composer).The `Mad World' music video is OUTSTANDING, and I have seen it many, many times already.  It is quite addicting, and even if I close my eyes and just listen to it, it is still great.The `Website Gallery' is very hard to see and is not anything special and does not add anything to the DVD.  What is shown is really a sampling of what the website has to offer, which is somewhat hard to navigate but during the cast and crew commentary they give you the three passwords for levels one, two and three if you listen closely.The `Soundtrack' feature provides interesting linear notes, but is not an isolated soundtrack of the movie (which is really the score of the movie with the lone exception the `Mad World' Tears for Fears songs covered so eerily by Gary Jules for the movie).The `Cunning Visions' section features the infomercials from in the movie with optional directors commentary).  There is also a `His Name is Frank' section that is a fun little feature of several place cards that are designed like those featured in the Cunning Visions `exercise' in Donnie's health class and shown during Jim Cunningham's assembly.  You can also look at the book covers used for Jim Cunningham's two books feature as background material during his assembly at the school.`The Philosophy of Time Travel' book feature is disappointing showing only several pages (including the appendices featured in the film) and all the pages are hard to see.The `Art Gallery section' is neat with a bunch of artwork that inspired works in the film and some of which was used directly in the film.  The production stills are plentiful and interesting.The `Scene Selection' feature is as good as any other DVD with moving images as opposed to stills to mark each chapter, and there are a total of 28; good for a 2 hour movie.Overall, I enjoyed this DVD especially the `Mad World' music video and the two commentaries as I personally enjoy the opportunity to see the entire movie a different way when I can and the commentary tracks give me this opportunity.	5.0	If you are reading this review, then you'll enjoy this DVD!	2003-04-06	22	19	3
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A4UW0TB854AIU	payasyouexit	Yes, it is better than Pulp Fiction and Clerks, much better. I would even go as far to say this is one of the best movies ever to be put to the big screen. It is the type of movie that you have to see again and again, and will still catch something new, even the 50th time you see it. It draws you in and catches your attention early by its strangeness, and dark comedy. Then boom! A six foot tall bunny rabbit tells the main character Donie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) when the world will end. Fom there in it is a roller coster ride all the way through. I also recommend that anyone who sees this movie reads the pamphlet on the DVD called The Philosophy of Time Travel (it is hard to read but fourtunatly it has been put on the internet.) This helps to explain the REAL plot of the movie that you will not get until you read it, but only see it AFTER you see the movie. I also suggest going through the maze that is DonieDarko.com it's confusing (I had to cheat to get through it) but also helps you understand the movie beter.The prefomances in the movie are great. Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself to be a great actor. The supporting cast to a great job as well.

No words can describe how awesome this movie is. Brimming with symbolism, Donnie Darko is a movie which opens the viewer's eyes to fake people, friends, happiness, love. Although the viewer may not realize it, Donnie dies for the ones he loves. He dies with his own happy memories, and in dying, he saves the lives of the people who would have died otherwise. 1000 words is not enough to fully explain the beauty of this movie.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1QWG77KXFU4GI	Perrin Frch	Possibly the finest debut film by a new comer ever. Richard Kelly delivers a brilliant film about a troubled teeneager named Donnie Darko.Donnie Darko is a trouble maker who has problems at school, home, and his emotional problems. In the beggining of the director's cut we find donnie lying in the middle of a road with his bycicle laying right next to him, we then see our first look at donnie, but he doesn't get freaked out about where he is, he just simply smirks like it never happpened. We then get an idea of what sort of person Donnie is. In the original version, as he is riding his bike back home we hear a song by echo and the bunny men titled 'Killing Moon'; instead we hear 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS. I'm not necesarilly reviewing the DVD yet but just telling you some of the stuff they took out and some of the stuff they put in, so moving on, we get extra classroom scenes where donnie is reading poetry and the classroom getting new books due to the banning of a book by graham greene containing a short storie about boys who wage destruction on an old man's house.In this director's cut, we also get small little things that make the movie more appealing, for example, when donnie is dreaming or waking up to find frank (the rabbit), we see a sweet visual of donnie's one eye with reflections and info on his eye, it's hard to explain, but I wont ruin anything else for you so I'll shut up about the extra footage onthe director's cut.Now the review:I've seen the original, so I reccomend you rent the original theatrical release version first to decide which one is worth more for your purchase. This film is about a troubled but brilliant young man named donnie darko. He is a trouble maker who has to see a psychiatrist due to recent brushes with destruction and various problems to why he does them. He is also a victim of a sleep walking problem to where he goes missing every now and then. One night he is told to wake up by mysterious voice, he then obeys the voice and follows it to where he tells him to go, he eventually ends up at a golf course where a giant bunny rabbit informs him that the world will end in the period of 28:06:42:12.While donnie is at the course his troubles begin to thicken when a jet engine lands in his bedroom, no one knows why or where it came from. Donnie then begins to start obeying what frank tells him to do, because he saved his life. So then the movie really starts to kick off when donnie starts finding out about the mysteries of time travel, frank, and if the world will really end in 28 days.The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, and has a brilliant cast of actors and actresses to pull off the brilliant characters of Richard Kelly's script. The directing and cinematography is awe inspiring with great directing and visuals.And as for the soundtrack, the music is mezmirising and absolutely brilliant, music and original score. So to sum it all up, I Highly reccomend this extraordinary piece of film to anyone who knows and enjoys good cinema. Enjoy.	5.0	They Made Me Do It.	2005-11-30	1	1	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A30QPQC2FC79H0	Peter Whitney	I am finding that those that get the film love this movie, and those that don't hate it and find reasons why it is bad that have nothing to do with the movie.  One reviewer said that it's like Donnie is taking bait.  He is, and he's supposed to.  See, Donnie is a typical highschool student with a not so typical life.  He's being visited by a 6ft rabbit with a reptilian feel to the face, and he's finding out about time travel as well as going through the motions of highschool in 1988 (great soundtrack by the way).  Along the way we meet a self help guru who well... isn't Tony Roberts by any means, a bible thumping teacher, his psychiatrist, his parents who are the coolest parents, and his two sisters as well as his new girlfriend who just moved into the neighborhood.  They are all there for a reason and they like Donnie feel something, but don't know what.  The commentary by the director/writer and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) is great, and the lost scenes are well... amazing.  Why a few made it to the cutting room floor I don't really know.  The two trailers are great (the second one you have to go to the Special Features, then &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot;.  Hit the right arrow key till you get to Appendex B and hit the up button.  That will highlight an arrow and with that you hit enter.)  We also get to see the original infomercial for the selfhelp series, and several TV spots (But not as many as on the Fight Club DVD) and more.  Many people are wondering why it didn't get wide release, well I guess that there is one reason... but I can't say because it would give something about the movie away but feel free to email me to find out my opinion on that.  Anyways, you either get it or you don't.  No middleground here.  You love it your you hate it, but you won't stand in the middle.	5.0	You get it or you don't	2002-03-31	13	11	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6TD8ZH4UHSO	Phxsns1	"Any time you hear the words ""cult classic"", you should know right off the bat that you're dealing with a movie that's not suited for a blind buy. If you are a fan or independent films, specifically indie sci-fi movies, you've probably already seen Donnie Darko and know whether or not you are willing to buy it (by the way, if you haven't seen it, rent it as soon as possible.). For those who have already experience this film, here's how it fairs on blu-ray.The video is nothing special, but there's no reason to hate on the studio for this.

I guess). It's somehow like watching a long music-video, and to be honest the music is what appealed most to me personally. There's nothing wrong with the acting, but nothing about this movie (including its' story) managed to engage me. I liked ""The Butterfly Effect"" better I think, and ""Vanilla Sky"" absolutely. But the movie only is entertaining to a certain level, though I wasn't exactly bored -I've even seen it twice to see if it would change my opinion, and to find out if there had been something I had missed at first view -but my first impression wasn't changed.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AYWIO6OYAGFGQ	"pm444 ""pm444"""	I missed this film in its theatrical release (apparently it received limited distribution), but since it requires at least two viewings, it's well-suited for DVD.  It's difficult to describe the story or even characterize it by genre, which shows how original the film is.  Simply put, it's about time travel, but it's about a lot more than that, too.The acting is consistently outstanding, with a list of well-known names in the cast, along with less familiar ones.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance that is so convincing, you forget that he is acting;  he IS Donnie Darko. While the story is mainly told through his eyes, the other characters are surprisingly sympathetic as well.  This is not an easy feat for a script to accomplish, especially when the viewer must focus so much attention on every event. It would have been easy to create a one-dimensional hero and a bunch of villains, but writer/director Richard Kelly doesn't take the easy way out.Instead, we get a highly intelligent and challenging film that engages us as much as it baffles us, that injects enough humor to keep us from stress-overload, and most importantly, makes us want to watch it again and again, even after we know what's going on.  In this sense, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; succeeds where other films have fallen short:  for example, I enjoyed the complexities of &quot;Memento&quot;, but I was not able to identify or even care very much about any of the characters.  The same was true of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  Both are excellent films, but I viewed both from a distance, more analytically than emotionally.I did not view &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; from a distance.  I was drawn into the world that it creates, and enjoyed it enough to return more than once.  A brilliant first film from Richard Kelly, who has set a very high standard for himself.The DVD does full justice to this fine movie.  The video and audio are excellent, and the extra features are quite thorough.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which I listened to the second time I watched the film.  They do a great job of helping the viewer to connect the dots.  They also include just enough of the usual &quot;behind the scenes&quot; banter to keep the commentary from becoming too academic.This DVD would definitely be included in any &quot;desert island&quot; list that I would ever compile.

I was curious so I looked up the movie online, and what I read made me even more interested in seeing it. But I was concerned I might be bored because I knew the plot.So I found it on TV one night and sat watching so spellbound I didn't even change my position on the couch. About an hour into the movie, my husband came upstairs and said, ""What are you watching?""""Donnie Darko.""""Oh. What's it about?""I had to sit there for about 30 seconds, and then the only explanation I could give was a sigh from the deepest part of my chest. And even then, when the movie was done, all I wanted to do was stare at the black TV screen for about another hour.So if you're worried about the surprises being ruined, rest assured it is impossible to write a spoiler for this film. Complex, layered, ambiguous, intense, and yes, dark, it is something you have to see to even begin to understand.The reviews here cover most aspects of the film's possible meanings, so I'm only going to add my one take. Now I'm not one to find religious messages in everything, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I did see a few parallels between Donnie's story and the Jesus story. First, when Donnie starts telling the truth, people really resent it. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but they all have one thing in common: Nobody wants to listen because they're afraid of what they'll hear.Then you have Donnie's choice to accept his death. If he saves his own life, many other people's lives will be ruined; if he chooses to die, these people will be spared. And yet....Donnie dies and the motivational speaker is still mired in a horrid mess of a life; Donnie's family is devastated; and the gym teacher is still blinkering herself into a black/white paradigm. So did Donnie's death really serve any purpose? I won't give my answer to that question, because this is a film everyone must see and process for him- or herself. And this is why I would definitely recommend getting a DVD, because you need to watch it more than once to even start to sort it out.Very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	Flying in and out of theaters before anyone really even heard of it, Donnie Darko is one of those little gems that most people will never see. It's a strange, genre bending film with a knock-out ending that will lead to hours of discussion long after the final credits roll.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager who in-between zoning out at school and regular trips to his shrink, starts being visited by a demonic rabbit named Frank. Darko is told the world is going to end, and is given orders as this story becomes more and more absurd. Is everything what it seems? What does everything mean? And when the climax is reached, just when you think you're going to get some answers, plot twists the size of Jupiter knock you down for the count and confuse you even more. After two viewings I'm still trying to figure it out. But that is what makes this film so much fun. There are many puzzle pieces throughout the film, some obvious and some you never notice until repeat viewings. And the movie is so much fun to watch that each viewing is an intense, exciting experience.A number of pieces come together to make this movie work. The cinematography is excellent. From the opening [picture] of Darko lying on the hill top road to the final image, each [scene] is disturbing, eerie and above all, beautiful. And the accompanying soundtrack fits these scenes perfectly. Most impressive is a hard hitting montage at the end to a haunting cover of a Tears for Fears song. The editing in a number of scenes is equally impressive. For example, in the first scene at Darko's school, the camera flies around switching from slow motion to fast forward, introducing all the supporting characters as they cross each other's paths. The results will have you rewinding the scene and many others over and over out of their sheer beauty. Helping the film in its disturbed nature is Gyllenhaal's characterization of Darko, sending down-right scary smirks and haunting glares all throughout the film.Despite all these successes, though, Donnie Dark does have some significant problems. Much of the A-list supporting cast, such as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and Noah Wylie, while superb in their roles, aren't given enough to do. Barrymore and Wylie especially needed more time to establish their relationship and characterizations. Also, while the film is supposed to be abstract and mind bending, it sometimes goes a little too far without offering just a little bit of explanation. Mostly just some added character motivation here and there would make a little more sense out of it.While some absurdity works and some doesn't, in the end the good in this film far outweigh its problems, and Donnie Darko shows great promise for newcomer Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it. After all, any film that inspires hours of thought and discussion long after it ends succeeds on all accounts. You'll want to own this one for repeat viewings.	4.0	Wildly strange and entertaining, and gets your mind spinning	2003-01-06	7	7	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2N5QMIZROR30U	"""quizkid82"""	"""Donnie Darko"" is precisely the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic. No one saw in the theater, but once people like you and me get their hands on it in the video store, we make damn sure all our friends see it.The coolest thing about ""Donnie Darko"" is that it's a bonafide independent sci-fi film. This movie has some impressive visuals and visual effects, and it was all made on a $4.5 million budget. Of course, when Drew Barrymore is your executive producer, I bet you get some deals and steals here and there...but it's still amazing that this film cost so little to make.Jake Gyllenhall is wonderful as the title character; somehow, the kid who stooped to the all-time low of ""Bubble Boy"" is able to carry a mind-bending genre film with a large cast of good actors.The film itself is at once hysterical and depressing; realistic and surreal; frustrating and accommodating. It's certainly an original work from a first time director, and a film that will certainly leave you with more questions than answers. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Any movie that requires you to think about it well after the credits roll is doing something right. ""Donnie Darko"" and Spielberg's ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" have more than a little in common -- both deal with issues that are bigger than us, both have an ending that can be thought of as both happy and sad, and both still haunt me to this day.Don't miss ""Donnie Darko."""	4.0	Overlooked gem	2002-04-26	2	2	0

Even two days after I had watched it the story seemed to be playing over and over again in my mind.Definitely a must-see for anyone who enjoys a very well put together suspense thriller or Sci-Fi. The plot is forever moving along with so many layers to it you wouldn't want to watch it just once!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1Y9PPPTU0QS0A	Rae Gunter	Donnie Darko is an intelligent, darkly funny and beautifully crafted film. Everything about it is sheer quality - casting, performances, production and soundtrack. It is subtle, and haunting, with even the minor characters given depth by their portrayal. I would absolutely recommend it.For me, one of my favourite parts of this movie was a minor subplot involving two characters. Drew Barrymore imbues her excellent portrayal of the high school English teacher trying hard to reach reluctant students with great compassion, especially in the byplay between her and the young Cherita Chen. It's a touching and evocative portrayal of the hidden compassion teachers can feel for particular students, of the general struggle of teachers today who care about their students. It's hard to describe it, but it's absolutely magnificent.This movie is worth buying because it's worth watching more than once; there are complexities and nuances of the plot itself and of the minor characters that reveal themselves only on subsequent viewings.	5.0	Brilliantly intelligent	2003-11-07	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ACQLZ27XTNPKC	"Rain ""Araina"""	After reading some of the reviews, I realized that this movie wasn't as bad as I originally thought.  But still there are some things that need to be said. I believe the directors and writers of this movie intended for it to be complex, but rather than this, they made it an unorganized collection of clips and dialog just to fit into a two hour time limit.  This movie did have amazing if not the greatest inventive plotline I have ever seen, it tackled the most important issues in life and death.  Such as religion and/or non-religion, the human mind, family, and love. But Nothing was portrayed the way it was intended to be portrayed. Many characters including Drew Barrymore?s were underdeveloped, and when events took place in their lives, there was no impact to the viewer because of this.  The impact fulness of every event in this movie is dwindled down to a bead because of the lack of character development.  After watching The Virgin Suicides, I understand that it is the idea of some directors and writers to create a sort of third person view movie, as if a book.  This would have made an excellent book.  It makes the viewer focus more on the moral issues and imagery of the story rather than the characters.  However, it seems the producers wanted to impress completely different groups of audiences, one teenagers, the other, the oddballs of the world.  Due to the lack of structure to the movie, all of us oddballs were disappointed, especially with certain mediocre scenes of some characters (Donnie/sister/friends) using out of place profanity and sexual content, when this time could have been targeted to character development and relationships.  Due to this, I was unable to see the character Donnie as a rare and brilliant person, and rather just an average, mediocre teenager.  This is far from complex and brilliant scenes. The teenage crowd was unimpressed by this sloppy attempt at teenage relation.  Many of the deleted scenes were vital, and needed to be included in the movie in order for the viewer to feel and understand the whole concept of it. But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it. Sadly, this was just the stories topics, original they were, but not done justice by the acting and character interaction.  The thing that gave it mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.  To anyone, I would suggest buying just the album, which is excellent, the score is the only thing that saved this movie from being mush, and providing it with a certain brilliance I was expecting.  The movie was certainly original, and honestly brilliant in some aspects.  But greatly flawed.	3.0	In All Honesty	2003-09-08	5	1	4

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A26ERDYXPJ54HD	Ranvel	Rarely are movies which are released today so intricate and so well meshed. Richard Kelly was able to pull off both of these in his first try, with Donnie Darko. Donnie Darko is the tale of a teenager of the title's namesake (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is also a somnabulist. He is from an upperclass family which doesn't have your normal table topics for dinner. Coupled with the fact that Donnie sees a psychiatrist and takes psychiatric medication is fertile territory to make for such a vibrant character. Every character (even the janitor!) in the film springs to life with some kind of nuanced magic of which Richard Kelly is the only practitioner.The intricacy is nothing to be overlooked; as the story touches on philosophy, time travel, the end of the world and subtexts. You see unusual things: hypnosis, detached jet engines, two-bit horror movies, dirty voyeurs and a geriatric woman who can't stay off the road. All the while resonating of the late 80's and all the while seeming completely possible.If you think soundtracks are something more than just an annoyance, then you will love the artists they picked for the as well as well as the original score. The climax of the movie features a song by Gary Jules, called &quot;Mad World&quot;, which really adds to an already amazing movie.The way the film was edited and cut turns the 112 minute runtime into somehting of a blur. You won't notice you've been sitting for that long and you will want to see it again when it's over. The all-star cast is helpful for convincing people to see it, but I'm convinced, with the way Kelly handled less accomplished actors, that he could have just as easily pulled it off with no recognizable faces.	5.0	A great start for Richard Kelley	2003-02-09	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	Donnie Darko is a teen horror film.  In addition, it's a teen romance.  In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship.  The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty.  I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment.  Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans.  Dukakis is smart and thoughtful.  Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy.  The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love.  To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal.  Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white.  Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics.  I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001.  You got me on that one.  There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's.  I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment.  Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date.  My teen dates were never like that.	4.0	Hamletian	2006-05-01	6	3	3

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3RJV0S6SP173G	R. Babstock	Donnie Darko is a movie that tests the limits of the alienated male teen in the suburbs convention so imaginatively that you hardly notice those patches where the script shows signs of strain. In some ways, he resembles the character Jim Stark portrayed so memorably by James Dean in 'Rebel W/O A Cause'. Just like the old Nick Ray picture, this one wins you over with inspired casting and great performances. Jake Glyllenhaal as Donnie is just brilliant. He looks a little bit like Tobey McGuire and naturally conveys some of McGuire's confused naivete. But Donnie isn't just bemused by typical teen rites of passage, he's delusional and suffering mightily from more than a touch of teen angst. It's like Tobey McGuire meets Kafka and it works.What I liked most about the movie were the scenes depicting Donnie with his family. Contrary to the stereotype of misunderstood teen movies, this kid's upper middle class nuke family comes off as very likeable. I've seen the actor who played Donnie's dad before in Election, where he plays an obtuse suburban dad, but in this movie the parents show their troubled son as much love as they're capable of. The mom seems just as confused by her son's troubles as he is. He's got an older and younger sister and though they're not as sensitive to Donnie's condition as one might wish, they're believable. They don't know exactly how to cope with the puzzle he presents. When the family gathers for meals or attend events like the little sister's talent show, you feel a genuine spark of family warmth. They are not the fallguys for Donnie's dementia. And the psychiatrist (played by Katherine Ross. Where have you been since that bike ride with Butch Cassidy  and the big move to Stepford?) seems helpful to the very bright Donnie. Maybe too helpful since any discussion with bright well disposed adults seems to further fuel Donnie's delusions.Part of his illness seems tobe that he's really trying to interpret what he encounters in life for it's true meaning. He might be delusional, but he hates lies and inaccuracy. There's a wonderful scene where he and his chums discuss the Smurfs and his buds spin all kinds of hardcore sexual theories based on this innocuous toon and Donnie cogently shuts them up. I'm not that up on the varieties of schizophrenia, but I'm willing to take on faith that this movie gets across what the disease might be like because it gets all kinds of little details about family life and the awfulness of school right.The main character becomes obsessed with a book by a centenarian who used to teach at the school he attends. The title: 'The Philosophy of Time Travel'. The only philosophical proposition held up for inspection by the characters in Donnie Darko is 'all men live and die alone' which Donnie discusses with his shrink. The emotional truth of this statement is borne out by the sad old woman who Donnie fixates on. It's she who tells the poor kid this hard to argue against homely truth. Anyway, we all travel through time, whether we want to or not - and then we don't. If ya ask me, this was a noble little movie	4.0	A Very Cool, Very Ambivalent Movie	2004-08-15	6	5	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1SDVZ7YNYKQ3B	RB	Donnie Darko is exactly what they say...unclassifiable.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, and still find something new to think about...and the thinking will be intense.  Just when you think you know what's going on in this movie, you think about it again and gain an entirely new perspective on just what you thought was going on.I do think that the director's cut leaves a little less to the imagination by giving peeks into the book involved in the movie, but it's not a major negative.  It's just that I thought that the original version had my brain twisted for a month after watching it over and over again. So there's some bias involved there.If you want to watch a movie that will force you to think about philosophy, religion, science, etc., AND entertain you by being a mixture of sci-fi/comedy/teen angst/drama type of movie, then you should definitely check this one out.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1M580K55FYI4T	R. Burrichter	I know, I know. It's hard to believe, but it's true. The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is TERRIBLE compared to the studio release. The way the film is pieced together is not nearly as effective as the original, nor were the director's choices in terms of soundtrack. Please, if you are going to buy this film for a Donnie Darko fanatic, buy them the studio release instead.By the way, before you slam my review, please know that I am a devotee of Donnie Darko.

Even if you don't get wrapped up in the mystery and go to any means necessary to decipher it, it still has a great atmosphere and is extremely well made.  Great performance, great script, great directing...  With that being said it's only an okay release.  The reason I'm saying this is because the special features are not in high def and the second disc is in fact simply the second disc from the Director's Cut release.  On the other hand this isn't a complete loss because you do get both versions on one disc so if you're someone like me who enjoys both films depending on their mood it works.  However, it's not a great transfer (although it's still better than the standard DVD release) which may matter to some.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2TBWLOHTZNK54	Reviewer	This movie is so damn refreshing. First off, the director somehow manages to get all the actors to be on the same page, for wry, real, fun portrayals. It's hard to describe, but it's not the sort of thing anyone in hollywood is fresh enough to put out right now.And from that fulcrum extends a movie that has sci-fi, horror, and surreality, and coming of age, but never loses itself in pomposity or ridiculousness.

After watching the movie, we had to watch the last 15 minutes again with the director's commentary on so we figure out what had happened.  Naturally, we then had to watch the movie all over again to see how it fit together.  This movie drags you deeper and deeper into the main character's world even when both you and the character are not sure what's real.  It all seems to make some bizaar linear sense until the very end when it all seems to unravel.  Has the character gone completely insane?  Have you gone completely insane?  Hard to know.

Listening to the director's commentary, he credits a Twilight Zone episode as perhaps having inspired him.  The episode mentioned is ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""  While there is something to this comparison, the episode that ""Donnie Darko"" is virtually a twisted rip-off of is is a rather obscure episode written by Earl Hamner of ""The Waltons"" fame.  The episode is called ""Ring-a-Ding Girl"" and is, in essence, the entire story of ""Donnie Darko"" told under half-an-hour, in a much more touching manner.  And yes, there is even a jet crash in it and the ultimate sacrifice.  But - watch the TZ episode and see for yourself.

There are rampant 80's jokes, as it does take place in the 80's, including a kid doing coke right in the middle of the school hallway as soon as the principle walks by, not noticing.  The biting cynicism about religion and the way the world is provides for one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movie ever made.

Suddenly someone asked if anyone had seen this movie, ""Donnie Darko."" Several others began to speak, but only vaguely. However, I was drawn, without knowing ANY specifics beyond the title and the mood of the movie.I found it that evening on a pay channel (does that seem a bit like destiny, my path in life?); and I watched, mouth agape, as the scenes unfolded in an intricate web of events all centering around the main character, Donnie, who was saved from death by his new imaginary friend, Frank: a six-foot tall bizarre-looking rabbit.Frank instructs Donnie to do things, things that disrupt and tear at the lives of the people of his town and school. And as I was appalled by Donnie's obedience, I couldn't help but to understand how we all feel led at times, as if it were out of our control.The movie is a study in irony at every turn; and as the story comes full circle, you see that redemption is the ultimate irony here. And Donnie Darko willingly and joyously bought it for everyone.Few movies have left me quiet for so long, alone with my thoughts of life/death, action/consequence...

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	I actually watched this movie on the recommendation of my 15 year old son.  Usually, his tastes are not always the most reliable (!!!), but he was right on the money this time.  This mysterious, funny, moving film has a terrific cast and a very challenging premise.  I won't get into the plot too much (that would be kinda hard to do), but let's just say it messes around a great deal with ideas of time travel.  But it feels like a social satire (a la Heathers) mixed with a moody horror movie (there's a very creep giant rabbit!!).Jake Gylenhaal, as Donnie, is terrific.  He's been called a &quot;poor man's&quot; Tobey Maquire, but he's every bit Maguire's equal, he just hasn't played Spiderman yet.  He's one of these moody, sensitive, soft-spoken young actors, and those kinds of mannerisms can get a bit tiring, but Jake pulls it off with freshness.  His sister Maggie (who was SO terrific in SECRETARY) plays his sister here, and they have a very believable brother/sister, love/hate relationship.Patrick Swayze has some fun with his clean image, and the scenes of him as a &quot;motivational speaker&quot; are truly hilarious.  Drew Barrymore plays an understanding school teacher, but, I must confess, she isn't very good.  Noah Wylie has a small part as another teacher, and he's passable.  Frankly, it is the teen cast that makes this thing sparkle.It's a difficult movie, and you MUST watch it with your full attention.  But you'll be sure to discuss this for a long time afterwards.Not for little kids, mostly because they'll never get what the heck is going on!!!	4.0	A very pleasant, creepy surprise!!!	2003-09-08	37	32	5

It is disturbing but not in any horror sense. Like the film ""The Fountain"" you must be patient and see it all the way through before you will really understand it - and maybe not even then at least at first. This is a sleeper in that you probably won't come to true clarity and understanding until after you have slept on it overnight. I guess the best way to sum it up, as much as it can be done, is to call it a psychological time traveller story, but that hardly does this film justice.Originally I put off buying this as it sounded like a horror film with all that that possibly entails. I am not a horror fan, nor like gore. I am glad however I took a chance and bought this film and watched it. Unique doesn't even begin to describe this film. Rest assured the R rating is mainly for extremely strong language. There is no graphic violence or gore involved, nor any nudity or sex, whatsoever. The disturbing part comes from anticipation and not understanding what you are seeing here.It is a profoundly unique well done story and no scene can be anticipated in advance as in many other Hollywood films.  It is not hard to understand now why this is such a cult classic!The Blu-Ray Directors cut is very high quality, extremely crisp, and the sound excellent. The soundtrack is really good and I really like the ""Mad World"" song and have since bought the soundtrack separately just to have it and some other unique tracks as well.If you are a fan of films like ""The Fountain"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", ""Dark City, ""12 Monkeys"". ""V for Vendetta"", ""Man from Earth"" and other similar type cult films this would be one to add to your film collection.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001)All hail the coming of Richard Kelly. If the rest of his films are as good as Donnie Darko, America has found its first truly great director since John Huston.The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal, who easily deserved last year&#146;s Best Actor award for this role) plays a paranoid schizophrenic high school students whose best friend is a six-foot-tall mutant-looking rabbit named Frank (James Duval [Go/The Doom Generation]). No, no one but Donnie is capable of seeing Frank. Frank makes Donnie do very bad things.When not under Frank&#146;s powers of suggestion, Donnie is your typical high school student. Along the way, he acquires a girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, of Life as a House fame), goes to class, feuds with his teachers, has deep and meaningful discussions about the sex lives of the Smurfs, gets bullied by the school bad boys, tries to make life easier for an exchange student, and hangs out with his similarly-outcast friends. When midnight comes, however, Frank pops up, and Donnie becomes&#133; someone else. The first time we see Frank, he tells Donnie the world will end in twenty-four days and some change. And things go downhill from there.Add to this mess Donnie&#146;s English (Drew Barrymore) and Science (Noah Wyle) teachers, whom he likes; the insane Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant [Speed]), whom he hates (she seems to be some kind of psychology teacher with a twisted agenda); his psychiatrist (the redoubtable Katherine Ross); a motivational speaker who seems to have fooled everyone but Donnie (Patrick Swayze); and, of course, his family, who think he&#146;s absolutely insane. It&#146;s a thick, tasty stew of teen angst, mental illness, and the sheer beauty of growing up different than everyone else. Like life, it&#146;s both funny and sad by turns, and sometimes cruel; Donnie wins a few battles, loses a few. The only real difference between Donnie and most high school outcasts is that, well, he&#146;s got this friend, see&#133;All of this makes Donnie Darko a good film. What makes it a great film is all the thought that went into the script and the direction; the underlying meanings, the visual clues, the attention to detail. Kelly makes M. Night Shayamalan directing The Sixth Sense look like an ogre with a mallet; this is the most symbolically-laden film since Begotten, at least, and possibly going all the way back to the original Cape Fear.Donnie Darko earned itself a place on the all-time 100-best list immediately. **** 	5.0	By far one of the best of 2001	2002-11-09	6	6	0

The new footage and assorted changes add nothing substantive or interesting and the attempt to ""explain all"" reveals that the director himself does not understand what made the original one of the great cult movies in recent years -- that incredible mind-blow at the end of the movie, with only a clue as to what you just witnessed. With all the hitting you over the head with the ""meaning behind the story"", the wonderment was completey ruined.So, if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, do yourself a huge favor and steer clear of this version and get the theatical release.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A293KDHXPL4EQN	Robert F. Barnes	Donnie Darko is a gem with many flaws. The flaws reflect a little light, giving rise to the mistakened belief that the gem is more complex than it would appear. But when you look closer, the gem is just cracked. Nothing more or less.This is as true for the movie as it is for the lead character. Jake G. has three basic looks he gives the camera--the puppy-dog, the creepy-as-hell snear, and the arrogant/confused/drunken teen. These he does well; but these do not a brilliant actor make. I wish him the best, though, and imagine he has better in him.!Spoilers follow!The rest of the characters are paper thin. There is no nuance--each one is a cardboard cut out. Except for the giant time-traveling killer rabbit. Now there's something you don't see every day! My hat's off to whoever thought that up.I kept putting up with undeveloped and cliche characters and an oddly paced plot (that kept me interested, though) for some sort of payoff. And when it came, I was disappointed. A simple Christological metaphor does not a movie make--in this case, Donnie apparently dies so that an alternate time-stream can be inacted, one that does not involve the death of his family and girlfriend.This movie is not 5 stars, nor 4, but is regretfully an average movie because of its flaws. Perhaps you can dig into it and watch it 5-6 times and become more accepting of the trite conversations, potty mouth humor, cardboard characters, and did I mention bad lighting, but that does not change the fact that they are there.Nevertheless, give it a watch. It's worth a rental, but because of the language, it's not for kids or anyone bothered by foul language.	3.0	A Mish-Mash Worth a Watch	2003-09-29	13	3	10

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AYLWPNL2366EP	Robert Kaercher	"This movie was a very pleasant surprise.When this was initially released in theaters, I didn't quite know what to make of the trailers.  It appeared to be a movie about some kid haunted by a scary-looking giant bunny, sort of a demented ""Harvey"" as though directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  I was intrigued.  Unfortunately, I never got around to going to see it in a theater, so when I saw it at my local video store, I snatched it up, having very little idea of what to expect.What I saw was a solidly entertaining, thought-provoking, unique and thoroughly original sci-fi time travel tale with very real and believable human conflict (rare for a science fiction flick).  Jake Gyllenhaal (playing the film's title character)-an unusually gifted actor for his age who consistently demonstrates a sense of truthfulness about his work (unlike so many other young actors of his generation, who seem mostly to be more concerned with looking cool and hip than with honing their craft)-gives a great performance, and is sure to have a wonderful future ahead of him.  Virtually the entire cast is an impressive veteran ensemble, all of whom deliver wonderful performances:  Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as Gyllenhaal's parents, alternately worried and amused by their son's eccentric behavior; Katharine Ross (yes THAT Katharine Ross, of such `60s classics as ""The Graduate"" and ""Butch and Sundance,"" who has unfortunately been all too absent from films since that time) as Gyllenhaal's concerned psychiatrist; Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (also the film's executive producer) are perfect as two young liberally minded high school teachers, embattled by a hypersensitive school bureaucracy; and Rachel Winfree gives a flawless performance as a neurotic high school teacher who tries so desperately to teach her students the difference between ""love"" and ""fear"" on the ""lifeline.""  Jena Malone as Gyllenhaal's love interest gives a very sensitive and well-crafted performance; she forces nothing, and like Gyllenhaal, she should also have quite a career ahead of her.The most ingenious stroke of casting in this movie, however, is perennial `80s ""Dirty Dancing"" icon Patrick Swayze as a cheeseball motivational speaker (a la ""Up With People"").  Definitely his finest performance since ""Road House"" (har, har).But the greatest kudos must go to writer-director Richard Kelly (not to be confused with ""Ally McBeal"" creator Richard E. Kelly).  It is not easy to craft a sci-fi tale that actually has a believable and compelling element of genuine human drama (George Lucas' stunted and awkward dialogue in his most recent ""Star Wars"" epic and the forced, saccharine emotions of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" spring to mind), but Kelly manages to pull it off.  This movie is also part satire, too, offering relevant social commentary without being preachy or obvious.This movie will surely go on to become a cult classic."	4.0	&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; A Real Gem	2003-01-14	31	29	2

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1QRY1XLMKX1KU	Robert Rootes	"I try to find movies that are unusual and sometimes complicated. This is a good reason I tend to rent movies away from the Hollywood formula, going for foreign films. With writer / director Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, I found a treat close to home. With cameos from Drew Barrymore, Noel Wyle and Patrick Swayze this movie carries you into the past, pre school shootings and unexplainable violence from today's youth. Set in 1988 (a year after I graduated high school), Donnie Darko uses the music of the times and the down-home settings to drive the point home. Quoted by Drew Barrymore (unfortunately deleted from the film), ""Kids today are lost because the parents don't know how to reach them,"" Or close to that. Our hero, Donnie, descends into madness when he comes full circle in the month of October to learn of the future events through his imaginary friend, a dark twisted rendition of Harvey with Jimmy Stuart, called Frank ""the rabbit"". Frank explains, through visuals with excellent special FX that the path we lead in this life is predetermined by a source that is expelled from your body. Confusing? Good! To appreciate the subtle use of language and visuals Donnie Darko isn't a ""horror"" movie, you could border it with Sci-Fi, you have to see the film! I recommend this to anyone that wants a taste of nostalgia from the late 80's without the trite clich&eacute;s always seen in movies. This was a more real look into the times, as close as ""The Virgin Suicides."" If you like dark, subtle plotted tales, this is your movie! I will be on the look out for more of Richard Kelly's work."	5.0	A dark, nostalgic trip into the past&#65533;	2002-06-26	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A18TSDA9ZRLKVM	"Robert S. ""geek hipster"""	Just a bit of math.  A blu-ray disc holds around 50 GB of data.  Movies that take advantage of the space are the ones that generally look better. This Donnie Darko Director's Cut puts both theatrical and Director's versions separately onto ONE disc, cutting the amount of space available for each in half. The result:  Neither cut looks better than a standard DVD. The image quality is soft to the point where film grain is barely even visible, and detail is poor, except in the occasional closeup.I didn't actually watch the Directors cut until I bought this version recently, and didnt understand what the hub-bub was about.  The sound mixing in the DC is downright awful in places where changes have been made.  Most of the sound changes involve fading out the (excellent) score by Michael Andrews and putting loud sound effects in their place.  Extra material in scenes adds some slight character padding that portrays Donnie in a somewhat less sinister light, which the removal of some of the music seems to want to suggest, too.  There's nothing wrong with that, but a big part of the film's charm is the mood it evokes, and the score is a big part of it. Cutting it down just makes the tone of the film even harder to get a hold of, if that's possible...The bonus disc contains a filmmakers journal, which will certainly interest film buffs, a documentary called 'they made do it too' about people who really liked the movie talking about how they liked the movie, and #1 fan: A Darkomentary (which I didn't watch).The Philosophy of Time Travel book that was included in the original DVD is sadly not included here.I'm a fan of the film, and even liked Kelly's Southland Tales (which was a good blu-ray, if not a great movie), but I can't recommend this release... it's just meh.If they re-release the theatrical cut as a standalone with a better transfer, I'm down.	2.0	2 Poor Transfers - Why?	2010-03-15	9	8	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1DKEKL2N30P22	Robert W. Macdowell	Beautifully grim and Brilliant! are the first words that come to mind after seeing Donnie Darko for the first time. Astonishing and Clever are the first words that come to mind after watching Donnie Darko the second time.*minor spoilers* What do you get, when your stuck inside the mind-inside the dreams-of Stephen King right as he falls alsleep whilst reading Alice in WonderLand?Answer:....Donnie DarkoWhen in the middle of the night a jet engine falls from the sky, crashing into the bedroom of Donald Darko, Donnie has only a six foot rabbit named Frank to thank for saving his life. Frank then kindly informs Donnie that the world will end in twenty-eight days. Over the course of the next month-with armegeddon inevitable- Donnie follows the bunny (a'la Alice style) through a wormhole into a tangent universe where he sleepwalks and reeks havoc on the schools water mane; falls in love; has many more creepy encounters with Frank the bunny; theorizes the true nature and existence of Smurfette; exposes a kiddie porn publishing ring; and uncovers the principles of Time Travel.Without getting bogged down in details of the synopsis, Donnie Darko simply put is: pure feat in filmaking. Never before has a film noir been able to capture and convey such raw beauty. Never before has such a dark and grim premise been so cleverly told,through painingly-pretty blue skies, descriptive and creative random blurbs of literature, genuine and concise dialogue, and an ending that brings us back to the beginning, which we quickly learn is the beginning...of the end.One of the highlights for me was the use of music, including an awesome and refreshing alternative to the cliche' part of a movie where we meet all the characters, and a group of characters meet for the first time- exchanging dry, predictable, formal dialogue. Instead the creators chose to pan from afar, mute-out all sound, and play-from very beginning to end- the appropriately symbolic song, &quot;Everybody wants to Rule the World.&quot; Throughout Donnie Darko the device of music is carefully and purposely implented to create a genuine feel of the late eighties era. The soundtrack is so deftly used, it sort-of becomes its own living character.It is a rare feat when a movie remains even from opening scene to the closing credits. Donnie Darko accomplishes this rarely reached goal though consistently superb cinematography, descriptive prose delivered by colourful characters, dashes of humour, splashes of romance and a huge cerebral heaping of the Philosophy of Time Travel- coupled with the fear of knowing &quot;that every living being on this planet...dies alone.&quot;Fear&lt;------------------&gt;LoveCellar Door(p.s. to a previous reviewer) The song &quot;Notorious&quot;,by Duran Duran, was released in 1986--not 1992.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AINY9YQ0YSM2Z	robulus	The thunder rumbled away through the distant mountains, we left the young man lying in the middle of the road, and the first notes of Echo and the Bunnymen's &quot;Killing Moon&quot; rung out. I was spellbound for the next 113 minutes.Set in the late 80's Donnie Darko is the story of a young man's alienation through mental illness and general teenage angst. Soon after a jet engine mysteriously crashes into Donnie's bedroom he starts receiving visits from a prophetic character in a strange rabbit costume named Frank. His subsequent interactions with Frank, teachers, friends, family, and his therapist weave a completely original and absorbing tale. Donnie's interest in time travel and anxiety about Frank's apocolyptic predictions move the story forward in a completely unpredictable way. There is a great deal of humour, especially with Donnie's disdain for the local self help guru.The usual high school teen-drama characters present themselves but they are fleshed out with uncommon depth in this movie, Donnie's family are likeable and very functional, his teachers have lives outside school and his girlfriend has a multi-dimensional personality with troubles of her own.A hypnotic and darkly beautiful original soundtrack is complemented by one of the best selections of eighties music I have heard in recent memory. Honestly the way this music is integrated with such meaning and purpose to the film's narative you'd think it was written for it. From &quot;Killing Moon&quot; in the opening scene, tracks from bands like Tears for Fears and Joy Division complement perfectly every time. In one scene where Donnie's halucinations get a little out of hand &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; by Australian band the Church is used so well I got a rush of blood to the head, and the final scene uses a re-working of Tears for Fears &quot;Mad World&quot; to great tragic effect.Some reviewers have been upset by what they see as a confusing ending, but I found the ending deeply moving and satisfying, as I did the movie as a whole.	5.0	Brilliant, Original Movie with Outstanding Soundtrack	2003-05-12	15	13	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A392BO4M88KUAD	Rock Montgomery	I waited a long time to see this movie.  I heard so many rave reviews about this film, and I searched different video stores in hopes of actually finding it.  When I heard that a director's cut was coming out, I finally felt that it was my chance to see it.Suffice to say, upon actually viewing the film, I was not that impressed.  It was so incoherent that I was praying it would finish after the first hour.  Donnie Darko could have worked better as a short film, but instead we are treated to an inflated, nonsensical plot, physic/psychological/theological mumbo-jumbo, and one-dimensional supporting characters.  Some of the actors do give fine performances, but it seems like they belong in different films (i.e. Drew Barrymore as the sarcastic English teacher).  We are supposed to believe in the mysterious and profound whenever somebody gives a zombified stare (which Gyllenhaal seems to have throughout the movie; the same goes with Mary McDonnell).  I'm so glad it's not sequel material.	2.0	It does not live up to its hype	2005-03-14	19	4	15
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AK1OBVI54SY73	"Rocky ""Raquel"""	This movie kept me till the end with endless curiosity and wonder and I can tell others were too for it seems this movie provoked a strong following. It is worth its fans though it is a very good and fascinating film with truly, as they say behind the scenes, a universal meaning. The whole plot though is something so amazing but mind- boggling that you just feel you need to talk to your friends or your parents about it right away after you watch it. This movie raised so many questions honestly and probably made a lot of people expand their thoughts just a little more for a little while about possibility and how limitless it truly is.Why this movie is not five stars readers may wonder? The ending itself, though understandable and satisfying, may not be easily understood the first time you watch it. I know it didn't for me. I was a bit confused the first time I watched the ending, so it was lucky for me that I waited until it came out on DVD so I could go back to the ending once or twice and put the pieces together more slowly. Yet it only takes once or twice glance at the ending again to get it. The point is though the ending isn't exactly a sure thing for most when they watch it for the first time, so I guess that is why they lose one star. After looking back once or twice though in the last few moments of the film, it all eventually comes together into again like I said a satisfying and good ending.Overall I liked this movie a lot, and I do think this year it is one of the best films I have seen. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I'm just terribly afraid of rabbits now... I don't want to explain too much of the film because it is just so exciting and also creepy, so I'll just leave you with an exciting mystery.Oh yes and watch the second disc if you can on Donnie Darko and watch the ultimate number one fan guy. He is very obsessed with this movie; it's so funny! And watching Jake G. dance behind the scenes? Priceless.	4.0	One Of The Best Films I've Watched This Year	2005-08-07	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1CEK79P47OADL	ruby717	"""28 days. 6 hours. 42 minutes. 12 seconds. That is when the world will end."" Or so says Frank, the pshcyotic bunny rabbit that tells Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) to do violent things.If you're buying the director's cut, then you've probably already seen this movie about 28 times. If you haven't, let me fill you in.In 1988 suburban Middlesex, Donnie Darko lives with his loving family in an ordinary life. But one night he sleepwalks towards Frank where he recieves information about the world's end, and in the process dodges death when a jet engine falls on his room (you heard me right-a jet engine). Because Frank saved his life, Donnie now must do what Frank tells him to do. Given this time until the world ends, Donnie tries to make sense of what has happened to him, as well as connect with his family, fall for a girl, and question the search for God, and in the process discovers that he should've died when the jet engine fell on his room.The main reason why Donnie Darko is already a cult classic at age 4 is because it doesn't clearly offer a solution, leaving the viewer in the dark as to figure out the pretzel-like remains. But that's also why people love it. I honestly loved it because it unknowlingly re-examins what it means to live; If the world were to really end in 28 days, what would YOU do?With an impressive cast (Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have supporting roles), lots of satirical humor, and many questions to ask, Donnie Darko remains a wonderful movie that dares to be original and will leave you thinking and wondering long after the credits end.But the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is for the director's cut and the special features. In the Director's Cut Edition, the movie is clogged with excerps from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', a fictional book prominatly featured in the film. It didn't even really achieve what it meant to-offer a clearer answer to the film's twisty plot. They belong in the special features department, like the original DVD did. And the sound and visual affects added in completly ruin it, such as the sci-fi like sound affects in the opening credits-they were NOT needed and were better without it; It seemed like Richard Kelly took too many notes from 'E.T.' while cutting the film. And the topper comes at the montage/letter to Roberta Sparrow, a powerful intro to the famously poignant 'Mad World' sequence. The director decided to add of all things FIREWORKS. WHY FIREWORKS? They are a total distraction to the beautiful montage and are not needed at all.The special features are another story (actually, the same). The original DVD had an insightful commentary by star Jake Gyllenhaal and writer/director Richard Kelly (the much cluttered remaining cast and crew commentary could've been skipped), while this one features Richard Kelly and his friend Kevin Smith. This commentary doesn't say much about the actual movie, but rather sounds more like a conversation between two buddies over coffee and cigarettes. Vastly un-needed is the documentary about British people who loved the movie, as well as the short movie about the #1 Donnie Darko fan-it's more sad and disturbing (in the fact that someone actually loves any movie THAT MUCH) than funny. The least boring is the production diary with commentary by the cinematographer.If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly advise you to rent the regular DVD, form an opinion, then, if and only if you really loved the original movie, shimmy on down to the video rental store (or wait a day for your Netflix DVD to come in the mail) and watch this. While it isn't entirely a must-skip, only huge followers of the original will truly appreciate this."	4.0	Skip the director's cut-buy the original DVD!	2005-08-04	8	7	1

He hates ""horror"" movies, this is not a horror movie.My son is dark, mysterious, obsessed with death and things that go bump in the night.. As I watched this DVD, I could see why my son loves it. He is a Marine, off in Iraq right now. Bless his heart. So, to feel close to him, I watched this and his other fav - ""Napoleon Dynamite."" That one is another story.Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect for this roll. Couldn't have been done by anyone else. He had the looks down pat. the head down and look up, look. The innocent smile. The evil smile. The fear. The horny kid at the therapist.. He was made for this roll! He was excellent.The girlfriend, also very good. As were the mom, dad, sisters. all good, but, could have been done by most anyone. I was pleasantly surprised to see Drew Barrymore, and Noah Willey as teachers. Oh, and the shrill-voiced prude teacher - perfect.oh, geepers - the small, but important roll played by Patrick Swayze - that was something!Our dear Donnie... every mother's fear, to have a troubled son like this. As a mommy, I could relate. You want so bad for your kids to be happy, well adjusted, and SANE. But, Donnie is not any of those. He is troubled. He has visions and sees his friend Frank. Frank is a wee bit creepy, but, not scary really. and, in the end, we know where Frank came from.The most interesting and different ending ever. Not a cranked out ""Hollywood"" happy ending with all loose ends tied up. Nope. Sorry. You walk away with more questions. I like that.My Norman was confused. Not me. I ""got it"" and got it all. Which is funny, because he's the PHD scientist. Some men, well, they think too hard. You know what I mean?

It was sarcastic, ironic and different than any other film I have ever seen.  The ending was great, but it made me cry.  Donnie spends the entire movie (takes place during a 28 day period) trying to figure out if we all die alone.  While he does this, he falls in love, finds out how much his mother loves him and exposes town scandals.  Though the ending was clever, it made me sad to think that all of that never happened.  He goes back in time and the whole movie never happened and to top it off, he is killed.  While he listens to his hallucinations in the beginning of the movie and gets out of the house, he doesn't when he goes back in time and is killed by the time travel machine.  When the girl he fell in love with is asked if she knew him, she reply's that she didn't.  Though he does find that we don't die alone, it's still a little tragic.	5.0	Donnie Darko	2003-08-22	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	"I fell asleep on this film a few years ago when I started it too late the night before it was due back at the video store.  It's not what I expected of a so-called ""cult"" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the ""shock editing"" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with ""fast action"" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, ""Jacob's Ladder.""  And the time-travel theme owes less to ""Back to the Future"" than ""serious"" science fiction movies like ""12 Monkeys"" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: ""La Jetee.""But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange,"" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to ""condition"" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, ""The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,"" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the ""everychild"" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit."	5.0	A Sleeper (but don't fall asleep on it)	2007-01-25	13	11	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2GR152XX560WH	Samuel N. Starkey	This is up there with Memento as one of the top films of last year. The 80's references were great. There were the obvious ones like the Smurfs and the not so obvious, like how at the end, on their bikes, the kids look just like the kids in ET. The music was amazing and haunting. The ambiguity of the ending was a big risk, but I think it paid off. This is one you need to watch over and over again to analyze and think about. The DVD extras shed some more light on the storyline and the music video is a nice bonus. It's impossible to read the book in the extras on a 19&quot; screen, but luckily you can get it on the official website. The book puts a whole new twist on the movie.	5.0	one of the most original movies of 2001	2002-04-23	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3W2CZIHNO7785	santolita	This movie is an interesting and provocative reflection about death and the role of death in our life. The actors go well and the script is well written. You can't predict what's going to happen in the next moment. This movie uses a non traditional form of story telling (I would say similar to David Lynch's style) trying to reach the unconcious.The reason I like this movie is because it has a point (I won't say what it is). And after my initial sadness of thinking of my own mortality, the movie actually made me feel better about myself and death. This is not just some weird movie that appeals to the wanna-bes of this world.	4.0	interesting reflection about life and death	2006-01-28	7	5	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ABBYHOP59TRZF	Sara	I watched this movie for free on YouTube, and it is fantastic. I decided to buy it, since the resolution on YouTube is not adequate for quality viewing, and this is a movie I want to see again. At first, I was turned off by the inappropriate dinner table conversation and foul language at the beginning of the film, but it really displays the disfunctionality of the family, which is important to the plot. The mother especially comes across as cold. In fact, I cannot think of any wasteful moments in this movie that do not further the plot. Everything is relevant, which is very much a schizophrenic experience; this movie is a wonderful insider view of the schizophrenic mind. I could really relate to the main character, although most schizophrenics don't act on their thoughts by becoming violent. The twist ending is really satisfying. I was imagining that this movie would be bloody, but it isn't. It isn't quite a psychological thriller, either, just a really good, strange movie that makes you think.	5.0	Worth Owning	2010-04-25	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A12ZJAKMYZVM4Q	Sara	"I really enjoyed Donnie Darko. The movie intersects different people's lives and emotions in a very thought-provoking manner. It doesn't make in fun of paranoid schizophrenia, a disorder in which Donnie suffers from, but shows the depths of his degripping from reality and how it affects the people he loves, such as his family, his girlfriend, his friends, and his community/school. His intelligence also plays a key factor in how amazing and yet ironic Donnie is portrayed. The actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, etc, brilliantly showcased the anguish, pain, remote happiness that these characters dealt with. In most films,you never see the main character who has extraordinary intelligence, yet struggle with the same mind that gives them that same intelligence, plus the fact that he tries to find out more about what is making him have these visions of Frank, the demonic rabbit, is enduring. The concept of the end of the world/time travel is an amazing and original idea that I think, has never been captured so brilliantly in a film before. No one really talks about what would happen if we could go back in time and change what we did or said, or how we'd feel if the world suddenly ended. The fact that Donnie tried to find an explanation and then sacrifices his own life to give better ones to his girlfriend, family, etc. is touching. With the subject of the end of the world, it's wonderfuly projected how the people involved took time to give us Donnie's thoughts on what he thought about the world ending, how it made him feel, his conflictions w/ God, philosophy and simple everday life.Someone who isn't very interested in religion, philosophy, or science fiction,like myself, would have looked at this movie and been like, ""This looks like crap"", but I was fortunate enough to see the movie and see something different...original than what I have seen in movies today. A very warm, disturbing, yet original film that has inspired me not to take for granted the mental health I have, the family I have, the life I live. It is my best and all-time favorite movie in my life."	5.0	Just When You Thought Originality Was Dead!	2002-07-02	19	13	6

I will be grateful to that friend for the rest of my life because this movie is honestly the most amazing film I have ever seen in my life. Words cannot describe it. It was put together SO well, and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is remarkable. It's extremely hard to understand. The first time I watched it I just sat there staring at the screen thinking... what just happened. But after watching it again, and looking up some info on the movie, it makes more sense. But I think the movie was put together perfectly. The mystery of it is what makes it so unforgettable. The soundtrack is amazing as well. Wouldn't change a thing... although the ""smurf"" scene was a little too raunchy for my taste. Still pretty funny though. :) That's another good thing about this movie. It's got drama, comedy, horror... everything. Watch it, and really pay attention, and you will NOT be disappointed. :) By the way... to those of you who ""fell asleep"" during this film - what does that have to do with anything??

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	APEJ4UN2JQNSN	"Sasa Husaric ""sasa28"""	"This is a directorial debut for Ricard Kelly who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. The movie was first shown at Sundance Film Festival where it was met with a lot of enthusiasm and good reviews. This is what prompted me add this movie to my collection.Before watching the movie I tried not to read a lot about it's plot and in this case it was a good deccision. The story is about a troubled teenage boy who has vissions of a giant rabbit who predicts that the world will end in 28 days.In some ways this movie reminds me of ""12 Monkeys"" as it deals with time travel and the parradoxes connected to it. But the plot and the movies 1980's surreal subburban setting are highly original. The production designer Alexander Hammond (""K-Pax"", ""Men in Black II"") did an excellent job of capturing various setting in which the story takes place. Surreal feel to the movie is greatly helped by the beautifull cinematography of Steven Poster (""Someone to watch over me"").The movies cast is diverse. The lead role of Donnie Darko is extremly well performed by Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown actor to me. He does a nice job of playing an emotionally disturbed teenager and the best scenes are his confrontations with the rabbit. The rabbit is played by James Duval (""Gone in sixty seconds"").In the roles of Donnies teachers among other we can see Noah Wyle (""E.R."") and Drew Barrymore and they did a good but not a memorable performances. Aslo, Patrick Swayze appears in the role of righteous self help guru.But the real strong point of the movie is it's open and undefined ending which leaves you wandering and prompts you to think about it. Not everyone will like the movie but all will at least think about the massage it tries to tell. It is intentionally made this way and the director says so in the commentary. The story is intentionaly left to open interpretation by the viewer which is great."	4.0	Suburbia with a twist	2004-10-13	1	0	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3OPCQYY5JM2TJ	"S B ""sdb70"""	"First of all, you are probably wondering how such a great film could have flyed so long under the radar.  Unfortunately, 'Donnie Darko' is a victim of timing - the original release date was just 6 weeks after 9/11 and one of the majory plot points was eerily reminescent of another catastophe that happend immediately thereafter.From the two separate commentary tracks, you learn that Drew Barrymore ""god-mothered"" the production of this first major film by writer and director, Richard Kelly, and because the budget was a measly $4 million, the project became a true labor of love incredible cast, which includes Jena Malone, Jake Gylennhal, and his sister Maggie (who would put in a tour de force a year later with 'Secretary'), Noel Wylie, Mary O'Donnell, and Patrick Swayze.  This odd combination of one part comedy, two parts sci-fi comic, and three parts drama, which one reviewer described as David Lynch meets John Hughes, works.  The plot is refreshingly subtle, refusing to hit you over the head like its Hollywood-ized counterpart, 'Butterfly Effect', which arrived almost two years later.From the 20 revealing deleted/extended scenes, you realize that the film could have been much less secular and a better movie as a ""Director's Cut"".  Also, a physical version of 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' book (which explains much of the underlying world in this thriller) should have included in the package, as the pages on the DVD on illegible.SPOILER BEGINNING:  The writing is fantastic for a first time director, but having viewed the DVD in its entirety, I do have a problem with one of the plot points:  we know Donnie is highly intelligent and sleepwalks, but the script never really reveals Donnie's ""super powers"" (aside from the implication in the facts surrounding the trashing of the school), and as such, the fact that he is ACTING telekinetically to pull down the jet engine into the portal (as indicated by the writer/director) is completely lost on the viewer.SPOILER END."	4.0	Almost perfect	2004-10-17	5	4	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	"In Donnie Darko, I am vaguely reminded of the question put to the test in The Seventh Sign, where Demi Moore is asked, ""Would you die for him?""She doesn't understand the question until the ending.  In a way, I compare Donnie's dream, or alternate reality, to this question:  ""Would you die for love?""It also brings about another question, ""Is it better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all?""Donnie is odd, Donnie is strange; but Donnie is a likeable kid despite his problems.  He is on medication for troubles he has had in the past, and is struggling to ""just be normal"".  He meets a girl named Gretchen, and they find their first love; and it will be a never-ending love.  Gretchen has problems of her own, with her mother having to hide from a violent ex-husband.The movie starts with Donnie waking up in the middle of the street, in the hills above his home.  He brushes himself off and heads home only to discover that a plane engine fell out of the sky from nowhere and struck his room.  If Donnie did not suffer from somnambulism he would have been killed.Donnie does have friends at school, but he also has imaginary companions whom he speaks with, and as he tells his therapist, they sometimes tell him to do things.  Enter Frank, the large psycho looking bunny who tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Basically, the movie follows Donnie for these 28 days, through school and therapy and home, bringing in some very interesting characters like Grandma Death, and of course Frank; along with great small roles by Drew Barrymore as the teacher and Patrick Swayze as the self-help guru who doesn't make any sense.  You will love the scene where Donnie attends one of his seminars.It's rather hard to do a review of this movie without giving away any key information, and I urge you not to read any review that offers spoilers.  This is a movie that should be watched without knowing, so that all the emotions it provokes come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.The ending is very surprising, and left me with a question that will not spoil the movie for you;  did Donnie make the choice, or was the choice made for him?Your view of this movie will definitely be your very own, but I can guarantee that whether you love it or hate it, you will not walk away unscathed.It is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.  If you have been trying to decide whether or not to rent it, my advise is just do it and judge it for yourself.Enjoy!"	4.0	Dreams and Funny Bunnies	2004-02-02	4	2	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A18GTN5ZU74AHF	Scipio	"This is one of those movies that seems to come out with little fanfare or success and, after a while, the volume of the buzz rises until it becomes a ""cult"" film.First of all, this really is an original film.  That's a plus in my book.  Nowadays originality is very scarce in Hollywood.Secondly, this movie is seriously (and consciously) weird.  That's not necessarily good or bad, but it definitely helps with the cult status.Without retelling the story, I'd just say that it was generally satisfying.  It's hard to catagorize, but, as the name implies, it's a sort of modern film noir - with a little science fiction & horror mixed in.  It was very unpredictable, but things came together at the end - sort of.There are a few flaws.  I was mystified that Drew Barrymore was so badly miscast for the part of an intellectual teacher until I saw that she was an ""executive producer.""  Money talks.Another problem, common among ambitious, unusual films, is that the part of the movie that takes place in the ""normal"" world wasn't very believable.  The dialog, especially between family members, didn't seem realistic.  Nobody seems to mind or hardly notice that Donnie is tremendously strange - he has lots of pals and gets a girlfriend without hardly trying.  Donnie and his buddies go to what appears to be a privileged private school, but, then, it doesn't.  The school bullies seem waaay over-the-top, especially considering the well-to-do suburban environment.  I could go on...But, despite the flaws, this movie keeps you interested.  While the viewer is at first presented with the old question of how much of what happens in the film is real or just in the protagonist's mind, it goes well beyond that before it's done.  The ending, where the loose ends are tied up (or are they?) - accompanied by the perfect song - is particularly well done."	4.0	Original, But Uneven	2005-11-21	5	4	1

From the very beginning I was completely captivated. This movie held my attention from the beginning to the mind-boggling ending. This one of those great movies that comes along every once in a while (the one's that rarely get much attention) and makes you stop and take a look at the world around you and even take a look at yourself. It is a thinking movie and not one that can be casually watched while you're doing something else. It requires your full attention. Not only for the full understanding of what is going on, but the full experience itself. I don't even want to ruin the experience by giving anything away other than the fact that it is about a troubled teen, Donnie Darko, whose life begins to spiral out of control after being visited one night by a 'friend.' I hadn't even heard of this movie before, since I live in a city where this kind of movie wouldn't get the kind of reception it deserves. I happened upon it, and read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am glad I did. It's eerie, creepy, beautiful, thought-provoking, stunning, striking, enchanting.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A15WL4C4FDSILO	Scot Hatfield	You read this following statement many times, but I would have given this film 4 1/2 stars if possible.  I had wanted to catch this film in theaters (because the trailer made it look like a horror film), but it never came to my city.  So, I scooped it up on DVD ASAP.What a unique, powerful film!  This film is ultra-cool, without trying to be so.  There are elements of horror, but Donnie Darko is so much more.  There are scenes where I, a child of the 80's, laughed out loud in appreciation of references to that time.  There were times when I actually felt chills.  There were times when I was sure I knew where the film was going, only to find out I was dead wrong.  There were so many interesting subplots that were intentionally left wide open that my wife and I spent several hours talking about them before we even touched the main plot (which was left to interpretation as well).In conclusion, this may be one of those films that you need to watch only when you are in the mood for it, but it is a film that has does not fit in any genre out there right now.  It is as unique as another great film, Memento.  And the DVD is jam-packed with cool extras.  I would almost demand that you rent it, and I would definitely recommend buying this wonderful film.	4.0	Very cool, very different film!	2002-04-06	4	2	2

To be sure, the film is at times bizarre and quite weird, but also wildly original and inventive.

I'd heard of it before, (browsing Jake Gyllenhaal movies) and it seemed interesting but had never pursued it.After we settled in to watch it, I was completely hooked. It took alot of processing to grasp the plot, but trust me, it was worth all of that thinking! The only downside was that after I viewed this film, for a few nights after, 6 foot tall demonic rabbits began to creep into my peripheral vision.Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely stunning in this film, I forgot it was him for most of this movie and he became Donnie Darko- the confused, insane, teenager who wants to get off with pretty much every girl he knows (and then some). His body language, haunting eyes, limp posture, crooked smile, all create Donnie's presence.I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12 or so, (I'm 13). It's mainly rated R forviolence (not gory though)some drug use (I fail to see the harm in this)sexual references (come on, these are teenagers)and profanity (and not just the mild ones)Overall though, it's an excellent movie and I'm dying to see it again.	5.0	28064212	2006-02-26	3	3	0

It may be the shangri-la of independent film: a treasure known to, and appreciated by, only those who not only stumble upon, but choose to explore it. For myself and my fellow children of the '80s, it's enough to be nostalgic about the era in which it's set, but in addition, this film has all the ingredients of an astonishing film: a superb cast the gels in an unnaturally perfect fashion (including Drew Barrymore in a role that should be a breath of fresh air to those of us who loathed never been kissed), beautiful philisophical implications, and a story that never fails to take you in directions you never dreamed.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1GSTCPM8NRZRV	Sebastien Pharand	It's too bad that Donnie Darko never received that theatrical run it deserved, because I can say without a doubt that it IS one of the ten best film of the last decade. Genre entertainment doesn't get better than this!Donnie Darko is a very disturbed boy. He seems depressed, quite lost in his own life. Things happen around him, things he cannot explain, things he has no control over. His life just doesn't seem to make any sense. So when a very tragic incident occurs in his neighbourhood, his life will be changed forever.The plot is so twisted, the story line so messed up that it's impossible to explain what the film is about in just a few words. What I can say is that Donnie Darko offers one of the best story's I've seen on the screen in a very long time. Great performances, a great supporting cast and a great storyline makes this one a winner in my book.Now, with the new director's cut, we're offered more of this cult classic. Scenes are added and a new soundtrack, the one the director first wanted before money became an issue in postproduction, only inhence the great experience that Donnie Darko offers its viewers.This is one movie any film lover should see. Donnie Darko will amaze you, will leave you breathless, and will make you want to see this one again. I've seen it six or seven times already, and I just can't wait to see it again.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AHFUO6OAIZDOB	"""seedonniedarko"""	This movie is incredible. When this movie was in theaters I did not know anything about it. When I bought it on DVD I found out that my life would not be complete with it. It has so many twists and turns that my head was almost spinning. Although many people have not heard of this movie I hope one day they will see it and enjoy it just as much as me.Frank the man in the bunny suit. How original is that. Time travel? one subject that has not yet been explained that great in other movies before, is explained perfectly in this film. If you don't agree with me, so be it, but just for your information watch the movie, over, over, over, over, over, and over again to find out why I think it is so great and if you agree with me. GOOD FOR YOU.  See this movie if you have not already and enjoy it for the first time, or again for another time.Good Day.Soory if you had trouble reading this review, thank you for your time.	5.0	How can anyone not love this movie?	2002-07-11	2	0	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2KX4T6RS7VE5W	Seeker	I watched this film for the first time with extreme doubts, but very soon I was completely engrossed.  The story is deep, intriguing, and absolutely confusing--but in the best possible way.  It's certainly a film that needs to be watched at least twice for any clarity.In the movie, Donnie is a teenage boy in therapy whose insanity one day hits an extreme: a rabbit named Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days.  From that point on, the viewer watches as the days count down and Donnie's world gets darker, stranger, and filled with more &quot;advice&quot; from Frank.  There is really no way to describe how much happens in this movie, how many little events at the beginning tie into the end, or how much positive meaning there is underneath the surface details.  I can only recommend it and hope that others enjoy it as much as I have.	5.0	Amazing film!	2003-08-11	8	8	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A11D3LWZ9DV00Z	SE	"Donnie Darko is a rare mixture of suspense, comedy, horror, European cinema with a twist, and then some. Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal from Bubble Boy) is a bright student who's on therapy and visits his doctor who discovers Doonie's sleepwalking activities during a hypnosis session. He has a happy life and is not bitter about anything. One night hears the call of a 6-foot rabbit and goes on a sleepwalking stroll, while a jet engine falls through his room. The event changes his life, as the encounters with the strange rabbit are more frequent. The FAA doesn't know where the engine came from as no airline has reported one missing from their planes, and everything is a bit confusing for everyone. The movie has some interesting scenes like one where Patrick Swayze plays a local author and inspirational speaker who goes to Donnie's school to speak to the students, and Donnie asks him ""how much did they pay you to be here?"" followed by an awkward silence.There are a few scenes where style takes over substance, one with what looks like a slow-mo steadycam continuous shot through halls and then out to the yard of the school to sound of Tears for Fears. Some say that mentally ill people tell it like it is because of their condition, but here we have a bright student-Donnie- who is a little, or a lot-depends how you see it- Schizophrenic and takes every chance to just blurt out his personal opinion-and one with which many of us agree- about the system.Like the scene where his gym teacher asks him to read from a card with some sample life experience and draw an x between ""fear"" and ""love"" on the board to illustrate where his life's experiences fall with in the two. He tells the teacher ""it's not that simple...life's more complicated than that...one can't just categorize everything into two extremes..."" I won't tell you what Donnie told the teacher to do with her little cards but he ends up in the principal's office. Donnie sees some gel like extensions coming from their families bodies as if arrows that point towards the future, so he starts discussing time travel and wormholes with his science teacher, who stops taking about it when the ""G"" word enters their discussion: God. The teacher replies ""I can lose my job"". The movie is filled with these social observations. In school you can talk about the universe at length, but not about religion. The local celebrity (Sawyze), whom the gym teacher respects, is caught running a pornography ring from his basement. Drew Barry, the English teacher is let go because she doesn't fit in with the school's conservative values.The movie keeps us interested, because there's a smooth flow of scenes, and it has scary moments, not based on violence and blood, but on suspense, mood, and wonder. Where did the rabbit come from, what's the meaning of the strange messages it tells Donnie?Is it just an illusion? Then why did it save his life? Is Donnie a psychic? All these questions are answered but not like you'd expect. There are twists and turns like in any drunken pretzel. This is not your typical formula, and at the end we feel the movie works not because of it's ending, but because of the trip there."	5.0	Different, original mix that works	2003-05-16	6	5	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2VUL8A9MGTAA6	Seth H. Peterson	I held off on getting this for quite some time. I ended up getting it because i lent my copy of the original to my brother and he kidnapped it. The commentary track on this version is much better than those on the original -- i thought Drew overly-dominated the cast commentary and i was somewhat annoyed by the Richard Kelly & Jake one, the director seemed overly concerned with explaining what the h&*^ was going on. This commentary is like that too, but Kevin Smith makes it MUCH less pretentious and clinical, much more organic. Aside from the commentary, the UK documentary and the #1 fan documentary are really interesting, the production diary less so.So, i view this set as all bonus features to be enjoyed by fans. The actual director's cut version of the movie, i dunno. The original is one of the best movies made. It's nice to see the added scenes where they should fit chronologically, but this version doesn't really seem necessary. Except that because of it we get all the extra features, which do enhance the experience, ALOT.	5.0	worth it, even if you have the original	2005-07-16	4	4	0

Yeah it has ""cult fave"" all over it; but just because it takes a few chances and defies a category doesn't mean it is a seminal or stellar piece of cinematic history.The portrayal of the 80's is spot on and sparked a quick trip down memory lane.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1SWC1LFNQJS6S	"Seville ""ourherochicago"""	"Like a movie iPod, ""Donnie Darko"" cycles through several familiar tropes: there's the Rift in the Space Time Continuum, not in deep space or the future, but in the Seemingly Ordinary Town Where Nothing is As it Seems, also surreally exemplary of the Hypocrisy of American Suburbia. There we meet the Troubled, Misunderstood Loner who occupies both a Waking Dream and the Painful Gravitas of Adolescence, and walks the Tightrope Between Genius and Madness... you get the idea. There's not one, but two Deus Ex Machinas bookending the movie: the first a literal god-machine falling out of the sky (we even see it suspended from a crane, just like in one of Euripides' plays); the second an ""It Was all a Dream"" sequence. Each turn the chief clich&eacute; about deus ex machina... that it's an escape hatch for an unskilled storyteller who's run out of ideas... on its head by making it the basis of this bravely entropic, mesmerizing story instead of a clumsy copout.These themes have been explored so many times, and so often badly, that the threat of clich&eacute; should be overwhelming and constant. But neither we nor Donnie are ever explicitly told this is a sci-fi movie. Since a parallel universe would look just like our own, how could he (or we) know? Everybody ""knows"" that an alternate universe is highly unstable and threatens to collapse the real one, but who can really say why? Such understanding is seemingly embedded in the hive mind of human DNA; it was probably there before such a story was ever told. ""Donnie Darko"" exploits these profound, resonant themes with a poignant touch. By setting the End of the World in 1988, the movie humanizes its futuristic plot with the elegiac, selective patina of memory.We learn in the Director's Cut commentary that writer-director Richard Kelly began his script as a stream of consciousness and worked backwards. He tries to reach an internal circle of logic that he never quite figures out how to close, and we're all the richer for this slight failing. Kelly claims that each of the characters are subconsciously helping Donnie fulfill his mission, for instance... which he never adequately conveys on screen. But such ""shortcomings"" make ""Donnie Darko"" play like a classic rock album side, or a poem excerpted from a Thomas Pynchon novel. Even in this slightly more explicit Director's Cut, ""Donnie Darko"" re-casts that most plot-bound of genres, science fiction, as lyric.Kelly's plot dumps any pat exposition of time travel's well-known logic in favor of broad, painterly strokes.  ""Donnie Darko's"" many moods... reverie, thriller, ghost story, drama, satire...  probably wouldn't flow with the same engrossing continuity had Kelly ever found a way to close those nagging gaps in plausibility. Each genre, instead of jarring the viewer out of the story, becomes a deeper fold in the maze of the minotaur's lair. Intentionally or accidentally, the film strikes the perfect balance between authenticity and mystique... with most of the former carried by Kelly's quirky, perfectly cast portrait (especially Jake Gyllenhaal) of a dynamic, intelligent and caring family who at once exemplify and transcend the typical foibles of the upper middle class.The film's other anchor in plausibility is visual; its concrete geography (the wealthy American suburbs) and distinct, recently lived cultural history (the 1980's) are filmed with a documentarian's eye. It's a clever extension of the historical-fiction, the-personal-is-political conceit: a time-travel story about the fate of the universe that's uniquely timebound and never leaves the hero's neighborhood, keeping our attention on its characters' hearts and minds. Because the film never resorts to a facile description of its own logic (a sometimes annoying ""shortcoming"" of life itself), the well-worn clich&eacute;s of time travel are restored as a vessel (a portal, if you will) to ""Donnie Darko's"" deeply human, profound themes.Only after Donnie fulfills his heroic mission do the lives he's saved get a fleeting, disembodied glimpse of his sacrifice. Even the audience isn't quite sure what Donnie's accomplished. We wake, with the whole town, from the film's dream logic to its final, tragic consequence. We only know, from Donnie's laughter and the peaceful (return to) sleep he faces his fate with, that his victory has brought him a happiness and comfort no earthly existence ever could.""Donnie Darko"" isn't a puzzle you solve. Because we're never comforted with a solution, our empathy stays squarely with Donnie, as we join his struggle to understand man's place and purpose in a universe where Everyone Dies Alone. And because these, like the movie itself, are insoluble riddles, we watch again and again."	5.0	A shared dream	2009-02-16	5	5	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ZGTC4AVTDVVR	"S. Franz ""Samson"""	"I would like to start by saying that I am a great fan of the movie Donnie Darko. That being said, I may be guilty of some bias.As I said in the title, this is truly a brilliant film. Its depth and originality provide something so rare in modern cinema that simply watching this movie makes one feel like one has tripped through the mud of popular movies and inadvertently kicked up a small piece of gold. There are countless ""Teen Angst"" movies, but few actually show the depth of the open-ended questions we all discover in our youth. The main character, aptly named Donnie Darko, faces not only these universal dilemmas but also his own schizophrenia. Donnie finds himself pondering one of mankind's oldest questions: What is the point of living if everyone dies alone? The storytelling never falls flat and the actors never try to over-act as seen in so many Academy Award-winning ""masterpieces"". The brilliance of this film could never be properly conveyed in words alone.That being said, This poster has a serious complaint about this new cut. If it was possible for a new ""director's cut"" to surpass George Lucas's re-release of the original Star Wars Trilogy in its ability to leave a sour taste in one's mouth, it is this movie. This cut provides no new scenes that were not available as extras on the 2001 DVD release. What it does include is pointless ""scifi-esque"" effects such as a close-up of a human eyeball twitching. There is honestly no reason for this nonsense to be edited into such an excellent movie. Another bit of added information comes in the form of book pages being superimposed over a few scenes. This is also superfluous as the entire book from which these pages are taken was included in the extras of the 2001 release.The movie itself deserves five stars, but this new DVD is a worse edit than the new Star Wars DVDs. Please, buy the original 2001 DVD release; you will have a much better experience."	4.0	A brilliant movie poorly re-edited	2005-03-10	4	3	1

Two things will occur to you after watching this movie for the first time.  The first is that you will want to discuss the movie in detail with anyone who has seen it. And the second is that you will want to watch the movie again to try to answer questions you have come up with.  As far as the meaning of the movie, I would have to say that is up to you to decide.  I have seen this movie end to end probably 30 times, even once with the comentary on and each time I have come away with a different theory of what is going on.  Though I try to stay away from pop culture I am very excited to see this movie come back into the light.  Even if the movie is a bit to deep sounding for your tastes try it out.  I mean come on it has everything from anarchistic destruction of schools, to Patrick Swayze as a child molester, to political debates at dinner.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	ADGLHK4FIYWYK	"""sharkeyboy69"""	"to be honest, i first heard of this movie from a friend who had gone to see it. he completely hated it. i still dont know why.donnie darko possibly is the most creative and original movie in existance. it is omitted from all genres and categories, through its severely warped and twisted storyline, mixed with it's intelligent depiction of issues. jake gyllenhaal plays donnie darko, a schizophrenic adolescant on the verge of insanity, due to his insane amount of questioning life. after being confronted by a huge bunny rabbit curiously named Frank, Donnie begins to hallucinate and drift between the realms of reality and.. well, fantasy. the most intriguing aspect of Donnie Darko is its enigmatic and ominous nature. Gone are the shallow teen flicks with bright colours and pretty faces - this movie is dark. very dark. after watching this movie, you will definitely say, ""ok, so what actually happened?"" this alien concept is fantastic - the audience is left confused, yet they are still entertained. the compelling storyline draws you to think for hours upon hours of what the movie was about. then you will watch it again. and again, and again. this movie sits you down, tells you to shut up and pay attention. the scary thing is, you do what you're told. another fantastic aspect is Kelly's portrayal of Donnie's environment. kelly successfully and effectively manages to convey modern-day life in america in the 80s, and in turn shows how Donnie's domestic situation helps to further create confusion for him.The movie follows donnie and how he deals with his new look on his life. Richard Kelly amazingly submerges the audience into a completely different world, and delves into the human psyche to convey how warped donnie really is. with credit to acting, gyllenhaal makes an undoubtedly memorable performance. it's also VERY chilling - you WILL shudder with disbelief and suspicion when Donnie asks Frank why he wears ""that stupid bunny suit"" only to receive the clear, but implicit statement - ""why do you wear that stupid human suit."" chilling indeed.this movie WILL be remembered in years to come - mark these words. If Scarface can do it, Donnie Darko has all possibility. and after watching this movie - you will believe that anything is possible."	5.0	holy jesus!!!!	2003-06-17	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"It's not immediately obvious what kind of movie this is, I'm still working on it. Part satirical social commentary, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci-fi movie, and part horror flick; like David Lynch masterpieces, it probably requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.But that's the genre-defying beauty of Donnie Darko. It springs effortlessly across themes to create a gorgeously ominous atmosphere. The screenplay flirts with perceptions to inspire a dreamy curiosity without actually explaining the twisted universe of time travel that drives a teenager to the film&#8217;s startling climax.Sure, like any other work of art, it has its issues. There are bits that are simply impossible to make sense of. For instance, a scene with a couple of men and Drew Barrymore, where they abruptly say ""Donnie Darko"" and then giggle. What was that about?One could also say that the movie trips a little in the last quarter by tossing some random stylish punches in an effort to keep the audience interested. The result is somewhat confusing if not inconsistent. Who was Frank really? We are led to believe that he was a figment of imagination, but as it turns out, he was a real character. I am still trying to work this one out.Regardless, whatever it is, whatever it resolves to and ""means"", I highly recommend this mosaic for its dynamics rather than its ""story"". How many movies can successfully pull off a six-foot bunny as a creepy character!

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2DZGUSFD7B09M	Sheriff kabany	(Donnie Darko) Dir: Richard Kelly 2001First of all I salute the director for his trend in thinking of our nature of reality and existence which really deserves the shedding of our thoughts.Although the Eighties were relatively near era with none very signifying features to be represented by, the atmosphere of the movie is amazingly indicative, you really feel that this movie was shot in the eighties.This movie has a very original plot, especially amongst those pillars of remakes and sequels we are compelled to watch every year, here we have a unique case in demonstrating ideas, to cover the plot with a quilt of pseudoscience as a metaphor of our direct perceptions.Mr. Kelly is hiding his original overall concept about our reality, existence, death and after all the after life. But I forgive him for he was aware that the audience will reject that all the solutions will be resolved by a dream, which is becoming a relic plot device.At the first place let us not to forget it is the Eighties, so the world obviously did not come to an end. So the other interpretation for the rabbit's warning must have one of the following probabilities:1) If Mr. Darko is still sane enough, so it is his own world which is going to end.2) Or the whole dream is a part of his delusions.I choose the first probability:And now, Let us return to the opening scene when Darko is awaken and standing up from his sleep on the road (this place might be his after life residence), he awakes with a satisfactory smile filling his face that is due to his rewarding dream, the dream in which he was alternately showed what is the effect of his prolonged existence on his beloved ones would be if he had not died.Yes you began to catch Mr.'s Kelly concept which says that &quot;every dying individual is rewarded by a satisfactory dream before he die&quot; a dream in which the deceased one know that his time on earth is up for considerable reasons.If you do not consider my explanation, let's revise the following tips which may support my assertion:1) Darko main terror is the fear of death2) Watch carefully for center of the falling jet engine it has a mark of a painting of a swirl just like the type of paintings we can only see in amusement parks, it is a hint that what we are seeing is a dream sequence.2) There elements of dream pseudo-reality:1) Fear is not antonym to Love as it has been taught in theLessons of spirituality.2) Graham Greene's graphic novel is impossible to be part of the curriculum in the USA high schools during the eighties.3) All the pseudoscience of time travel and &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; book are a dream resolutions (I personally had experienced those kind of dreams in which you can fix any problem with a very then convincing solutions and just after you wake up with the pride of victory you discover it was nonsense hokum, for example my testing days of I dreamt once while I was studying for math test of equations so nave that I was awaken very convinced of my invention, and seconds later as they vanish, I recognize they were the daughters of my dreaming mind)4) Watch out for Mrs.' sparrow whispering quote is a reminiscent of his personal terror (fear of death) &quot;Every living creature on earth dies alone&quot;.5) The song mad world reveals it all6) All the declination of his mental state and its consequences (sabotaging the school, the death of his girl friend, killing (Frank) the rabbit and the death of his mother and sister) are better is interpreted as part of his dream.I admit very much this movie for it is a character study about the titular young man who is losing it for a not very clarified although intricate reasons.If you like that movie I strongly recommend.David lynch's Mulholland drive, Lost highway Adrian Lyne's Jacob's ladder and of course Soderbergh's Solaris.	5.0	&quot;The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had&quot;	2003-11-03	109	45	64
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AYBXGH8ZR15NK	Shikhar Dixit	"Written and Directed by Richard Kelly (ASIN: B00005V3Z4)Any reviewer would be hard-pressed to discuss this film without giving away significant details. Donnie Darko is a snake eating its own tail, a story where the circularity of the plot is an integral part of its enjoyment, and so many seemingly insignificant moments through the film prove crucial to the end result, a kind of dark surprise different from any of the tired twists found in recent big-budget films.It is 1988. A borderline schizophrenic teenage boy, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is haunted by visions of a man-sized rabbit named Frank. In addition to the prophetic announcement that the world will end in ""28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds,"" Frank forces Donnie to commit a series of increasingly serious misdeeds.As if this is not enough, a crash course in Einstein-Rosen bridges aka wormholes by physics teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle,) along with a copy of The Philosophy of Time Travel, convinces Donnie that a ""fourth dimensional construct"" has touched down right in his home town, allowing him to see such apparently hallucinatory events as streams of computer-generated liquid that hint at people's intentions.Set to an eclectic 1980s soundtrack, and also starring Drew Barrymore (producer for this project,) Mary McDonnell and yes, Patrick Swayze, Donnie Darko is deliberately vague as to its genre--the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully. The setting is vintage to the time period, but not prone to the heavy-handed display of era-specific props as other near-period pieces.The DVD (from CBS/Fox Home Video) contains the 113 minute feature film in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1,) deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, director's commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, the The Philosophy of Time Travel, music video for covered 80s song ""Mad World"" and an art gallery with production skills.This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and English and French Dolby surround."	5.0	Brilliant and Original	2011-01-24	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2AN988COWP49T	Shiragami Hiromi	"The way I came across this film was so coincidental, or,  gsynchronistic h, if I may say as a self-assigned Jungian. It was just when I finished to watch the film:  gA Beautiful Mind h on DVD and was deeply moved by the extraordinary life with schizophrenia of the Nobel Award winning mathematician John Nash when my 15 year old daughter came in and said that she had just watched  gDonnie Darko h with her friends and she thought I should watch the film. Actually, although I knew the scary looking rabbit face on the jacket of the DVD, I knew nothing else about  gDonnie Darko h and it was just because I found the DVD on sale in a shop on the very next day, and the whole cast seemed promising to me, I bought it not knowing how great the magnitude the film would give me.I recognised Jake Gyllenhaal fs face just because a week ago I just saw the film  gThe Day After Tomorrow h and I liked his performance. Then I was totally stunned by the back ground music  gKilling Moon h by Echo and the Bunnymen, who were my heroes in  gOctober 1988 h, the very emotional period when I got married to the man who had introduced the band to me and is the father of above-mentioned daughter who was in my tummy at that time sharing my body fluid.I watched through the film with awesome and yet strangely familiar feelings towards Donnie Darko. Actually, his character, his being, the events happened to him, the whole thing in the film, was not strange to me at all. The film was like isotonic to my body fluid. It completely absolved me. I watched the whole film three times without break. I couldn ft help immersing myself in the film. I had become Donnie Darko.Although I have never been under medication, I knew what is like being  gborderline schizophrenic h because I, too, used to see and hear things in my adolescent years like Donnie Darko does. I had an  gimaginary h friend who was absolutely real to me and always said what I thought the truth. Truth about the nature of human being. About the life and the  gsupreme being h. I still cannot figure out if he was real, or just very realistic  gdaydream h, or product of schizophrenia.Like Donnie Darko met the book  gPhilosophy of Time Travel h, coincidentally or  gsynchronistically h, in the mid 70 fs, when I was a  gtroubled h adolescent, I met the books of Philip K. Dick like  gA Scanner Darkly h,  gMartian Time-Slip h and the  gValis h trilogy in early 80 fs and so on, to which in my personal view  gDonnie Darko h echoes immensely.Philip K. Dick, who was famously in suffering from mental illness himself until his untimely dearth in mid 80 fs, once wrote (though I cannot recall his exact words):  gGod changes the appearances of surroundings and the environment of yours so that it looks the time has past. h  I don ft think the  gtheory h should be proved mathematically, but I know it tells the truth. (O.K., I accept if you think that that is precisely because I am schizophrenic.)Anyway, through every story he wrote, I thought I got the message; the true nature of the faith is very similar to the form of insanity. In other words, you never be able to tell if a man telling you truth about God fs message or he is just purely insane. You have to know, however, your pure  gfaith h (to anything) can be used by both God (or, just say  ggood force h) and the Devil (or, again, just say  gevil force h), so you got to be careful. Look at the fascist like behaviour of Mrs Kitty Farmer, an advocate of the  gOvercome-the-Fear h cult of Jim Cunningham,  gcaricaturisticly h played by Patrick Swayze.The fear of apocalypse Donnie Darko (and I guess everybody) has is to fear of unknown. If you don ft know what happened when you die, the death can be unbearably horrific event. Donnie didn ft know what  gFrank h is telling him was actually a gospel to him, to save the life of the girl he deeply and truly loves and to save his own soul from succumbing to the fear. So, in the end (or the beginning), Donnie smiles contentedly because he now knows everything he should know as a human being. (I don ft say that he knows  geverything h like the God does. No one should, nor have to, I think.) You never know if Donnie fs Mum and little sister will still be on the plane ""again"", but at least he should have changed the course of lives of some people he related / would have related in the  gfuture h for good. I have heard that in the Bible it is said that when an apocalypse comes the God transfers his selection of people to the new world that exactly looks like the old one so the people never know they have been actually  gsaved h. But to some people a tiny fragment of the event remain in their memory like a dream you cannot recall. The fragments of what Donnie has done to the people  gin the future h are scattered onto the people fs unconscious memory like fairy dust.I think that thought is beautiful. It makes this film poignant and yet, somehow, soothing on each view."	5.0	The Rapture	2004-07-07	10	5	5
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A11YJFJHW2XH5O	"""sillycanadian"""	Donnie Darko is the type of movie that defies description, not only because of the melange of several different genres, but because of the feeling it leaves you once the end credits roll.  I saw this movie for the first time this past year at University and at the end of the movie I just sat there shaking my head, my jaw dropped to the floor.  I proceeded to rave about the film to my dorm-mates, and they would always ask me &quot;What's it about?&quot;  My reply would always be &quot;I can't tell you.  Not because I don't want to give anything away, but because it is impossible to describe.&quot;  Then after they watched it I would ask them what they thought, and the number one response was a look of amazement followed by &quot;You're right, I can't describe what I just saw.&quot;  I should follow that up by saying every single person who I told to watch the movie loved it and raved about it to their friends, who in turn fell in love with the adventures of Donnie.The cast is superb, the script is perfect, the score is beautifully haunting, and Richard Kelly displays an enormous talent in directing his first major film.  There are numerous moments where you just can't believe how good, or how touching, or how poignant, or how mysterious, or how perfect a scene is.  I can't physically tell you what happens plotwise, but I can tell you that you will be blown away as I was.The DVD is very high quality for the price with very good picture quality, excellent sound, and great menus.  It is packed with special features, some are wonderful (the Mad World music video and the deleted scenes with director commentary,) some are unnecessary (a picture of the soundtrack.)  The commentaries for the feature are an excellent complement to the film.  One has director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhall providing wonderful insights, and the other has at least 7 cast and crew members (Kelly again, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Jena Malone, and several others) reminiscing in glowing terms on their experience.  The camaraderie that you feel between them is wonderful, and the movie is seen as a labor of love for each person.This movie makes a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.  I have yet to convince someone to watch it and have them tell me they thought it was anything less than amazing.  You will feel the same way, no matter what your tastes.	5.0	Indescribably brilliant	2003-07-06	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2WPI6O7IRTPI6	Siren	this is a movie that tries to be something it is not...deep.  Yes, that is right.  This is not a deep, meaningful flick.  Not even Richard Kelly knew what the heck is was doing or even why he did it. The reasons he did give were so incredibly dissapointing and plainly idiotic.  He gets kudos for reading a couple of familiar and meaningful books but that is all.  It is just fantastic how many try to articulate supposed meanings into this film when not even its writer/director knew what the heck he was doing. There is more substance in the attempted interpretations than this film could ever have.  It is amazing how people let their imaginations run wild in trying to decifer reasons.  this is a good film to watch while reading your favorite book on a comfy couch..	2.0	Come on People!	2004-11-10	33	4	29
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1SWBS6EJXEUTZ	Sir Grand Citizen	I can't. There is no way for me to really express just how amazing, how thought-provoking and compulsively WATCHABLE this movie is.  I've watched it three times, and know I will watch it again at least three more times.  The story is incredible, and the concepts which are fully fleshed-out (but still left for the viewer to discover) are fascinating.Having been a film fanatic for the past 25 years (since I was 8), and being a HUGE fan of offbeat cinema, I expected to be let-down by this movie.Quite the opposite.It's one of those films where, once you've seen it, you begin planning when you can watch it again, and whom you can drag-along for the ride.The genius of this film is that all of the elements are IN the picture, but it's up to the audience to piece it together, and once they DO it still leaves lots of room for alternate theories.  It's the kind of film that raises as many questions as it answers, and NOT in a frustrating way. The film can be re-watched many times and it's not like the previous veiwings will ruin the effect; rather, they enhance it. Knowing what follows makes the film all the deeper, the messages all the more relevant, and the different trains-of-thought about &quot;what it all means&quot; all the more captivating.I can't recommend this film enough.  The only movie of late that knocked me off my feet this way was MULHOLLAND DRIVE.BTW, the DVD is great. The image is a bit soft (source materials?), but the audio (5.1) is AMAZING, and the bonus features are plentiful (the deleted scenes are over 1/2 an hour long, and they're NOT just throwaways).Very, very recommended.	5.0	How can I express how AMAZING this film is???	2003-01-03	7	7	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A19MHOF8RVQOWN	"S. Johnson ""heartsurgery"""	I bought this movie on the recommendation of a Target employee who fiercely recommended it but couldn't readily explain it. Despite being extremely confusing, it absolutely rivets you to your seat with suspense and slowly reveals the truth. Insignificant events turn out to have meaning. You dont know if Donnie is crazy or not. What is real, what is not? Do things really happen by chance? Are things really how they appear?Just like the previous reviewer, I watched this movie three times in the same night. There are clues carefully placed throughout the movie alluding to what's coming. I guess the reason I never considered buying it was the title and the box. The box looks like a Friday 13th/Freddie movies and doesnt accurately reflect the depth of this movie. And the marketing, I never heard of the darn thing.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD I felt should have been included in the movie. Since Donnie's hallucinations are increasing in severity and frequency, his shrink doubles his dosage. The scene left out is where the shrink tells Donnie he's been taking placebo's all along! That would have freaked me out, and I'm sorry the director chose to delete that scene. Missing this movie is like missing the Sixth Sense.	5.0	Riveting	2002-11-09	6	4	2

He got Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain (2005). And he gets Jena Malone in Donnie darko.The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is a 2+ hour episode of The Twilight Zone. It deals in time travel, the butterfly effect, and the whole ""what would happen if certain events in the past didn't happen or were changed"" thing.And apparently the formula works. At the time of this writing the average Amazon rating is 4+ stars with almost 1000 reviews to back it up. Wow.Well, I say, what we have here is a good movie with a loyal following. Hence, Donnie Darko, for whatever reason, has become somewhat of a Cult Classic. But a 5 star film??? No. You have GOT to have Rabbititis to think that THIS is a 5 star film.Donnie Darko is an interesting movie. Its Director Richard Kelly has a very short resume, so kudos to him for creating such a buzz around such a mediocre psychological adventure.A lot of the situations are real and fun to watch. But the time travel part is the real point of the movie, which is bizarre and not easy to follow even if you are paying attention.So, if after all that you are as I was inclined to give Donnie Darko a try based on the raves...rent it as I did. Then perhaps make the purchase if the movie compels you to join the group that makes this film a classic...a ""Cult"" Classic."	3.0	Rabbititis	2006-12-18	0	0	0

This film is incredible in the way it makes you doubt. I still don't know if Donnie was mentally ill or the world was acually falling apart around him. I would recomend to see the DVD of this film because there are loads of deleted scenes that will further explain the characters, not to mention the two commentaries included which also might answer some questions. But expect one thing about this film; you most likely will NEVER be able to find solid answers to all the questions you will have after watching it. It was made to be open to interpretation.One thing that really suprised me about this film was it's special effects, for an independant film the effects are the best I've seen so far.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AG1E3QENF9SLN	snapper	"This movie was often showcased in ""My Recommendations"" on Amazon. I just overlooked it, and continued on my way through the site - though I did enjoy hearing the title track and cover of Tears For Fears' ""Mad World"" by Gary Jules. Last weekend, I came across the DVD in the under $10 bin at a local store, and figured it was worth a shot. The box said little about the plot, and I figured I needed to keep my opinion here relatively the same.Initially seeing Drew Barrymore (and her company, Flower Films) as one of the executive producers, I expected some pop, bubble gum, teen flick along the lines of her bookend Charlie's Angels with a Final Destination undertone. To my surprise this Richard Kelly script delivered a stark and sterile vision of life though often over-medicated American eyes. It places the 6'-tall rabbit of ""Harvey (1950)"" into the setting of darker ""Magnolia (1999)"" and its self help videos, with a dash of Alan Ball (American Beauty/Six Feet Under) into a blender, but comes out original and enjoyable. Don't wait two years (like I did) to see it, and don't read all the plot spoilers leaked everywhere else - just watch and discover it for yourself. It will be good to see if Richard Kelly can continue this creative and smart style of filmmaking."	4.0	Not another teen movie... in fact, far from it!	2004-01-05	2	2	0

I know it had some cheap corners cut, that some of the otherwise strong actors (Drew I mean you) were just off, but something about it just works.  And no, I won't pull the ultimate prententious statement and say that anyone who dislikes it ""just must not get it"", it is a little complex but it is no Momento.  You do need to carefully watch some parts to see how it all fits together and at the end, you will be faces with putting the pieces in back, but it is not crazy complex.Perhaps it is the music...as a child of the 80's it was spot on.  Maybe it was the perfect casting...everyone of the younger actors shines.  And maybe I just got caught up in Sparkle Nation (sorry you'll have to see it if that does not register).

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A10C5CJK1YKGV0	Steffan Piper	"This film could possibly go down as the greatest film on teenage detachment ever made. If Hollywood could ever get their act together and make an adaptation ofThe Catcher in the Rye, we might actually have another contender, but as it stands currently, and barring all the false starts and problems the aforementioned project seems to be cursed by, Donnie Darko may just be the last word. At best, this really is a genre splitting debut feature about time travel, alternate dimensions, Castanedian Philosophy and even an introspection into the true nature and place of those would-be personalities, the Smurfs. At worst, it's the greatest contribution the Emo sub-culture to date, out-stripping The Cure.I've seen this movie a few hundred times now, and if you knew me you'd probably understand that it's not that strange of a boast at all for me to say it. I currently own three different versions of this and have sifted the contents and commentaries of all of them. The Original Theatrical Release, The Director's Cut (White Box) and the Region 2, UK Release (Black Box with hologram). So far, my favorite is the Original Theatrical release and for the following reasons.1. Richard Kelly tells the viewer in both versions of the Director's Commentary that he could never get clearance or the money for the songs he wanted to do the film with originally and was `forced' to change some of the music after he toured the film with festival rights. Well ... in all honestly, it was probably for the better that he didn't have the money. I can't bear to watch the film start with the alternate music. Echo and The Bunnymen's `The Killing Moon' is a perfect and very haunting opus-like opening to the film that should have never been messed with in retrospect, regardless of whatever came before it. Tampering with it in such a way is like taking `As time goes by' out of Casablanca, which Michael Curtiz and Jack Warner would've done had Ingrid Bergman not cut her hair and been unavailable to do reshoots and pick-ups.2. The fireworks at the end is superfluous and a bad choice of visual effects to have man-handled inappropriately into the film. It comes off as a thuggish way to treat the original, without doubt. The eyeball visual and the ocean waves are interesting and seem to fit the tone, but anything after that is just grasping at amateur theatrics.3. While I do appreciate the additional scenes and the on-screen text of `The Philosophy of Time Travel', it does add to the film, but with the other two mentioned points and the shifting of key music, it negates whatever is gained by the on-screen text.I remember when Donnie Darko was released and was being advertised with the ad campaign posters all over Hollywood. They were able to secure the large billboard on the corner of Fairfax and Hollywood Blvd and I remember thinking: `Wow, what an odd looking poster. What the hell is that all about?"" But I never saw a trailer once.The ad campaign this film received was atrocious to say the least and it was no fault at all of the filmmakers or flower films, but a direct failure of 20th Century Fox executives who didn't really know what to do with this, even though teen horror was the biggest grossing money-makers in the business at the time. All they needed to do was just advertise it and let the masses decide to go see it. Typically though, almost every modern classic has been panned or mishandled and sometimes this just adds to the beauty and the lore that follows the film ever after.Unfortunately, the film hit theatres in limited release (LA, NY) just a week and half before 9-11, and much like David Fincher'sThe Game, which was sunk by the death of Princess Diana, Donnie Darko suffered an equal fate and quietly slipped out of theatres robbing Kelly of the immediate notoriety he should have garnered and does deserve. To be fair though, Kelly does have a pretty unstable reputation as a filmmaker and a Howard Hughes alaHell's Angelstype of aura regarding his movies.Southland Talestook much longer for Kelly to get out and into theatres than was ever needed, and he pretty much spent the 00's working on one film, where his peers put out 3,4 and 5 films, even with Tony Scott taking him under his wing. Work ethic is probably not the problem, but writing and post-production tinkering seems to be his Achilles heel.Donnie Darko will surely be remembered as his masterpiece. For several years the film had successfully supplanted and pushed out midnight viewings ofThe Rocky Horror Picture Showand their antic driven followers, for the much more morose Donnie Darko and the coffee-clatching style of discussion that often followed afterwards. Having attended both of those in my life, I do not elevate one over the other but enjoyed both equally.Everything about the Theatrical Release of Donnie Darko is pure magic and the stuff of great filmmaking. Kelly's writing here leaves just enough for the viewers imagination without spoon-feeding and raises enough questions to cause a prolonged dilemma.... ..."	5.0	Holden Caulfield called and he wants his movie back ...	2004-12-28	4	3	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A34F61YHP1KNAC	Steven Lee	Donnie Darko is a film that is incredibly complex? No, it's really not...not if you know what the film is really about.  Donnie Darko is more than a film it's a puzzle; I've finally put together the pieces after re-watching the film several times. If you've never seen this film you may want to stop reading this spoiler because I'm about to reveal the truth about Donnie Darko.  I've read many reviews about this film from critics and various members of the general public and nobody has ever explained what the film is about, WHY? Because they don't know.  I DO! Donnie is the second coming of Jesus Christ...he died at the end of the film because of peoples sins (To give them another chance to live).  There are many clues in the film about this. The cinema is playing the last temptation of Christ, Donnie's Psychiatrist tells him that if the world were to end then there would only be him (God) and you (Donnie) left.  Donnie cries after hearing this.  Frank asks him &quot;Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?&quot; Because he's Jesus.  Donnie's teacher tells him that an act of god would be the only way wormholes could appear out of nowhere.  Donnie explains to his teacher that it would be possible to travel in time along god's path. Frank is a vision from the future guiding Donnie to save the world.  Donnie floods the school so that he can meet Gretchen, he falls in love with her and she dies. Everything comes together so perfectly so that Donnie will save the world and die for people's sins. The plane engine is a rip in the space-time continuum (I.e. there's no need for it to be there) God uses Donnie to repair the rip.  Donnie calls Patrick swayze satin.  God is using Donnie to save humanity and Donnie Darko is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Ok! Now you know the truth about Donnie Darko... go and watch the movie again...if you don't own it...please buy it from Amazon.com today.  Everyone should experience the best DVD release of 2003 and one of the greatest films ever made at least once.  It's a love story, a science-fiction film, a movie about the dangers of self help, a time travel movie and it's also none of the above as explained in this article. Enjoy the film!	5.0	Read on for the truth about Donnie Darko.	2003-12-22	10	5	5
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"""Donnie Darko"" has just the right blend of quirky characters, scientific fascination, and narrative ambiguity to make it an instant cult classic.  While never quite as successful as its bigger budget cousins - darkly offbeat films such as ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Magnolia"" or the work of David Lynch - it's nevertheless a highly original and ambitious first feature which manages to impress. As does Jake Gyllenhaal, turning in a wonderfully unnerving performance as the troubled Donnie, his innocent looks making his behaviour even more chilling.  This is clearly a low-budget film, but for many audiences the grubby sound mix, poor lighting and (in places) very clunky writing will all be part of the charm.  If not, the 28-day countdown to cosmic doom will keep even the most jaded (or confused) viewers engaged.  Moreover, the late-80's fashions and songs make this film a particularly amusing 'wormhole' for the over-25's.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A28SC4ZQGE4E8T	Steven Swan	I first saw this movie on Bravo back when they weren't running reality shows all night long, and after seeing it a few times just kept wanting to watch it even more. Getting the DVD has revealed alot...and also opened up a whole other world if you will. I'm not one to understand what Universe the film is in at any given moment, or try to decipher how time travel works. I can only fathom that the movie is smart, bratty, and for the most part brutally honest about high school life (or whatever Middlesex is), Jr. High etc...and the variety of students you would encounter.Donnie is the independent one, who is smart enough to challange the norm, and stand up for what he believes...I think I understand why intelligent people are so angry and sometimes misunderstood, they see the world for what it is, they understand what is really going on around them, and they are really angry about it. Those of us who aren't intelligent to understand how we are being screwed, are just left in the dark, and it's up to Donnie Darko to save us all.Very good film holds your attention, with some comedic moments, from whimsical to some off color comments that like I said are kids being kids, not always polite, and the music..the music makes this film all the more enjoyable. Good to hear some more alternative sounds, even the music choices are smart and are a major factor in the atmosphere of the movie. An amazing film to watch , even if you are not able to understand it like me, the whole concept...at least makes you want to understand it little by little, even if you are distracted by great characters in interesting situations throughout this time.	5.0	Fascinating and Entertaining	2009-10-31	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" is a sprawling mess of a film.  It tries to be profound and thought-provoking but only winds up being maddening and pointless.High school student Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is having strange visions.  He is taking medication and seeing a therapist but still cannot shake his problem.  Is the man in the rabbit suit that he constantly sees really there or just a figment of his imagination?  Is the fabric of the universe really unraveling before his very eyes?  And is the world really going to end in twenty-eight days, six hours, forty-two minutes, and twelve seconds?""Donnie Darko"" strives to be intriguing but winds up just being plain weird.  It appears at the outset to be a tantalizing metaphysical mystery but it ultimately reveals itself to be a tale full of nonsense and dead-ends.  The only aspect of the film that comes off as being a positive is the strong acting.  Gyllenhaal does a great job conveying the confusion and conviction of his character while the supporting cast of Mary McDonnell, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Katherine Ross all turn in yeoman work.  Yet when ""Donnie Darko"" ends, you are left with the feeling that it should have been something much more than the spectacular failure that it is.  Then again, maybe it plays better in a tangent universe."	2.0	"""How's it feel to have a wacko for a son?"""	2006-04-30	14	6	8
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1WGMN0ESMW35G	STP	Simply put, this movie is mesmerizing. I'm sure you have read about the plot from other reviews so I will spare you the details. Basically this movie is unlike anything I have ever seen in a movie. I have seen reviews that compare it to other teen horror/drama movies such as final destination. Don't be fooled by these reviews, nothing you have ever seen is like Donnie Darko. To compare it to other movies is unfair. It's complexity is mind bending and leaves you wondering what could possibly explain what happened. After watching it multiple times I have given up trying to explain it with rationality and simply excepted that it is meant to be a mystery that is meant to be interpreted how you see it. I do not think there is a single explanation that sums up all that you see. The story gives you just enough to make you think you know what is happening until the ending which sends your mind racing back wondering what you just witnessed. The performances by the entire cast are exceptional. Never once will you watch this movie thinking about the actors. You are convinced by their portrayals of the charcters they represent, drawn into the movie and their environment. In summary Donnie Darko does something that I think all great movies do. It removes you from reality and transports you to a different place for an experience that you will never forget.	5.0	Darko is different and incredible	2006-05-31	5	4	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2AMWSLSNK8XQ7	Stryker Stereo	"When I first saw the trailer for this film I was thinking that it looked terrible. I mean, how many teen flicks does the world need? Also, Patrick Swayze's ugly mug popped up and I almost lost it! There was no way I was going to see this. However, after some time had passed and the film went to video/DVD whatever the hell people use these days, a friend of mine had rented it and was raving about how good it was. He told me that I would like it, then I said, ""Is that the movie with strange looking bunny rabbit thing"" and he responded with ""yeah that's it, but you just have to see the film to beleive it, the trailer does not do it justice."" So, I found myself at the video store renting Donnie Darko, somehow I was inexplicably drawn to it... Anyhow, I watched it and I was in awe. What a freakin' great film this is!! I was so into it that the next day I went home and watched it again from start to finish, I picked up a lot of the little nuances the second time around, could not figure out the fat jogger man in red outfit though, still working on that. Very funny, very moving, very thought provoking, interesting themes and ideas are generated in this film. Easily the best indie film of 2001. Oh, and as for ol' Patrick Swayze, don't worry he is not the main focus of this movie, plus he receives a splendid demise in the end. This film demands to be watched twice.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A36ER94271DHJZ	"stryper ""stryper"""	I went into this movie with no preconceived notions, having read only the DVD case and nothing else.I like a film that challenges the viewer to find their own meaning and doesn't just blatantly spell out every little nuance...But there is a big difference between a movie that challenges the viewer and one that just throws disjointed and half realized notions at you, and then expects you to make some kind of cohesive sense out of it.I liken this film to being given a box of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle pieces, which then, fail to actually fit together in the end.The film, The Jacket, did the whole time travel/twist on reality thing much better, even though it too asked the audience to stretch their imagination and use their minds, but the difference is, that this puzzle was solvable, as all of the pieces given, in the end, fell into place, and yielded something.Granted, that something might be different for each individual, but the point here is that something could be made of all of the pieces given.But with Donnie Darko, the end result was more like a who done it, where the killer turns out to be someone who just suddenly popped up in the last 2 seconds of the film, a cheat, if you like.Anyone can take a bunch of interesting concepts and throw them into a film, and tell the audience to figure it out for themselves, but that doesn't make it a good film, just a bunch of interestingly shaped and coloured puzzle piece that fail to actually fit together in the end.The emperor's new clothes, is what this film is trying to sell, but I'm not buying.	1.0	THE EMPERER'S NEW CLOTHES HAVE GOT NOTHING ON THIS FILM...	2006-12-23	42	12	30

It pretty interesting play on the time travel/alternate reality theme.  The small town feel adds to the movie's ambience and the Patrick Swayze scenes crack me up every time.  It doesn't really make any sense and you either like it because of it's ambivilence or you don't.The acting is exceptional by everyone except Gyllenhal but he isn't bad enough to ruin the movie.  I listened to the commentary by the director and Gyllenhal and I swear that guy is the most self centered annoying twit of all time.  WHO WAS THE AD WIZARD THAT CAME UP WITH THAT ONE! no but seriously he came off like a fifteen year old punk who just got his first movie and thought he was GOD.  The music rocks to this movie with some nice 80's music but unfortunately they didn't have enough money to buy the publication rights so the soundtrack so they just put out an instrumental soundtrack.Bottom Line:  Not for everyone but if you are a child of the 80's or a fan of originality check this out.	4.0	What a cool movie.....	2003-07-15	2	2	0

But then...let's just say, I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong; this is a great film regardless of what cut you're watching, but I found myself watching the director's cut and wishing for...a little less.The main difference I think, is the amount of explanation. The theatrical release is very ambiguous, very unapologetic, and very unexplained. I loved it. It forced you to draw your own conclusions, judgments, and explanations for the events of the film. The Director's Cut, probably in an attempt to answer all questions from fans and make sure that the message was not misconstrued, is very clear in its explanations and messages by comparison. And that, for me, kind of ruined the magic and mystery.Again, this is a fine film, so if this is the only version you watch, you'll probably love it. But I would suggest watching both versions, and deciding for yourself.	3.0	Too Be Honest, I Preferred the Theatrical Release	2009-04-12	4	4	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP	Takis Tz.	"Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.A brilliant deep-cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.A young teen diagnosed with bordeline schizophrenia starts having weird meetings with a human size rabbit who looks part alien, part reptile, part artificial, and who carries a message of doom for Donnie Darko (the boy, and yes, that's his name)..Donnie begins to take the message very seriously but simoultaneously he begins paying attention to the world around him and in him. He understands with the help of his ""friend"" that nothing you see and observe is accidental.Predictably, he comes at odds with the people he tries to convey this message to (""the world will end in 28 days""), he discovers that most people out there live on the surface of reality and not only they wouldnt dare take a dive underneath but wouldnt even consider there's something constantly eluding their awareness. Probably because their awareness is, hmm, defective?Donnie Darko, inspired by his visions ( or his deeper glimpse of reality) begins a personal trek of questioning, redifining and re-interpeting. The strange ""Grandma of Death"" (an old woman who years ago had written a book about time travel and spends her time ever since waiting for a ""message"" herself) becomes a focal point for Donnie. But Donnie tries also to squeeze as much information about the puzzle of reality from other people around him, most notably certain teachers, he attempts to piece things together and bond all these realities that appear before his eyes and mind together.The film is, as others have noted too, incredibly hard to classify. Viewers with a particular liking in the ""alternative"" will adore it as it encompasses loads of hints and direct references not only to time travel, but to parallel universes, telepathy and astral projection to mention but a few. But if the ""paranormal"" spooks you it has strong dosages of the ""normal"" reality most people experience too even if that is portrayed as a dull and depressing one. Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.The young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down-to-earthness to it all with her refreshing performance. But there is no actor involved in this film who goes unnoticed and I'd have to think hard to find a parallel in that respect.Lastly, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a film, it goes from scary to sad to funny and thought provoking to intimidating and back to melancholy in an stunningly effortless way (kudos to the script writer).An absolute must-see."	5.0	"...""we all die alone""...."	2003-02-27	1	1	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AMIOLJHCQHGBE	"T. A. Wauldron ""iamtoddicus"""	First , I LOVE bizzare films (see Welcome to WoopWoop, Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead).Second, I couldn't believe the same Drew Barrymore who flashed her hotchamatata's to David Letterman would have the brilliance to produce this film!This movie draws you in from scene one. You have no idea whether the `hero' is psycotic when he sees Frank The Giant Rabbit, or sees things we just don't. And Patrick Swayze as the charismatic Love/Hate guru was a stroke of genius. You hate him and his bible thumping followers...and then you find out his secret truth.From the moment we know Donnie is `different', to the moment the jet engine crashes through his bedroom, to the final moment when HE discovers reality, WE don't know the reality.Donnie sees things no one else can, and they have to do with time travel and different possibilites of the future. Personally, I loved the aged alzheimers woman who goes to her mailbox, sees nothing there, walks away, and turns in the middle of the dirt road, to see if something may have been placed in her mailbox while her back was turned (she is the secret to the film...). My only tsk tsk is they could have done more with her...This is a film of teen angst, the futility of correcting a wrong space/time has decreed, and an EXCELLENT sci-fi-eerie-romance. Some high profile actors (Noah Wylie for one) took on this movie in minor roles( I LOVE that cameo mystique...). Dark irony rules here.I'll tell you how good this film was....I watched this instead of CSI. I bought this DVD. My friends who saw it were awed and bought it.

In comparing the DVD image quality to the Blu-Ray, there is very little discernable improvement with the Blu-Ray, and that's the whole point in having a film on blu-ray.

If I meet this guy in person, I'd have to thank him for changing my life.  Donnie Darko us undeniably one of the most underrated movies ever created.  It combines every genre and packs it into one movie.  (Rarely achieved successfully by a director with obvious influences from Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch and even Spielberg himself and yes, this director can be compared to greatness.)  The acting and cast was perfect (I can't put Jake Gyllenhaal's performance into words, I'm still baffled!!!).  The 80's musical score was perfect as well as every aspect of the film.  A Logical illogical ride into divine intervention, Donnie Darko is nothing short of amazing and is right up there with E.T. and Mullholland Drive.  For his first Directing gig, this director reminds me of a young Orson Welles.  His work is truly amazing!  P.S.  I must warn you that this movie suggests intellectual participation so the average moviegoer: BEWARE!	5.0	Nothing short of amazing...	2002-06-26	17	12	5

That said, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story (the likes of Salinger's ""...Rye"") of a cynical adolescent, Donnie Darko.  Donnie is a sort of a comic book high school hero, who tells everybody where to get off in such an intelligent way, that even his parents have to congratulate him on being expelled from school.The twist that will ""knock you flat"" (as Jan Stuart of Newsday put it) is almost superfluous in light of what the rest of the film has to say for itself.  This is almost two films in one:  a highly spiritual film about time and space; destiny versus free choice - and one that is very earth-bound about having the courage to be your own person, and about questioning everything before excepting blindly.  The two themes are magnificently bound together in a visually stunning, and breathtakingly acted film.

(I lucked out because everything else there is expensive as heck.)  I was disappointed to see that it wouldn't play on my Playstation 2 since it was a UK disc.  Fortunately, after some slight modifications, I could still watch it on the DVD player I had on my computer.The first thing I noticed was that this movie had a lot more cussing in it than I remember.  I also noticed that it didn't show my favorite character Frank all that much.  Still, I think this movie is a great thing to see.  It's about a kid in high school with severe mental problems, so it's not very unusual.  This kid's name is Donnie Darko.Donnie has hallucinations and personality disorders and darn near every mental disorder a person can have.  He goes to a shrink and takes lots of meds.  Does this help?  Of course not, why would anyone expect it to?  I'm sure it costs the parents a lot of money, but they seem more concerned for their wacko son than for saving up some dough.Well, Donnie has this imaginary friend named Frank that tells him when the world is going to end; 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.  Frank isn't a a Kool-Aid drinker though, he's just a guy in a bunny rabbit skull costume that looks really boss and evil.So Donnie goes through school and cusses out teachers and picks up this gothic-type chick.  Naturally he doesn't get expelled or anything.  Under the influence of Frank, Donnie develops an interest in time travel and studies it.  His main book of reference is written by a weird old lady who does nothing but check a mailbox all day.  She must have been looking for a check or something.In a short subplot, Donnie burns down the home of a child pornography peddler.  This happens right after my favorite scene in the movie where Frank takes off his mask.  The Frank unmasking scene is spooky, with really dark classical music playing in the background.  I love it.  Frank turns out to be pretty darn ugly.The film has an excellent soundtrack including one of my favorite songs, ""Head Over Heels.""  The cinematography can't be any better.  It's very dark throughout but not so dark that you can't see.  Even when it's bright daylight outside, the movie manages to keep its dark feeling.The movie is kind of written like a Star Trek episode with all of the time traveling business.  I'm not sure if it's 100% consistent, but with a vague and complicated subject like time travel, you can get away with inconsistency, since time travel is so darn neat.If you're into weird stuff, you need to see this movie.  It's got a lot of imagination put into it, and I think everybody can appreciate that."	5.0	There Needs to be More Skull-Rabbits	2005-09-02	7	3	4

Whats the point of  this movie? All my family and friends who say they love this movie cant even explain it to me. Its so good cuz of the cast. Oooo its so good cuz that bunny is so crazy. The colors are so cool. The soundtrack is really good. Thats all fine but none of that matters if the movie doesnt make sense. Is there some big statement about the state of the world? An observation about the power of love? Something about white american surburbia? Time travel? Schizophrenia? I dont get it. The whole movie is a just a countdown and then jake goes back and doesnt talk to the bunny so he dies. big deal. Events are altared. Wow.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A20TJ5P97W5MS1	The Inquisitor	"Donnie Darko came out in 2001 & was written and directed by Richard Kelly.This is a very unique and memorable film.It's a forward thinking 80s throwback grounded in innovation.There are very few films that successfully achieve a vintage feel mixed with a more modern philosophical outlook.Because of this, Donnie Darko was destined for cult classic status from the start.The soundtrack, the style, the look and feel are all on point.Aside from the visual presentation there is certainly something more.Notably, this film marked the arrivals of Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone.Furthermore, in a masterclass of casting, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze are also featured.This inclusion of 80s icons successfully strengthens the legitimacy of the throwback aesthetic.You can see Richard Kelly had a vision and he brought it to the screen.In Spielberg fashion, the film focuses on a family unit in the middle of America.The center piece of the story revolves around Donnie Darko.Donnie is a medicated sleep walker troubled by intensive apocalyptic visions.And that is only the beginning.A jet engine mysteriously falls out of the sky and smashes mercilessly into the Darko home.To heighten the paranoia, no airline is reporting that an engine is missing from one of its jets.Where did the engine come from? It had to come from somewhere.This inexplicable occurrence is the basis for Donnie's increasingly complex & disturbing visions of mass destruction.In a quest for understanding, Donnie converses with his therapist, questions the science teacher, listens to Joy Division, & celebrates halloween.All of these activities contribute to Donnie's potential grasp on the very complex structure of time and space.Donnie reads The Philosophy of Time Travel, written by Roberta Sparrow, in an attempt to figure this puzzle out.The searching leads Donnie further down the rabbit hole. What does it all mean?Yes, there are a number of questions. Some are answerable and some, not so much.Donnie Darko's ability to transcend cultural eras could be considered time travel in it's own right.It will take you back, then back further, and then possibly forward.Overall, a fun thoughtful mental expedition.As with all great adventures, it's about the journey and not necessarily the destination.If you appreciate cult films, Darko is required viewing.""A wrecking ball smashes into the tall building, and a few floors collapse into the big hole. Hours later, the office building has been reduced to a pile of rubble, and a job has been well done. The workers had executed the demolition ""with the seriousness of creators--and destruction after all is a form of creation."""	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #157	2014-05-18	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2YDVQRBG8T3D7	"Theresa Williams ""Zen"""	"This movie is about learning to live.  Donnie Darko is a troubled 15 year old who thinks life is absurd and meaningless because, in the end, everyone dies alone.Set in the Fall of 1988, the movie is about personal transformation and how through your own personal transformation you can change the world.  The 1988 Presidential election serves as a handy backdrop for the despair caused by alienation and apathy.  The country has emerged from 8 years of conservatism under Ronald Reagan and has a choice to make.  This larger sense of place echoes within the community, where conservative values are prominent and people fear change.  The only kind of ""change"" people accept comes from the self-help guru who spouts shallow epithets; whereas real works about transformation and change are shunned and called ""pornographic,"" such as Graham Greene's short story which says, in part: ""It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallised  with the pain of puberty.""This could not be a better description of the angst of adolescence and of Donnie Darko himself, now in his 15th year, who is searching for the ""plan"" he needs to accept the yin and yang of existence:  that destruction and creation work together to create change.Donnie is the only student in the class who understands the Greene story.  When called upon by his teacher he says the story is saying that ""destruction is a form of creation.  So the fact that they burn the money is..,.ironic.  They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.""But how does one find transformation in a world that seems to offer only diminished possibilities?  In a world that believes acquisition leads to happiness?  What Donnie ultimately discovers--which is why he laughs and smiles at the end of the movie--is that meaning is found through your creative engagement with life and through the mark you leave on the world.The song ""Mad World"" truly encapsulates the thematic concerns of the movie beautifully.  The music video, included as a special feature, is valuable in itself.  Highly recommended movie."	5.0	Learning to Live	2006-08-13	22	21	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3VAXB8CDYY5BG	The Wingchair Critic	"'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' (2005) offers audiences a restructured vision of the extraordinary 2001 Richard Kelly film, which stands with 'Haxan' (1922), 'Freaks' (1932), 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1947), 'Curse of the Demon' (1958), 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'Carnival of Souls' (1962), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Blue Velvet' (1985), and 'Faust' (1994) as one of the greatest fantastic films ever created.Sadly, the revision, however more closely it may dovetail with Kelly's personal vision, considerably dilutes the film's drama and power on almost every level.While the theatrical release was fueled by its own judicious editing, structural hard edges, glorious ambiguities, and evocation of the suburban weird, the so-called director's cut continually literalizes the plot while simultaneously altering the status of essential story elements.In a grave error of judgement, the daimonic rabbit Frank, a dominant presence in and the very symbol of the theatrical release, is now overshadowed by Roberta Sparrow's previously obscure book, The Philosophy of Time Travel, which is brazenly promoted into the foreground. Additional superfluous scenes of the Darko family interacting (which were wisely included as outtakes only in the original DVD) undercut the film' pivotal forward momentum, while the deletion of some of the mean-spirited dialogue Donnie's peers direct towards one another weakens the satiric and parodic humor of the original.Key characters, like the free thinking, anti-establishment teacher beautifully portrayed by Drew Barrymore, now seem to have briefly wandered in from another film entirely.Awash in new CGI effects, the director's cut should make more logical sense, but simply does not. The film's last ten minutes, in which everything that has gone before coalesces into terrible meaning, should have been considered sacrosanct and left unaltered.As a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi-faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.So in a reversal of several well-documented Orson Welles projects, including 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942), and the plot of Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories' (1980), 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is a concrete example in which the much-maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.For the film's reputation to continue to flourish, it is essential that the theatrical version remain in circulation; the obvious choice here would have been to include the mediocre director's cut in addition to the theatrical release.Bonus ""special features,"" such as ""They Made Me Do It--The Cult of Donnie Darko"" and ""Number One Fan--A Darkomentary,"" are third rate, futile studies in self-applause and package padding which further embarrass the project as a whole."	2.0	Darkness Brightly Packaged	2005-02-21	9	7	2

Some scenes cut from the original are quite simple, but still, very emotional and should have never left the movie in the first place. They provide more depth to the movie and its characters. The soundtrack is just the way the director had originally intended, and they also had more time to work with the special effects.And well, yes, the original movie is far more ""open"" to interpretation, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. As for me, I liked to know what the director's idea for what was behind the events that happened in the movie was.One thing is clear for me: The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies EVER."	5.0	The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko	2008-01-05	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AWJKA0TRZLZGS	Thomas Bailey	"Theatrical trailer: ""The Only way to unwind the future is to follow the path."" -- The path of a 'border-line, adolescent, sleep-walking schizophrenic' named Donnie Darko living in a parallel universe -- or is it a total delusion? -- guided by the six-foot rabbit Frank. -- Frank who turns out to be much more than just the strangeness he appears to be: Something (his energy, essence, vibrations, importance) the other characters in the movie tune into without totally understanding the entire gestalt; plus: It is difficult to see, but it seems that all of these characters are a part of the whole: Many mentors guiding Donnie along the path, and psychotic-appearing acts that he commits with reasons that seem to be connected with setting things right, to rescue: Donnie Darko -- the chosen one, the savior of the world.When I first watched this movie, I found myself caught in between liking and hating it. I loved the character Donnie Darko: Although he was suppose to be mentally disturbed, I found him to be very perceptive, witty, intelligent, and one of the most sane people in the entire movie, challenging those who failed to see things the way they really are -- which causes him to be trapped in extremely-painful isolation. I loved many of the other characters as well: His girlfriend, his two sisters, his father and mother and many others, the teacher Drew Barrymore plays, Patrick Swayze's character, and the old woman who keeps walking back and forth to the mailbox to check for mail that is never there, almost getting hit by cars passing by -- although I found myself very disappointed, at first, that as strong a part as she seemed to play, she wasn't explained or used as fully as I hoped for; I found myself thinking of the movie 'Somewhere in Time', where Christopher Reeve -- playing a playwright in the 1980's -- is approached by an old woman --played by Jane Seymour -- who pleads for him to come back in time to her in the world of 1912 where she lives; but nothing like that appears to happen.I only found myself wading through a very slow movie that tempted me-several times-to jump to the end to find out where all of this was leading, but I avoided the temptation, watching with irritation with the slow pace, and fascination for the eerie use of sound and special effects drawing me deeper in...until...I got to the end, and everything was suppose to wrap up neatly ...but it didn't: ""Oh, yuck!"" I found myself vocalizing to an almost empty room, except for me.But after watching the commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie, and the deleted and extended scenes, it made more sense to me, and the old woman fit more into what I hoped for -- although very subtly -- and the ending was more satisfying, and some of my impressions were confirmed.And now I can say I like the movie. -- But even more so: The DVD as a whole; DVD is the way to go with this one; not VHS, for you need the deleted and extended scenes -- which the director cut because he needed to make a two and one half hour movie into a two hour one -- and the commentary to best understand and appreciate the movie, an understanding and appreciation you will not get by the VHS alone: You can either buy the movie so you can have time to go through at least once, watch all of the twenty scenes (with commentary and without), watch -- especially -- all the way through with the director's commentary, the commentary with the cast (if you so choose, but not necessary, for there is very little information that isn't all ready covered by the director in a much more straightforward manner), and check out the other features as well; or, if you would rather avoid the expense, you can rent it (all by itself) at a place that allows you to have it for five days, and: ENJOY!"	4.0	I LIKED IT, I HATED IT, I RECOMMEND IT	2002-10-05	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2V2XRUGEYYCGG	Thomas Glebe	"After several viewings and much thought, all I can say about this movie, in seven words or less is, ""My God, what a totally fantastic flick!""  A film, which I only finally saw (but had heard about, many years after it hit theaters and later DVD and cable).  I really cannot say how great this film is, but I'll try.  Note however, that on Amazon's rating scale from 1 star to 5, if I could, I'd give this SIX stars, but am limited to five.  For this is a work which rises above the five star Amazon rating level for me, and few films have ever done that actually.  Overall, despite some minor stumbles along the way, and many, confusing non-linear moments which occur throughout, I can seriously say this is certainly one of the most unique, touching, and mind-expanding movie efforts I've seen in a long, long time. It entered my top 20-50 films of all time quickly at the very least, when I first experienced it, and continues to move up, upon repeated screenings and reflections.  That's saying a lot because my list of such top films of all times includes dozens of great films, too many to name here.This is a small and independent but yet, GREAT movie, and is a must-buy for those with the funds and who loved/love this right off the bat as much as I did/do, because more viewings not only add to one's understanding and appreciation of it all, but will over time, as it has for me, simply add to one's thinking about it all deeply afterwards and lead to finding new meanings in various scenes and ideas/insights.  Basically. ""Donnie Darko,"" if you see it and you enjoy it upon initially watching it and re-watching it as I did (and still do), is a strange, wonderful enigma of a film, which you will come back to, for further and deeper appreciation.  With the rather obtuse at times, and certainly non-progressive temporal structure however, repeated viewings and closer attention, almost seems essential for a full appreciation of this masterpiece.  Along with so many various interpretations from viewers, if you collect DVD's, and fell in love with this film early on, as I did originally and much later on, this is really a movie you'll want to come back to and watch again, many times.  While my review does not distinguish between released DVD versions, I can only concentrate on the basic product, which in its original film, is really something special.It's hard to know where to begin to describe this absolutely amazing movie/film, which I found so surprisingly fascinating and unforgettable and great, when I first saw it, and since have, upon repeated viewings.  As a general rule, I have never written short Amazon reviews, since my main deal here has been to try to impart upon readers, more in depth thoughts on all things entertainment-wise.  I could just say, ""this is a little-known, but important, cult-ish example of what Hollywood/Independent cinema can be, and mandatory viewing for any real, thought-stimulating movie fan,"" or ""it is a complete and enlightening surprise from beginning to end,"" but I will instead just give my totally personal opinion (with a lot more words) that this is a film which everyone should see at least once.  Whether afterwards, they get the same mental digestive overdrive reactions I did when I first saw it and which has been validated by seeing it again and again, is unknown to me.  Because I loved this movie the very first time I saw it, and watching it again has only reinforced that opinion.  I would hope to believe others have experienced this gem as much as I did originally, and have found enjoyment from repeated viewings.While this film is, indeed, very non-linear. which is usually a quality which more often than not, has turned me off to so many other such movies besides notable exceptions like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Go,"" and ""11:14."" ""Donnie Darko"" is very deliberate in its intent and purpose, and its oftentimes ambiguous nature, is just one of its many charms.  If you first see it, and like/love it, you'll eventually refer others to it, if for no other reason, than for that of trying to search for other's explanations as to what it's all about, from others besides yourself.  However, if one first experiences this little jewel of a film and doesn't quite understand/appreciate it, I would advise one to simply devote the time if possible to watch it again, and again.  In time, I would trust that it will all eventually become clear, what this enigma of an independent, but Hollywood release, really means.  While some unnecessarily may want to over-interpret this, or dismiss it entirely from a possible feeling of just being too lazy to simply THINK, to me, ""Donnie Darko"" is simply amazing.  Whether watched initially, repeatedly, and/or thought about later.I came to eventually see this film long after its original release and subsequent impact, as I have so many other great movies, but in the new century,  That does not diminish its importance and meaning to me as a truly great cinematic effort in the long run, and this new century film holds up very well, with anything from the last few decades.  It is a one of a kind, at the very least, and I only wish more modern-day films came to equal this cinematic excellence.I could go on to list the many stars and their fine performances, including Jake Gyllenhaal (our teen-aged hero which this middle-aged man can still truly identify with), his sister in real life and in this movie, ""Maggie Gyllenhaal,"" Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone among others, but let it be said, this is a great cast.  And their characters all perform key roles in the overall whole.""Donnie Darko"" is one of the best films I've seen this century.  It is strange, open for debate as to meaning, but entertaining and compelling throughout.  The film style is original and effective, the soundtrack and appropriate ""songs"" right-on, and the whole film, while dealing with some rather disturbing and/or depressing subjects, is a winner from frame one to the last frame.  If you have never seen this, by all means, do.  If you have, a lot of what I've hinted about without spoilers, should touch base.An unforgettable experience, I watched this in amazement the first time, and have since, upon every repeated viewing.  One of a kind, tight, and almost perfectly presented from beginning to end, along with a near perfect cast, directorial style, and musical background, ""Donnie Darko"" is truly a must-see experience.  What it all really ""means"" in the end, is up to the viewer, which makes it forever more a total and timeless winner."	5.0	One of the best movies of the new millennium...	2008-10-10	2	2	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AZ0A4CHTY31OO	"Thomas P. Burwell ""tom"""	"I thought Donnie Darko was a great portrayal of how we long for so much more than we usually take the time to realize in life.  It shows that we can be in control of many aspects of life; many aspects that most people never even realize.  Most people would have been asleep to many of the details Donnie was able to perceive about people (such as the fakeness of Jim Cunningham and the sincerity within his English teacher).I do not think this movie supports the usual existentialist claim that we create our own meaning in life.  The movie recognizes there is more than just becoming aware of and controlling as many aspects of life as you can.  Donnie chooses his own death in order to save his girlfriend not because it his simply the path he chooses, but because it is one of those moments that in the words of the movie ""reminds you beautiful the world can be.""  In the end, I think the movie instead affirms that there is a best way of living with the choices that we have."	5.0	Magnificent exploration of existentialist thought	2005-03-30	1	1	0

Needless to say, I was dead wrong.  This is a bad movie from beginning to end, one that tries to be artsy by providing a convoluted and incoherent plot about a depressed high school kid.  The bunny rabbit turns out to be some mask, not a real demon or anything, and the horror elements are very poorly handled.Most of all, I found this movie to be BORING.  But like a lot of boring, overrated films (such as IN THE BEDROOM or BREAKING THE WAVES or, dare I say it, SPIDERMAN) this movie has managed to trick a lot of people into thinking it has worth.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1UL6W4QPS8BMI	Tigertrader	"Richard Kelly's 2001 film, Donnie Darko, has both an impressive cast list and a thought-provoking story. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, and Patrick Swayze star in the movie.Initially, the picture appears to be a simple, offbeat sci-fi flick. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, seems to be a slightly disturbed yet average teenager surviving high school in the suburbs. He visits a therapist regularly because of his persistent sleepwalking, yet everything else in his life is as average as can be. Donnie's life changes when a man in a giant rabbit suit, Frank, visits him at midnight and lures him outside. His interference saves Donnie's life and launches him into a bizarre adventure. Donnie's mental health decreases as hallucinations plague him while he seems to gain superhuman abilities as well. He encounters Frank repeatedly, and the giant rabbit helps him realize his destiny.However, Donnie Darko, refuses to be labeled under one genre. It boasts elements of romance, mystery, horror, drama, and comedy while acting as a relevant social commentary.Rebuking simplified views of morality and emotion, this film promotes free-thinking. It satirizes the black and white ideology that so many education systems shamelessly promote. Rather than ranking all experiences on the ""fear or love"" scale, Donnie claims that humanity cannot be boxed into neat categories and that there are seldom blanket answers for any problems.Kelly masterfully crafted the atmosphere of the movie and its significance to the storyline. The movie left me feeling constantly wary, hairs standing up on the back of my neck. It horrified me in a way that most traditional scary movies could never hope to. There were no spectacular special effects or any monsters to speak of, but it hammered uneasiness into my mind. Whether it was during a sunny day or the witching hour, I couldn't shake the overwhelming feeling that something was out of place and that was terrifying for me. It was like an entire film taking place in Uncanny Valley.Jake Gyllenhaal's acting fits flawlessly into the movie's atmosphere as well. He appropriately balances emotional expression, the awkwardness of a high-schooler, and defiance against repression.The romance in Donnie Darko transcends the stereotypical Nicholas Sparks formula. It's quirky, adorably awkward, and it highlights a vital aspect of romance that usually comes off as clich&eacute; and melodramatic- sacrifice.Donnie Darko is not a film for people craving action-filled scenes and a light plot. It is not a leisurely swim for the brain. Its style and depth are reminiscent of other great thoughtful works, such as Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange. Truly, though, Donnie Darko is a rare film that I believe anyone can enjoy if they watch it with the right mindset. Similarly, anyone watching it in the mood for a fluffy timewaster will be sorely disappointed.It is a complex and intuitive piece that refuses to hold back its blows at society's conceptions of good and evil. Even within the serious context of its message, Donnie Darko supplies plenty of laughs and holds its place as one of the most influentially entertaining movies of the 2000s."	5.0	A hauntingly beautiful film	2013-09-03	0	0	0

The main character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (the son on &quot;City Slickers&quot;) does a good job of playing a psychotic teenager and this movie sets its own standards as a 'teen picture'.

Tobish ""timberwolf1"""	"After seeing and loving ""Brokeback Mountain"" (five viewings?!), I embarked on a Jake Gyllenhaal mini-film festival, starting with ""Jarhead"" (BLECH).Since I've been hearing about ""Donnie Darko"" since its release, mostly from slightly eccentric, highly intelligent people who mostly share my taste in movies, I rented it (The Director's Cut).OHMYFREAKINGGOD.From the first moments, I was completely and totally drawn in to this completely original, yet accessible film.  The plot has been discussed in countless other reviews, so I won't get into it here, save to say that is both bizarre and resonant.  Things are purposefully left ambiguous, yet there is an undeniable internal logic that holds the many threads (and clashing movie genres) together.  Visually this film is a stunner, with wild effects merging seemlessly with domestic and school scenes that seem perfectly normal but just a little bit ""off.""Everything in this movie has a double or a triple meaning, and virtually everything is symbolic or foreshadows something later in the film.  Frank the Bunny's line ""Pay attention, you might miss something"" applies to Donnie, but also very much to the viewer.  This is an incredibly ""dense"" film; cross James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" with Kubrick with ""Requium for a Dream"" with ""Ordinary People"" with any John Hughes teen angst movie and you end up with ""Donnie Darko.""  That is, if you're an incredibly gifted screenwriter and director like Richard Kelly.  This film DEMANDS repeat viewings, as it reveals entire layers of meaning each time you watch it, and can easily make you obsessed.  A cult has formed around it, and there is a cryptic website as well as a multitude of ""Donnie Darko"" internet communities, FAQs, blogs, etc.I noticed that many of the negative reviews were from people who'd seen the original and disliked the Director's Cut.  The criticisms mostly stem from the fact that Kelly explains a bit more in the Director's Cut, but I can tell you, as a virgin viewer, it STILL requires a lot of puzzle solving and analysis; once you've seen this film, you just can't stop thinking about it.  Also, people complain about different music choices, and some additions and missing lines (particularly a key line from Frank in the movie theater).  Shoot, now I have to buy BOTH versions!All of the actors are superb.  Both Noah Wylie and Drew Barrymore give the performances of their respective careers, Maggie Jyllenhaal, Jake's real-life sister, is wonderful as Donnie's sister, and the rest of the cast is equally good.However, Jake Gyllenhaal really shines in the title role, as a hesitant teen with family troubles and a tough time socializing who is 1) either caught in a wild time-travel loop where only he can save the world, or 2) a paranoid schitzophrenic.  His halting manner, his hesitant voice, his odd tics, and most of all, his incredibly expressive eyes manage to convey a very troubled teenager who you can still empathize with.  Because you so feel for this character, the ending is both disturbing and deeply sad.  It's a tour de force performance, particularly from an actor that was only 19-20 when the film was shot.This is no mere intellectual exercise; many ""puzzle movies"" engage the mind but remain emotionally cold and detatched.  Donnie Darko is the rare film that manages the nearly impossible task of having a mind, a heart, and a soul, in roughly equal measures.  DO NOT MISS THIS, I wish I'd discovered it sooner.A definite 10 out of 10."	5.0	Instantly one of my top 5 films of all time	2006-03-22	10	10	0

One can't catogorize this movie; there are so many elements in it.  Teenage 80's, scifi, etc.  But I would say this is more of a - put the mystery together type of movie.  I give it credit for being original, but i can't help but wonder from beginning to end, &quot;when is this gonna end?&quot;  My girlfriend totally hated this movie.  It spread itself thin trying to put every genre together.  There were quite a few funny parts though - one being a funny smurf conversation.Sure, i understand what's going on.  But, you should rent this one first, cause it's not for everyone.  Along the same lines as this is muholland drive, which is far better.

Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't ""get it"" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally ""get it"", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it."	4.0	A nice mental exercise for geeks	2006-09-02	11	6	5

The first time I saw it, I was with a couple of friends, and we weren't getting it at all, but we were having fun trying to figure out who was whom according to the characters in the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"".Art can be interpreted so many ways, and we all have our own opinions. Nobody can be ""right"" or ""wrong"" in what they appreciate, which is one of the beauties of Art in itself. To me, Donnie Darko is like one of those paintings a person needs to stare at for a substantial amount of time before they see the beauty of the picture. Once you learn who the characters are in the film....what the Artifact is, the role of the Manipulated Dead/Living, and so on, it becomes a whole different movie, and it's quite a film after that. 4 stars is fair, to me, but I understand those that give it 5."	4.0	Character representation	2006-08-20	6	6	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3HAF8WE779PDQ	Tolli	This movie was entertaining for the entire duration. That said, I think it should be watched more than once for somebody to distil its full meaning. I had a sense after watching this movie for the first time that I had missed a lot of the context surrounding the plot. After going online I came across the AMAZING website that accompanies this movie, and a copy of the lady's diary. Without reading the diary, I don't think its possible to understand the movie fully. The Director's Cut is an interesting opportunity to learn more about the original intent of the movie's creators and brought me back for a 3rd and 4th viewing.

I won't spend time here repeating a review of the plot or discussing the characters (all excellent).  Instead I will tell you about  my family and this movie.  My 17-yr-old son started talking about it one day because he had seen it late one night on one of the cable movie channels.  He said it was really good and he was looking for it to come up again. He said we HAD to see it.  It eventually did come on again one late night, and he made my husband and daughter watch it with him.  The next morning my husband was shaking his head with a smile on his face and saying that the movie was good but quirky.  He wanted to see it again, as did my daughter.  Flipping around channels one early, early morning I chanced onto this movie.  I watched it, totally enthralled, and totally oblivious to the fact that it was 4 in the morning and I had to go to work in a little bit.  When it was over I got up and complained to my sleeping son that I was now hooked, late for work, and it was all his fault.  I've seen it a couple times on the cable channels, but that wasn't enough, so I bought it for Christmas for the family.  They were excited.  It is entertaining, rich with character and plot development, engaging, addicting, and after you watch it, you can't stop thinking about it.  See it and enjoy.	5.0	Whole Family Addicted to this Quirky Movie	2003-12-30	5	5	0

You can really take this movie 2 ways, not getting it at all, or totally loving it. I was somewhere in the middle. It was both funny, and chilling at the same time. It reminds me of a movie I saw a long time ago, called: Jacob's Ladder. Without spoiling the end of the flick for those who haven't seen it, I do encourage you to check it out. I saw someone's earlier review stating it was kind of like a Napolian Dynamite Nightmare, in that, it's again, kind of like, you either get it, or you don't. I can see alot of people coming off of this movie with a question mark....but, I totally get the end, it was fantastic. I saw it on cable, one of the reviews said they has watched the commentary a second time around, and connecting the dots was very well put.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2XLI1QOMTHXRT	Trelloskilos	Between the thousands of High-School comedy flicks and Teen slasher films lies a very rare, untapped viewing genre which few moviegoers even consider, let alone bother watching. While the previously mentioned genres deal with basic teen preoccupations such as losing virginity, asserting popularity and curiosity (the perils of opening the cellar door (sic) to find out what that strange noise is), these films have little more to say than 'Hey, we're kids, and we're having a blast'. There is a sense of 'normality' and 'healthiness' that these films choose to base themselves on, usually allowing the odd 'fat kid' or 'freak' a look in for added laughs or to help drive the plot. Donnie Darko is definitely not one of these filmsDonnie Darko is one of those rare gems that combine a subtle Lynch-esque dark humour with a nihilistic view of the trivialities of society, and what is considered 'normal' behaviour. Unlike the 'American Pie/Scream' banalities, we seethe central character relinquish grip on the world around him, but in his own mind, establishing his own beliefs and opinions, with the assistance of Frank, a very unusual and sinister sidekick.The components that introduce us to the world of Donnie Darko - a misplaced Jet engine, an apocalyptic prophecy made by a man in a macabre bunny suit, and the complexities of Time travel are as strange as the overall atmosphere that pervades this film. The viewer cannot help feeling that as the central character's sanity unhinges, that it is in fact the rest of the world that is going crazy.The acting is amazing, and the plot is superbly driven. The movie succeeds in walking a fine line between many genres, without ever being dominated by one - the film could have turned into comic farce, horror, sci-fi or love story, but chooses to remain uncategorized. The dialogue is blatantly written to make you acknowledge philosophical questions from the Zen-like to the ridiculous. It is a very accessable film, despite all the bizzarre inclusions and enigmatic prose. Similarly, while there is a heavy element of despair and worthlessness, it is not a film that will make you suicidal. However, it is certainly not a film to watch if all you want is a brainless teenage romp. If you want that, go hire out something by National Lampoon.Despite criticisms that the end was a let-down, I honestly thought that it was a good strong ending that answered many of the film's plot points, but left the more important loose ends free for the viewer to interpret, and in keeping with the rest of the movie, was bitter-sweet and thought-provoking.Particular highlights are the first time Donnie sees evidence of time travel, the conversation that he has with Frank in the cinema, the disturbingly realistic twist of the Jim Cunningham character, and the voyeuristic peek into many of the characters alone while a melancholy cover of 'Mad World' is played.Donnie Darko is up there with films like 'Heathers', 'Virgin Suicides', 'Memento', 'Cruel Intentions' and any other film that actually dares to challenge the viewer to look beneath the surface.	5.0	Definitely a worthwhile experience	2003-01-09	20	18	2

He returns home the next morning to find that a jet engine has crashed through his bedroom. As he tries to figure out why he survived and tries to deal with people in his town, like the school bully, his conservative health teacher, and a self-help guru, Frank continues to turn up in Donnie's mind, causing him to commit acts of vandalism and worse.  The performances in this movie are exquisite. The talent in this movie is top notch and Gyllenhall is just amazing. People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A15H0OGLXJ9FC6	T. R. Rak	"First of all, buy this ORIGINAL 2001 release version DVD.  Forget the director's cut - it's okay, but not what you'd expect.  The director's cut suffers from what Jack White (of the seminal music band, ""The White Stripes"") meant when he said, ""Art is knowing WHEN to stop.""  The director's cut simply doesn't, and you'll see why too if (as I did) you make the mistake of shelling out the extra green to acquire it.  Take my advice:  Don't.Stick with the original.  You won't be disappointed.Okay, why do I call this bizarre, brilliant flick ""the story of my life.""  Well, because on October 20, 1988 (to be exact), I had an experience MUCH like Donnie's, REALLY and TRULY, only in my case I tried to commit suicide.  So when I saw ""Donnie Darko,"" my first reaction was, ""oh my god, HOW did the director know?"" (about my life at that precise moment in my, much like Donnie's, ""emotional problems""-riddled history?).  So ... overcoming the intial ""shock/epiphany"" of seeing my own life played back for me in panoramic technicolor, I curled up, frightened but fascinated, beneath a snuggle blanket and watched further, transfixed by one of the most subtly original, germane, cohesive stories to reach celluloid actualization since ""Dawn of the Dead"" or, much more recently, ""Identity"" (with John Cusack); and I quickly became, not only a believer in time travel, but a living survivor of it (UNLIKE Donnie, but forgive me for (possibly) giving away TOO much here).  This story HAS to be experienced; and perhaps YOU, Constant Viewer, like I do, remember where YOU were - and what YOU were doing/feeling/going through - way back in October of 1988.  Whatever it was, I bet it was something you'll never forget.Like this film - you'll never forget it; and, lessee ... I'm on about my, er ... 12th or 13th viewing of it now (the ORIGINAL, NOT the director's ""clutter"").  I put ""Donnie Darko"" in my Top 5 movies of all time.  For originality, for story, for great, natural, completely successful ""suspension of disbelief"" acting; for being, at once - a tragicomedy, a WILDLY-WEIRD (this is the understatement of the new millennium) dramedy, a fired-up, mind-frying sci/fi thriller, a uniquely-tender-hearted horror yarn, and WAY beyond, My Friends:  ""Donnie"" is a philosophical brain burster much in the same neogenre/league-of-its-own film-making; for counterparts in creative ""playfulness"" behind the motion-picture camera, I can only recommend the following ""warmup"" exercises:  see ""Pi,"" ""Primer,"" ""Adaptation,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Martin"" (a little-remembered but unforgettable piece by George A. Romero, who has a brilliant little cameo in this pic as a ""happy marshmallow man-child"" of a Catholic priest).  You'll get the idea FAST, of what you're in for with Donnie.An all-star cast will blow you away and lends immense credulity to this quirkified, whacked-out, indie knockout punch; you'll be reeling when you see here:  Mary McDonnell, Noah Wiley, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore!  Watching Drew play the part of a high-school English teacher is definitely worth ""the price of emotion"" enough (interestingly, if NOT for Barrymore's bankroll (she's the executive producer of Darko's ""reel world,"" in REAL life); fact: ""Darko"" probably never would have lit up our darkened screens at all, without Barrymore's vision and deep enough pockets to realize such - Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Drew!).  And getting Swayze to play the role of a pedophile HAD to have been a ""challenge,"" er ... to say the LEAST!  Swayze HAD to have been ""a total sport"" about what he was asked to portray; like the way John Malkovich was concerning HIS OWN ""journey through the looking portal.""But enough said.  Darken your own personal viewing room now.  Slide ""Donnie"" into your DVD player.  And ""take the trip,"" safely and securely (yet be warned - your MIND and SPIRIT may NEVER be the same afterwards), as I have, and am living proof of, the reality, horror, and (as Kelly intended, and successfully realized), the HEALING benefits, not unlike ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but only MUCH DARKER implications of, ""time travel.""  Hurry though.  As Kelly remonstrates cinematically, ""time is precious.""  Indeed.  And, Frankly speaking (pun intended), time's running out."	5.0	The Story of My Life ... Relived!	2005-12-02	7	5	2

The reptilian rabbit head was just plain bizarre and kind of creepy and enough to keep me interested for awhile. However, things didn't start to make any sense and crucial pieces and elements of the ""plot"" started disappearing left and right. By the time the film ended I was wondering to myself, ""What in the world was that all about."" Now after reading a few reviews here, I can see how the whole dream-thing fits in and the movie sort-of makes sense. However, if it was all a dream, then this movie is just one big cop-out. Had the movie been written and edited together better, then this would not be the case. But it is.The writing is awful. Everything is all choppy and convuluted and doesn't make any sense. Of course, if it's all a dream, it does make sense. But, the thing about dreams is, nobody really likes watching other people's dreams. Dreams are difficult enough for the dreamer to understand, yet alone anyone outside in the ""real world"". Dreams are very personal and usually should be kept that way. That's why movies that are dreams on celluloid usually just don't cut it as cinema. A dream has to be restructured to make sense on the screen and if it isn't, it falls apart.However, even if the film did make sense, it still wouldn't be all that great. The poor writing has already been mentioned, but the acting is even worse. Jake Gyllenhall does a decent job as Donnie Darko and the young lady who plays his girlfriend isn't too bad either. Outside of that, most of the actors in this movie seem less believable than a cartoon. Patrick Swayze is one of the big names who has a secondary role in the film. His character seems like somebody who has taken too much speed; I mean Chris Farley's Matt Foley was a better and more believable motivational speaker than this guy. Then there's the other big name of the film, Drew Berrymore. Drew is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks. She plays a teacher who is dismissed for teaching a graphic novel in class that the school board believes leads to school vandalism. You can tell that Drew just doesn't relate to the noble profession and good old American teachers because her performance is as stiff as a brick wall. One of those Fandango paper-bag puppets could pull off a more believable performance than she did.The acting is pretty lame, the writing poor, and the plot makes no sense. The whole thing is supposed to be a dream, but comes off as being a cheap cop-out. Therefore, you will probably either love or hate this movie. I personally couldn't stand it after the first twenty minutes, but thought the reptilian rabbit head was creative enough to be worth a glance."	2.0	Is It All Just a Dream?	2004-02-04	0	0	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3SUZFC8L0TW3V	Un Anglophile	"""Donnie Darko"" is already one of the certifiable cult classics of the 2000s, joining perhaps ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" who already achieve such status in still a young decade. What sets this film apart from the others, however, is its sheer unclassifiable ness: family drama, horror, science fiction and humor are all mixed in this cinematic stew where ""Pretty in Pink""-meets-""Slaughterhouse-Five""-meets-""Catcher in the Rye."" The outcome is a highly original film that dives into fundamental questions of life itself, all of which makes great entertainment.Set in the tightly-clinched sphincter of late-1980s Reagan America, we meet East Coast Catholic high schooler Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teen with emotional problems that worry his concerned and supportive family. Donnie's world isn't in good shape either: Dukakis is losing badly to George Bush; his fellow high schoolers and friends are brash and racist; his education filled with meaningless fear-and-love emotional studies. The neatly trimmed lawns, big homes and fine green trees of his hometown of Middlesex, Virginia disguise the brewing trouble that is lurking all around.Donnie unexpectedly begins to sleep walk at night, leaving his house to wake up in the morning on hillside roads and golf courses. During one such walk, a disjointed voice lures him out of the house and onto a golf course, where Donnie discovers a guy in a demonic bunny suit named Frank telling him that the world will end in twenty-eight days.This sparks a chain of events that not only puzzle Donnie, but virtually everyone around him, calumniating in a hallucinatory finale where the audience is asked to question what it means to be alive and ultimately what it means to be alone in a complicated and sometimes frightening universe.With a strong cast that includes Patrick Swayze as an ultra-conservative emotional speaker, Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore as Donnie's progressive English and science teachers, Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's real-life sister) as Donnie's `80s-brat sister, and the always great Mary McDonnell as Donnie's confused but loving mother, ""Donnie Darko"" has a great depth of actors which brings these colorful characters to life. The also fabulous soundtrack includes a slew of `80s favorites, like Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears, the Church, and Joy Division. Its most talked about song, ""Mad World"" an excellent remake of the Tears for Fears classic by Gary Jules, is absolutely haunting when played near the film`s conclusion. Attesting to its power, it went to number one in the UK in December 2003, nearly two years after being released.In all, ""Donnie Darko"" is a great movie to watch on Friday or Saturday night with all the lights turned off, and possibly a cup of coffee once it's ended to talk about it. Like a good wine, ""Donnie Darko"" has become more popular since its subdued release in 2001, and with time, has only gotten better."	4.0	Anxiety	2004-03-29	3	2	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A12UR373PCMT02	Victoria	This movie is about a not-so typical teenage boy, Donnie Darko, who is played by the(gorgeous and talented)Jake Gyllenhaal.  Donnie is a paranoid schizophrenic.  However, unlike many movies about people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia, this movie provides a more three-dimensional perspective than usual.  As the movie progresses, the many subplots, such as town idol and motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, Gretchen Ross and her relationship with Donnie, and Sparkle Motion, the youngest Darko's dance squad, keep the movie from feeling stale- in fact, it feels anything but.  The movie strikes the perfect balance between being funny, sad, and scary.  I definitley recommend it.	5.0	Interesting, Original, and Engrossing Movie	2003-01-24	0	0	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A40WS4N6FGPU1	"Victor W. Nappen ""YourBuddyVic"""	I would say the #1 reason to buy this movie is that it contains the original theatrical version. Before I upgraded to blu-ray I bought the DD Directors Cut on DVD, and was very dissappointed about the changes to the film. Scenes were shifted around, and even worse, the soundtrack was different.Visually, the DD blu-ray is no better then a DVD that is upconverted to 1080i, but for someone who doesn't have the original theatrical release and is looking to add to their blu-ray library, you can't go wrong with this. I will also note that it DOES contain the Director's cut so the converse is true. If you only have the thedtrical DVD and you are looking to see what the Director's cut it about, you also should buy this blu-ray.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AEQOE882VQTLV	"Voodoo Soup 9000 ""Don't hear it, feel it."""	I've seen both versions, theatrical and director's cut, and concerning the ability to understand what's going on (it's still not totally clear, to be fair) the director's cut is more helpful. Not to say that this cut gives it away, because that would be entirely untrue, but it shows very subtle ghosts of what could be thought bridges if you sit down with the film and enjoy it from all angles.The way I got the most out of this version is first by watching the theatrical cut. Then, go through and watch the deleted scenes and put them in place mentally. Try to listen to what the dialogue is not only trying to say but what it avoids saying to convey the intention of the scene. Now, that's really a big part in looking at the whole movie in different lights. Watch the director's cut now and it will be easier for you to employ more thought-based observations as opposed to rudimentary dialogue parallels. Buuut if you're not into all that, just watch this film. It's fantastic and ironic even if you're not trying to delve into its implications of divine intervention, time travel, and greed.	5.0	Director's Cut aides in interpretation	2006-03-21	5	5	0

This weird time-travel movie, involving other dimensions, is great. There's a witch in it, but it's hard to describe, so as an older guy who often doesn't care for teenage movies, I'll just give it two thumbs up.

Maybe that is the wonder of this film: there is so much room for interpretation. Its own complexity only underscores one of its themes. What are these themes, you ask? There are many, and I went through a sort of cycle to understand what the film was trying to say:First I thought it was a film conveying the decay of modern society through metaphor. Then I thought it was about the complexities of fear, and that those who try to pin down life problems too simply are lost in themselves because they choose not to face the truth that lies within the shadows. Lastly, I began to think it was simply a movie that wanted to say, ""There are those who may be able to control fate with time travel, but only a few. They are out there; and it is possible.""Honestly, to me, it was all three rolled into one genius cult flick.I'm a big fan of films that attempt to tackle so much, because 1) it makes me think and approach aspects of my own psyche and 2) it offers more interesting cinema than the normalcy of peaceful narrative. It's even better when the film manages to pull off every one of its goals, especially with engaging symbolism and beautifully crafted twists and turns. I can't even say I caught everything by the end of 'Darko.' But I understood everything I needed to understand. I believe that was what director Richard Kelly was attempting overall: to offer us a film that can be stretched so many ways that you can't help but make it personal."	4.0	Satirical, hilarious and frightening...at the same time.	2004-08-13	10	8	2

While I appreciate some of the new and extended scenes, mostly those including Drew Barrymore as the only teacher in Middlesex who actually knows what's going on in the real world, and those showing the relationship between Donnie and his parents, the rest of the added material is completely superfluous and overshadows the mystery and intrigue of the original cut. The new digital effects, including the horrible superimposing of pages of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", are worthless and add nothing to the plot. I remember after watching the original movie how blown away I was by this film, but that did not mean I understood every aspect of it. It made me want to study the film more and even try to find ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"", which was included on the bonus features of the original DVD. While I do not regret buying the Director's Cut for a couple of the new scenes, I would urge those of you who have never seen ""Donnie Darko"" to watch the original cut, as it is a far superior movie."	2.0	Not nearly as thought-provoking as the original cut	2005-03-20	12	7	5
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" takes the audience down the rabbit hole on a long, strange trip that alternately becomes, surreal, comic, dramatic and just plain scary. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) suffers from hallucinations and takes medication to help control his ""visions"". One night after taking his medication he has an encounter with a large, rancid, evil looking six foot tall rabbit who informs him that the world is going to end. ""Frank"" (as he calls his imaginary friend) takes him briefly into the future disappearing and reappearing throughout the film. Evidently only Donnie can stop it. The film moves from fantasy to reality with no clear indication as to whether or not Donnie's ""visions"" are real or if everything is in his imagination. Using a soundtrack made up of 80's staples (""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" by Joy Division, ""Head Over Heels"" by Tears For Fears, ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS among many other titles), director/writer Richard Kelly creates a bizarre satire of suburbia and surreal science fiction drama. Kelly's original version of the film featured some different songs and was shorter (and features new sequences and optical effects not in the 2001 release) but also seemed more open to interpretation. The allegorical references sprinkled throughout the film along with the bizarre dream sequences made the original film both fascinating and plain weird.This new director's cut makes the film less opaque and adds an element of the ""Twilight Zone"" to Kelly's rich, original vision. The director's cut isn't necessarily a better film just different. Visually stunning and with an outstanding cast, inscrutable script ""Donnie Darko"" was just different enough to not score with audiences post-9/11. That's tragic as this totally original film makes an impression whether you're watching the original version or the director's cut of the film.""Donnie Darko"" lives up to its title with a number of unusually dark images. Fox has done an admirable job translating this film to DVD.  Unfortunately, Director Kelly and DP Hunter went for a muted, gauzy look with soft blacks and muddy image reproduction. There's nothing we can do about and Fox has done the best with what they were given. I did notice occasional analog flaws pop up on the print but aside from that it looks pretty good despite the limitations placed on the film by Kelly and Hunter. I'm surprised that Fox didn't use the extended branching approach here that they did with  the""Alien Quadrilogy"" boxed set but that could be simply because the film has been reshuffled too much to do so. The 5.1 and 2.0 mixes sound solid although the sound is a bit murky towards the conclusion with some distortion on this edition of the film.Fox wisely put all the extras on disc two of this set allowing the film to benefit from the extra disc space. We get a ""Donnie Darko Production Diary"" (with optional commentary by Director of Photography Steven Poster). . There's also a commentary track by Director of Photography Steven Poster in the Donnie Darko Production Diary which provides an interesting insider's perspective and lots of trivia about the production of the film. Featuring camcorder shot footage of the search for locations and behind-the-scenes footage of the production, it's an interesting glimpse into the process of pre-production. #1 Donnie Darko Fan is the result of an internet contest for the best short film about being a fan of this film. The winner's film is included and gives a glimpse into the odd world of fandom. We also get a storyboard to screen comparison for a key sequence from the film. They Made Me Do It features interviews with British fans of the film discussing what drew them to the film and how it changed their view of the world.A fascinating commentary track by Director Kelly who discusses his film with fellow Director Kevin Smith (""Clerks""). It's, at turns, informative, philosophical and very involving. Does it answer the big questions about this film? Not exactly but it wasn't designed to do that either.Kelly's original vision has been revised somewhat in this ""Director's Edition"" of Donnie Darko. The meaning of Kelly's film is still, ultimately, open to debate and while the film may be a bit less ambiguous than the first theatrical cut, its also got its fair share of great moments as well.  The first disc comes with a terrific commentary track by Kelly and Director Kevin Smith. The second has all the extras including a documentary on the making of the movie, a glimpse at the fandom following this unusual cult film. We also get to see the film that won the contest for #1 Donnie Darko fan. While it's not something to crow about it is an interesting look at what levels the fans of this unusual and great little movie will go to. Be warned fans of the theatrical cut that this version runs longer, has different songs and may spoil some of your pet theories about the film's meaning."	4.0	Expanded director's cut slightly different take on story	2005-02-15	10	10	0
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5	W. freeman	I know now why i never watched this movie years ago, and i'm a HUGE fan of psychological horror. This i'm afraid is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. For one i'm not a fan of Jake Gylenhall at all, for another this movie makes no sense even in the world of a demented mind. Seeing visions, time travel, jet engines falling on your room for no reason, doing something because you take medication for your troubles and an evil guy in a scarey bunny mask tells you to? Ok. Well it seems the general premise of the movie was to be clever, just like a lot of bands, and tv shows try to be, or speak cleverly to prove its something unique. This movie is a joke within itself, it contradicts itself, by trying to be serious and again by trying to be darkly funny. Well neither work and the movie just falls flat and you end up fast forwarding through the last 40 minutes or so. Anyways movies like this just make me wonder how people can try and come up with ideas, and i think to myself wow i could come up with something ten times more clever. But my ideas would never get heard, this movies is not demented, it just attempts to be.	2.0	Donnie Dorko	2010-08-06	17	3	14

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	DONNIE DARKO has gained audience appeal through its DVD release after lukewarm responses at the cinema in 2001.The film focuses on a teenage boy with psychological problems, and is told through his eyes.  The boy receives messages from an evil rabbit whom is a figment of his imagination. A number of disturbing events occur, but by the end of the film, you are left wondering what is real and what isn't.Donnie Darko has some merits including interesting performances from the entire cast, and an fairly engaging storyline (but it does drag at times).  Overall, the film is over-rated and only worth seeing to try and determine why it has a cult following.  I'm still figuring out its cult following. Obviously theatre audiences from 2001 agree with me.DVD SUMMARY - includes many deleted and extended scenes.  Some of these are expected to be included in the impending Director's cut due for release shortly.  Apparently this new Director's cut will improve the film's meaning.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1HK1LRON0UJ5X	William McNeill	"The air of creepy dread in ""Donnie Darko"" is pitched just right.  The movie plays with the conventions of teen comedy and teen horror movie without falling into the traps of either.  Jake Gyllenhaal generates real sympathy for a character that could have easily been just another Holden Caufield variant.  The tricky plot keeps you guessing.  The movie is also the first period piece whose period is the late 1980's, which has got to count for something.  ""Donnie Darko"" is totally worth watching once.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of watching it twice within the space of a few days, and the second viewing diminished the charm of the first.  Suddenly the teen angst was too heavy, and the loose ends I had found teasingly enigmatic seemed merely sloppy.  Then I made the even worse mistake of watching a few scenes with the commentary turned on.  Director Richard Kelly is a young guy with a dopey voice who clearly identifies with the put upon Donnie.  The gap between what he thought he was doing and what actually came across killed whatever mystery was left.""Donnie Darko"" is Richard Kelly's first movie, and I'm eager to see what he does next.  He's got more visual panache and interesting ideas than most people out there.  If ""Donnie Darko"" doesn't hold together, it's mostly because he tried to put too much of a good thing into one package.  You can still get your money's worth out of this movie, but you have to know what to do with it: watch it once, and take it back to the video store."	3.0	Spielberg Gothic	2003-02-22	4	1	3

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	There is a curious cinematic form that has emerged in the last few years, which is akin to the Moebius Strip.  In such films, past shades into future, cause and effect are interchangeable, and the film loops around neatly (and shockingly) to reveal that it is really a sort of closed alternate universe. Examples include Lost Highway, Memento, 12 Monkeys, and now Donnie Darko.One of its charms (and frustrations) is that, like Vanilla Sky, you are never certain just what sort of film it is you are watching until the end.  It reveals itself slowly - layer by layer.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a likeable young man troubled by what is probably paranoid schizophrenia.  Refreshingly, his parents (played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnel), are not the usual teen flick dummies.  The family, while a bit dysfunctional, manages to remain cohesive and loving.  This is important.  The film would function as a sympathetic treatment of mental illness even if it did not have other goals in mind.Darko has strange visions and visitations.  He sleepwalks, and finds himself waking up in odd places.  Most disturbing, he seems to hallucinate a guy named Frank in a macabre bunny suit, who tells him that the world will end in 28 days.  It does not take long to figure out that he's referring to Darko's world, not the world as a whole.To enjoy this film, one needs to understand two things: the events, though strange, are leading to a definite, coherent conclusion; and - importantly - the audience is asked to participate in fitting the pieces of the puzzle together.  There is no character given the task of explaining it to the audience to make sure we get it.  That there is an answer, and that it's slyly revealed through seemingly inexplicable pieces doled out in the course of the story, is a testament to the skill of first-time writer-director Richard Kelly.As plenty of other reviews here make clear, there are many people who lack the patience for this sort of thing.  If you are one of them, you have been warned. You will probably find Donnie Darko both perplexing and pointless. But if you enjoy puzzles, if you find yourself trying to second guess where films are going as you watch, then you will probably find this film enjoyable.Although I didn't think Donnie Darko was very profound, I did find it moving.  Jake Gyllenhaal embodies his character completely, making him sympathetic even when his behavior borders on psychotic.  His is a brilliant, if malfunctioning mind, and Gyllenhaal's performance manages the neat trick of telling us that there is a decent human being struggling under the burden of his illness.  This basic decency leads him to decision at the end of the film that, while not very surprising, is nonetheless heroic in its own way.The DVD is fairly good, with some interesting (if not particularly revealing) extras, and a couple of frustratingly disjointed commentary tracks.  In my opinion, actors and directors should strive to actually PREPARE what they are going to say, while still allowing for some spontaneity during the recording session.  If not, you get a lot of laughing and people talking over one another, as you do here.  It's good for a listen, but don't expect anything truly revealing.I'm not sure how much further the Moebius film can be taken.  It may be exhausted with just a handful of striking examples.  But then, who could have foreseen such a striking, original film as Donnie Darko in the first place?	4.0	Moebius strip	2004-02-16	6	5	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A2CUTR9F6T1NP4	Winky	I actually bought the Donnie Darko DVD for five dollars. It caught my eye because of the cast. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore who also produced the film.This film is a psychological thriller. It is about a high school student (Gyllenhaal) who is very delusional. He has a strong opinion about society and isn't afraid to share it. Through out the movie he sees a psychiatrist who tries to help him with his oddness and attitude towards life.Later Gyllenhaal is visited by a demonic rabbit, is it a real, is it a dream or is it just a message from the future? This demonic rabbit appears every now and then and influences Gyllenhaal's actions. His conference with the rabbit makes him become interested in time travel.Towards the end of the movie the truth of certain individuals come about and the solution to the demonic rabbit is revealed.I enjoyed this movie because it challenges the viewers mind. It bottles you up until the end in which you are ready to have an understanding of the movie.	5.0	An INteresting Original Movie	2005-06-15	2	1	1

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A39NXAD50F6YVZ	Winston Smith	"...Lost Highway meets Heathers meets Unbreakable meets 2001 A Space Odyssey.Some movies refuse to follow the rules of conventional storytelling and the results are often a disaster, but sometimes they result in something wonderfully different--and this is an example of that. The way ""Donnie Darko"" meanders without warning, or apparent reason, from one genre to another is one of its charms. Is this a science fiction film? superhero? horror? Teen comedy? Yes, all of them!Also refreshing about this film is, despite its name and gloomy cover art, this is not another pointless excercise in teenage doom-and-gloom, depression, angst, apathy, etc. (see Butterfly Effect). The dark moments are tempered by warmth and sweetness (e.g. Donnie actually discussing the time travel book with his family instead of hiding it away, or the genuine affection shown when they watch the youngest daughter perform in the talent show, etc.)The plot is a muddled mess, overly ambiguous, and even the director, in his commentary, seems a bit confused over what he's wrought. He seemed to have a lot of big ideas but lacked the discipline to connect all the dots. There is a lot of exposition missing that would have helped clarify just what we are beholding. Imagine trying to follow all the alternative time-lines and character crossovers of, say, the Back to the Future trilogy, but from the perspective of a minor character who is never actually aware of Marty and Doc and their time machine but witnesses only the changes that resulted from their interference and you have some idea of what I'm talking about.But it is significant that the ambiguity of the plot is never boring or frustrating, as it sometimes is in, say, a David Lynch film, in which you often feel like the director's jerking you around without any point. Donnie Darko always FEELS as though its coming together like some kind of complicated puzzle...even if it ultimately doesn't.The plot, as well as I can make out, is this: A jet engine falls from a plane, landing on Donnie Darko's house and killing him. But due to some time-space anomaly, explained only as an ""act of God"", the engine falls several weeks earlier than it is supposed to..seemingly dropping from out of the blue sky. This time-space anomaly threatens to disrupt the stability of all existence, and so a ghost-figure from the future travels back in time to save Donnie from being killed by the errant jet engine, then proceeds to guide him through various ritualistic acts of violence and destruction that, for reasons never made entirely clear, are necessary to correct the time-space paradox and thereby keep the world from ending. By the end, Donnie apparently has acquired the power to create a ""wormhole"" in space, and when that plane finally makes its flight and drops its engine, he uses a wormhole to transport that dropped engine back in time, thereby correcting the paradox (and sacrificing himself in the process).If it sounds convoluted, it is, but like I said, its never boring. And my analysis may be way off base, but that's part of the magic---that there is plenty to ponder and speculate by the time the credits roll. Give Donnie Darko a chance."	4.0	Butterfly Effect meets Being John Malkovich meets...	2004-09-03	15	13	2
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AVC8ZAFPYOHZL	"W. Jamison ""William S. Jamison"""	"I was struck by the reverse similarity with ""It's a Wonderful Life"". With Jimmy Stewart we have an angel helping him see what his community would have been like without him and this convinces him that it is a wonderful life thus saving him from suicide. With Donnie Darko we have the opposite scenario. Donnie uses quantum physics through the aid of his science teacher and a street wandering centenarian who has written the book on time travel. This enables him to see why everyone will be better off without him and he saves them from himself by using the portal to wipe away his life and the subsequent destruction it causes. The special effects and relationships are certainly different. The family argument at the dinner table is different. But especially different is the moral implication that life for everyone else would be better without Donnie. What a paradigm shift this is. Do our depressed kids need this kind of suggestion?"	5.0	Its a Wonderful Life in reverse	2005-08-05	3	2	1
B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1W86FGCI4XJG5	"W. J. Chambers ""post-human"""	"Yes, I do compare this version of the brilliant film Donnie Darko to Star Wars.  And why would this be relevant?  Because it seems that the director of this film, drunken with the ravings of fans and critics, has decided to make a small buck and tinker with something that was sacred..and you don't just do that.  Alright Richard Kelly, your movie was a cult hit, it touched lives, and it almost seems that the carelessness and savagery you've displayed in destroying your film are indicative of a general lack of care for your fans.  To quote one of your great characters in the film:  ""I have serious doubts about your commitment to Sparkle Motion!""  And what is so bad about this ""director's cut""?Many things, and too many to list here, but I'll throw out a few that Darko fans are sure to remember.  The opening scene, with it's beautiful panorama and ghostly music has been altered to include the intrusion of chirping birds and new sound effects that take away the original impact of the scene, afterwhich the Echo and the Bunnymen song ""Killing Moon"" has been replaced by the much less enthusiastic INXS song ""Never Tear Us Apart"".  Speaking of music, Kelly has taken songs out of their original place throughout the film and completely rearranged them in a much less compelling way.  Remeber that great scene where Donnie is following a timepath with the Church's ""Under the Milky Way"" playing?  Gone.  Replaced by the ending of the ""Killing Moon"", which just does not work.  One wonders if Kelly didn't just take all of the bonus material on the original DVD and slap it in, including the Roberta Sparrow book, rearrange the music and add a few new sounds in the mix.  Is this what fans wanted?  Maybe we were happy with what we had?  The extra scenes are all on the original, along with the book, so why buy this?  Well if you are like me, then you got caught up in all the ""Donnie Darko is being re-released in a suped up form"" hysteria and went out and impulse bought it.  Well I wish I hadn't, and from one fan to another, trust me..this one is not worth your money."	1.0	Biggest dissapointment of the year...so far(think Star Wars)	2005-02-21	32	24	8

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A1VDNNGF006HM7	wolffacedgladiator	This movie is sheer brilliance. The concept is genius. A boy with a sleepwalking disability cheats death by wandering out of his house in his sleep and avoids a jet engine that lands in his room, and the second he cheats death the culmination of all the actions of his unplanned existence presents itself in the form of a sinister bunny named frank. This is the only logical explanation for the basis of this movie, some people will try to say Frank helps him cheat death by luring him out of the house, but that just doesn't work. Frank didn't exist beforeDonnie cheated death, so that's impossible, not to mention there's a reason why the movie opens up w/ Donnie waking up on the Carpathian Ridge. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard, and the movie sticks to the time period better than movies actually released in the 80's. This movie is incredibly deep and complex, and acted out by a broad scope of talented actors and actresses. Richard Kelly is a masterful director, and nobody could play the role of Donnie Darko better than Jake Gyllenhaal.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A7KQDQJKU2J2H	writer@repairman.com	"You can't get more surreal (unless you consider Linklater's ""Waking Life"" or Bunuel's ""Le Chien Andalou"") than Donnie Darko.  Elegantly crafted both in cinematography and definitely in script, this film includes not only strong acting but visceral chills in more than a few places ... and then adds dark humour on top of it all.  In my opinion, if a film brings you close to tears in laughter as well as in sympathy, it should rank among the highest in your collection.Jena Malone (Gretchen) gives a smouldering angst-ridden performance alongside Jake Gyllenhaal .. who was also seen in Bubble Boy, which I do not recommend.  I've never seen Drew Barrymore act better.  Even the small roles were developed and meticulously acted, such as Cherita, and Donnie's sister.  All of them had motives and yearnings, which I long to see more in Hollywood.  The score is also a must-have, composed by Michael Andrews, and with a fabulous song by Gary Jules - cover of Tears For Fears - Mad World.This should be seen by everyone."	5.0	Absolutely.	2002-05-19	3	3	0

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	A3IN8P3AYWMYB7	Yucca Bravo	With a plot that seems to wander from place to place it can be difficult to follow, however, Donnie Darko's various storylines are necessary for the plot to work.  Try to view them as tributaries all coming together to form a greater river, or in this case film.  I thought that fresh faces and the veterans melded seemlessly into a great cast.  This is the kind of film that depends on direction, plot, and acting, not a 300 million dollar special effects ILM crapfest.

B00005V3Z4	Donnie Darko (Widescreen Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"I am an avid film-watcher, especially ones with mind-bending material such as this one, but I can honestly say that I've never had a stranger experience watching a movie than ""Donnie Darko"".For a basic plot summary, a teen named Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who may or may not be just a tad emotionally unstable begins seeing a vision at night of a giant bunny.  When said bunny saves him from certain peril one night, it sets in motion a chain of events that present Donnie with a serious of decisions he must make.  To say any more would be to starting leaking spoilers.I'll start with the positives here: Despite the fact that the film gives away absolutely nothing (like a never-ending card game where the hands are never shown), it was still an enjoyable experience.  The characters are interesting, the plot is intriguing, and even though I never quite knew exactly what was going on, I never felt like I was wasting time.  It always seemed as if forward progress was still being attained.That being said, I can't give this movie the full five-star treatment like so many others.  Why?  Because I believe any movie has to have some sort of ""base"" (or some answers given), and this film just refuses to provide them.  It's like being asked to decipher a code without being given any sort of ""key"".  Maybe I'm missing something big here, but until I finished the movie and went online in search of answers I was utterly clueless as to what the heck I just witnessed.  Those online ""answers"" that I found, however, didn't seem to have shown up in the actual movie itself (or very slightly).  SPOILER ALERT: It all seems to be related to the ""book"", but yet the book only shows up in flashes in the movie.  Only in promotional materials does the book seem to be explained, giving us the ""key"" to understanding at least a little bit.Of course, it is always possible that I just ""don't get it"".  But until I do, this is an oddly middling effort for me.  More frustrating than anything, as I was totally engaged until the end when I was severely let down by the esoteric nature of the experience."	3.0	Films This Deep Need SOME Explanation, But This One Provides Nothing	2013-09-18	2	1	1
