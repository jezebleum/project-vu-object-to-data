Mathematics and science are every bit asnatural to Ellie as knitting a scarf or whipping up asouffle. Ellie's on a one-woman mission tofind intelligent life somewhere out in the cosmos. Itsure ain't in this movie. Here's how she quantifiesher excitement:""You know, there are four hundred billion stars outthere, just in our galaxy alone. If only one out of amillion of those had planets, and just one of out of amillion of those had life, and just one out of amillion of those had intelligent life; there would beliterally millions of civilizations out there.""OK, here's what I get: ""one out of a million"" of fourhundred billion leaves you with 400,000. So before youeven get to the second ""one out of a million"" you areout of millions to get one out of.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2CRUETJKX1WA5	absent_minded_prof	This movie stands head and shoulders above most science fiction.  I was really moved by it when it came out...  Before I forget, I want to recommend looking at &quot;Carl Sagan: A Life&quot; by Keay Davidson, or at &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps&quot; by Kip Thorne.  Both have some discussion of this movie -- Kip Thorne's discussion mostly has to do with Carl Sagan consulting him about the wormhole idea, but still.  Or, for more about the Drake Equation, look in your copy of Michael Crichton's &quot;Sphere&quot;.This movie captures the excitement of astronomy, and the feel of SETI-like programs, to a &quot;T&quot;.  Jodie Foster is terrific -- I wonder if she considers this one of her better roles.  I hope so, because she blew me away.  Tom Skerrit plays a complete jerk, which is sort of a stretch for him, as he generally seems to get more solid, midwestern-American-values sorts of roles...  He does a good job though.  Rob Lowe has a minor but interesting part, as the movie's version of the real-life Ralph Reed -- look it up, seriously, that guy is worth knowing more about.  Also, Angela Bassett plays a powerful African American woman with her usual aplomb.  She brings a lot of intelligence and vividness to her part.  James Woods is pretty terrific too -- I would give a lot to hear his input on various scenes, he's no dummy, science-wise, as a real-life M.I.T. graduate.The excitement of science is what you walk away from this movie feeling.  So often scientists in movies are &quot;mad scientists&quot;, or maybe an action movie hero type with a slightly introspective streak.  Jodie Foster's character is an atheist, a scientist, and of course a woman, but she makes a great heroine.  Generally this movie just rocks, and rocks hard.  I imagine that Carl Sagan would have considered this a fantastic curtain call, before he left this planet.  Two thumbs up.	5.0	Just fantastic	2000-10-18	4	3	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	"He became so famous as an astronomer that it's easy to forget he was one heck of a fine wordsmith as well. Yes he was. You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.Why COSMOS? Well, if I type ""billions and billions"" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word ""marvel"" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book.And yes, the DVD as well, which is good since that's what I'm supposed to be reviewing here.  The DVD is true to the book, so of course it's excellent.  A whole lot of fine actors here too."	5.0	Contact	2006-08-27	6	0	6
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3PEMQAM8WICIO	A Customer	&quot;Contact&quot; began with promise.  The first 30-40 minutes told a compelling scientific detective story.  I looked forward to seeing the science team interact, detect, and piece together the alien signals.  Sadly, the intelligent characters were cast aside and the plot moved to  Washington, D.C., not known as a mecca for bold, original thinkers.With  all the richness and possibilities inherent in cinema, I was frustrated to  witness so many scenes revolving around TV news screens and the lingering  reaction shots of the cast.  Great scientific discoveries were being made,  but the director chose to show the characters having dull meetings and  watching TV.  &quot;Contact&quot; was weighed down by sappy music  throughout.It wasn't possible to take &quot;Contact&quot; seriously  after the tedious second act.  The main character was diminished by the  filmmakers' unimaginative reliance on crudely caricatured antagonists.  The  sets and special effects were well done, but there was no need to dwell on  them.Big Moments happened every 7 minutes, and the story's power was  diluted by the time Dr. Arroway began the space voyage.  When there was no  turning back and her face was at maximum contortion, I thought she finally  understood the true meaning of the cryptic Vega message: It's a cookbook!	2.0	I wanted to like it.	2000-03-11	10	5	5
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3QP8RGAUPF2OS	"A Customer ""Vicarious sycophants will abuse t..."	"`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  Part IOriginally, review of this movie found some fault with the short shrift given to the novel's breathtaking resolution.  Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content.  Computer graphics are ok, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie.  So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9/'02).  The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some `association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, ""The Pentagon Propaganda Machine"", largely channeled through the movies.So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library).  And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s.  Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book ""Language and Problems of Knowledge"".  The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character.  Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science.  I guess any theater company's rendition of `Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story.  Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro.  So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible.  I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape.  That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story.  Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in ""Quantum Gravity"" by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in `Minority Report'.What can be done?  Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could.  This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted.  (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in `Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie `The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens.  Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity.  Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth?  I doubt it.  And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like `The Matrix', `CUBE', `THX', `Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings.  So who knows?  It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life.  Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century.  Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides.Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs.  That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe.  Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing.  In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like ""Ozone Diplomacy"".  The `official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.See the unsettling conclusion to the review on the soundtrack...."	3.0	`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  (Part I)	2006-07-21	15	0	15

I sat around for hours with my friends discussing time and space, heaven and hell, religion,  faith, and the realities of science.  Carl Sagan should have his  masterpiece reviewed in every philosophy class out there.  It isn't the  aliens that draw you into the story, its the combat between science and  religion, and the realization that both need to fall back on a little thing  called faith.	5.0	Good enough for english class	2000-01-11	5	5	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AEJ31WGHJ59C	Adam Shah	Another masterpiece by Jodie Foster.  Foster can make the worst movie tolerable--e.g., Nell--or make a good movie into a great one--e.g., Silence of the Lambs.Here, the movie starts out with a great plot and Foster  does not disappoint.  Foster plays a scientist obsessed by the search for  extra-territorial intelligence, the SETI project, at a time when government  cutbacks are shutting the project down.  Foster portrays the scientist  obsessed by her field but unable to make others understand how important  her interest is very well.  The scene in which Foster first hears an alien  message is particularly powerful and the subsequent search to understand  the alien message is very interesting.  Although I am not a scientist, the  task of decoding the message was easy to follow but, at the same time was  somehow complex and even suspenseful.  The scenes of contact are low key  and, in many ways similar to the analogous scenes in 2001.  I believe this  was intentional given the other similarities of this movie to 2001.  Most  obviously, the search for extraterrestrial life in both movies results in a  story more about the human condition than about our interaction with other  life forms.A note of further interest:  there is a surprising,  although understated, scene at the end which seems to explain everything  but on further reflection, still leaves almost everything unresolved.Finally, several reviewers have complained about the Matthew McConaughey  character, the modern man of faith. McConaughey plays a man struggling to  keep science within the bounds of morality, religious or otherwise.  Jodie  Foster's character and he clash since she is not only a scientist who  believes in knowledge without moral limits and does not believe in G-d.  Rather than take sides on this debate, the movie, instead, presents both  sides fairly and then proposes that the two views can co-exist peacefully  without either banishing G-d from our lives or putting irrational limits on  science.I applaud Hollywood for dealing with this issue, even  superficially, since it is controversial and yields no easy solutions.  The  McConaughey character changes my review from a four star review (very good,  but not special) to a five star review for a rare movie which is both  entertaining and intelligent.	5.0	Amazingly Well Done	2000-05-30	5	4	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AHL35XZ3OND2Z	Adron Gardner	"Before I review this film, I am going to say this. If you haven't seen this film - don't. Track down Disney's 80s made-for-cable ""Flight of the Navigator"" and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night. But if you must...Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it.In many ways Contact is a concept film - a ""what if"" statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. ""What if"" somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? ""What if"" the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? ""What if"" we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong.Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father-daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey.  This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie.  Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. Ellie discovers the sound, Ellie discovers the bomber, Ellie...well you get the idea.  All the males are paper cut out bastards and little old Ellie is the perpetual victim.  It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the characters and writing rather than engaging into the story.  Yes it is one of those movies.The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight.  The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a ""are you kidding me?"" laugh-out-loud ""alien"" beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues.The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some."	2.0	White Noise	2011-01-04	18	3	15

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	This movie tells an intelligent story about a possible type of first contact between humanity and an extra-terrestrial civilization.  While that is part of the reason that I gave this movie 5 stars, I was even more  impressed by the director's ability to catch a glimpse of what can be the  dog-eat-dog world of scientific funding, credit and credibility.Jodi  Foster plays a brilliant, budding young scientist who wants to pursue SETI  (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) work.  Her former mentor (Tom  Skerritt), now head of the National Science Foundation (the government's  primary funding agency for science), sees that work as professional  suicide.  He then does what he can to pull the rug out from under her and  her work.  In the meantime, Foster meets McConaughey, a handsome ex-priest  who seeks truth not via science, but through spirituality.When Foster  recognizes that contact is taking place and she makes that information  public, Skerritt swoops in and attempts to take control of the project.I  am extremely impressed by this movie's ability to tell a great story of a  possibility, presenting the premis of non-confrontational contact.  This is  no shoot-em up movie.  It does, however, have a healthy dose of special  effects, but those effects are not the heart of the show.There are  interesting plot developments, instructive insights into the lengths that  some scientists may go to gain recognition among their professional peers,  and the conflict that some scientists face when they realize that there are  more ways to learn about who we are and why we are than via science.I  encourage you to give this movie a look.  The combination of story, acting,  special effects, and implications of the story make for a great movie!5  stars all the way.Alan Holyoak	5.0	Top notch, thoughtful sci-fi	2000-06-20	3	2	1

There is a secondary story about computing the digits of pi which did not appear in the movie - so you should read the book as well, because there is a very interesting discovery, independent (?) of the main theme.  The problems that the main character Elie faces - getting funding, administrative turf wars, lack of imagination on the part of congress and some of the public are probably pretty typical.  The highlight of the film for me was when The Signal first was received - it is done as an audio signal, which is not the way radio astronomers usually get data, but it is incredibly exciting.  So - unbuckle the seat belt restraining your imagination and enjoy the ride!	5.0	I Love This Story!	2014-05-27	0	0	0

The photography in ""Contact"" is very detailed. The shots that show the outer space and the natural beauties surrounding the research centers are proof of the high technical level of the team behind ""Contact"". The use of footage of popular characters (like Bill Clinton) look as real or even more real that the scenes in ""Forrest Gump"" (same technical team behind ""Contact"", but with more experience and more technology than where they did ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994). By the way, the music is also perfect for this film, the composer was Alan Silvestri.2).- THE MOVIE HAS AN INTERESTING CAST: in ""Contact"", we can find popular actors like Jodie Foster, James Woods, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Rob Lowe and Matthew McConaughey.3).- THE MOVIE WILL BE INTERESTING, PERHAPS WILL BE FASCINATING: and ""Contact"" isn't the exception to this rule. The human beings are always interested in the study of other planets and solar systems, and we are always wandering if there is life in other place besides the Earth.Robert Zemeckis is a director capable of tell a story in his movies, he has a lot of tricks and resources, he is very creative and he is always surrounded by the right people in every movie that he makes. Another interesting movies filmed by Robert Zemeckis are: ""Forrest Gump"", ""Back To The Future"", ""Cast Away"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""."	4.0	ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE MADE BY ROBERT ZEMECKIS.	2004-02-10	7	7	0

Even more amazing is that it remains so engaging without the typical bug-eyed monsters that populate science fiction.The ""human reaction"" to the series of unfolding extraordinary events is vividly portrayed, and is so reflective of our modern world. A blitz of media here, a special committee there, a glory seeker, a powerful manipulator, and even a terrorist all appear in this picture - it has them all.The script is very well done, and one of my favorite lines points out how humans are not only capable of beautiful dreams, but also of horrible nightmares as well.The film mentions that the bottom line is that we do not live in a world that is fair, but for this picture the bottom line is that it - including the performance of the wonderful cast - is an extremely fine piece of work from top to bottom."	5.0	A Beautiful Dream	2005-07-24	3	2	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A31D9IXASAR0FV	Alex Gomez	I think they definately should have stuck more closely to the source material. Ellie developing a sexual relationship with Palmer was really corny. I saw this movie once years ago, years before reading the book and I liked it alot then. But I just read the book a couple weeks ago, so I went back and bought this movie and realized how much they actually changed... for the worse.The main thing that troubles me with this film is the theological aspects. I'm an atheist (I wasn't when I first watched the movie years ago, so I didn't catch all the religious overtones at first) and I felt kind of slighted at the treatment of the source material. The way they made Ellie seem like a bad person for being an atheist. Granted, in the real world that is likely how it would've played out, but I can't help but feel this movie had more of a pro-religion agenda.The worst part of the film was definately the ending... If they had followed the book directly, the ending would've been much more dynamic. They also definately should've kept S.R. Hadden's ending. It was so cool, but instead in the book we just see S.R. Hadden's dead body being wrapped up. The book's ending was definately ten times more satisfying than the movie version's. All in all, I'd recommend this to others, but warning to those who have read the novel and loved it, you will be disappointed in this film, at least slightly.	3.0	After reading the book, this movies sort of disappointing	2009-03-23	5	4	1

Unfortunately it was just as meh as I remember it being.  Rather than being used as a vehicle to debate philosophy the movie seems to try and cram the idea down the audience throats that science and religion (Christianity particularly) can be justified within a single equation.  I feel as though I am constantly told throughout the movie that ""science is great but don't loose your faith"".  This whole movie would be better served as the novel originally did not choosing a side and merely posing philosophical ideas that sometimes conflict and leaving the audience to debates these different ideas among themselves.  Aside from the overly preachy anthem of the movie it just isn't very interesting.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3BFJFJRXMWXAX	Andy Williamson	"Having owned and seen many DVD's since getting my player in '98, I can now come back and say that this is one of the best. CONTACT is based on a book by Carl Sagan, and I approached it with caution but interest. It was a wonderful film to see on the big screen and of course lost some of that power in the transfer to your TV set. That aside, the transfer is GREAT and the sound-especially if you have DD 5.1 (I believe there is a DTS version as well) -is fantastic. The extras are actually interesting here; I really loved the explanation of the computer animated sequence for the opening of the picture. The other menu items are also interesting.Knowing Sagan's proclivities, I figured there would be a strong 'bash on religious thought' undercurrent to the film. I was pleased to see that that was not the case. The monumental issues of faith and science were *generally* dealt with respectfully. I did find Matthew M's character (former man of the cloth Palmer Joss) to be an interesting foil for Jodie Foster, SETI scientist, answering her pointed questions with even more thought-provoking statements like ""Prove it."" I appreciated that because, in fact, the naturalist/rationalist is at the same pains to support their ideologies. But I digress... Perhaps the most interesting point to the entire film is the way in which Foster's doubting character is forced to defend herself in the face of evidence that she imagined the entire experience. This alone leads me to believe that the entire purpose of the film is to tell the story of one person's transformation from skeptic to surprised and berated believer. How interesting...On the other hand, the preacher has no problem sleeping with Jodie Foster which was more than a bit strange, and the film's consistant portrayal of religious followers/leaders as morons and lunatics (Busey) grated on me after a while. Ugh. How tiring. How a number of reviewers can claim that this film was some sort of religious propaganda is *beyond* me.  Outside of 'Palmer Joss' the 'religious' characters are anything but likeable.  In the end, the film was still very good and well worth seeing despite these issues. It remains a powerful film with amazing originality.  The effects are wonderful, the displays of CNN crew and President Clinton effective at first, then a bit annoying.  Finally, to answer the question 'What was the point of having Jodie Foster travel all that way to meet her father?'  Uh, I think the reasons for that are obvious:1)  To prove to some of the numbskull film audience out there that perhaps not everything in life is not tied up with a ribbon as nicely as we want it to be.2)  The fact that perhaps this alien culture tailors these trips to the individual making them-and they knew that Foster's character had unfinished business with her father.3)  Plus, rather than overloading Foster's character, they presented themselves in a pleasing form.  Makes sense to me."	4.0	My first DVD!	2002-11-06	4	3	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	"CONTACT is an excellent sci-fier based on a Carl Sagan story and directed by Bob Zemeckis that deftly considers not only the possibility of life elsewhere but also both sides of the eternal debate on whether there's a Divine Being.It stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who tenaciously clings to her SETI explorations despite obstacles and resistance from her boss (Tom Skerritt). Just before the plug is pulled and Foster's Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence team is evicted from Socorro, NM's Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory, they get a hit. Monitored signals originating from the Vega constellation send a mix that includes a 1936 TV broadcast from Nazi Germany of the Berlin Olympics, the first high-powered signals of such a type. These apparently took 26 years to reach Vega, and 26 years to be bounced back.Not as a criticism of the plot, but this raises a question in my mind. I know little of physics, so it'll probably sound as dumb as I am on the subject. If there's nothing in the universe that's perpetual, including energy, how can a radiowave, which is a sort of energy (yes?), travel billions of miles without dissipating?Anyway, news of this discovery brings out the lunatic fringe, each group converging on Socorro, all with different agendas. Most amusing are the Chevy Vega car clubs; most frightening, some scruffy Neo-Nazis and a raving ""end-of-the-world"" proselytizer.When sub-frequncies are unscrambled and a language decoded, scientists are able to construct a one-person craft (from instructions sent by an unknown ET) that will instantly transport a passenger across the universe. Unseen events occur and Jodie is the one selected to make this voyage.A ""traveling through a wormhole"" sequence is terrific and quite scary. Jodie arrives safely on a planet somewhere in Vega. The next scene is so obviously foreshadowed early in the film the alert viewer is expecting it, and yet I found the experience to be very emotionally stimulating.

And that is only one of the several very fascinating details of Contact, and the methods in which Sagan's incredible book was translated to film.There is really so much to rave about, suffice to say the movie is perfect in my perception.  The inclusion of the cages, in such a fantastic glimpse (when she is in space en route to Vega and pausing, looking up), is merely evidence of the profundity of the entire film, and a very edgy creativeness, which surfaces just barely in these glimpses, to expose that the film's perfection is far more than air tight.  It is, in a way, not finished.  There are certain scenes, which move on, logically, naturally, but leave an open page.  And all of this done in such a subtle way.But of course, I recommend this movie, as well as a reading of the book.  After, or before the movie viewing.  I really do not think, in this case, it matters.	5.0	Cages	2002-01-17	0	0	0

An extra-terrestrial communication is picked up and (eventually) Jodie Foster goes on a very surreal space trip while apparently not moving. Foster is excellent throughout, but the film is spoilt by a crass sub-plot concerning so-called religious right politicians who try to prevent her going on the misson because she doesn't believe in God. The over-coiffured Matthew McConaughey looks far too well groomed for a priest, and is unconvincing in his role.There are some great moments though, and some excellent special effects, so there's enough here to interest the average sc-fi fan.	3.0	Good but flawed	2007-01-18	10	4	6

Apparently I'm not alone. Other reviewers have brought up a number of good reasons for their enthusiasm. Reasons such as top-notch acting, a thoughtful and thought-provoking story, and dramatic moments like the initial appearance of the alien signal and the destruction of the alien device.I'm on board with all of these observations. In particular, the intelligent treatment of the controversy that erupts over the human response is plausible. This is a more thoughtful scifi movie than most (not to take anything away from space operas), and that's a good thing. Beyond this, however, there are some things in CONTACT that are special for me that haven't been noted by others.First, there's the opening sequence. It begins with a view of earth floating in space. From there the camera seemingly falls away at an accelerating pace, zooming past the other planets in our solar system, flying backward to a position looking back at the Milky Wat galaxy. It's a breath-taking sequence and the DVD is worth having just for that alone.Then, there's the great scene when Jodie Foster's character enters the capsule and waits to go wherever she's going. ""Good to go"", she keeps repeating. ""I'm good to go."" I can never watch this part of CONTACT without reflecting on what a terrifying yet exhilarating moment that would be. Foster's character has no idea where she's going (if she goes at all) or what she'll find when she gets there. It's the moment she's waited her whole life for, but she's facing the ultimate unknown. The scene is, for me, an incredible one and I never tire of seeing it.Finally, the trip Dr. Arroway finally goes on is visually gorgeous and emotionally satisfying. What happens is very much open to debate, but the journey is eye candy from beginning to end. The ""contact"" she makes is a nice culmination of her touching relationship with her father.I hesitate to call CONTACT a great movie, but it's certainly a very good one. It's one I'm happy to own and I strongly recommend it to you. Further, as I write this, it's selling here for just $9.99. That's a bargain in my book.

It blends the whole spirituality/science thing with amazing dexterity.  Both fields seek meaning in this life and both ultimately end in a mystery.  So too this movie.  Jodie Foster is brilliant as a scientist who longs for meaning even in the midst of her scientific endeavors.  This movie is big all the way around.  Rather than highbrow entertainment we are drawn to the characters and really feel the character Jodie Foster portrays.My only criticism is the pseudo-religious character played by Matthew McConaughey which is a more sterilized version of presenting the religious element.  But the religious element is necessary to make the whole thing work or it becomes just another sci-fi flick.  Perhaps in places the movie is a bit over the top but in the end it works.Visually the film is remarkable.  It is not overladen with special effect but the special effects that are present are dynamite.  The best thing about the movie is that the observer is not a bystander but is required to engage the film and enter in.

There are many constraints, primarily budgetary and temporal, to making a film from a book.  By reading it after seeing the  film one is not disappointed by the lacunae left from editing out  &quot;extraneous&quot; material in the interest of brevity, and the written  version allows the reader to enlarge on relationships and side plots.  This  instance was no exception.  Although I enjoyed the characters, and  certainly the actors chosen for the parts were perfect for them, I felt  they were a little &quot;flatter&quot; than in the book despite being real  people.

Does anyone recall there being a belief test for astronauts before?There are mysteries in the world which are completely unfathomable to me. And one of them is why anyone can consider this film to be any good at all.It is true that it had a promising start, with the first alien signal being detected by scientists; but from that point on, it goes downhill at the speed of light. Apparently, it is supposed to be a realistic hypothesis on how contact with an alien civilization could take place. But for me the story is completely unbelievable, and so full of holes that they are too many to list them all... I don't believe NASA would ever handle things the way they do in the film, I don't believe the church, let alone some neo-hippy preacher, would have squat to say in how things were handled, I don't believe a terrorist could ever get that easily to the very centre of the most expensive and important structure ever built by mankind, I don't believe some rich guy could set up a secret spaceship orbiting the earth aside from the powers that be, just like that, I don't believe NASA would be so keen to discredit the tale of their chosen ambassador, especially having proof (the hours of blank tape) that there was some truth in it, and I do not believe aliens would show up in a virtual beach with the face and voice of some poor girl's dead daddy.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A55MRYPUAX4QU	Avid Reader	Form the majestic opening of silence to the meditative ending, this is a powerful portrait of human desire for knowledge. The intelligence of this film - especially compared to the garbage shown daily - is just stunning  Jodie Foster has said about the heroine that it was the closest any character had gotten in representing her spirit. That is an outstanding compliment considering the main character is based on a real-life scientist and the movie shows her as skeptic, searcher and explorer.The movie and the book have been compared both favorably and unfavorably but that should not be the case.  Both are excellent representations of their particular genre. The best one can say about their relationship is that the movie effectively captured the spirit of the book - if not exactly following the storyline.CONTACT has been called science-fiction for &quot;thinkers&quot; and it is void of much of what is seen in current films of this type - no action-packed space shootouts, no morphing monsters, no aliens using ESP or advanced technology.  No, it is instead a quiet demonstration, as the main character states, that we as a race are so small and so insignificant and so precious when viewed in the background of the Universe. It is continually surprising, the plot consistently logical, the characters always &quot;in character&quot;.  It is one of the best portrayals of scientists and their work with all the bickering, fighting, jealousy and in the end, awe upon discovering Nature's secrets.Philosophically, it asks many questions.  The book deals more forcefully with the role of superstition and religion as it relates to scientific ventures.  Indeed, both the book and movie go to great lengths to explain that science does not demand blind obedience and is constantly challenged and tested in its assumptions and theorems.  Whether or not one believes that other alien civilizations exist, this film makes one wish that it were true.Added kudos to the cinemtography and music.	5.0	A Credo for Our Age	2003-09-30	7	6	1

Deeply embedded in the story and the visual images and even certain lines of dialog is the spirit of Carl Sagan. He lives forever in the changes he brought about in his world.Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, who is passionately pursuing SETI - the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. As you probably know, lots of people consider it a huge waste of time, and lots more consider it a security risk. Then there are those who consider it blasphemy. All these viewpoints are represented in the film, along with the courage of scientific research and liberal theology. The latter is represented by Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey, quite delicious), religious philosopher and writer, and Ellie's lover and number one fan.Her number one financial backer is a mysterious billionaire named Dr. S.R.Haddon, a colorful figure to say the least, who made me think of Captain Nemo. He lives in an airplane, and seldom lands it. Her primary nemesis is Dr. David Drumlin, who first has her funding cut and then, when she finds unmistakably artificial signals, takes credit for the project and hogs the limelight.I'm not going to spoil too much in telling you that the signal includes detailed plans to build some sort of machine, nobody is quite sure what it's supposed to do. But a great deal is made of the fact that it seems like a vehicle of some sort, and only room for one person. Who will represent the entire human race to some completely unknown aliens? The government sets up a commission to make the decision, and Palmer Joss, as a close friend of President Clinton's (who appears in the movie, presumably with carefully edited stock footage), is included in the commission. Does he pick Ellie to go, knowing she may well not survive, or not be able to come back, or come back something over 50 years later, not having aged appreciably while he becomes an old man? She wants to go so very much, but then so do quite a few other qualified scientists, and also Dr. David Drumlin, Mr. Limelight Hog.The reasons for the commission's decision may depress the heck out of you; they did me. The stunning act of sabotage that threatens the whole mission is also depressingly realistic. In fact, good parts and bad, this movie is disturbingly realistic. But like Carl Sagan himself, the end result is optimism and faith in human reason.	5.0	Thoughtful Drama about the SETI Project	2012-05-13	0	0	0

I can't think of any other reason that &quot;Contact&quot; wasn't resoundingly laughed out of bookstores, much less theaters. I know my friends and I were reduced to helpless tears halfway through.The very notion that Jodie Foster is listening to the various frequencies that SETI is scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life is foolish enough, but then the flaws are compounded by repeated improbable meetings with priest Matthew McConaughey. Apparently, his character's dialogue with Foster's is supposed to be thought-provoking and challenging. Apparently, the screenwriters have never actually had a thought-provoking or challenging conversation.The payoff to all this foolish mumbo-jumbo is a machine the alien message provides for communicating with them, followed by actual contact. Sagan boldly goes where few esteemed figures have gone before, and rips off John Varley's novel &quot;The Ophiuchi Hotline&quot; for the idea of the aliens giving out plans for an interstellar communication device. Then we get the note-for-note theft of the climax of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Space turns out to be Heaven, where lonely little girls can meet aliens-shaped-like-Daddy. It was a foolish concept in &quot;2001&quot; and it doesn't smell any better second-hand.I urge everyone dazzled by this film to pick up works by Arthur C. Clarke and John Varley.

I felt that she portrayed her character well, particularly where she had to use her imagination in the scenes where she is experiencing and seeing things that are supposed to be indescribable. I thought she was masterful in expression of emotion.The rest of the characters were predictable and cheesy, however. I did not appreciate how the religious figures, except for one, were portrayed as hick, &uuml;berconservative obstructionists or fanatical, evil, and insane martyrs. Not very believable characters. I will say again, cheesy and predictable. The supporting actors were more believable (ex. president's secretary). Being LDS, I rolled my eyes at the reference to the fanatical preacher being from Utah. It was also a stretch in the plot to have a Howard W. Hughes figure in S.R. Hadden. His role in forwarding the plot was essential, but it was a bit silly to watch the Hughes eccentricity replicated.This was just an interesting premise by Carl Sagan and it shows that scientists indeed must have creativity in their field. I'm glad that Sagan stuck with science and did not continue to write books. The movie is good for Foster's acting and good for pretty good entertainment. Pop the popcorn and watch it. Just ignore the cheese.	3.0	Well, fun movie to watch, not a masterpiece, though	2014-03-19	0	0	0

What is this supposed to mean? This film offends just about everyone: science fiction buffs, scientists, atheists, religionists, those who believe in aliens, those who don't, and most of us hoping for alien contact of the Spielberg kind. If you think there's going to be lots of interesting special effects, fast forward the film after the first five minutes to the last ten minutes. This should save you hours of boredom. Also, is this what Carl Sagan wrote? Shame on him if he did! Zemeckis's own Forrest Gump could write a better story!

I can't remember any science-fiction film after 2001: A Space Odyssey to be this thought-provoking, and while Contact is not quite as profound a statement as the aforementioned opus, it still has quite a lot to say for itself. Jodie Foster plays an earnest scientist who spends her whole life searching for extra-terrestrial life and finds vindication when a message is received from outer space. Naturally, it throws the world into a huge frenzy, and despite the efforts of kitschy bad guy Tom Skerritt and military operations-head James Woods, she gets to go on a journey to the heart of the universe and see whether or not she can find the answers she's looking for.  Perhaps it's a little hokey, but I found myself totally captivated throughout the whole film, and the adventure Foster goes through in the last third of the picture is one of the most thrilling sequences in the films of 1997 (not the least because Foster, surrounded by all these new worlds she's viewing, can act the scene to pieces, which is amazing considering the fact that we know she really sat in front of a blue-screen for two weeks).

That's just an insane plot failure if you ask me.  When Foster does arrive at the Alien planet, they make everything look like Florida and the Alien she meets looks like her dad?  She goes through all that fuss, traveling across the stars just so she could see things that she can see anytime on Earth.  She gets about a 10 minute conversation with the Alien, who tells her basically nothing, then promptly sends her back.  That is just ridiculous and disappointing.  I get that the underlying theme was about ""faith"", but they could have done more with that ending.  At the very end of the film, Foster is speaking with some school kids and one asks her if there are life forms out there in space.  What does she say?  She tells him ""Good question...""  So, what are we supposed to take from that answer?  Why didn't she just say ""yes""?  Did she doubt what she saw and heard?

It's an incredibly moving story about a scientist who lives out a scenerio that has played out in the minds of real life dreamers like myself.  The ultimate &quot;what if...?&quot;.  Indeed, what if THEY (E.T.'s) contacted US (Earthlings).  Director Zemeckis does an excellent job of transferring novel to screen.  &quot;Too long&quot; say some critics.  No way!  Perfect.  Things play out quite well.  The &quot;backing into space&quot; opening sequence is probably my personal favorite of all time.  I'm thrilled to live in a time when movie makers can create such magic.  It's worth the price alone to see the first few minutes of this film.The cast is very good with Jodie Foster and John Hurt standouts.  Foster is as good in this as she was in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A6WZVL0SRQAPY	Brian Driver	This is one of my favorite movies OF ALL TIME. It's a movie about science, religion, faith, love, first contact, fanaticism, politics, money, genius, and intolerance.  It's a thoughtful film that's not afraid to confront not only what it might feel like to communicate with an alien race, but whether we are mature enough to handle such an event.I won't describe the plot--enough reviews have done that already. Here are, however, the reasons I think you will love this movie:1) IT'S A THRILLING ADVENTURE STORY: There is tension present throughout this movie, some of it represented by the big questions below, but a lot of it is because of the excitement of discovery. When early on in the movie radio astronomer Ellie Arroway (Jodi Foster) receives the radio signal from outside our galaxy, the movie kicks into high gear. Not only are they hustling to clarify the message signal, but they also have to decode it to discover an amazing set of what appear to be BLUEPRINTS...but for what?2) IT HAS A GREAT PEDIGREE: The original book is by scientist Carl Sagan, and it went through many changes in its almost decade-long development.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Flight,Cast Away,Forrest Gump, andGothika), it has quite a cast: besides Foster, there's Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt and Angela Bassett - all in top form.3) IT ASKS BIG QUESTIONS: What will happen to individuals, the country, and the world, when we finally contact alien life?  Are we mature enough as a society not to go off the deep end? How will discovery of another intelligent species change our attitude about God, Heaven, and our place within His universe? How will our political system react to science issues concerning national security?4) IT TAKES SCIENCE AND RELIGION SERIOUSLY: It's rare that a movie, or book, treats both of these subjects with care and sincerity. While the plot includes religious zealots who are definitely there to derail any somber efforts to follow the blueprints, McConaughey's Father Palmer is portrayed with genuine intelligence. This is NOT the McConaughey who so frequently plays the stoner dude in so many movies - no, this is the sober actor who once in a while gives us the potential he inA Time to Kill,FrailtyandThe Lincoln Lawyer [HD]. His Father Palmer is an advisor to the President, and it's a role that really lends gravity to the religious side of the discovery. I'm not especially religious, but I'm open enough to have movies portray religion at its best in order to increase the seriousness of the debate.Note: As for drawbacks, the movie does run a little long, and there is one plot development late in the film - I won't spoil it here, but it involves a backup plan that comes out of nowhere - that defies credulity. But they're just tiny flaws in the masterpiece, as they say, and in no way hurt this terrific, wonderful, intellectual movie.	5.0	An Enlightening Intellectual and Philosophical Adventure	2013-04-14	0	0	0

This one is grounded in the real world for a change, not the la-de-da what-if world of a fantasizer (although those can often be quite entertaining; it's just that this one is refreshing because of the perspective of writer/producer Carl Sagan).We see the struggle of the modern scientist to be taken seriously, the single-mindedness that marks the great mind, the helplessness of losing control of one's ""baby,"" all in the setting of a visually unique experience that's as dazzling as anything I've seen on film.Yet it's also Sagan's perspective that spoils the experience on one level. His evolution-based theories have always caused him to be singled out for opposition commentary by those who believe in Creation rather than his purist form of natural selection. Therefore his story includes snotty religionists (Rob Lowe in a bit of bizarre casting, thinly disguised as Jerry Falwell) and mindless fanatacism masquerading as religious fervor (stunning role by Jody Busey, son of Gary).  This smacks of possibly a ""strike back at them"" attitude in Sagan's heart, as he seems to see ALL Christians now as wild-eyed freaks and self-righteous hypocrites.Sagan's idea of presenting a balanced perspective toward those with religious views is to include a near-priest who dropped out because he ""couldn't handle celibacy"" and hops into the sack with Foster right away, yet is our Godly hero. Puh-leeze. Have to have sex to sell tickets, I guess, but that's seriously left field. Likewise the government people and department heads are all one-dimensional bad guys.I continue hope in vain that the movie industry at large can one day manage to lose its prejudice against us with a deep faith in God, and thereby present Christians as real three-dimensional people rather than one-note props to play off of and treat as idiots, yet there is no doubt that the story of ""Contact"" is moving and exciting, visually hypnotic and inventive. Obviously it does not commit the sin of boring the viewer; it's one you can debate after seeing it.Further, major props to the makers for at least presenting the scientist herself even-handedly. She is not Ms. Perfect. That would have been unforgivable. It's a shame she's the only character in the entire story who really seems like a real person with complexities and a past. For a 2-1/2 hour film, you'd think at least one other character would have the hint of a personal history.

Gould ""Remo &#34;Uzi&#34; Gwaldabi"""	Carl Sagan, the greatest science teacher in history writes a story of the epic battle between science and religion synthesizing the two into one. Science is the only way to reveal the true nature of the universe and religion is the manifestation of man's desire to know the ultimate truth without having to think at all. Both will completely fail to ever resolve the question of WHY even if science is able to explain in massive detail exactly HOW everything came to be and how it will end/begin. There is no greater entity to verify that why part. Clearly the tensions revolving around science and religion and the forces that seek to utilize one or the other to seek dominance was an issue when written and indeed remains a very serious problem almost 2 decades later. For whatever reason man seems to have to know the ultimate answers and will make them up when convenient. Despite the concept of the evil scientist, itself a product of fear and ignorance of science and what it reveals, the world has nothing to fear from science...it's not an ideology, just a method of proving things. However religion has been, and I'm afraid will always be, the greatest source of fear, hate, stupidity and violence affecting civilization that can ever be. That's why this movie is so damn good. Doesn't really resolve anything just opens up the dialog with imaginative, intelligent and artistic presentation.	5.0	Best science fiction movie ever	2013-05-24	3	2	1

The level of disagreement about life on other planets is intense, and evidence that something far more advanced might be observing us is as frightening as this movie makes it seem.  My favorite disagreement was about whether a chair would be necessary for space travel.  If the design for a pod doesn't include a chair, don't try to take one.  Philosophy might also be better if it wasn't an excuse for getting some university chair, which is not the kind of philosophy reflected in this effort.  Embarking on this trip, which presses the limits of what might happen at the speed of light, could easily be considered more thrilling than the finer points of any philosophy.	5.0	Multiple reflections.	2002-03-20	0	0	0

Although science fiction it based its premise on current massive expenditures of science actually seeking life elsewhere in the universe beyond our solar system but within our galaxy.  It relates the parallel thinking processes of scientific &#34;fact&#34; to religious beliefs letting the viewer accept both or neither.  Discovery isn't all about logic and cannot always be proven.

A  visually intense film, it is complemented by a passionate performance by  Jodie Foster, and despite those who don't hold McConaughey's acting ability  highly, Matthew delivers powerfully.To me, the film brings a compelling  comparison of science and religion, emphasizing the importance of faith for  both ambitions.  Others feel the film contrasts science and religion, with  the former based on probabilities and the latter on faith. Whatever you  take from this film, it is guaranteed to occupy your thoughts well after  the credits roll.I would have given this film 5 stars except for one  unneccesary and detracting scene. I will try not to reveal too much in  detail, but the hackneyed inclusion of government conspiracy downplays, or  rather eliminates, the audiences' need to share the same &quot;faith&quot;  as Palmer (McConaughey) and the population (in the movie). This scene  continues to irritate me and I believe sells us, the audience, short in our  ability to handle an inconclusive ending.Despite this distraction, I  still hold this film as one of my favorites.	3.0	A great film, but sells the audience short	2000-09-18	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A13GUM5TY2UROC	Carl Bostek	Carl Sagan had the gift of making astronomy and cosmology understandable.  As an astrophysicist he realized that our first contact with an alien species might very likely occur by picking up radio signals from space.  That was the premise he used in his novel Contact.  But Contact is not about the science or even about alien races, it is about how mankind might react to such contact and the role belief plays in shaping our understanding and our reactions to the certain discovery that other intelligent life exists in the cosmos.  And belief is what this movie is really about as it portrays Science and Religion as both lovers and adversaries in the quest for understanding and truth.Contact doesn't answer the ultimate questions of life, but it does present them in a dramatic, suspenseful and believable way and leaves us to ask ourselves what role our beliefs play in our own lives.	5.0	"Best ""First Contact"" Movie Ever!"	2014-02-09	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A16OO2AD1PFKPC	C. Doyle	"""Contact"" is a film that can be interpreted to be a film about several things.Ellie Arroway, our main character, is an astronomer working with SETI in New Mexico when she discovers a radio signal transmitting from a near-by star system.  After decoding the message, which turns out to be blueprints for a transportation device, they ""send"" her off.  When she returns, she discovers that it appears to everyone that she didn't actually ""go"" anywhere at all.The focal point that is driven in this movie was the relationship between Ellie and her love interest, Palmer (Matthew McConaughey...).Palmer is a spiritual man who ""can't picture a world without God.""  Ellie is a scientist who looks at fact and logic to understand the universe.  In the end, Ellie can't prove that she did ""go"" anywhere, but she finds that she has grown faith for it to be true.  Why?  Because her experience was a gift, a beautiful view of the universe and the realization that although, as earthlings, it may seem that we are all alone, we are actually not.  This is the meaning of religion; that when humans feel alone or weak or afraid, they can find comfort that God is with them.  Even though she cannot fully explain what happened, or the meaning of what she experienced, she will not back down from that belief, even with an angry James Woods yelling at her.I think that in the end, after going through the whole experience, Ellie finally finds out why people would choose to ""have faith"", rather than look at everything in a factual, scientific manner.A great movie overall.  A very rare film that combines science with science fiction, religion with ET, and ultimately, ""the pursuit of truth,"" which may not always mean what the facts support, but rather, what you believe inside.  Definately one of my favorite movies.My favorite quotes:Ellie(on God): ""How do you know that you're not diluting yourself?  For me, I'd need proof.""Palmer: ""Proof... Did you love your father?""Ellie: ""...Yes...very much.""Palmer: ""Prove it.""--Palmer: ""You personally.  You.  By doing this, you're willing to give your life. You're willing  to die for it.  Why?Ellie:  ""For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for...some reason why we're here.  I mean why are we here, what are we doing here? Who are we? If this is a chance to find out even a little part of that answer, I don't know, I think it's worth a human life...""--Ellie:  ""Is it possible that it didn't happen?  Yes...I had an experience.  I can't prove it.  I can't even explain it.  But everything that I know as I human being, everything that I am tells me that it was real.  I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever...a vision of the universe...that tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant, and how rare and precious we all are.  A vision that tells us that we belong to something that is greater than ourselves, that we are not, that none of us, are alone.  I wish I could share that.  I wish that everyone, if even for one moment, could feel that awe and humility and that hope...but...that continues to be my wish."""	5.0	The search for meaning, the search for truth	2005-10-23	8	5	3

Well what would it be like if the ending has aliens showing Jodie Foster the secret of life the universe and everything and sent her home with a pat on the head? Apart from being quite beyond the capability of even Carl Sagans mind, by showing only the traces of aliens the sense of the unknown is kept. You're kept thinking ""Oh come on I wanted to see more! What were they really like?"" Sure you may be disappointed by being given only a little information but if it was all explained to you with nothing left to the imagination the sense of disappointment would be greater. The aliens are kept mysterious to keep you curious. Human beings like to wonder. In effect the viewer (and reader in the case of the book) is given a ""teaser"". If it gets you wondering about what's really out there, then I think Carl Sagan has accomplished what he really intended.Overall I think the book is more thought provoking, but the movie does have good points in the visual effects area. In particular, the 3 minute opening scene showing the pan away from earth, moon, solar system, cometary cloud, nebuale, galaxy to other galaxies and beyond gives a real sense of scale to the universe, much more than simply words could desribe. It's one thing to say ""billions and billions"" but to *see* the universe visually is quite another. The scene where Jodie Foster floats down from the sky to the beach world is uncannily dreamlike too. And of course the movie soundtrack is very good too.Overall a quite enjoyable film, but not quite a ""classic"""	4.0	You don't see any aliens in the book either	2006-06-03	7	4	3

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1S3C5OFU508P3	Charles Ashbacher	The only event that I believe would have more power than establishing contact with alien intelligence would be an appearance by God similar to those documented in the bible. However, to many people, the events would be equivalent, which is one of the many themes of the movie. I very much enjoyed the movie, finding so many of the subplots typical of what would be expected if such an event occurred. The main character, a hard-driving independent female scientist, obtained much of that focus from having her mother die when she was born and her father when she was nine. This determination kept her going through many lean years of project cancellation and ridicule.Subplots aside, the main event was of course the message from aliens. Given the horror of the perspective of history, it seems bizarre that a telecast of Hitler opening the 1936 Olympic games would be the first message received. However, since it was the first telecast of any power, it is a reasonable possibility. The appearance of President Clinton as himself lends an air of realism that could be obtained no other way. He has a stage presence and an air of seriousness that makes his cameo appearance work to perfection. Other cameos by television commentators such as reporters reinforce the realism.While government agents are occasionally portrayed as bureacratically bound, it does not descend to the appearance of idiocy, which was a welcome relief. The agents are characterized as rigid, but not foolish, up to the very end. The last segment, where you see the beginning of a cover-up is the least plausible notion and comes across as artificial.  The main character, played superbly by Jodie Foster,  is a strong personality and as befits such a character, she is surrounded by similar strong personalities, one of the toughest of which is the president's chief of staff. She is a hard-nosed woman who gets her way simply by saying what it is. Foster's &quot;boyfriend&quot;, a deeply religious man who contributes heavily to her loss of a prized position, still respects her beliefs even though he strongly disagrees with them.With all the subplots, the main plot is still strong enough to dominate the movie. It is a movie with all the intrigue of a major political event, yet still manages to retain the scientific aspects of any contact with an alien civilization.	5.0	Blended political intrigue and scientific achievement	2001-09-21	5	4	1
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1C48YH2PUJTJZ	Charles H Pearson	This is one of the many books that never survived the transition to film.  The director concentrated on special effects (which are impressive) but completely ignored the more important elements of character and message.Jodie Foster does a respectable job, given the script, as Ellie Arroway.  The rest of the cast is entirely forgettable.  In the novel, the character S.I. Hadden is terribly important to the philosophical debate.  He is reduced in the film to a bit part, and a kook.Sagan's novel is an elegant debate between Science and Religion.  Both are given the respect and skepticism the righly deserve. The novel is brilliant in its observations about the orthodoxy of both.  The novel's characters are rich and fully developed.  The film fails miserably.The novel is less a sci-fi story than a rich debate of philosophy.  The film is nothing more than sci-fi special effects.  Several important characters from the novel are &quot;rolled into&quot; a single, rather pathetic, character of the film.Perhaps the most egregious sin the film makes is creating a sexual relationship between Arroway (Jodie Foster) and Palmer Joss (Matthew MacChaughay).  This NEVER HAPPENED in the novel, and it completely destroys the intellectual content of the novel.The film was originally supposed to be made by Franscis Coppola.  In the year or two prior to Sagan's death, there were some legal problems, and Coppola lost the rights to the film.  Instead, it was made by Robert Zemenkis.  Zemenkis destroyed the novel, and create a most mediocre film.  We can only wish that Coppola had the chance to make it.Skip the film. Read the book.  The book is an elegant dialog between Science and Religion.  The film is just a movie.

Great direction by Zemeckis, and Jodie Foster is brilliant as usual, and Sagan's ideas are well worth bringing to the screen.Now for the nitpicking...--SPOILER WARNING--I haven't read Sagan's book, but I'm guessing the story was altered to give it a wonderful sappy ending in which religion and science are ""both right"". Maybe they are both right, but this movie sure didn't show it. Because the ending has a monstrous gaping hole.In their effort to teach Ellie (and us) a lesson about faith, the writers contrive an ending where Ellie is left with nothing but a memory to verify her wonderful experience. An angry congressional inquiry, led by the James Woods character, investigates, and comes up with an alternative explanation for everything that has happened -- that it's all been an elaborate hoax perpetrated by the eccentric genius Haddon. But this is ridiculous, for many reasons. For one thing, how did Haddon come up with radically new technology capable of generating lightning and tidal waves yet inside of which ""the weather's fine""? He's smart, but not that smart (he has self-sealing door metal technology that he never thought to sell?).But more importantly, a signal from deep space could not be faked by a satellite, especially one that's been verified in Australia. And even if it could, THE SIGNAL WAS STILL THERE during the entire building of the machine. The aliens could not have known it was received at least until Ellie made her journey, so they would not have stopped transmitting. There was all the time in the world to verify that the signal was in fact coming from Vega. So there was clearly a message sent by aliens, and the public anger over wasted money makes no sense. So, the entire ending of the movie seemed stupid and manipulative to me. The message of this movie should have been ""science trumps human stupidity"", but that message wouldn't have been commercial.Oh yeah, and don't anyone ever put Matthew McConaughey in a sci fi movie again.

It's also a more personal story about loneliness, hope, and the growth of civilization. It's a beautiful and sweet story, but also serious and tense at times.

The payoff comes fast and furious as a transmission from outer space quickly transforms the quirky character played by Jodie Foster into a world renowned scientist.

He has national security in mind and does not budge on any of his stances through the movie.

No.In this film adaptation (sort of), Carl Sagan imagines what first contact with an alien species would be like, given everything that was currently known about actual science and astronomy. Without giving too much away, the movie pulls it off magnificently, going through everything imaginable about the response to alien contact: decryption, mathematics, politics, military (US mostly) concern, religious fervor, some of the crazies, human brilliance and idiocy, and still manages to strike an emotional cord with the main characters. It doesn't attempt to guess what aliens would look like or their capability, leaving that unknown element as it should be: unknown.It's not all perfect, there's some lack of elegance in some of the writing and dialogue, and the ending in the court room could have been tightened up around Ellie's experience, but overall it's imaginatively written without assuming anything, and makes great points about how human reaction and the value of ""non-practical"" fields of science, given the interconnectedness of all the different sectors.Give it a look.

It's quite a good movie cause there's a sense of pace and structure without it being too long or just spurts of goodness laced in with long boring stuff.The film opens very impressively with a shot of Earth outside its atmosphere with multiple sounds going on at once like songs and famous quotes and we do what could possibly the longest zoom out in cinema as we leave the solar system with the sounds starting to fade until we have left the Milky Way and then we see dozens of galaxies popping up. They then combine together into one little shiny light in a girl's eye. Quite neat but onto the story.The little girl is Ellie Arroway, a quite gifted child with an acute taste for science and math and she becomes someone of huge intelligence only to sit in a chair at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico looking for signs of alien life. Her thorn in her side is David Drumlin, her boss and head of the Science Division. She ends up having to move to New Mexico's observatory and there she finds an alien signal filled with stuff so the whole world is now focused on her discovery even though she feels she's not being fully thanked.One of the coolest scenes undoubtedly is all the radio signal decoding turns out to be a machine, an incredibly expensive machine that will send one occupant into a large energy core. Seeing her travel in this thing is quite neat but what happens afterwards is good since it reinforces the theme of the movie which is belief although some people absolutely hate it(like Mr. Garrison on South Park for one).I can only watch the film now and then, just one of those movies that I can't really re-watch a little while after just seeing it but when I do, it's still good.

PAUL	"Like all good science fiction, the futuristic setting is only glossy packaging to capture our interest while distancing us to the role of specator...the content is about our contemporary world and the issues within it.  Based on the late Dr Carl Sagan's book by the same name, &quot;Contact&quot; is an eloquent exposition about the conflict of opinion regarding science and religion.  No where is this more evident than in the range of reviews listed here and how the reviewers felt about the movie's message.This is a ""deep"" movie - meaning it will appeal to those who like to think about their movies, rather than just experience them.  If you are hoping for a Heinlein ""Starship Troops"" action flick, forget it.  There is some amazing eye-candy in form of the much touted Earth fly-away in the opening and the psychedelic trip to Vega, (an obvious nod to another ""deep"" sci-fi film by another accomplished sci-fi author), but on the whole, this is film that will keep you occupied well past its 150-minute run time.Is there reality a conflict between Science and Religion? Or is one a form of the other?  Can anyone really claim to be purely scientific or purely religious?  Or perhaps these are mutually supporting methodologies where the human race decides what it knows and what it doesn't know, but believes.  A review is not meant to answer these question, but viewing the film is certainly going to make you think about them.Jodie Foster was perfectly cast in the role of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an orphan turned scientist who is about as close to the purely-rational intellectual as a human can get.  (Remember, Mr. Spock was only half human.)  It was no doubt a risky move for a popular actress to play an atheist protagonist to an almost wholly religious audience, but Ms. Foster, noted for her integrity in choosing roles, delivers a performance that should have earned her an Oscar (or perhaps that was the price?)In all a great movie that I'm pleased to have in my collection and one I'd unconditionally recommend for those deep-thinkers and lovers of hard science fiction."	5.0	A Question of Faith	2003-06-22	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"While this movie is often held up as a science fiction story about first contact with beings from another world, that is only the framework for what the story of this movie is about (I have not read the book and do not know if the book is similar to the movie, but the Carl Sagan was involved in the screenplay).  Contact also refers to the human search for truth and what coming into contact with that is like.  This isn't a particularly subtle story, but it does have a strong point to make about the humility true seekers of truth have versus those who talk about truth, but distort and destroy as they advance some other agenda.A mistaken view of the movie would be to see it as science versus religion or as reality versus faith.  Sagan is actually pointing out the similarity of scientific truth seeking and faith - a lesson that Eleanor Arroway (played by the great Jodie Foster) eventually learns as she is persecuted for the reality she experienced, but cannot prove.  She even refers to her experience as a vision in trying to describe it.  And her soulmate, the man of faith Palmer Joss (played quite well by Matthew McConaughey), supports her testimony and sees something in the search for truth through science that he had not suspected.The bad guys in the film are on both sides and are portrayed a bit ham handedly, but are well acted by Jake Busey as Joseph, and James Woods as Michael Kitz.  Joseph is the wild eyed ""prophet"" whose vision of the truth leads him to reject anything that science has to say (except the making of explosives, apparently), and Michael Kitz is a cynical politician who ""investigates"" Arroway's experience, but who is really using her to try and advance his political career.  (Why they simply didn't have someone else go through the machine to verify what Arroway said one way or the other eludes me - maybe the story made up some ""reason"" to prevent that logical next step.)  So, this way the story pairs Arroway and Joss as true seekers who have humility and devotion to the truth, but who have different approaches.  Their love story shows them as soul mates not only in love, but also in their love of truth.  Then we have the idiot bad guys Joseph and Kitz who have other desires and only pretend to be seeking the truth.  They already ""know"" their truth and aren't seeking anything.The other characters all help dress out this theme and add to an interesting story, but this is the main point of the story and makes for a pretty good film.  Just don't expect a terrific science fiction / alien film, because that is not what this really is."	4.0	Pretty good film about truth seeking dressed up as a science fiction / alien tale	2006-05-03	5	4	1

Contact perfectly captures the awe and wonder of realizing just how small and insignificant we are on Earth in comparison to the rest of the universe.Jodie Foster conveys an infectious enthusiasm for knowledge that is such a refreshing change from the usual scientist-type normally depicted in science fiction films. You can't help but get caught up in her quest for signs of intelligent life in the universe and sympathize with her frustrations from fellow colleagues and government types.The supporting cast is also excellent -- in particular, William Fichtner as a blind scientist (based on a real person, btw) is a real stand-out. He normally plays psychos or bad guys in movies and so it is really great to see him cast completely against type as a gentle soul who is very loyal to Foster's character.The DVD is quite good in quality -- although, the extras do tend to lean to the special effects aspects of the film, which gets a little dull after awhile. However, the film's three audio commentaries are all good listens -- especially Jodie Foster who talks about her own personal passion for the project.Contact makes a great double bill with another film, October Sky, which is also another story about a character in love with gazing up into the stars. Both of these films are based on real stories and are very well made. Definitely worth a look.	5.0	a genuine tribute to the wonder of the cosmos	2003-09-05	5	5	0

The central concept of how the Earthlings would deal with knowledge of the existence of an alien civilization is dealt with in a superficial and  melodramatic way.  The actors' were all melodramatic, though some of this  may be blamed on the screenplay.  Foster gave a very bad and unconvincing  performance.  When push came to shove, she wimped out in her defense of her  atheism (though that's the screenwriter's fault).  She was horribly  miscast.  To this day, she still looks like a teenage tomboy.  Only  Skerritt and Hurt gave convincing and interesting performances.  If you're  watching this on cable, skip the first 40 minutes.  If this is truly an  accurate rendition of Sagan's novel (which I haven't read), then I owe the  film's makers and actors an apology.  But from a purely cinematic  viewpoint, it's extremely disappointing.	2.0	Hokey Hollywood junk	1999-07-27	10	5	5

I can't analyze all the big theories and allegories this movie undoubtedly has. I'll leave that to people who claim to be experts in the fields of space stuff and God stuff. Or movie stuff. I can however say for the moderately inquisitive and curious readers and watchers of sci-fi, who hope that the center of the universe isn't our little marble, and maybe, just maybe, there's room for more people and maybe even a deity out there, that this was a pleasant movie if you can get past all that bile-raising stuff. Sagan wasn't so much as educating the uneducated as bashing and berating those who do not agree with him. I think he had the opposite effect, unless that was his sole intention, to seem small minded and angry. If I make a movie about space, hope, and the future I'll probably try to not degrade over half the people of my planet and fill it full of politics and hate.It kind of makes me think if there were someone else out there they'd watch how we belittle each other (as per this movie) and pass right on by.But it gets an ""A"" for effort.

Even though ""Contact"" is Sagan's only novel, it's a very good one, with a firm basis in real-world science. Adapted to the screen, it loses a lot, but the story is compelling, and the cast does a very good job of making it work. The special effects are impressive, too. One day, we may actually receive an interstellar welcome.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"I really wasn't sure that Carl Sagan's novel would translate very well to the big screen; after all, Sagan and his book were grounded in science, some of the most hardware-intensive scenes were left rather vague in the novel, and Sagan's atheism threatened to somehow taint the story's interplay of science and religion.  This movie, though, despite the fact that it necessarily differs from Sagan's novel at times, works amazingly well, even resurrecting a powerful ending under conditions that could be criticized by some in the two words ""nothing happens.""  Indeed, something amazing does happen, and even if it had not, one theme that I read into this story is that the journey is often more important than the destination.This motion picture is (pardon the pun) stellar in so many ways, reflecting a rare level of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  This really starts with the cast.  The role of Dr. Ellie Arroway was a crucial one that, in the hands of the wrong actress, could have doomed the whole project.  Any concerns along these lines, though, were dispensed with immediately upon the signing of Jodie Foster, the greatest female actress of this generation.  Matthew McConaughey gives a better than average performance as Palmer Joss (the religious guy), Tom Skerritt is as unlikable as always in his role as the President's Science Advisor and frequent Arroway nemesis, and the rest of the cast excels as well.  The injection of then-President Clinton and a number of CNN journalists into a number of scenes also brings a most welcome feel of reality to the profound events taking place here.  The special effects are just wonderful.  The opening scene is as beautiful and memorable as any scene you will find anywhere, the animation of the giant machine is extremely realistic, and the visual aspects of space travel are also a sight to behold.  Not only do these great scenes delight the eyes, they remain true to the nuts and bolts of science that Sagan wanted in the movie.  This movie may be long by some standards, coming in at almost two and a half hours, but there's not one wasted scene.The story is, in a sense, not all that complicated.  Ellie Arroway (Foster) finally gets a chance to realize her dream of searching for signals from outer space, only to find herself and her project stripped of funding by an unimaginative (or possibly secretive) government.  She and her colleagues refuse to let the dream die, and on one remarkable day they pick up a signal.  Once the signal is verified and word gets out, the public begins to wig out in a number of ways (quite overblown, in my opinion) and the government, specifically the military, swoops in to get their hands on the project.  Ironically, yet very plausibly, part of the signal ends up showing a clip of Hitler opening the Munich Olympic Games (which was the first television signal broadcast over a sizable area).  Arroway manages to persevere in her work, and eventually a message is discerned among the data, yielding blueprints for some type of great machine.  After plenty of government haggling, the machine is built, and one person is chosen to travel in what the scientists now come to believe is some type of interstellar craft.  The movie does not end here, though, not by a long shot.I find a few aspects about this movie and Sagan's novel interesting on a personal level.  Sagan was a long-time exponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, yet at a certain point in his career, he noticeably changed and became one of the most unobjective bulwarks of the movement to discredit any and all UFO sightings and encounters; some have speculated that he became a participant in the official government policy of disinformation and dismissal.  I believe he would know better than most how the government would frown upon news as profound as the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and this movie certainly does show some of the dangers inherent in the military takeover of extraterrestrial projects.  I am also somewhat surprised at just how effective the juxtaposition of science and religion is presented here, given Sagan's lifelong atheism.  The religious aspect of the film works more in a spiritual than a Biblical sense, yet work it does.  There is obviously a lot of Sagan himself in Dr. Arroway, and this story, in both novel and motion picture form, stands as a true testament to one of the most influential scientists of modern times."	5.0	A brilliant and profound motion picture event	2003-07-06	2	1	1

It wasn't that at all.  Besides being well-written, well-acted, and well-filmed, it also artfully struggled with Science vs. Faith without passing jugement on either.  The film starts slowly, portraying a typical labratory-like environment where each day is much like the next, but it builds in excitement.  By the end, the situation is getting really exciting.  Contact is fun to watch for the special effects but it has a plot equally as engaging.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AAE2DUEMTR30I	DAVID BRYSON	Considering the subject it tackles, I always felt that Carl Sagan's `Contact' was a little bit of a let-down. It would be unreasonable to look for something of the order of Childhood's End let alone of Stapledon, but Contact trivialises itself in too many ways. When the author presents us with the undeniable evidence (fictional of course) that a major civilisation is consciously trying to reach us, to base a lot of the story round the issue of trying to obtain funding is sheer bathos. Also, to a European reader the whole issue of science-vs-faith is a complete non-issue seemingly introduced to play to a certain kind of American gallery, and even from that standpoint it is hard not to find ridiculously implausible the status the book gives to vested religious interests, to say nothing of an auto-da-fe being made the qualifying criterion for participation in the project.The film could have alleviated some of this, but the production elects not to and instead throws in a variety of gratuitous downers of its own. It should be said at this stage that the film abruptly hoists itself on to a higher level towards the end, from the point where the alien machine first appears. Until then the camera-work is dull and average, the situations are void beyond belief of imagination, (the romantic theme in particular seeming a blatant crowd-pleaser), the dialogue is as flat and artificial as could be, and the only remaining hope was that the acting might raise the level a bit. No such luck. McConaughey is downright awful, but Foster and the rest of them are very little better, and it took a machine to rescue the production. The thought crossed my mind that if I had been the alien intelligence I would have hit the off-switch and looked for a more promising culture on Betelgeuse, Algol, Polaris or in another galaxy altogether.I'm a bit of a sucker for light-shows, and my level of interest and involvement rose sharply when the alien machine started up. The actual alien contact is notoriously vague and inconclusive. There is nothing basically wrong with the idea as far as I am concerned, but it should have been developed in some way. Instead we are brought back to earth with a bump and the focus shifts back to the less-than-gripping topic of congressional hearings, this one featuring some perfectly farcical conduct by the committee chairman.The story has the basic makings of real greatness, the film has some undoubtedly gripping sequences - so could I honestly manage to award it a third star? Not really. Not with any integrity or fairness to other productions.	2.0	FALTERING CONTACT	2003-11-02	15	4	11

No other movie is as good to watch repeatedly as this one to me.Jodie Foster does an excellent job in the key character of this movie.  And a fine supporting cast do quite well working to make all the events seem plausibly quite real.Of the negative reviews I see here, they seem to fall into three categories.  One is people who knew nothing of Carl Sagan's writings.  And think the movie should be juiced up.  One is people who read the book and don't like the changes made. And finally those who don't like the treatment of religion or the manner in which the science seemed at odds with religion as portrayed here.If you aren't familiar with Carl Sagan, then you are possibly looking for the wrong thing from this movie.  It isn't a sci-fi thriller meant to mindlessly entertain for a short while.If you don't like the changes from the book, well I think that a matter of taste.  I thought the changes didn't diminish too much the ideas from the book.  And some concessions have to be made when books become movies.For those not liking the portrayal of science and the way it is sometimes at odds with religion I can only say it must have seemed that way to Carl Sagan.  And I think it often is at odds.  As we advance in science as a culture it will be more at odds in the future.  Some compromises or changes will have to occur.  This movie left that open ended.  As it must do to be honest.In my opinion, 5 stars all the way.	5.0	Best sci fi ever in some ways	2004-11-25	19	17	2

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	This film was very important for me to watch.  I don't know too much about Carl Sagan but I've listened to enough Art Bell that I am interested in SETI and the pursuit to find out the truth of life outside our  universe.This movie focuses on several topics such as extra-terrestrial  life and also the battle between science and religion.  I for one am a  person who thinks scientifically but at the same time a God believing  person and for others they can't compare the two, both are at opposite ends  of the spectrum and this movie is really good at showing that.Also,  the involvement of the US government.  Very interesting.  Also, the movie  uses a lot of major newscasters from CNN and President Bill Clinton.  Also,  very interesting.This DVD is one of the best intelligent movies and the  whole story including the special effects are wonderful.  The video is nice  and clear and the use of many colors in the film are brilliant.  The sound  on digital 5.1 is also very nice.As for the DVD extras, I have to give  Warner Bros. an applause for doing this movie justice by including three  feature length commentaries by Jodie Foster, the director and producer  Robert Zeickis and Steve Starkey and another group being Ken Ralston and  Stephen Rosebaum.  Also, it was nice to see the computer animation concepts  and tests, special effects designs and more.  I'm not sure if there were  many deleted or cut scenes but I wish they included them but I can't expect  much, they did a great job and by including three commentaries, that's  really awesome!I'm sure some people will love or hate this film due to  the science vs. religion overtone but I know what my heart believes and I  can only say that this DVD is highly recommended!	5.0	Contact DVD Review: A Truly Superb movie!	2000-06-07	3	2	1

This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena.  It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction.  The  general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant  segment of the scientific community considers the Search for  Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and  human energy.  The prejudice is so great that until recently no  self-respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of  having no career.  Well, there are a few brave souls.  This is a movie  about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of  fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their  authors.  But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary  writer.  Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the  script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg.  It is extraordinarily well  thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying  conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane  of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks.  It is also emotionally  moving.There is, however, just the slightest ""written by committee"" feel  to the movie.  Everything is a little too neat and too well explained.  It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you  can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production.  And yes, Palmer  Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway  (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice  to round her out.  Being a political innocent isn't enough.  And the media  and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of  that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing  a futuristic or ""superior civilization"" story, namely coming up some  unknown technology or information to make it seem real.  The formula for  cold fusion would work, or the cure for cancer.  But how can you do THAT?  You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important  than your script).  It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg  and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall.  Only those  who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here.  And incidentally  Zemeckis can be given credit for making ""Contact"" intelligible without any  dumbing down, no mean feat in itself.As far as star Jodie Foster goes,  it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of  science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of  astrophysicist Ellie Arroway.  They have her come out looking androgynous,  which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and  had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were  needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings  aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive  sexuality long ago.  She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she  still looks like a normal woman in a gown.  And she is appropriately  unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera.Best  line: ""It's so beautiful.  They should have sent a poet."""	4.0	&#65533;If it&#65533;s just us, it seems like an awful waste of space&#65533;	2000-06-21	19	12	7

Lavish special effects complemented by treacly dialogue make me usually stay home when the latest &quot;blockbuster&quot; is released.  However, in the summer of 1997, this baby came along and was a breath of fresh air.  Actually having a movie get people to think about the meaning of life and their own existence is a fairly daunting task for a movie, but this one succeeds smashingly.  Having used it in my classes, I can attest that these questions can cut across ages and get down to the heart of us all.  It was also nice that this movie was fairly successful, making close to 100 million.

But if you want to think about and imagine what it might really be like if we made  first contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence today, you'll LOVE this  movie. I read Carl Sagan's book, and thought the movie was much better--the  movie had less fire-and-brimstone-style anti-religion preaching, and more  of a thoughtful, focused, storyline.

I at first didn't like it a whole lot back then but now I think it's one of the smartest sci-fi movies made in the 1990s and I strongly recommend this movie.

Ann has said that Carl would be proud and happy with this film.For me &quot;Contact&quot; was able to nicely walk the tightrope between fantasy and fact. A good many of the characters you see are based on real people that Carl knew in the SETI community. While we can't know what will happen when - and I do say when - we discover other life in the universe, &quot;Contact&quot; gives us a good account of  the nobility that the human race will show when it happens (embodied largely in Ellie), the ignomy (embodied largely for me in the portrayal of the Government and David Drumlin), and the  misplaced but sincere concern we'll all feel (embodied in Palmer Joss).In the end &quot;Contact&quot; is actually not about the aliens. It's not about the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It's not about the science or the technology. Carl Sagan, as he did so many times, wrote a story about US - the human race, the human condition as we will be when we take that final, humbling step on the road Copernicus put us on so many centuries ago when he ripped the Earth from the center of the universe and put it as one of so many planets in the Solar System.As such, &quot;Contact&quot; doesn't have to be seen as a Science Fiction film if you don't want to see it as such. You'll love this film if you've ever felt passionate about anything in your life. You'll love this film if you've ever had that passion challenged.Heck, you don't even have to know what a radio telescope is! See this film.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AGMW9CT5Y5W50	"D. Pfeffer ""Buford59"""	Contact has big ambitions and satisfies most of them and entertains the rest. To start it is based upon a novel by Carl Sagan and he is able to give the science fiction aspect of the film credibility from his own insight in the science community. The film depicts quite well the drive and determination the scientists must possess just to be able to work in their chosen fields and the way that politics comes into play to create hurdles and roadblocks. Interlaced within the science film is the human story of personal tragedy, discovery and betrayal. This is not explored to create in depth character studies but just enough to make the audience care about the characters. The one angle of the film that I find most compelling is the struggle between religious faith and scientific discovery. This is not so far-fetched, recall that Copernicus&#8217; theory of the universe was banned by the church and that he delayed publication of his work until after his death for fear of excommunication and execution.The casting and the acting were top notch Jodie Foster (Elle Arroway)carried the dedicated scientist role believably well in what would have been a male role in most movies. Elle is far from a perfect character she has faults and flaws aplenty, she has issues with closeness and being able to see another&#8217;s viewpoint. You can see here struggle for truth whatever it is from others and herself. Her life is dedicated to searching for evidence of the unknown and proving irrefutably the truth in it.  Matthew McConaughey (Palmer Joss)was perfect in the traditional female role of the would be love interest that just so happens to show up whenever a tender moment is required and who though drawn to Elle he is spiritually and philosophically her polar opposite. His life is driven by faith knowing that cannot be proven but he believes it with all his heart.I think one of the things I like most about the film is that it asks more questions than it answers. There is no attempt to paint Elle as a perfect character that will save the day, or to say yes there are aliens and they are here to harvest us or give us better iPods. More so the film asks &#8220;What if? And if so how would you react?&#8221;	5.0	For me it is a classic that I can watch over and over	2013-04-17	0	0	0

She was bright, worked with intensity and was able to study at the best training institutions. With experience in the field, she is now a young senior researcher on the heavens. Unpolitical, she is subordinate in her endeavors to the one who can speak to the people and institutions with money. Finally, there is a contact with outer space. She is crucial to the analysis of the data from which emerges a design for a space vehicle to bring the unknown entity out there and our world together. Who will be the first person to negotiate the trip? Will it be successful? That is the story of Contact, omitting the facts that should not known in advance. Jody Foster does an excellent job in leading a skilled cast which makes interesting what could have been dreary documentary or soap suds romance. Whether the tack taken by the creators of the film to round it off is satisfactory or not, is a question that should not be discussed in advance of the reader watching the film.

I believe this movie accurately portrays the emotional aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular:  the sense of awe and beauty when confronted with infinity, and the sense of lonliness felt by everyone with an idealistic passion.If you have ever read Carl Sagan's books, you'll see that this movie touches upon the usual staples of a Carl Sagan read:  the foundation of religion vs. the foundation of science, the mutual misunderstanding and struggle between those governed by curious optimism versus those governed by primal fear, and a demonstration of the dangers of a world that depends on science which is filled with so many people who do not understand it.Some have argued that they find Contact to be &quot;preachy.&quot;  I don't really see much of a foundation in that assessment of the movie.  Just like in real life, the ultimate philosophical answers are left wide open at the end of this movie, leaving it open to many different interpretations.  And I think it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't follow the contemporary pattern of avoiding any serious discussion about morality and philosophy.  These are some of the conversations the human race will be forced to have with itself if we want to survive the coming centuries.  Recent events since this movie was released and Carl Sagan's death only accentuate the importance of facing this fact.I love this movie.  From the beautiful computer-generated opening sequence, through the middle sequences detailing the main character's relentless and passionate quest for scientific knowledge and exploration, to the adventurous surreal climax, I felt that I had a personal connection with almost every aspect of this movie.	5.0	One of my favorite movies	2004-07-12	5	5	0

Personally, I don't know what to make of this film.  It frustrates and annoys me and yet I found it absolutely absorbing, something I couldn't turn away from, even at its lowest ebb.  At all times it is entertaining.  But it is also manipulative, filled with stock character types rather than genuine people, and a story that is obvious; nothing truly surprised me about this film.  And yet, I still liked it.  I'm trying to figure out why.The opening sequence is magical in its simplicity and beauty.  It gives one pause to wonder.  Unfortunately, how and why we wonder is soon taken away from us by a story that literally maps out exactly what we should feel, when, and why.  Allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions was taken away, I find that galling and not a little insulting.  I was also put off by the heavy handed way in which religion was presented (making Christians either lunatics or self-righteous nitwits).  This was less a story about discovery and more about the politics that might surround such an incredible occurrence.  All the fringe ugliness dampened whatever enthusiasm would be inherent in such a life altering moment.  This is a great idea, mishandled.  Why the botched ""contact"" moment?  Why all the nastiness with James Woods maniacal character?  If you want to tarnish and kill an ending, that's the way to do it!On the other hand....there is that magnificent performance by Jodie Foster (and Jena Malone) as Dr. Eleanor Arroway.  John Hurt was bizarre (in a good way) as the mysterious S.R. Hadden.  It was so nice to see David Morse play something other than a bad guy, the same goes for William Fichtner.In the end, I find myself justifying why I liked this movie in spite of all its negative points (that would include Jake Busey & Rob Lowe).  I think that what I liked most was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.  I think that for a film to inspire that (hope) is something special in itself.I've often found myself peering up at the night sky, wondering if anyone is out there...wondering if anyone is out there."	4.0	Star light, star bright, The first star I see tonight.....	2011-07-31	5	5	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"A film very much in the league of such sci-fi giants as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and E.T., director Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film CONNTACT is one of the genre's most stunningly intelligent films of all time. Clearly having learned much about displaying a sense of cinematic wonder from his mentor Steven Spielberg, Zemeckis has fashioned a film that, like ""2001"", has elements of spiritualism, mysticism, and child-like awe.Jodie Foster is Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an ambitious radio astronomer who, ever since she was a young girl, has been dreaming of making contact with other beings from outer space. As her ambitions grow, there is, of course, plenty of resistance from other corners of the scientific community to her search--especially from her mentor (Tom Skerritt), who sees this as wasteful, pie-in-the-sky stuff. But when Foster and her team at New Mexico's Very Large Array radio telescope field in New Mexico detect an actual alien signal (represented in prime numbers) eminating from the star Vega, some twenty-six light years away, all bets are off. Despite the somewhat ominous beginning to this (the signal is eventually found to have been in response to the first-ever TV transmission on Earth, which were the opening ceremonies to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, presided over by Adolf Hitler), further research, funded by an eccentric engineer (John Hurt) reveals the desire on the part of the aliens for the human race to build a space pod that will hurl itself towards Vega at or near the speed of light.Immediately, of course, there is a worldwide firestorm of controversy, and not just from the scientific community. The religious community, particularly America's religious right-wing, comes to attack Foster and her fellow scientists for wanting to contact aliens who might not believe in God (or their version of Him). Foster does, however, have one sympathetic friend in that community--Reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). When, during a test of the new pod, Skerritt is killed by a fanatic religious bomber, it is up to Foster to make that ultra-perilous journey to Vega.When she does, she stunningly meets up with her father (David Morse), whom she lost at an early age. Her return to Earth and her story is met with unbridled incredulity and iron skepticism. But McConaughey chooses to take the high road in this case, stating that although the two of them operate under different covenants of thought, their goals are one and the same--the pursuit of truth.Based on the only fictional novel written by the late Carl Sagan, creator of the legendary PBS-TV series ""Cosmos"", CONTACT is a very lengthy and extremely ambitious film that succeeds far more often than it slips (which is extremely rare here). As with any of the great science fiction movies, the special effects and the hardware are incredibly spectacular; but going hand in hand with all this are a highly credible story and some fine acting, particularly by Foster, whose performance here is as good as anything she has given us since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.With newsreel references to the religious cult murders that occurred in San Diego shortly before the film's release, as well as video cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, and president Bill Clinton (some of them admittedly resembling humorous asides more than they do advancements in the story), CONTACT is also topical. By having McConaughey's character display a genuine sympathy towards Foster's approach to things, the film does not balance science over religion; but it also does not fail to condemn certain segments of the religious community for trying to force their values onto others. In essence, CONTACT is a plea for understanding among all the world's people, and bravely suceeds in telling us that ours is not the only intelligence that God may have bought forth.For anyone interested in the science fiction genre, CONTACT is a must-have for your video or DVD collection."	5.0	One of the all-time great science fiction movies	2002-01-18	2	2	0

The chemistry between McConaughey and Foster was unconvincing, perhaps, but they turned in respectable individual performances. I'd say Sagan succeeded in helping us see SETI from a more practical perspective while entertaining us at the same time. One of the practical considerations, of course, is that by the sheer weight of the numbers, if Darwinian evolution occurs spontaneously whenever and wherever conditions are right, there should be literally millions of worlds in the observable universe where it has (and/or is) happening, with many civilizations far more advanced than ours (per the somewhat controversial work of astronomer Frank Drake and others). So where are these beings and why don't they respond to our hails? These are all intriguing questions that Sagan helps us consider in this imaginative screenplay.	4.0	Vintage Sagan	2013-10-24	0	0	0

Jody foster was an excellent pick because she is so good at making you feel the feelings of the character.  I found myself really rooting for her and angry at the various antagonist.As a Born Again Christian, I feel the sex scene and the obvious cuts at Christians were uncalled for.  The message of the film regarding religion seemed to be that you're not really truly a believer unless are an agnostic humanist that was once a believer but are too smart for that now...and you're now just trying to rationalize every aspect of faith.Typical of hollywood, though, so I didn't penalize for this in my ratings.  Those are my personal feelings about the content.  The acting, story (for the most part), directing, etc. were exemplary.I must add that the quandary the main character finds herself in towards the end of the movie while testifying of her experience gave me hope that maybe there is a mustard seed of understanding.	5.0	Forgot how good this movie was!	2014-03-18	0	0	0

Now, after purchasing this movie and having had the opportunity to sit and watch it again, I see that it truly is a work of art.Jodie Foster does an amzing job in her role as the first person from our world to EVER make ""Contact.""  While many others shoot her thoughts, ideas, and hopes down throughout the movie, she never wavers once!  Standing firmly in her convictions as a scientist, she aims to make believers of us all.Although I am not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, he does a solid job as Foster's polar opposite.  Another thing i liked is, although they are very opposite in opinions of the world, they can co-exhist and share one common thing: love.  Now, you may be thinking ""oh there's a love story here?""  Yes, but it never distracts from the overall story; and at a crucial part, even helps to enhance it further.Very, very solid acting and storytelling in this one.

It has great cinematography, casting, and music, but its script is the real standout.  It's rare that *any* fictional film spends so much time on science, even other science fiction films, but this movie manages to touch upon a lot of the important dichotomies and other concepts in the field of science:  Basic science versus applied science, empirical data versus faith, openness versus control of information, the opposition of science and religion, the convenience and ubiquity of technology versus personal fulfillment, and even the role of sexism in a field where judgement on knowledge and merits is supposed to be the only thing that matters.  (The excellently cast and played Drummond spends pretty much all of his screen time alternately patronizing the main character and stealing credit for her work, even daring to justify his behavior by lecturing her about how the world is not a place where fairness matters, as if he were teaching her some kind of important lesson and she would thank him someday.)This movie has held up extremely well since 1997, and anyone with a sense of curiosity and wonder would be well served to see it at least once.	5.0	Underrated movie	2014-05-27	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3C3D4Z5U7Q4F7	Guy Gillor	"(contains spoilers)In my review I don't wish to say too many things about the technical aspects of the movie. I think that, style-wise, this is classic grand epic cinema, with large shots, larger music, a real treat in my eyes.I wish to put another point of view into the discussion of the movie's portrayal of science versus religion. Many of the reviewers seem frustrated by the, what they consider, ambiguity the movie holds towards this question, which they feel is significantly different than the balance in the book. I have a very different opinion about this.I am, I should say, completely atheist. I am also a social scientist. This movie, in my opinion is a one of a kind social science fiction movie. The contact with extraterrestrial beings is the premise, but the real story is that of human society and the reaction to the contact. Sagan, atheist himself, devoted much of his life to try to educate people about science, and about understanding religion from a social history perspective, not as a relevant tool to understand the material world today. In Cosmos, Sagan explores the reactions of human society and social structures to a possible contact. Unfortunately, we still live in a very backwards, religious society, and this is what the movie shows. The focus on religious dilemmas in light of the first contact is unfortunately very likely to happen in such case. The impossible position that Foster's character finds herself at the end does not leave the ""science vs religion"" debate open handed, as we learn that the evidence which proves her main argument (that she experienced 14 hours in what seemed like a fraction of a second), and shows how it is being hushed by the government.In another book, Sagan wrote of the ""demon-haunted world"", and traced the struggles of scientists to stand by the evidence in a repressively religious environment. Contact, the book and the movie, puts forth an argument that today, in many ways, we still live in a demon-haunted world, in which the role and social power of religion is much too strong."	5.0	The demon-haunted world	2012-02-09	2	1	1
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2VB73LG2J633W	G. Vozzo	I read some reviews here and elsewhere which warned that the image quality of Contact on Blu-ray is substandard. However, I do not find that to be the case. Since I now have both the Blu-ray and DVD, I can see just how bad the DVD print is, full of picture noise and compression artifacts. The color also doesn't look quite right in places. The Blu-ray image, while not reference quality, is a very good transfer which, while cleaning up the image considerably, also retains much of the natural graininess of the film. For the most part, colors are strikingly vibrant without looking over-saturated. The aspect ratio also seems correct (i.e., no vertical stretching). On a properly-calibrated TV, this looks vastly superior to the DVD print. And the sound is just fantastic.Unfortunately, the bonus material leaves a lot to be desired. Although the short-and-small computer animation featurettes from the DVD are retained, they look terrible. Also, I didn't find the extensive text-only production notes from the Special Edition DVD on this Blu-ray.A low price makes an upgrade from DVD more than worthwhile. Although this excellent movie deserves a better overall treatment, I find the quality of the movie itself on Blu-ray to be praiseworthy.	4.0	Looks and sounds great on Blu-ray, except for the bonus material	2013-01-22	1	1	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AEV640MKB3I9J	Hank Drake	"Contact is the most satisfying science fiction movie of the 1990s.  It avoids the pitfalls of being a shoot 'em up like Starship Troopers, or being coldly intellectual like 2001.  It is also one of those rare movies that gives the scientific aspect of the script proper respect, without  being pedantic or sacrificing character development.For me, what makes  the movie work is the versimilitude with which the story is handled.  Using  CNN reporters, celebrities, and even President Clinton, the story comes off  as very realistic.  Certain details from the book would have made the ending a bit less ambiguous--e.g., the fact that sand was found in the pod seemed to  indicate in the novel that Ellie really did visit another world.  Apparently, the  producers wanted to keep the ending more ambiguous, which is  understandable, since one of the themes of the film is faith.  Ellie's lack  of faith in organized religion ironically comes back to haunt her when she  realizes that for people to believe her journey actually took place, they  must accept her statement--on faith.  (Incidentally, the book makes clear that Ellie is not an Atheist, but rather an open-minded Agnostic.)This is one of the few films in this genre to have truly first class acting.  Foster does her usual excellent job, as do the supporting players, especially Tom Skeritt.The visual effects in this film are in a class of their own, and they are placed at the service of the story, in contrast to the Star Wars movies.This is one of the first DVDs I purchased, and for years it was my demo-disc.  Warner has simply packed it with extras, inclusing three commentary tracks and a French translation.  There are also extra materials explaining how the  visual effects were achieved and how the Machine was designed.  The Blu-ray has the same features.This is a  DVD everyone should have!UPDATE, June, 2010:Contact has since been issued on Blu-ray.  I recommend that over the DVD for several reasons.  In addition to the obvious visual improvements, the old-style snap-case of the DVD was rather unwieldy.  The generous features on the Blu-ray are exactly the same as those on DVD, but the menu is easier to navigate.Over the years, my opinions on the movie have changed somewhat - although I continue to rate it highly.  Since my original review in 2000, I have visited Puerto Rico twice and the Arecibo Observatory once.  Although the telescope itself is spectacularly presented in the film, the huts that Ellie and her co-workers live in couldn't be farther from a realistic portrayal.  Buildings in Puerto Rico (which is in a hurricane zone) are invariably made of cement.  The same can be said of the ""lechonera"" style restaurant where Ellie meets Palmer.  Arecibo is essentially a suburban town, not some third-world hovel.  In real life, Arecibo (like most of Puerto Rico) has been overrun by American fast-food restaurants.The use of real-life footage of President Clinton is, in retrospect, a mistake.  It serves only to date the film.  In the novel, the President was an unnamed woman who was only referred to as ""Madame President"".  I feel the film would have been more successful if it had stayed closer to the book - Angela Bassett, who played the Chief of Staff, would have been a good choice as President."	5.0	Versimilitude	2000-04-21	4	2	2

He addresses questions and issues within the movie that we don't realize are so important until we've been around a while and analyze our world's technological evolution.ESPECIALLY our technological capacity and the implications and repurcussions.Of course I could rave on about Jody Foster and Matthew McConaughey (never spell that right - sorry!)Jody is totally lovable, likable, sympathetic and compelling. She is 100% convincing as a brilliant, uni-linearly focussed and isolated scientist. Her determination in the movie serves as model inspiration on how to succeed in the business world. She just won't give up.Matthew is at his most magnetic. As he and Jody meet in a tropical cabana, you can feel the heat of his charm pop right through the screen. There's probably not a woman in the world who could have resisted in responding to him... except the wonderful character portrayed by Jody Foster.It adds the perfect romantic tension.Coupled with the extraordinary scenery, the absolutely soaring and magnificent musical score, CONTACT is one of the best movies ever made.But, folks may not notice at first. So many thought-inspiring little things slip by, unnoticed. So, it's one of those movies that's gets better and better as we get older and wiser. The more we watch, the better it gets.As a kid, we may have enjoyed it immensely. As an adult, it becomes a movie of great import and impact if you give yourself a chance to examine the science and forethought that went into the writing and making of this movie.I wasn't quite sure about Carl Sagan, didn't know of him very well. But, now I can see he was one of those special geniuses who know so much more than one might have surmised. One of the world's truly great thinkers.He wrote popular novels - perhaps that may have diminished his reputation as a world's great thinker type of scientist and pushed him into seeming  just another populistic author. He was also a television star with his own documentary.Now I would like to see them... and have an opportunity to read his books.In a separate review, I hope to address the final question posed within the latter parts of this movie. But here, I don't want to insert any spoilers.The best way to watch this movie is from a clean start, and then watch again and again to get the full purported meanings.6 out of 5 starsOther recommended EXTRAORDINARY movies:Bladerunner - Pinnacle of SCIFI moviesSaving Private Ryan - Great, great war MovieA.I. - classic WORK OF ART for all timeContact - SCIFI at it's very bestPhantom of the Opera - Haunting Perfection"	5.0	CONTACT - PROFOUND and Stunning Movie with Jody Foster and Matthew McConaughey	2009-07-18	2	2	0

In all fairness, this should be a 2 1/2 or 3-star film, but the utterly appalling ending removes any possible enjoyment.Many other reviews have summed up the plot, so I see no reason to restate it here. What is so ghastly about the movies' conclusion is the premise that an intelligent, well-educated, experienced SCIENTIST; upon meeting an alien species is reduced to ""faith"" to explain what happened.

It's my kind of sci-fi -- very restrained, and very plausible, really. It's the kind of sci fi that doesn't remove you from the real world -- and I mean that in a good way.The only thing I disliked about the movie was the scene where the two main characters were shoe-horned into the most tired and unenlightening discussion on science and religion ever -- the old ""We don't need God anymore, we've got science"" vs. ""Isn't it nicer to believe that there is a God?"" arguments.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A68JOU4GHD820	Howard S. Shubs	"""Contact"" is a fantastic movie intended to ask questions, and has a lot of fun doing it.Some people seem to miss the point, in that they think they're being provided with answers.  This movie doesn't give  any answers.  It doesn't show ""the alien"", though it shows -a  representation- of an alien, from the main character's memory.  It says so  right in the dialog, but I guess that since ""Contact"" doesn't  come pre-chewed and digested, there are a lot of people who can't  understand it.  This movie is aimed at people who are willing to think.  Others need not apply.What the movie -does- do is ask questions, and  really interesting questions at that.  An example: any answer to questions  like, ""are we all alone in the universe"" would be bogus, because  we don't know.  Instead, it asks, and shows an example, of how humans might  react to a ""first contact"" situation.  It asks questions relating  to science vs religion.  It speaks to us of ""the world as it is""  rather than ""the world as we'd like it to be"".  The only thing it  adds is ""the message"", whatever that really is.I've read the book, and found that this movie is one of those rare examples where the movie is better than the book.The DVD is  fantastic, because not only do you get the awsome movie, but you get all  the commentary which allows you to extract every iota of meaning from it.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3LIMH3HXT94YB	I.M.	Actually i, personally, didn't think that the novel &quot;Contact&quot; could be applied to a motion picture for it had multiple levels of storytelling. Moreover, it presented a long time period with ingenious  connections, references and, of course, memories which could turn out as a  disadvantage for a film to grasp it all. However, Zemeckis' demiurgical  blend of Sagan's novel with conventional Hollywood approach makes this film  an experience to enjoy. What's so striking is that, the film and the book  almost enrich one another. For example, in order to visualize the Machine  (of course not fully, because it's a bit altered in the film) described in  the book, you have to see the film. On the other hand, if you want to touch  a deeper level of meaning &amp; cross-references (through a magnificent  choice of quotes, flawlessly constructed storyline, and the unique  perspective of the universe &amp; life itself that Sagan makes us witness)  you have to read the book. But beware: if you read the book 1st, then you  may find the film less satisfying. Because, after all, this is a Hollywood  production. It has to address the public taste with a pinch of a love  story, injustice &amp; redemption sequences, and of course a  &quot;comprehensible&quot; finale. But no matter what, it's a sparkling  film with an unforgettable performance from Foster. Check out the book for  a more puzzling ending. But don't miss this beautiful &quot;visual&quot;  version of the novel. Because Ellie says it all: &quot;no words can  tell..&quot;	5.0	No words can tell..	2000-01-14	0	0	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3K140NYRSF6I6	I'm Just Sayin'	"Since I am a fan of science fiction as well as science fact this movie proved to be a great one for me. Jodie Foster is wonderful as the doctor who using SETI finds a signal from a distant galaxy. She finds herself ultimately building a machine that transports her to the source of the signal. On the planet she meets an alien who assumes the physical shape of her late father.She realizes that of course it isn't her father, but has so many questions she wants answered, that she goes along with the created scene. Her time is limited and soon she is sent back to Earth only to find that in Earth time she has been gone mere seconds, not hours or days. A controversy erupts decrying her claim that she actually WAS where she said she was. For those who haven't seen the movie I won't spoil the ending.What isn't mentioned anywhere in the film is that Carl Sagan and his wife were responsible for it's creation but he passed on before it was completed. During the film there are instances of a reverse letter ""C"" being formed by popcorn spilled on the floor, when Jodie's father dies. Then again in the grains of sand the alien holds when they meet. Again in the sky above the alien planet and at the end when Jodie sits on a cliff overlooking the canyon and sunset. What does it mean?The reversed ""C"" shape in the movie is a representation of the constellation ""Corona Borealis"" it was Carl Sagan's favorite because it looks like a radio telescope dish! The end credit's say ""For Carl"" and indeed Carl has a presence throughout the film with the these references to his constellation.Coupled with a wonderful score by Alan Silvestri this movie is a home run in my book.On a purely technical note, in the film, Dr.Arroway (Foster), as a child, is an amateur radio operator as I am. It shows her using the radio and calling ""CQ"" a general call for anyone to answer. But then she keeps saying ""come back"".... this is slang used only by CB radio operators and is rarely if ever used by amateurs with any experience."	5.0	"Looks like the ""Truth really IS out There"""	2012-09-10	0	0	0

Do we really need to see the Giant A-hole walking around sucking up credit for everything? Did we really need to see Gary Busey's son as a psycho cult leader and the whole destruction of the first device when a second one was readily avaliable? It felt like pointless filler padding out a strong story into an overly long drag, if I was in charge of editing Contact I'd probably take out about an hour of filler.Anyways underneath all the forced drama lies a really good story that sci-fi fans and religious people can both enjoy.	4.0	Great Ending, Slooooooooow Beginning	2012-05-23	1	0	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2WHV0YLBOK0I0	Inspiring Insomnia	"The film, Contact, spends nearly as much time debating faith versus science, and whether the two can co-exist, as it does in exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  For this reason, not all science fiction fans will love the movie as much as I did.  Jodie Foster (as Ellie)turned in one of her typically stellar performances, and her transformation from a strict ""Just the facts, please"" scientist to a woman who accepts faith's role in the building of the universe was believable and moving, and it really resonated with me.  Matthew McConnaughey, on the other hand, was horribly miscast as Foster's religious and intellectual counterpart and as her sort-of love interest.  Fortunately, he kept his usual smarmy smirking acting technique to a minimum.I love the opening of the film which portrays a gradual pullback from a point on Earth to a faraway point in the universe before the visual zooms back into the eye of Foster's character as a child.  I can watch this scene over and over.Side note with a SPOILER:  I originally saw this film with two friends in the theater when it was released in 1997.  At the conclusion, both made comments about how bizarre it was that Ellie's father was on another planet.  Whaaaat???  I didn't understand how they could possibly have reached that conclusion, especially since the dialogue spoon feeds us the explanation for the alien's appearance.  I thought these two friends were the only people who could possibly have missed this, but in reading through some of the reviews and comments here, I see they were not alone!"	5.0	Powerful film that resonates long after its ending	2012-09-24	0	0	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2YHNYN8ETDJGO	In the Thick of It!	Anyone remotely familiar with Carl Sagan must know that getting away from the lights of a city, and looking up, leaves one to feel a flurry of emotions about it all when viewing the heavens at night. How can we be intelligent enough to build all of these tools to use, and still have room for doubt about the why? What if humans on an insignificant planet in the Cosmos actually did pick up a signal or make 'Contact' from outer space? How brave would you actually be? The movie 'Contact' presents this loneliness with a gentle and loving manner. The movie presents the greatest challenge -- do we survive, despite ourselves here on this insignificant speck like a grain of sand in all the grains of sand in all the beaches of the planet we live on? It really is not thought that humans would end it all, being even made to feel smaller than previously before by receiving advanced technology from aliens meant to meet this 'Contact', or is it a weapon?But then again, they are extremely more intelligent, and give us hope, and fear, about the why and the what and the who and the how, but where are we, as humans, really at within the Grand Scheme of It All? The movie shows that the answer these questions give leave all even smaller and less advanced then we previously thought and still leaves the possibility open with all the awe and wonder Carl Sagan sought to show when talking about the Cosmos. The movie presents all of this with all the technological wonder it can muster at this Time and in this Space called SpaceTime. But then again, perhaps Carl Sagan should be remembered most for his love of life, and his thoughtfullness on why we as humans ought to survive and not create a Nuclear Winter Scenario by having a Nuclear War, a Holocaust due to hate and stupidity on this Planet Earth, in the Sol System, in the Persus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, one of the local group of 50 galaxies traveling together through SpaceTime at around 33 miles/ second traveling towards the SuperCluster Cluster of Strings of Galaxies near the Virgo Constellation only reaching that part of SpaceTime in another 300-400 million years, and still will we survive or make 'Contact' in that SpaceTime while we all are traveling in this SpaceTime and still find that everything else has moved that was there before in that region of SpaceTime, but yet find the strength and courage needed to survive? Perhaps, that is religion, perhaps it may be common sense, perhaps many emotions, some of which we may not have even discovered yet.

Allowing idiotic diatribes between politicians, religious maniacs and other assorted groups to become the common denominator in the script, totally ruined the film for me.As for all of the constant scenes about America's various crackpots and their opinions on science, why did Hollywood think it would appeal to the rest of the world?	3.0	Contact - a total farce	2013-10-11	2	0	2

The subject of Contact is not exclusively aliens. It is not meant to blow you away with special effects either. But it is still science fiction; just not action.It may be unpopular for movies to do this nowadays, but Contact is meant to get you to think. It is a 'thinking' movie, so to speak, about humans and our society, values and beliefs. Indeed, Arroway's journey to space serves as a plot device to this end.Unlike many science fictions, Contact does not build up suspense for the purpose of eventually revealing what the aliens look like, what their intentions are, and other things all about the aliens.

I purchased this movie on DVD over a year ago, and I can't count how many times I have seen it.  Jodie Foster is majestic in this film.  She plays a very complex character, as per usual for Jodie, but this role suits her very well.  Throughout the enitre film you will be cheering her on, as you quickly realize she is the &quot;outcast&quot; of the scientific world.  The movie made me think of the possibilities, the &quot;what if's&quot; of the universe.The overall message is faith and the power of believing in one's self, science, and the universe.  Because of this movie, I had to stop and think many times, about the power of faith.  The movie made me realize that we as humans are a tiny incriment of the universe.  Are we the only intelligent life in the universe?  Can faith and science coincide with one another?Robert Z. is the perfect director for this.  Jodie was the PERFECT Ellie.  Robert pieced this enitre movie with such grace and precision, and Jodie was so realistic as Ellie.  Ellie challenged the normal views of the world, she grew as a person, she saw somewhat of a &quot;different light.&quot;  I truly loved this movie, and I reccomend it to everyone, even if they're not into sci-fi, that's only a fraction of the movie.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3H23RXZ5DRPDD	jax-UT	Yes this is one of the only movies my Mom and I both like.  When I was young, she had me watch Cosmos with Carl Sagan on PBS.  This movie reminds me of that because it is dedicated to Carl Sagan. I knew she had seen it previously and liked it, so I got her the bluray for her new bluray player.Jodi Foster is excellent as usual as a frustrated scientist listening to signals coming to Earth from Space in hopes of possibly finding proof of intelligent life in outerspace. Matthew McConaughey plays a very liberal preacher who isn't such a believer in her work but seems to like her very much. She's all science, he's all religion, so there's friction for a sort of attraction as a subplot.When a signal comes to her crew from outer space, she of course wants to follow the instructions in the message to build a device/portal to take her to the originators of the message. Add in government interference, a rich old eccentric man who supports her, and a crazy religious zealot who opposes science at any cost and you've got a good movie.  It may seem sentimental and slow to some viewers, but they can't all be action movies can they?	4.0	a movie i can watch with my mother	2011-01-17	0	0	0

It is our beliefs in this that can not be proven that makes us human.The story about the puzzle and the trip to another planet was just background for the rest of it, and that is why I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it more with each viewing.	4.0	This one grew on me.	2003-07-26	0	0	0

This movie is really the best of both worlds.The transformation of Jodie's character through the movie is subtle and heart-breaking. It's hard to imagine who else could have come close to pulling off this role as she did. Sci-Fi movies of course never win best actor/actress awards, but she was nominated for Golden Globe for this role.There is an interesting article about this film on Wikipedia, that discusses the ""screen-writing hell"" the film ended up in for years. Multiple directors, a parade of writers that came and went... And the film is flawed, no doubt. (The main antagonist, played by the wonderfully slimy Tom Skerritt, dies half way through the film.) But the acting is wonderful all around.I bought the movie on DVD, and watched the lengthy special mini-documentary about the making of the film. The vast majority of the special effects shots in the movie are not in the more sci-fi scenes, but in the normal, day-to-day scenes -- a crane shot of her house as a young child that zooms in and pushes right through the window into the room where shes sitting, for example (the window wasnt there, of course: the window, the trees reflecting in it and even the finger prints on it were all animated). There are dozens of those kinds of shots in the movie that are breath-taking once you start paying attention to them."	5.0	Jodie Foster is amazing  in this film	2012-02-29	1	1	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A10BWW5GU19AD	Jeff Wiley	`Contact' has evolved into one of those movies that people either seem to love or hate.  This reviewer loves it.`Contact' is a fresh story, and is particularly great for those who enjoy their sci-fi light : science fiction movies that don't require laser guns and spaceships, etc.  Its subject is thought provoking, its characters are memorable and well portrayed, and its overall presentation is top-notch.The events following the signal's detection are spot on, as director Robert Zemeckis captures brilliantly the reaction and events that would most likely follow an event of this magnitude.  I view what he presents not as a swipe at humanity, but as a snapshot of its current state.  Religious zealots to scam artists to a media feeding frenzy are presented here, not to mention rather accurately and believably.  The political, religious, social, and moral fallout of such an event are also presented here extremely well.The movie's climax (Ellie's final destination) is not only satisfying, but also intentionally ambiguous, forcing the viewer to think about what they have just seen, and where she might actually have been.  For the sake of anyone who hasn't seen it, I'm being as vague as possible, so as not to ruin anything.It's probably redundant to say that Jodie Foster was fantastic, but I'll say it anyway.  She is in a category by herself, in terms of acting talent, and she is supported by a great cast featuring Tom Skerritt, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse (a terrific actor in his own right), Angela Bassett, John Hurt, and James Woods, among others.  Also featured are many well-known media figures who had cameos in the movie, adding a level of authenticity to the film.`Contact' definitely deserved more attention at Oscar time the year it was released, and why it didn't receive more, I can't say.  Suffice it to say that this is a movie that, no matter what you believe spiritually, has the ability to either force you to question that belief, or it will re-enforce your beliefs stronger than ever.	5.0	An incredible, if not overlooked, film.	2005-10-17	7	6	1
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3F3E4SZPCZP0P	Jephph	Though not a perfect adaptation of Sagan's book, this is fairly loyal and ends with an effect similar to the novel.The cast is definitely on top of things. Jodie Foster makes an impeccable Ellie Arroway, Matthew McConaugheh an effective, if somewhat youthful Palmer Joss, a reverend and Ellie's intellectual equal; Ken Der Heer's role is significantly downsized, but for his part he does well; Tom Skerrit is a perfectly pompous Dave Drumlin; James Woods a properly militaristic Michael Kitz; and, perhaps in the film's best performance (though he certainly did not have as much work as Foster or McConaugheh), John Hurt is a KNOCKOUT as S.R. Hadden. Oh yeah, and Rob Lowe has a nice role as the Reverend Billy Joe Rankin.The technical aspects are definitely all there; the opening shot is beautifully done, and the special effects are stunning throughout. Though at first I thought the idea of Ellie and Palmer getting together would ruin it, I found it did not have much ill effect. I like also how they chose not to dwell on the hypocrisies of Mr. Rankin.What is missing, and I think fans of the novel will agree, are Ellie's traveling partners, particularly Vaygay. C'mon, Zemeckis, you should know by now that any movie of this sort needs a smart alecky Russian to carry it in the slow spots.Still, the thought provoking story remains intact, and the film was dedicated to Sagan, whom I'm sure would have been pleased with the outcome. Well Done.	4.0	Loyal Adaptation	2003-08-31	1	0	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A36T7D31VJFVYZ	Jesse	Not only was the story of this movie written by a visionary and a genius, this movie is about us.This movie takes place in modern times and juxtaposes real life against the backdrop of intelligent life in outer space.  It's not about futuristic technologies or far out heros.  This movie is about real people.  Real humans.  It's a treatment about what would happen in our times if we made contact with extraterrestrials.  Like ET, this captures how someone's life would change with that contact.  Therefore, I think this is one of the most visionary science fiction tales of all time.  It's about everyday people in modern times, no one extraordinary, taking an unimaginable leap out into the galaxy, with a little help from friends in distant places.I have seen this movie twice.  The first time when it came out, and I was young then, only 21 or so.  And, at that time, I wanted action and wiz bang.  It honestly didn't satisfy me at that point in my life.  Many years later, I adore this movie for its dream and it's humanity.	5.0	My Favorite Sci Fi Movie	2014-02-03	0	0	0

I consider myself to be a Born-Again Evangelical Roman Catholic Christian.  I fould the movie very thought provoking.  M. Scott Peck, M.D. an author  and Psychiatrist in his book &quot;The Road Less Traveled &amp;  Beyond&quot; states that the best way to sell yourself on Christianity (and  Grace) is to have a very questioning attitude toward religion.  When you  decide YES, your faith is built on a solid foundation.  This movie puts  that philosophy to the test.  And for me comes down on the side of God.  The scene on the party balconey where the preacher asks Jodie Foster to  prove that her father loves her was a stunning revalation for me.  She  responded that she just knows, but can't prove it.  I find that to be one  of the strongest statements to support faith in God that I have ever heard.  I have used that &quot;prove XXXXX loves you&quot; to support my belief in  God on several occasions since the movie.  How can we PROVE God loves us  (or that he exists) any more than you can PROVE that your husband or  whoever loves you.  The movie was a religious experience for me.  I am  sorry other Christians don't see the value in the movie.  I suppose that  non-believers can support their positions with the movie too.  Maybe that  is the rub?

I had read the book, and although obviously there had to be some changes, I thought in general it stayed faithful to the spirit of Carl Sagan. It's good to see a science-fiction movie in which battles with aliens isn't the main theme.One thing surprises me. Although I haven't plowed through all the reviews, nobody seems to have commented on an allusion which I thought was fairly obvious (and is also in the book). Ellie encounters her 'father', who tells her that he has taken this form because it would make her feel more comfortable. He then goes on to say that it has always been done this way. Now, that seems to me to be very sensible; if you wanted to arrange to meet another type of life-form, the best way to do it without provoking alarm would be to adopt the same corporeal form as those whom you going to contact. The suggestion that it has 'always been done this way'.... well, maybe it has, except that it was on this planet. I'd find that logical and perhaps that was what the movie and Sagan were suggesting.It would be far more logical for an advanced alien civilization to adopt that strategy than for an all-powerful deity to do so, wouldn't it?	4.0	What if...	2011-07-07	1	1	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" is a fine adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel, inspite of the additional subplot involving Matthew McConaughey's character, a young fundamentalist Protestant preacher. Certainly this is one of the most imaginative films I have seen on the subject of contacting other alien civlizations. It is also an excellent depiction of science on how it is done as well as its politics. Jodie Foster's potrayal of astronomer Ellie Arroway is splendid, almost perfect, with the notable exception of her relationship with McConaughey's character. She excels in conveying Arroway's romance with astronomy and her steadfast determination to do first rate astronomical research.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	"Plenty of reviews below talk about the plot details, etc, so I will omit that here.What I like best about this film is that it addresses both sides of the Science versus Religion debate, and is equally respectful of both sides.  Jodie Foster's character is a woman of Science, not of God.  But by the story's end she has found her own kind of Faith, though it comes partially because she is unable to provide proof of something that her doubters know darn well does actually exist.My only beef with the film is a minor one but it stuck out like a sore thumb to me:  Late in the film's first act she is explaining what Prime Numbers are to some government men.  She says that prime numbers are ""numbers that are only divisible by themselves and One.""  Thanks for the math lesson, dear screenwriters, but in truth Prime Numbers are only EVENLY divisible by themselves and One.  Yes, there is a difference.  That little error in semantics wasn't the issue for me, however.  The issue is that just a few years before ""Contact"" was made, Jodie Foster directed and starred in ""Little Man Tate"", a film about a young boy with above-average intelligence.  In a science and math contest, the young boy and some other bright kids are asked ""Which of these numbers are divisible by [some integer, like 3]?""  While the other kids think it out, Little Man Tate shouts out ""All of them"", which was technically correct.  The contest moderators were looking for the numbers EVENLY divisible by the integer, but they failed to make that distinction.  Tate caught the mistake and put the quizmasters to shame.  Jodie Foster, having directed that scene, SURELY should have remembered that distinction when delivering her lines in ""Contact"".  That Prime Numbers description goof should never have made it past the rehearsal stage.Funny the little things you pick up on, eh?""Contact"" is a great movie by the way, Angela Bassett's over-emoting notwithstanding."	5.0	Two things of note about this film	2005-07-08	10	4	6

Love the new streaming directly to my Sony Blu-Ray wireless!!!The main premise that there are lots of other habitable planets must be correct.  If there are 17 billion planets similar in size to Earth in the Mily Way, and 1 in 1000 is at the right distance to have liquid water... then there are 17 million possible places for life, just in our galaxy.  And there are 500 billion galaxies.But mostly really far away, even at light speed.  I guess, when someone or something does show up will be a surprise.  It is worrisome that greater technology does not seem to bring greater awareness, as is clear on Earth.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG	Jonas Cukierman	"The best science-fiction film of 1997 and one of the best of all time. Based on the book by the late Carl Sagan, this film examines the possibility of life on other planets and the means to make ""contact"" with  them. There is however an even more profound question this film ponders. At  the forefront of one of history's oldest battles are the two contenders of  science and religion. The story begins with Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster  in one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen on film) as a young  girl. As an extraordinarily brilliant child, she shows the making of a  scientist at an early age. The death of her mother and later her father  (both at a very tender age) only push her to explore the limitless  boundaries of the life/faith dilemma. As the film progresses, the  intermingling of science and religion become more apparent. After Arroway  receives what is believed to be a signal of life in outer space, she is  determined to go into space (at risk of death) to explore the origin of the  alien life. What follows before the flight is a plethora of red tape enough  to frustrate God. The religious community, from liberal to fundamentalist,  is determined to make its voice known to the world by apprehending Arroway  and convincing her that it is a question of faith and not science that life  exists. Enter cynic philosopher and Minister Palmer Joss (Matthew  McConaughey). His close relations to Arroway and his visibility on the  world stage create a fabulous breeding ground for conflict and make the  audience think hard about the dual truths and ambiguities of both religion  and science. In fact, the line between science and faith almost seems to  disappear at times. In the end, we are left to our own conclusions about  what is what, but not without feeling that science and religion have both  been given a fair shake. If you are expecting laserbattles and  intergalactic dictators on mega-spaceships, then Contact will certainly  disappoint you. However, if you are expecting to dive deeply into the  thought process and see a Sci-fi film, which is more on the philosophical  side with, many questions left unanswered (like 2001: A Space Odyssey),  then you are in for a great voyage into the unknown. The best thing about  this film aside from the material it approaches is the handpicked cast.  Aside from Foster, James Woods is remarkable as a starchy-shirt, bureaucrat  who refuses to bend to what he cannot see, Angela Bassett is the  open-minded and contemporary believer in the science community who is more  willing to accept Foster's story than anybody else. John Hurt is the  eccentric billionaire who is Foster's only real ticket to the spaceflight.  On a less powerful note, McConaughey is unable to make his role interesting  or even the least bit appealing. The only thing he can convince us of is  that he cannot deliver such a powerful character as his is supposed to be."	5.0	Thought provoking science theory, not just sci fi.	2000-05-23	4	3	1

It is also a rational, believable approach to science fiction.  It has a plot which demands to be taken seriously.  Science fiction often requires an element of &#34;suspension of disbelief.&#34;  This film however, though solidly in the genre of science fiction, does not.The character of Ellie Arroway does not say anything which I cannot imagine Carl Sagan himself uttering.  Cameo appearances from various real life personalities, not the least being President Bill Clinton, add to the immeasurable value of this film.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	Contact is a movie based on the book of the same name by Carl Sagan. Well the title, opening and ending are the same but most of the rest is new. As a film it was o-kay but as an adaptation it was pretty bad.Radio telescopes pick up a signal from space. The signal has many levels and originates from a system that has been too quiet. In the signal there appears to be the instructions for building some sort of machine. The machine is built and sabotaged. A second machine is activated and the movie's star has an experience unobserved from Earth.It is common to shrink casts to make a book fit in a movie. In this case it lengthened it. By cutting the team down to one person there was suddenly a lot of politics about what single person could represent all of Earth. After the return it is one person's word, not a team's, against the evidence.I was not a big fan of the book when it came out (the characters jumped to too many conclusions and I didn't like the ending). The film 2001: A Space Odyssey becomes the template for the journey with language lifted right from the novelization (of 2001, that is) thus weakening the story even further.One way to think of it is that if this film mated with Independence Day then the offspring would be The Arrival. While The Arrival does the contact bit better Contact is still fun to watch. Tom Skerrit makes an excellent low-key bad guy. This is an unfortunate way to remember Carl Sagan the man.	3.0	A Sorry Adaptation	2004-06-24	4	0	4

I wish the movie would have kept some of Carl's more subtle thoughts, mentioned in &#34;Contact&#34; the book, and included them in the movie. For example, the characters discuss Pi, in the book, as a god's signature, but it's left out of the movie.	5.0	An amazing creation	2014-01-28	0	0	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"I rate Contact (1997) a five star film which featured wonderful Jodie Foster. This movie played well on a conventional TV, but did not hold up well on a LCD 52"" HDTV and upward compatible DVD player. If you really love this film the way I do, I would suggest definitely getting it in Blu Ray.I can't say enough about what a fine job was done in making this film. Jodie Foster was able to perform in a totally synthetic environment while delivering (I think) one of her finest performances, delivering a breathless rapture suitable for the cosmic occasion presented. The computer graphics were the best and totally believable. Overall, the cast, direction, pacing, CGI were great and the special effects were meticulously done. The musical score and story were just great.The film was dedicated to Carl Sagan who wrote the original book and helped with the screenplay and is a fine testimonial to the man.I went to the single star reviews and found that this movie was rated as a stinker by a considerable number of people, some of which down rated it because of the compromises it made regarding the fact that Sagan was apparently a registered atheist! They appeared to be upset that this film made some kind of case for faith. It did not make a case for religion, however, and just implied that certain ""human experiences"" can never be proven to the satisfaction of a scientist.The human condition of personal experience still exists, despite the condition described in the film as ""the self reinforcing delusion"". I started out in my early years as a strong faith based person, and now that I am a considerably older person find myself becoming more of an agnostic with time, despite the approach of mortality. I don't deny Hollywood the right to make a compromise between faith and evidence for marketing purposes, or whatever. I agree with the gist of the statement that Ellie made about her lack of belief in god. There is insufficient evidence for a scientist to prove either case."	5.0	Contact (1997)-Great film like this one comes along rarely!	2009-07-23	1	1	0

Gittins	"Directed by Robert Zemeckis of ""Forrest Gump"" fame, there are the same type of visual effects, and more, in ""Contact"", a movie about receiving an earth-originated TV-broadcast from the star Vega, 26 light-years from Earth.Jodie Foster plays astro-scientist Ellie Arroway, who is listening for signals from space, and finally detects one. After decoding the message, NASA builds a large machine that was described in blueprints contained within the message. Ellie's slimey boss, played by Tom Skerritt, is selected to be the designated passenger in the machine, but the test-launch is sabotaged by a religious lunatic, killing Skerritt and destroying the machine. Luckily, there is a second machine, secretly built in Japan, and Ellie is chosen to man it. She ends up taking the ride of her life.The movie co-stars Jena Malone as Ellie as a girl, William Fichtner as a blind astro-scientist, James Woods as the National Security Agency head, and Matthew McConaughey as a not-quite-priest who develops a relationship with Ellie.The 2-1/2 hour movie is very well made, has many special effects (some are the type you don't notice), generally good acting, and an interesting premise.The inexpensive DVD has 3 commentaries - one by Zemeckis, one by Foster, and one by the special effects guys; analysis of several specific special effects; sparse analysis of a few computer-animated concepts; includes extensive text-based behinds the scenes information.Based on Carl Sagan's book ""Contact"" which interweaves military, religious and science aspects to space-travel.

With some time to reflect, it was more about Jodie Foster's performance and the film's big Hollywood style, than true movie substance.  Emotionally one of my favorites, I've watched it many times and still get  a little choked up, esp. when she gets ready for launching in the Machine.  The love story, however, is flat, and thus I feel it can't have 5 stars.  I had to read the book, and of course it was better.  More political,  (although dated) it makes up for the lack of deep substance in the movie.  No love story here (although some interest in a character not even in the  movie).  Read it soon, but after you see the movie.  Carl Sagan, thank you  for making a brilliant, original pop fiction novel before you left us.  As for the DVD, plenty has been said here already, and all of it is true.  This is one of the ultimate DVD versions of a movie and relatively  inexpensive too!

So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.	5.0	SETI Seeks What Is Already Here	2012-03-06	4	3	1

Spurred on to succeed by the death of her father, Ellie embarks on the proverbial &quot;search for intelligent life&quot;, and indeed encounters some on terra firma in the form of Palmer Joss (played by dashing Matthew McConnaughey).  The two meet up later in Washington after Ellie discovers a pattern of prime numbers sent back from the Vega system.  A great maelstrom of excitement ensues when streams of data are decoded (Ellie is surreptitiously aided by an eccentric millionaire called Hadden) and the blueprints for some great machine come through.  The next conflict is, who gets to go...well, we know who it eventually turns out to be, and for all her doubts in a higher power, Arroway now faces the challenge of scrutiny when the time she has spent &quot;away&quot; from earth doesn't jive with the events experienced by everyone else. Interesting philosophical overtones, and the question of &quot;Are we alone in the universe&quot; are subtlely asked in this film.

(To be fair to said daughter, a few weeks ago she picked this one from a list of three, sat through the entire movie, and then wanted to discuss it afterward.  Yessss!)I have dealt through my entire adult life with the issues of ""science vs. religion.""  No other Hollywood movie I'm familiar with addresses this nexus so well.  I grew up in a conservative religious environment, in which the short chronology of Earth was a given.  And by short I mean about 6,000 years, per the genealogical chronologies of the Hebrew Old Testament. (As you may know, the Greek Septuagint OT chronologies run a tad longer, say about 7,000.)Graduate study in ancient Near Eastern history/achaeology and excursions into geology (including a three-week stint in the fossil forests of the Yellowstone) forced me to reconsider the ""given-ness"" of the short age of Earth, and to look more objectively at the nature of ""truth,"" of perception and epistmelogy, of ""myth"" (as an organizing stucture).  Without saying more, let me just say that this personal journey has left me closer to Ellie Arroway than to Joss Palmer.I used to say that religion and science were two valid ways of looking at the universe.  Now I'm not even sure what such an assertion means.  I no longer think of myself as a two-part witness to reality (whatever that is).  Split epistemology like this no longer works for me.Ellie and Joss wrestle with ""Ocham's Razor.""  In terms that would be entirely at home in the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design ""debate,"" this movie asks the hard question that few on the religious Right today seen to care for:  ""What is the evidence.""Other reviewers have made the point, correctly, that this movie is appropriately ambiguous on the answers to the largest questions.

Linder ""Professor Laura"""	"This is not your typical sci-fi movie, simply because the book on which this was based was written by the late Dr. Carl Sagan, Ph.D., a world-renowned professor of astronomy.Don't expect green women seducing the captain of a starship, nor fist-fights with aliens (which is a bit ridiculous when you really think about it), nor aliens that are simply 'human in every way' except (for example): a) they have pointy ears and suppress their emotions, or b) they have a violent streak and have interesting foreheads, or c) they are short, have large ears, and are incredibly greedy.  Remove the ears, the unusual foreheads and the big ears and what do you have?  Just a variety of human beings -- those seeking emotional self-control and spiritual development, violent warrior-types and unethical, money-grubbing businessmen.As much as I truly TRULY love other sci-fi series, virtually all the above aliens are bi-peds (two-legged) and are about as technologically advanced as humans are at that point in the future.If another race of aliens were only a couple hundred years ahead of us militarily and technologically, they could blow humans out of the water if they chose to do so.  Why?  Because scientific knowledge increases exponentially and therefore with an ever-increasing increasing speed.  (Just look at what we human beings have learned in the last 50 years.)Several people that I know that saw Contact did not understand beforehand that Carl Sagan was trying to depict how First Contact might REALLY happen with a far more advanced, non-violent species that wished to communicate with us, with as little trauma as possible.  Some of my acquaintances were disappointed that there were very little special effects.The bottom line:  This is an absolutely wonderful movie for those who have the patience and intelligence to appreciate a believable, insightful film which: a) thoughtfully depicts the individual characters who make the discovery, and b) also explores how different groups of people throughout the world might react to a First Contact that the entire planet suddenly becomes aware of.Expect outstanding, ""slower-paced-yet-fascinating!"", subtle, insightful writing and first-class acting.  Expect realism, not computer-generated aliens, nor an excessive reliance on special effects, nor a predictable, canned Hollywood script, nor a predictable Hollywood ending.Human reality is rarely predictable and is often both 'tumultous and disappointing' on the one hand, but also 'amazing and beautiful beyond words' on the other.

Happily, ""Contact"" is that rare instance when the movie is better than the book. It is worth the price of the DVD just for the awe-inspiring visuals of the opening sequence. The clever use of media sources for exposition, & the manipulated image of president Clinton (from his ""Mar's rock"" speech I believe) make it noteworthy. I also enjoyed the remarks by Ellie's ""father"" at the movie's end, as well as her testimony. In my opinion, this is Jodie Foster's finest role. If you're looking for a space alien shoot-em-up get Starship Troopers because this movie will dissapoint you - which may explain why this movie is often overlooked & under-rated.

I was surprised that some customers thought that the film depicted religion as the baddie.  If you look at the ending, the main character has to emphatically admit that she feels in her gut that there is ""something out there bigger than all of us"".  I find the overall conclusion of the film a bit corny.  I really don't think that the main female character would have  had a romatic relationship with a religious man, no matter how modern or 'new age' he may seem to be.  Seriously?  This film feels very 1980's, despite being made in the late 90's. The concept of  life on other planets is still one that is being researched by scientists today.  In a time of international financial crisis, shouldn't we be spending time and effort on helping one another?  In an odd way, thinking that we can find another planet with life on it to point us towards new frontiers and solve our problems seems, ironically, egotistical--and well, very American."	3.0	vintage sci-fi trying to play the faith card	2013-10-06	2	0	2

Her father passes away shortly after her introduction in this movie, which further instills her scientific as opposed to religious view and approach to life. We then see Foster having made a career in the field of astronomy, particularly with interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. After getting private funding, Foster comes across a unique pattern of sounds that is later found to be a precise set of instructions to build a machine. With dreams of sharing contact Foster will do anything to see this through, despite all the religious and political turmoil along the way.There is some excellent cinematography in the movie with some interesting special effects, but nothing that would completely ruin the film like a lot of CGI these days. The acting is good and is made to feel more natural with the use of real news clips and voice archives. The only thing that doesn&#8217;t come across as natural is the &#8220;relationship&#8221; between Foster and McCauneughey. Other than that, if you enjoy anything fantasy related, thought provoking, or perhaps a little more sciencey less fictiony then this is the movie for you!	4.0	Contact	2013-11-18	1	1	0

First of all were the stereotypes (illusion of dead father, typical currupt politician, boss who cares only for himself, truth about ETs is hidden).Second, it's simply not developed.  It is 'wanna-be' deep.  It uses a lot of 'big' words to make the viewer think they are watching an intellectual movie when they are not.Third, pacing.  The whole movie builds up to a 36 minute ending.  This includes the all important following of the ET's instructions.  By this point, I really didn't care.Fourth, depth.  It tries to touch on many points that it never probes any of them in depth.  To see politics in the Space Program I recommend The Right Stuff (even though it is cleaned up version of the space program).  All the questions the aliens left Ellie with, that she never really probed them about.The 'reunion' scene has been done better in Star Trek.Pass this one up for a real thinker.

The opening scene always thrills me, as does most of the cinematography. Jodie Foster is as talented as ever, and who could not want to look at Matthew McConaughey.  More importantly, the themes of the story reach me the most.  The battle between science and religion and the testing of our search for truth.  As humans, we are constantly assuring ourselves that we have the answers, and this movie just re-interates how young we really are.	5.0	My first DVD	2001-07-12	0	0	0

But, like any other human being, she isn't perfect.  Contact, apparently her creative child, ought to pop whatever &quot;genius balloon&quot; the folks in Hollywood have tried to pin on her sleeve.  This movie is slow, overbearing, and not very interesting--quite an accomplishment for a movie involving inter-stellar travel and first contact with intelligent life outside of Earth.  All in all, Foster holds her own compared to the insufferable performance from Matthew McConaughey.  Simply put, he is awful, attempting to portray an intelligent representative of the religious point of view.  He simply isn't up to that task, and comes across as more of a dumb hick way out of his element.  (Has he ever been good in anything?  Not that I've seen.)So Contact just drags on and on, preaching this, prattling on about that, spoon-feeding us the life story of this preeminent scientist (Foster), showing us stereotypical intrigue between those who want scientific progress and those who do not.  Added for good measure are some sophmoric attempts to engage in philosophizing about &quot;big&quot; issues (which end up being just plain dumb) and an ending that simply isn't worth the wait.

Axler ""maxnax"""	Robert Zemeckis' adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel is as thought-provoking and intelligent as Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  The film contains two prominent themes: a conflict between science and religion, and the wonder and excitement of discovery.  It is slow-moving and deliberate, and yet contains some incredible special effects in the final act.  The result is an extremely absorbing and up-lifting experience.  Contact centers around a bravura performance by Jodie Foster as Dr. Elinor Arroway, an astronomer obsessed with the idea of life in other galaxies.  The Foster character is in virtually every scene of the movie, but is aided by terrific supporing characters.  In particular there is Ellie's father (David Morse), who motivates her as a child to pursue her dreams; Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), theologian and love interest; and billionaire Hadden (John Hurt - almost unrecognizable), who provides the financial stability for Ellie at just the right moment of her life.  The discovery of a signal from outer space by Ellie triggers the beginning of the second act of the film, and I had great fun at this point watching the world come together, trying to figure out what to do next.  I won't reveal any more, since the key to the enjoyment of the movie is discovering at the same time as the characters. Definitely a must-own.	5.0	On par with Close Encounters	2000-12-28	0	0	0

Jodie Foster who interprets the scientist Eleanor Arroway and in along the movie is the principal character (since the beggining when she was a child), gives a very strong image to those scientists who believes in science and in themselves.Another very strong mates in the movie are Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Josh, the religious adviser from the White House and the Arroway's semi-sentimental partner, but more impresive is how all the trama develops in a very realistic secuence and the world's looking for this kind of contact.But seriously Carl Sagan let think us about a vision who can happen maybe in the future, all the elements are teorically logical and his arguments are facts that could impact forever in the human kingdom history. Too seriuos is the history that Robert Zemekis and crew recluted a lot of existent talents with their own live characters as like in first place the same President of the United States Bill Clinton, Larry King, Jay Leno, Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, Kathleen Kennedy and others who plays their role as the same real life.But the rest of actors as Tom Skerritt, David Morse, James Woods, Rob Lowe, Angela Bassett (how you remembers me a lot to Mrs. Condoleeza Rice girl!) and John Hurt (impactant character for S.R. Hadden) gives more credibility to this genius and intrigant sci-fi state-of-art movie.Highly recomended to see this movie again and again, you'll never be bored, you'll be contacted."	5.0	Fantastic Sci-Fi movie!!!	2008-10-24	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AAYYDGI70L20P	Mark	Contact has long been in my list of top 10 movies. A big fan of Carl Sagan in my youth (his series Cosmos inspired many budding Astronomers I'm sure) seeing his novel contact realised as a motion picture was a joyful occasion for me and while there are a few differences from the book I was extremely pleased with the result.The choice of Jodie Foster as Elly worked well as she brought her considerable acting talent to crafting a character driven by a thirst for knowledge and the need to know that we are not alone. Other powerful performances from Tom Skerrit and Matthew McConaughey round out the main characters in this movie nicely.Stunning visuals, great soundtrack, and great philosophical questions to answer.This will always be one of my favourite movies and I am glad that I can now enjoy it in magnificent full HD.	5.0	Finally, Carl Sagan's masterful novel in Full HD	2010-07-27	3	2	1

You have to watch this movie at least 3 or 4 times to fully notice and understand the intricacies built into the characters, plot, and philosophical concepts related to religion, science, and technology. &#34;Contact&#34; is a very intellectual movie; it is a LOT more than just a movie about being contacted by an extraterrestrial society, and also much more than simply a movie focusing on both real and supposed relationships among science and religion.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	ABXT4TSJL5N70	Mark R. Sherman	Contact is a movie that works on every conceivable level.  It is a smart, thoughtful, and entertaining show with an absolutely brilliant performance by Jodie Foster (her closing scene testifying at a Senate hearing could be the best thing she has ever done, and that's saying a lot.)  What makes this movie so special is its ability to keep the focus on the characters and story despite the presence of some mindblowing, truly spectacular visual effects. That's unexpected with films today normally leaning one way or the other. (Speaking of visual effects, the camera perspective for the scene in which young Elle tries to help her stricken father is just impossible to explain or describe.) For the serious movie buff, the DVD includes some insightful commentary from the director and FX supervisors, as well as Foster. This is just a stunning piece of work that was overlooked to a great degree when it was released.	5.0	Exciting, Thoughtful, and Visually Spectacular	2000-11-21	1	1	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A13DRH017BAN4I	Mark Wilsonwood	"For starters, it suffers from a common problem with modern movies: Carefully constructed political correctness. Most of the white males are over-reacting military men, not very bright political consultants, fundamentalist religious figures (some harmless except for being stupid, others terrorists), and scientists willing to take credit that rightly belongs to their female colleagues. Women and minorities, of course, are a different matter. The star is of course a brilliant female scientist. The most level-headed political advisor is a black female. The ""flight director"" for the machine is a black male.But putting aside the political correctness, the element that really prevented me from enjoying this movie was Jodie Foster's performance. I guess it's really good acting. Her delivery is intense, passionate, and earnest. Really, really earnest. There are scenes where every muscle in her face is working overtime to express the -- well, earnestness of the character. Whether commanding her troops in the tracking station, dealing with less intelligent people in the multiple committee interrogation scenes, or repeating ""Okay to go"" over and over and over and over, she is -- really, really earnest. Watching her performance was literally fatiguing.There was a minor character at the beginning of the movie, an Australian astronomer whom Foster's character contacts to confirm the signal they're tracking is real. He's much cooler and calmer than she is. I found myself thinking the movie would have been much easier to watch if he had been the main character."	2.0	Foster makes it fatiguing	2008-10-19	9	3	6

I enjoyed watching this movie for its premise of finding extraterrestrial life, but I really felt that whoever wrote the storyline pretty much painted it into a corner by getting into a tug of war between science and spirituality. Jodie Foster played the part of Dr. Eleanor Arroway perfectly, but unfortunately when asked, it would have been off the crux of the story for Dr. Arroway to just deflect the questions about her own views on spirituality by having her answer &#34;I'm an astronomer, not a theologian&#34;... in that respect, I felt that the movie was hitting its viewers over the head with the idea of questioning religion.

Within the first minute of this film, you know you are about to watch something completely original. (Just for the beginning this is worth watching, as it deserves the award of best opening sequence ever (with Memento a close second)) It focuses on the struggles that Ellie (Foster) faces as a scientist grappling with losses of those close to her, opposition from her superiors and peers, and her atheistic attitude toward life. The movie ultimately focuses on the concept that, whatever you want to call it, there is &quot;more&quot; out there.Foster does a great job of acting, and while the movie runs long at 2 1/2 hours, it's an interesting and unique story. More dramatic than action-packed, Contact is touching in its telling and will make you think about the possibilities that lie out there.	5.0	NOT A THRILLER, BUT A THINKER	2004-02-16	3	3	0

The story isnt just about alien conact and all that, its much deeper. Its all just hidden away behind all that alien contact stuff. Bladerunner and its ideas reflections upon life and death[&quot;all those moments lost in time like tears in rain&quot;] and contact, I found as clearly a metaphor for faith.

There are special effects galore; a broad, sweeping story concerning outer space and alien contact;  and lots of technology in between.  But at its heart is Jodie Foster.  What  a performance!  I never knew she could be so soulful.  She plays the  resourceful, plucky heroine again, but this time Ms. Foster opens up and  shows us so much more depth.  The scene in which she witnesses the cosmos  and cries, &quot;They should have sent a poet&quot; is breathtaking.Now, the DVD is pretty cool too!  Ms. Foster's commentary channel is a  revelation.  And the step-by-step process of creating the digital effects  is interesting as well.  It is truly amazing what computers have done for  visual effects. I'm not sure I understand how some of the effects were done  even after watching the demo reels on the DVD!They've truly done a first  class job on this DVD.

I think Carl would be proud of it.By the way, did anyone realize the two &quot;C's&quot; in the film.  One was in Ellie's father's hand.  And the other was at the very end when Ellie sifted rocky soil in her palm.  I think &quot;C&quot; symbolizes &quot;Carl&quot;.

Contact had a big influence on me as a kid, and fueled the wonderful childish curiosity I had about space, science, and the search for Extraterrestrial Life.That said, I had forgotten about the cheesy melodrama between Jodie Foster and Matthew Maconaghey (whose character could have been removed and the movie wouldn't have suffered) and the overplayed &#34;david and goliath&#34; trope about Jodie Foster vs. &#34;The Man.&#34;  I would have loved to see more about what we've learned about the universe and our place in it, and less about petty interpersonal relationships.	4.0	Good movie, not great movie	2013-03-11	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A7KC2Y7KU4D46	mg	"I liked the movie overall.  The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect.  I think this movie is more ""about"" religion vs science, than anything else.  Even extra-terrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second.Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character (Dr. Ellie Arroway), who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself.  Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did -- if it wasn't for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information.I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world.  I'm not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it's author; not about me.This movie has a strong undertone -- A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director:  This undertone is all about the battle between (1) sound scientific reasoning and logic (and 2) the single-minded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves.The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason.  I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie (little spoiler):~~~~Palmer Joss: Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody. And I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in God. Someone who honestly thinks the other ninety five percent of us suffer from some form of mass delusion.Ellie Arroway: I told the truth up there. And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.~~~~Who is right or wrong?  I guess it depends on your own worldview.  When I was younger (years ago), I remember watching this movie and definitely agreeing with one of them; and now that I'm older I re-watched this same movie agree with the opposing character.  I liked the movie equally well when each viewing (separated by years of course), since the movie does a pretty good job of raising both sides arguments without sounding like it's definitively rooting for either.****** Now, this next part has a bit of a spoiler so don't read it if you don't want to ruin the movie ******In the end, the movie portrays a sense of balance -- that neither side is necessarily 100% right or 100% wrong when (1) the main religious figure (Palmer Joss), does in fact exhibit the redeeming quality of being open to the possibility that Ellie Arroway is telling the truth, and (2) the main secular figure (Ellie Arroway) ironically shows ""faith"" in that she truly believes (despite no empirical evidence) that her personal experiences were real and not a delusion; and she also bequests her opponents to have faith in her as well.Finally, there is just one big plot hole in my mind (also a spoiler):If nobody believed her, then why didn't someone else just go in the machine again and verify it?  Perhaps not using a WIRELESS camera this time..."	4.0	My thoughts	2012-09-07	3	3	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	In 1985, Pulitzer-prize winning author and astronomer Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote a brilliant &quot;what-if&quot; scenario in his novel entitled &quot;Contact&quot;.  In the novel, Carl Sagan created a scenario in which his protagonist, a radio astronomer named Dr. Eleanor Ann 'Ellie' Arroway, discovers an extraterrestrial radio transmission that is clearly from an intelligent alien source.  The discovery causes intense debate between the proponents of science, religion and government that eventually leads to some very compelling questions on the nature of faith itself.  In 1997, the novel was transformed into a film of the same name under the direction of the well-known director Robert Zemeckis, who had previously directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994, for which Zemeckis won the Oscar for Best Director), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984).Carl Sagan, with assistance from writers Ann Druyan, James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, slightly modified the original story by giving Dr. Arroway (played by Jodie Foster) a more personal adversary in another astronomer, Dr. David Drumlin (played by Tom Skerritt).  At the beginning of the film, a brief exploration of Dr. Arroway's childhood (played by Jena Malone) is provided that helps to establish her purely scientific perception of reality that resulted in part from the passing away of her father, Ted Arroway (David Morse), who had also encouraged her love of science, astronomy and radio communications.  As an astronomer, Dr. Arroway dedicated her work to the SETI project (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which Dr. Drumlin considers frivolous and potentially damaging to Dr. Arroway's credibility.  With her governmental funding cut, Dr. Arroway eventually gets private funding after she approaches one of the world's richest and most influential men, S. R. Hadden (John Hurt).  With funding secured, Dr. Arroway's search continues at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico.  With her unorthodox method of personally listening to outer space static, Dr. Arroway suddenly and unexpectedly hears a bizarre set of sounds.  She immediately gets her team, which includes Kent Clark (William Fichtner), busy working on analyzing the signal, which likely comes from an extraterrestrial source.  Once verified, she announces her discovery to the world via the news media, to the disdain of governmental officials including Dr. Drumlin, National Security Advisor Michael Kitz (James Woods) and then President Bill Clinton (himself via archive footage).  It also gains explosive response from very religious individuals who don't necessarily share Dr. Arroway's enthusiasm, except for Father Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), whom Dr. Arroway met in Puerto Rico in a more than casual sense.  The content of the message itself raises some very large questions.What really brought Carl Sagan's vision to life in &quot;Contact&quot; was placing it within a contemporary timeframe.  This included the use of many real events, people and places that included CNN, the VLA, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and many cameos from current politicians the television personalities (Jay Leno, Larry King, Geraldine A. Ferraro, Geraldo Rivera to name only a few).  Also, Robert Zemeckis placed actors within archival footage in much the same way as he did with the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in 1994.  All of this, as well as superb acting from the principal actors (Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, John Hurt, William Fichtner and James Woods), great cinematography, wonderful sets and great special effects make this a brilliant film.  Other memorable characters include Rachel Constantine (Angela Bassett), Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), the NASA Mission Director (Tucker Smallwood) and Joseph (Jake Busey).  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include Dr. Arroway hearing the message at the VLA, the public response, the political discussions, Dr. Arroway meeting S.R. Hadden, the machine, Dr. Arroway's relationship with Palmer, the pinnacle event and its aftermath.Overall, I rate &quot;Contact&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  In my opinion, it portrays many very probable debates and reactions if astronomers ever actually do discover intelligent extraterrestrial communication signals.  I applaud Carl Sagan for his vision, as well as Robert Zemeckis and the many actors and other people involved with the making of this very engaging and compelling film.	5.0	&quot;Wanna take a ride?&quot;	2004-01-11	292	275	17

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	CONTACT poses the philosophical dilemma revolving around the existence of God..or a God.  Scientists are thought to believe only those things which can be proven...there has always been a battle between religion and science.  Carl Sagan's book and Robert Zemecki's movie are not afraid to approach this dilemma.  And it's ironic that in the end, the scientist faces a panel that asks for proof.  It's a difficult question, and no answers are given.The movie itself is a panoramic visual delight from the awesome opening to Ellie's travel to a distant galaxy.  Although the movie is a little long in the tooth, Zemeckis coaches a dynamite performance from Jodie Foster.  In her role as Ellie, Foster embodies the soul of a woman who has spent her life searching for answers, wanting to believe that there's more to life than us and our planet.  Using her distinctive voice, those beautiful eyes, and her heart-felt performance, Foster brings life to a complex, yet innocent, woman.  Matthew McConaughey as the spiritual former priest, Palmer Joss, uses his star power to enliven an otherwise poorly developed character.  The supporting cast has some good performances from William Fichter, as Ellie's blind companion; James Wood as a slimy National Security director; Tom Skerritt as the underhanded scientist who mocks Ellie and then when something occurs, takes the glory, and Angela Bassett as an aide to the president.  Zemeckis uses his FORREST GUMP technique of inserting the then real President Clinton into the film to authenticate the action.The film works mainly because of Foster.  This two time Oscar winner shows why she's one of our finest actresses.	4.0	IS THERE LIFE OUT THERE	2004-09-11	10	9	1

If you want spaceships blasting each other or evil aliens with mental powers, try Star Wars or Dark City.  This is the culmination of a lifetime spent communicating the awesome  potential of scientific discovery in layman's terms.  I am, of course,  speaking of Carl Sagan, the heart and soul of this movie.Sagan's vision,  so eloquently translated by Robert Zemeckis and brought to life by Jodie  Foster and Matthew McConaughey, is a realistic exploration of mankind's  reaction to first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Skepticism,  hope, wonder, fear, distrust, and wide-eyed enthusiasm greet the  &quot;Message from Vega.&quot;  Zemeckis stays true to Sagan and delivers a  thoughtful character study, a surprisingly even-handed debate on religion  and science, and a commentary on mankind's readiness for entry into the  Galactic milieu.One of the finest and most scientifically (circa 1990's)  accurate sci-fi dramas of the past 10 years.  (Except for the fact that we  search thousands of frequencies at once, so humans don't actually listen to  signals from space.)  Foster's performance is worth the price of the movie.	5.0	Engaging and surprisingly human in scale	2000-06-08	125	113	12

What I got was another dose of Hollow-wood crap!  This movie had such promise and fell way  short.  The love-story subplot was totally unnecessary and really detracted  from the overall story and the ending . . .  Well let's just sum it up in  one word . . . anticlimactic.  The movie tries to build up to big finish  and what do we get?  These aliens send us this extremely complex cryptic message that tell  us how to build a device to travel across the galaxy in an instant and only  one person can go.  Whatever!  Then we finally make first contact it looks  like a dead realtive who tells us absolutely squat then sends us home to  tell the rest of the world uhhh! Bottom line:  If you like typical  hollywood formulated movies, with love-story, some cool effects, some  obstacles/antagonism to main chracter(s) followed by a &quot;hokey  ending&quot;, then this movie is for you!	1.0	High expectations leads to big dissapointment!	1999-10-09	47	14	33

It is about a scientist named Ellie,(played by Jodie Foster),who goes it alone to see if there is life on another planet by speaking into a shortwave radio connected to many satellite dishes. She has been searching for life on another planet since she was 9 years old. She hears a loud signal, and calls her workers in a room filled with high tech equipment by walkie talkie, goes to the room, and traces the message she gets. Along the way she meets a 'man of the cloth' played by Matthew McConaughey, (I forget his movie name). He asks her if she believes in God. There is much more I could say here about this movie.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2VGKGXSG81KAS	Michael J. Berquist	I remember walking out of &quot;Contact&quot; struck by how unusual a film it was for a summer release. Not an action film, not a romance flick, not a comedy, &quot;Contact&quot; was a serious exploration of the roles faith  and science play in our daily lives, and it asks a good question of us- how  compassionate are we really? Do we accept the beliefs of others, or do we  stay to our own narrow beliefs? (Appropriately, I saw the movie in our  nation's capitol, just a block or two away from where numerous scenes take  place in the film.)The short and sweet of the plot is this: Jodie Foster  plays an atheist scientist whose quest to find life on another world is  rewarded with a signal one day carrying instructions on how to construct a  machine capable of transporting a human being. I won't give away too much  else. Suffice to say I was impressed by how the film handled the message  and the response- it was not melodramatic and seems quite plausible. The  viewer gets the feeling that if mankind does ever make contact, this would  be how it was done. The question of whether there is extraterrestrial life  out there is a daunting one- to put it mildly it would be the greatest  discovery in the history of mankind and would fundamentally challenge  virtually all of the assumptions mankind has made about our place in the  universe.Foster is quite good, but I found Matthew McConaughey's role as  Foster's love interest and a religious thinker to be a little hard to  swallow. He's a talented actor to be sure (he was terrific in &quot;A Time  to Kill&quot;), but he was miscast here. James Woods and Tom Skerrit don't  impress as the film's two villains, but the story and Foster are strong  enough to carry the movie along despite some weak characters.Does the  movie demonize religion? For the most part: no. The unfortunate casting  aside, McConaughey's character has an important role to play here in making  it abundantly clear that faith and reason need not conflict and that  mankind can believe in god and still be able to question the world around  ourselves. A good message, but one that the film only half-heartedly  makes.In terms of technical execution, &quot;Contact&quot; has much  going for it. It all looks plausible, like we are watching a documentary  instead of a fiction film. The sequences involving CNN reporters and clips  of President Clinton (re-edited to make it appear like he was commenting on  events in the film) blur the line between fiction and fact.On the  balance, well done. This is a film that will impress and make people think.  Good work.	4.0	Thoughtful	2000-03-21	13	12	1

I happen to know that Sagan had little respect for people of faith (Christians are by far the safest to criticize because we're not likely to cut someone's head off for doing so!) and I don't know if the book was more respectful than the movie but my skin is thick and other than that I thought it a pretty good movie. I found the Haddon character very intriguing. Too bad his part was so small. The circus that followed  the discovery of the message from the aliens was exactly what one would expect, and the posturing of the politicos is as laughable in the movie as it is in everyday life.	4.0	Gird your loins Christians!	2013-05-10	1	1	0

It seems he had some input also, which is great, because I feel it helped keep the story on track.  With such great actors as Jodie Foster, James Wood, John Hurt, and Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughey it is really hard to find a fault with the caste.  Tons of extras and commentary tracks, the only complaint I have is the same one I had when watching it in the movie theater.  And that is it is a tad too long.  Just a tad, maybe ten minutes more than it needed to be.Outside of that it is a great movie and viewers of all ages should be able to enjoy it.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A16EZ4MT9BFF2R	Mike Murray	Bear with me.A young girl is encouraged by her widower father to explore the world and beyond; soon left orphaned, she turns inward and relentlessly pursues the signs for intelligent life in the universe, only  to be thwarted at every turn by an evil nemesis and yet be assisted by a  mysterious shadowy figure with the power to make his machinations stick.  Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet  equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum  that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount  Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump,  Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the  framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster  is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for  anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for  Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by  Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of  the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and  fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman  with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes  involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a  priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him  no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story  that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its  characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are  well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience  with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you  think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen  story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for  screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis,  aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide  us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more  endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what  would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.  From  beginning to end, every part of her experience rang true.So, for a  thoughtful way to spend 2 hours, rent or purchase this film.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	Imagine if Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was made with late-'90's technology and a Hollywood cast, by -- for better or for worse -- the Spielberg disciple who directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You don't have to imagine it, because we have the reality of &quot;Contact&quot;.  I had a lot of problems with this movie, some of which I'll list later, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.The science of the movie was fascinating (even though I'm not familiar with the source material, the late Carl Sagan probably deserves much credit here).  A rag-tag group of science misfits picks up a pulse from outer space, and slowly learns the message contained within.  There's a fine moment near the end of this sequence where a video representation of the message is revealed, and it is a truly stunning moment, that carries much drama.  The message contains plans to build a machine, which will send one person to a distant star, presumably for enlightenment.  The &quot;machine&quot; is gloriously realized.  It is both beautiful and believable, its power palpable and awesome (especially in one scene where things go horribly wrong).  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his considerable skill at special effects very wisely here, giving us enough to keep the imagination entertained but never overwhelming the story.Unfortunately, the less technical aspects of the movie are handled quite sloppily.First, the acting.  James Woods and John Hurt, two actors I admire, had a tough time fleshing out their two-dimensional characters.  Woods didn't do anything more than show narrow-mindedness and anger, while Hurt was stuck in eccentric billionaire mode.  Rob Lowe, also playing a two-dimensional character, was just painful to watch, affecting a hoarse voice and a beatific smile that did little to hide the fact that his character was no more than a fluffy device to introduce basic religious arguments.  Ditto Jake Busey, as an over the top zealot who carried the added detriment of an albino fright wig and &quot;evil&quot; white-eyes.  Tom Skerritt fared better, although he was miscast.  Skerritt is usually fine when playing the saintly father figure; here he's asked to be a slick, egotistical bureaucrat, and doesn't pull it off.  Which brings us to Matthew McConaughey.  I had no problem with his acting, but the character was completely implausible.  A man with a self-help book at number one on the bestseller list would not get this much time with the President, especially if his ideas were as lame as Matt's 'Palmer Joss'.  He represents a bigger problem with the movie, in that the fight between science and religion is handled in a very passionate, but utterly simple-minded way.  I suspect that some of the book's big ideas and arguments were dumbed down for a mass audience.  It's unfortunate, wasting an opportunity for intelligent mass discourse.The lone bright spot in the cast is -- duh -- Jodie Foster.  I admit to being ambivalent about Foster in the past, but here she won me over.  Her Dr. Arroway is meant to have passion, drive, brains, desire, spunk, and innocence.  Foster pulls off all of these traits wonderfully.  There were some moments near the end, when Arroway takes flight (&quot;They should have sent a poet,&quot; she cries when confronted by an ineffable view of space), that in the hands of a lesser actor would be hokey.  Foster gets them all right.I get the impression that Zemeckis himself doesn't trust the weight of the ideas he's putting forth here, because he does several things that distract the audience from them.  First, the relationship between a young Arroway and her father was manipulation of the highest order.  It's pop psychology that anyone can understand on an emotional level, rather than the intellectual level, which should have been the movie's strength.  Also, he employs &quot;testimony&quot; from real-world media figures (it seemed like the entire staff of CNN appeared on screen at one point or another) to lend the ideas credibility.  In fact, the ideas were undermined because of this.  The same can be said for his liberal use of news footage of President Clinton, whose intentionally vague speeches are supposed to relate to the film's narrative, but rather prove distracting.There is a lot of potential in &quot;Contact&quot;.  I was gripped by the story, even though a lot of the times I felt like a machete-wielding explorer hacking my way through a jungle of debris to get to it (I have the sneaking suspicion that Zemeckis realizes this, for he includes a take-off of the line &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume&quot;).  It is visually stunning, engrossing, and, if you can turn off your cynicism for awhile, believable.	4.0	There's a fine movie in here somewhere	2001-04-27	13	6	7

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1ZEWZG6AKB7C0	Moonstone7	Contact captivates from the first moments and never lets go. It's one of my all-time favorites, that I view over and over again. It's poetic and spectacular--an awesome movie--and Jodie Foster is wonderful as the ever-searching Ellie Arroway. Matthew McConaughy is quite the hearthrob, too. (I love his gorgeous curls and dimples!) After watching this movie, I had to get Carl Sagan's book. Zemekis has captured the essence of the book but for those who hunger after more I highly recommend reading the book as there's so much more to the story and the science that couldn't be told in the movie, especially the trip through the wormhole (taken by several people, not just Ellie) and the sections about the number pi. Simply fascinating.	5.0	Superb science fiction!	2005-07-03	1	1	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	Mr B T Thacker	Contact is a film about the battle to get to space, and what we might find there. It's not attempting to prove or disprove God, or the value of science. It's not trying to tell us that all politicians or priests are  bad. And it's not trying to be &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.What  &quot;Contact&quot; is: a moderately thoughtful and carefully constructed  essay on possible first contact and problems therein. It's got some cheesy  mechanics in it (love-story, arbitrary ending), but, frankly, you expect  that. It does provide beautiful and, more importantly, integral special  effects, and some nice acting from a few cast members. Not all, mind  you.I find it difficult to believe that anyone who watches this film  with tolerance and an open mind could object to it. Obsessive Christians'  only complaint might be that there are atheists in the movie. Grow up -  there are atheists in real life. Obsessive scientists might have trouble  with depictions of science as faith. Get real - the issue isn't science,  but personal belief.If you can shed a few preconceptions, and are  willing to watch something a little deeper than &quot;Batman and  Robin&quot;, then you should enjoy &quot;Contact&quot;. If not, then just  don't watch it. But you'll be missing out on an important debate.	4.0	I think some people are missing the point . . .	2000-02-20	5	2	3

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AB5DVSNPX1JSK	"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown"""	"Contact was a film that interested me from the get go.  I loved the idea, and I guess I still do: a chance to make contact with Alien life and making it come across as real.  There is no question that this film provides a realness, an authenticity of plot mixed in with good acting.  What Contact lacks however is some contact with originality and general audience appeal and satisfaction.  Now what in the world did I just say?  Well let's analyze this movie:Arroway played by the supberb actress Jodie Foster is a scientist who goes out of her way to be the first to make contact with recent Alien life that eventually becomes national, meaning it becomes obvious to the public.  Now two good things here that I liked:1. It pretty much avoided the cliche of the big ""government conspiracy"" that so many sci-fi films feel they must have (until the end).  The government and public are just as surprised by the sudden alien contact as any one else.2. You don't get to see Aliens, they are left up to the viewers imagination.  Another words, you don't know what this out of space life is.  This maintains interest and suspense.Now, here's where it lacks originality.  Arroway is not an original character.  She's a scientist, a believer in new life out there, explorer, etc.  This is the character ""we"" as the audience would expect to be the main character.  Although it may be what we expect, that doesn't make it original.  What makes Close Encounters of the Third Kind better is that the main characters were ordinary people, with no expertise, learning and changing and developing as the film progresses.  Arroway changes hardly at all, because practically the film is about everything changing for HER.  Everything opens up to her from opportunities to beliefs.  We don't sympathize with her because she doesn't grow, only the plot grows around her.  And it should be the other way around.Another cliche is Skerritt's death.  I'm sorry, you knew that was going to happen.  You knew some accident was going to take place to keep him from going up so Arroway could go in his place.  This plot is good, but it is at the same time predictable.  And because it's predictable, some of suspense goes down the drain.Now the worst of all worst cliches in the movie is when she makes actual ""contact"" with a being that's in the shape of her father.  How utterly stupid.  How many films have I seen now that have this?  Visited by an image of her father, a ghost like figure, so many films do this.  They have to ruin this film by making the ""contact"" turning out to be a relative of hers.  There is no satisfaction to this, all the suspense during the whole film of wanting to know WHAT is trying to make contact is answered by adaptation of her father?!  What a waste.That costed it one star, the cliches and the wasted suspense of this movie.  What costed it another star was that I really did not like the political/religious bias and slams and cliches in this movie.  I'm sure Athiests love this movie, because religion is dissed big time in this.  Half this movie was not about the contact from another life form, but rather the struggle between theoretical differences (Athiests vs. Religion).  This did create drama and friction between characters such as between Arroway and Palmer (Matthew McC.).  However, it came across as if this film had another objective in mind.  As if it was on a mission to show up religions and make it appear as if ""religion is the doorstopper in progression.""I'm not the only one who thinks this, who was a little offended by how someone who believes in God is represented.  Sorry, Palmer didn't make a very convincing religious person.  He basically shies away from Arroway when the topic comes up, as if ""he knows she's right.""  And naturally for villains, the director has it be these religious wackos.  Then when Arroway is being interviewed by world leaders, they make it appear as if she's being persecuted for not having a religious belief.Again, these are all slams and cliches against religion, and some of us like to see better representation in movies if it's going to be an essential element of the movie.  Not that the issue has to be ignored in movies, but create a balance not a bias.  Otherwise, leave the subject alone if you can't accurately or fairly represent the other side.  Because quite clearly there was an anti-religious agenda in this movie and I felt it uncalled for.Other than the biasness and the lack of originality in climax and character, this film has a good storyline.  It has great acting, it is a very believable film.  And if not for these blackmarks, I would've considered among my top favorite sci-fi films.  But the director made a classic mistake in dividing the audience by slamming a belief system rather than telling a story without the anti-spiritual agenda.Grade: C"	3.0	Contact makes rough contact	2003-09-28	3	0	3

They even showed a bluish cast of the surroundings on the alien planet that would result from not having an atmosphere to screen out the blue part of the light spectrum.

To tell you the truth, I expected much more out of this film, especially since it was written by science fiction genius Carl Sagan.  Jodie Foster, however, gave an  exceptional performance, while Matthew McConaughy's character had  absolutely no purpose.  Secondly, I was expecting more of an ending.  I  know that some people call it a genius ending, but I just don't get it.  I  felt like I was being ripped off.  Robert Zemeckis stole my money, made me  sit through two hours, expecting a smash ending, and... what do I get? A  lame ending.  Who needs that? There are plenty of movies with crappy  endings.  I do recommend viewing Contact, just for the sake of it.  There  are one or two moments that are entertaining.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A13UFU1894FYT8	OldBrit	I saw this film in the theater when it was relaased and this is the first time I've seen it since that time. It's well made, entertaining, and compelling. As a science fiction movie, Contact is OK, as long as you ignore it's lack of faithfulness to Carl Sagan's novel of the same name. It's really a political drama in which the sci-fi element is the MacGuffin.As a time capsule of the late 1990's, it excels at using faked news media to make it seem real. The special effects are excellent. The cynicism in the way government operates, the manipulative abilities of the extremely wealthy, the fairly negative view of humanity, and the emphasis on spirituality and God deliver a conservative message that today's Evangelical Christians and Tea Party should find quite appealing.Unfortunately, it's one of those movies where you really want the entire movie to be the first 15 minutes because what happens next is more interesting than the first two hours - especially if you're interested in it as a sci-fi film. (Which, of course, would have taken it even further away from Sagen's book.)I must say that I kept wanting Jody Foster to give Matthew McConaughey a good swift kick in the gonads and send him packing, but she never did.This film, while not a masterpiece, is a solid and entertaining film that will hold up well to the test of time. After writing this, I took a look at Roger Ebert's review. I usually find that he and I have similar taste and tend to rate films similarly - although it is often for very different reasons. Roger gave this film 5 stars and thinks it is, in fact, a masterpiece. So, do take a look at Contact and decide for yourself whether Roger Ebert got it right and I got it wrong. NOTE: Don't read Ebert's review before you watch the film as it contains numerous spoilers.	4.0	A great time capsule of the 1990's	2013-10-12	0	0	0

And to have the dead dad deliver some mushy, useless speech that said NOTHING??!!!Things I agree with other reviewers on:Angela Bassett had to ACT! instead of just acting. She ate the scenery in each of her scenes. Quite annoying. James Woods did the same.Whenever Matthew McCaugheny came into a scene, the movie stopped dead in its tracks and yes, don't hit us over the head with religion! If religion had its way, we'd all be still living in the middle ages. Science (the opposite of religion) has given us technology and all the comforts that go with it. Laughably ZERO chemistry between he and Jodie Foster.Zemeckis teased us with the big build up to nowhere. Shame on him for not finding creative minds that would have provided the necessary pay-off to taking a ride in the Fantastic Machine. How dumb did he think his paying audience was? Pretty dumb.Like I said, well made big budget movie worth watching IF you do not expect a pay-off which this one thoroughly promised but failed to deliver.	2.0	"Big Build Up To Getting ""There"", But No There There!!"	2005-09-07	19	2	17
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	Contact is a terrific film on many levels: superficially it's beautifully photographed with ace special effects - many of them I didn't realise were special effects at all until I watched the little feature about how they were made, which surely is the acid test of how good they are.Jodie Foster's performance as a slightly geeky (but secrety rather attractive) scientist is spot on, especially her cheeky rendition of Sagan's own goofy accent, but the remaining characters are cartoonish and a bit theme-functional: for once, the bimbo is a bloke - that Matthew McConaughey's hokey priest is Foster's love interest and intellectual adversary fits nicely with the battle of intellect vs. emotion which is waged throughout the film, but as a credible character he just doesn't stack up. The same is true of Tom Skerrit's Big Bad Boss Who's Only In It For The Glory.For all that, you're certainly left mulling over the notion of contact, in all its manifestations (you know, with little green men, with other human beings, with your lost father, with your spiritual side etc.) throughout, and given that the author of the screenplay was a thoroughly scientific and sceptical chap, the final message is one of surprising humility and irony.Ostensibly the conflict is between science (which needs to know The Truth, whatever the religious consequences) and blind faith. But when the arch-sceptic finally establishes (...or does she?) her argument, can she prove it to a sceptical public?  Quelle dilemma! Lesson learned!	4.0	Billions and billions...	2000-12-10	2	2	0

It extends beyond the limits of science fiction making the audience think about the human nature and the  relationship between science and religion.  Contact features an interesting  relation between an astronomer and a &quot;priest&quot;. In the end, it  shows how these two opposite sides can easily contact. The audio  commentaries by Jodie Foster and Rob Zemeckis are also very interesting  since you get an insight on the background of the movie.

Here we see all the crash of so many disciplines mostly it's religion VS science. I liked all the intrigue, the memorable  quotes (some were quoted by Carl Saggan before his death), but mostly I  liked the human part of each character, because I found it very accurate,  we see at the end that faith is always a fundamental part of the human  being, even if you're very rational. And from my point of view Science and  Religion aren't completely incompatible after all, 'cause they both come  from the same root: philosophy.

Time and space don't allow a comparative with the novel.......Dr. Arroway has little reason for faith. Her mother died giving birth to her, and her dad died nine years later. What is there left to believe in? Already science-minded, young Ellie Arroway looks to the stars for answers. An accomplished astro-physicist, she declines grants an fellowships to pursue a personal SETI. She falls victim to a series of hoaxes, ad evetually acquires a corporate sponsor in order to advance her agenda. Once she makes CONTACT, her career, and life, become entangled in bearu-theocracy. She copes well. An act of terrorism propels her again into the spotlight, and then into the Vega solar system. There she meets an alien who admittedly takes the form of her late father. She learns about time.  Once back on Earth, many are skeptical of her accounts. A lo-tech device offers proof of her testimony, but is shielded from the public. She continues...  This truly inspiring film suffers from the impossible combination of religion and science. Although Sagan himself talked the embracement of belief and science (he was a poitician too), the film makes it clear that these agendas cannot collide. Afterall, God is omnipotent. If God wants aliens, God'll have 'em. If the next minute God doesn't want aliens, there won't be none. Same goes for us. There is no common ground. For all its wisdom and insight, its lovely craft, its feel good message, it unfortunately fails as an intelligent film. That is, unless, we admit that peole are indeed illogical. Is that the point? We already know that.	4.0	A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH THE RICHER NOVEL	2001-06-02	1	1	0

What I witnessed that was almost more remarkable than the film was what went on in the audience (or what did not go on) -  During the entire  duration of the movie NOBODY moved - no bathroom breaks, no popcorn runs.  &quot;Contact&quot; was completely entralling.  A wonderfully orchestrated  concept in addressing some of the most difficult philosophical questions  ever asked.  A few great surprises to keep the audiences on the end of  their chairs.  How many people got goose bumps when Hadden says from the  Russian spacestation: &quot;Want to take a ride?&quot;  As I read some of  these reviews my only comment for those slightly disappointed in not have  the great visual alien revelation at the end is:  Look beyond the physical,  this movie is about ideas and intangibles, use your mind. I'm sure the  Vegan alien would have had to work overtime to &quot;make it easier&quot;  for you, too.  And for those of you who think this is Sagan's way of  saying there are aliens and flying saucers all around us - Wrong - this is  actually Sagan's way (or science's way)  of saying that if there was life  out there, because of the vast distances, a transmitted signal would be the  first (or most intelligent) way to try to communicate and not zooming  around in flying saucers. Sorry,  Roswell,  I'd like to believe but as  Jodie Foster says &quot;I'd need proof, wouldn't you?&quot;  Carl  Sagan  believed it was possible.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A26972KFFGMG0W	Peter F. Ward	"Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.  Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the ""truths"" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.  Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests.  Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.  Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious.  Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on."	1.0	A brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment.	2008-10-20	33	8	25

Acting (I.E. Jodie Foster in her finest performance) . Special effects. Direction. Etc.

All aspects of this  excellent movie, (story, acting, special effects, etc) interleave with each other to create the synergy of  being greater than the whole of the parts.  And because of this the movie flows along effortlessly, never releasing its grip on our attention and at points reaching the hypnotic intensity  of an epic novel.

If anything it's generous.Undoubtedly the worst part of this awful remake of an excellent, thought proving book is at the end, where in big letters it comes up with the words ""For Carl"".At that point I nearly threw something at the screen.Carl Sagan was an atheist. Contact, the book, contains some intelligent, thought provoking, discussions between two of the main characters ; the atheist Arroway, and the Christian Joss. The ""extremist"" views on both sides are represented by Drumlin and Rankin. Rankin, as far as I can see, has been removed altogether. Most of the discussions between the two main characters have been rewritten so that the balance becomes blatantly pro-religion. For example, at one point, the Joss character asks Arroway ""Did you love your father - prove it"" which is the asinine kind of thing an asinine religious person would ask ; and absolutely not the kind of thing the Palmer Joss character in the book would ask.Worse still is the end of the film. In the book, Arroway is basically paid off and hushed up. In the film, there is a big set piece investigation in which Arroway is asked ""questions"" - this is an unsubtle piece of propoganda in favour of religious faith.Back to ""For Carl"". Carl Sagan ; the author I've read in Contact and various other books would have disowned this movie, and probably stopped it. Hence the title.Does it matter ? If you like dumb movies, probably not, it then just becomes are rather pointless low level action flick. But then again, you might as well by a Schwarzenegger film for that."	1.0	No wonder they waited till Carl Sagan was dead.	2003-03-01	103	44	59

Here were are in the midst of billions of planets, stars and galaxies. Its so vast and amazing it boggles the human mind. Planet earth is a spec of dust within it all, yet we humans are so pompous we actually find it difficut to believe there is other life out there. But not Ellie(Jodie Foster). She had the faith to believe in such possibilites, and by sticking with her hope she discovers the greatest breakthrough in human history, and was then left to stand aside while goverment scrutiny and red tape made their own decisions and not for the best. In the end Ellie gets her chance to visit another world, and as the audience we get to experience a magical spectacle rarely seen in cinema. Contact represents one of the finest science fiction experiences that can be imagined. This is a solid motion picture masterpiece that I have personally seen several times and it takes my breath away just a little more with each viewing. This film often rises above the masterful sci-fi achievements of Kubricks 2001: A space oddesssey some 30 years later. Indeed a cinematic experience rarely achieved to this degree. Jodie Foster once again proves what a truly talented actress she really is. Along for the experience are some gifted actors like Tom Skerrit, James woods, Mathew McConaughey, and even Bill Clinton signed on to play him self in this truly epic motion picture. There is a sub story here that is truly interesting also. Should someone who doesnt believe in the existance of God be allowed to travel 20,000,000 light years into space to make contact with an alien existance? Though I believe in god, I dont think its an issue at all. This is truly a spectacular and powerful movie experience that represents the best in science fiction story telling.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3FOSBM4MMUFER	Randal J. Batty	I felt the film was faithful to Carl Sagan's novel.  This book adapted itself well to film unlike much of science fiction.  Jodie Foster does all the heavy lifting here -- particularly showing her prowess as a major actress during moments of doubt and introspection.  Her ability to display inner conflict is really amazing.  I enjoyed all aspects of this film -- from the sweet/folksy beginning of a young girl's amazement with the stars, to the same girl's encounter with the unknown and her struggle to validate her experiences in a court of inquiry.  The film grabs you in a personal, emotional way and doesn't let go.  The film forces you to look at the essentially invisible line between faith and science, and that's a big enough goal for any motion picture.	4.0	A Conundrum Between Faith and Science	2011-03-28	1	1	0

Besides the fact that the special effects are great and the acting is great, the story is entertaining and realistic (okay, to a degree). The science world is exposed as to how it really is -- more driven by money, politics and ego than most care to admit. It also shows that although science can do wonders, it is not the answer to everything (by the way, my background is in the hard sciences).

The plot is also quite similar to the book, which I also recommend reading.The DVD, while preserving the sound and video to almost perfection, has included some worthwhile features.  The &quot;making of&quot; sequences tell quite a bit how a movie comes to light.Last but not least, if you're still not convinced, then you should get the movie just for the beginning and climax.

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun"""	"In these times when Hollywood gives us so much ill-inspired pseudo-scientific and -technical bunk to wade our way through in the interest of entertainment, we also get this wonderful story by the late Dr. Sagan brought to decent special-effects life.  Though much of what we hear coming from the mouth of Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster), as directed at Palmer Joss (McConaughey), is presented with such an attempt at persuasion as you'd find in the characters of an Ayn Rand novel, the basic story is that life is a precious possession, to be cherished for all it is at the present moment.  The relationship of Ellie to her father is one of profound loss, but she will not accept God's will as explanation:  ""I should have kept the medicine in the downstairs bathroom--then I could have gotten to him faster"".  We are really left wondering about just what the actual ""phenomenon"" is that we have witnessed, since evidence proves finally lacking for the rigorously-grounded scientist to follow.  Sagan's awareness of the kind of fringe groups that ""are out there"" is illustrated by the mass-celebration and -demonstration held outside the Very Large Array, even to include a chapter of the Chevy Vega collectors' association, in honor of the star that has finally heard our stray RF from the 1930's and sent back its reply.  The response of the Clinton administration (though I understand the clip of him giving a press conference was lifted from another context) in militarizing the project might even find support among the UFO conspiracy-types.  But Dr. Arroway does not care; she has taken up the banner of scientific inquiry and integrity, so she needs to tell ""everyone"".  The ""machine"" is exceptionally well-modeled for the screen, though we have to wonder about some of what is purported to go on when the capsule finally reaches the core.  We are given imagery to remind us of the transport in ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"", or as later seen in Neo's initiation via the Rabbit Hole in ""The Matrix"".  This is a highly-developed story about a variety of developments in its human characters.  We are left wondering, though...what COULD have taken place for those 18 hours?"	5.0	Equal time for reason--quite refreshing	2003-06-03	4	4	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time.  Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them.  ""Contact,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young.  And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years.  She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, ""Contact"" will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey.  It's what the magic of the movies is all about."	5.0	Foster, Zemeckis Realize Sagan's Vision	2001-06-25	5	3	2

In this dramatic ""Sci-Fi"" movie, the lead character, Dr. Arroway (Jodi Foster) is presented with the penultimate challenge of pitting scientific logic and the essential human importance of religious faith in a God/higher power to live a life of meaning.  I cannot imagine this movie being nearly as significant without the excellent casting of characters. (especially Foster).  This is a tough issue to ""sell"" to the public and a difficult message to convey through the genius of Sagan. However, the job gets done and done well.  I reccommend seeing this video 2 or 3 times to really get the full impact of the message, or better, read Sagan's book before or after seeing the video.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A315XBNH62ZKUV	Richard Mercer	This was my first DVD purchase, and I couldn't be happier. This is definitely one of the top five SF films of all time. I personally would place it third after 2001 and 2010, but ahead of any Star Trek or Star Wars film, as much as I enjoy them. Its strong points are its evocation of &quot;sense of wonder&quot; and intelligent treatment of a core SF theme; if you prefer action and special effects you would rank it lower. There are a lot of nice special effects here but they don't dominate the movie as in Star Wars.I don't know of any other film that gives such a balanced presentation of the conflict between science and religion. My only problem was the claim that &quot;95% of the world's people believe in some sort of God&quot;, a figure which is preposterously high but goes unchallenged in the movie. Ellie (the protagonist) should have laughed at this claim rather than being cowed by it.Things you should know:-- This release is lean in extra features; there is no extra video included. The only substantial extras are annotated reconstruction of some special effects and three alternate audio-commentary sound tracks, one by Jodie Foster herself. For someone like me who would be entertained listening to her read a phone book, her audio commentary is a real bonus, like having her sitting there next to me explaining the movie(!)-- On a standard TV the video shows in a relatively narrow band; it's in 2.35:1 format, which is as far as I know the narrowest presentation used for DVDs; it uses just slightly more than half your screen. You should not let this prevent you from buying the DVD; like me, you will *someday* get a widescreen TV, and it's still quite enjoyable on a standard TV.	5.0	Believe the Editors!

I was written more than 10 years ago, so the current SCI-FI concept we usually see is not present.  If you like action like The Rock it is not for  you.Perhaps during the contact I would do a different thing if I would  write the story because it feels quite a bit common, but as I said it was  written years ago and the only one I would blame for it is Carl Sagan.I  have not read the original book but those who read have told me that the  movie does not alter the story but simplifies it for time reasons.I own  the video and I think that it worth the price and it is enjoyable.	4.0	Masterpiece	1998-12-25	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	Let's say that proof of alien life was found with the radar, satellite stuff we have poking around space, then the events that would take place would probably be very much like those in &quot;Contact,&quot; and that is the beauty of the film. Robert Zemeckis' movie cleverly takes a look at what would happen if we discovered evidence that we are not alone. It sets itself apart from blockbuster science fiction like &quot;Independence Day&quot; because of how realistic it is, how convincing and plausible. The screenplay by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, based on the novel by Carl Sagan, is filled with interesting characters, but more with interesting ideas. We also appreciate how they add philosophical arguments into the mix. Most science fiction films don't really explore the debates about God and science, this movie does, by letting the two main characters debate about the issues. The movie is also entertaining on the dramatic angle and the special effects are wonderful to look at. The movie has style and realism mixed with science and deep philosophical issues. I have nothing against the &quot;cool&quot; stuff like &quot;ID4&quot; or &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; but &quot;Contact&quot; is a breather for people looking for something smart and thoughtful. It has detail, great performances and nice photography. A very good movie.	5.0	Intelligent And Interesting.	2000-12-20	20	16	4

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	CONTACT is one of the most thoughtful and compelling science fiction films ever made.  Everyone involved is working at the top of their game, from Zemeckis, who covered some of these ideas before in the delightfully silly  BACK TO THE FUTURE series, to the performers, who are each exceptional and  truly moving.  Jodie Foster once again plays a loner, with a deep wound she  must heal, and McCounaghey, who has never been more appealing, plays the  insightful spiritual man who loves her.  If you are looking for cheap  thrills and lots of action, CONTACT is not necessarily your sci-fi; you  will not be disappointed by the mind-boggling effects and surprisngly  sublime alien encounter(s), but this movie has a lot more on its smart  mind.  The experience of CONTACT is emotional on every level, from the  petty games people in power play, to the grief we feel over the loss of  loved ones, to the difficulty each of us has in making that one true  connection with someone we love.  I for one cannot get enough of CONTACT.  One for the ages.	5.0	SUBLIME SPECTACLE	2000-03-06	6	5	1

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AQ65579F7SYVX	SaosinEngaged	"I've viewed this film countless times. Each time I watch this movie, I'm left wondering how Contact is time and time again glossed over and seemingly forgotten. It's a true work of art; a beautiful, inspiring, self-affirming and hope filled tale of one woman's ambitious spiritual and scientific journey through the monumental discovery of alien life. This film does not pander to the blockbuster Michael Bay super-explosion loving crowd of ""aliens vs humans'' plotlines that seem to dominate sci-fi, it's much deeper than that. This film is about how little, insignificant and infantile we are as a species, and how there may be millions of advanced creatures out there willing and ready to guide us through our evolution as a species if only we can find a way past all the troubling and petty politics and be receptive to them. Contact also expertly intertwines the seemingly contradictory doctrines of science and faith, and in the end shows how having a little bit of both may be the answer to the human experience.What makes this film is the incredible performance of Jodie Foster and the emotionally resonant plot that humanizes her weaknesses as explainable personal tragedies early in her life. The culmination of the long and powerful story is one of the most beautiful and artistically vibrant scenes in any film I've ever seen. Truly, it's moved me to tears. I can count the number of films that have done this on one hand.I have NO IDEA why this film has received so little recognition, whether on top all-time Sci-Fi films or top movies in general. The great Carl Sagan's brilliant story is brought to life in a semi-realistic portrayal of what would happen if a message from an alien species was ever received in modern times.5 Stars."	5.0	Quite possibly one of the most underrated, underappreciated and misjudged movies in the history of film.	2011-08-30	9	9	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A97SZOCQ8XEFL	Sarah Borkowski	Contact is the story of humans' first contact with something from space.  Ellie (Jodi Foster) spends her whole career listening for sounds from space.  Along the way she meets Palmer (Matthew McConaughey), a man concerned with how scienctific discovery and technology affect human welfare and religion.  These two characters have very different religious viewpoints, and I feel like the differences were handled well.  The debate could have gone on endlessly, but that wasn't the point of the movie, and once it reached the fundamental divide between faith vs. proof they let it go.The movie was well-acted by all the characters.  Jodi Foster plays a very convincing obsessed scientist, and Matthew McConaughey is a thoughtful counterpoint.  Personally, I think the downfall to a lot of science fiction movies is that the characters are too attractive and the movie gets wrapped up in their romantic relationships.  Contact kept the science on mainstage with brief cameos from other topics, which was great!Contact brings the viewer in and forces you to think about really important issues and how you would react to the events that unfold.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2GQ7EUWPSB0OP	Sarakani	I read the book but the film did not dissappoint.  Of course as a film it is designed to appeal to Americans - frankly the film was more entertaining than the book which included about five people visiting the alien world - more scientifically credible by all means.This film is a tremendous breakthrough in CG animation and the use of realistic news casts and video inserts to convey a sense that it really happened.  If it did happen, how would it unravel and the book is a masterly portrayal of how things could change.  The script also analyses the scientific method, Occam's Razor and the problems with truth and the bugbear of science and relgion - veering rightly in my view towards science against the dogmatic aspect of religion.How accurately the film foretold the tragedies of suicide bombers.  How lovingly it showed the whole of a dessert community madly celebrate the message from outer space, in so diverse a fashion and hyperbole as only Americans could.The best bits were views of our solar system and such extraordinary footage of young Ellie - rushing down a corridoor to open the medicine chest.The best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90s sadly underated and comparable to other Zemeckis treats like Forest Gump.Entertaining, educational and the depiction of a golden age for the US and Americans, the best in its civilisation which was set to change in the Post Clinton era.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	&quot;Each of us is bound by a different covenant.  Each of us seeks truth in our own way.  Each of us, scientist, priest, spiritualist, agnostic, looks for answers that define our existance.  It is the quest, the journey, that each of us shares with one another.&quot;Contact is the story of Eleanor Ann Arroway (Ellie, for short) and her individual, life-long quest to seek answers to the questions &quot;Who are we? Why are we here?&quot;  She seeks answers as a radio-astronomer, heading up a division of S.E.T.I. ((The)Search (for) Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) at Aracebo, and later at the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico.  Her search, which spans many years of her adult, professional life, lead her to the discovery of a radio signal from Vega, a star roughly 4 light-years from Earth.What unfolds in this epic story, originally written by Carl Sagan, reaches far beyond the realm of an average science fiction film.  It is the story of a woman, whose faith in science leaves her with more questions then it answers.  It is the story of a man, torn between the love of a woman, and the faith of the religious covenant he has dedicated his life to.  It is the story of a government, at once skeptical and manipulative, attempting to dictate the actions of a discovery that really belongs to the world.  And, ultimately, it is the story of each of us; of anyone who has ever asked the big questions:  &quot;Who are we?  Why are we here?&quot;Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starring Jodie Forster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skeritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett and John Hurt, and featuring an incredible soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, this movie, which runs a little over 2 hours is absolutely well worth the time.  It is a story of contact with extra-terrestrials, but also much more, it is a story of contact with ourselves, and the values, beliefs, and covenants we hold most dear.	5.0	This Movie Makes &quot;Contact&quot; On Many Levels	2003-09-18	3	3	0

And when it comes to sci/fi, dramas no movie does it quite like Contact. It Is one of my all time favorite movies.  Robert Zemeckis directs a movie for the ages and Jodi Foster sells this magical ride through space and time better then anyone could. If you are looking for a movie with a great story, plot twists and a great supporting cast look no futher.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AMPJ6H2OEA49B	Scott Ox.	What I love about Contact most, is the imagination.  Without giving anything away, let's just say that it's a ride containing different periods of struggle, persistence and success... even if that success is sometimes limited.  Also, if you're expecting &#34;little green men&#34; from this, you'll be sorely disappointed.  This is a look at one possibility for contact through educated and creative eyes.Jodie Foster as Ellie is spot on for what I'd hope a passionate, atheist, scientist, protagonist would be.  She's stubborn at times when confronting McConaughey's religious character, making her both lovable and frustrating simultaneously.  In the end, regardless of her beliefs, you can't help but to admire her honesty... and the fact that despite having the opportunity to lie or sell-out multiple times, to get what she wants, she never does.My dislike for the flaws (McConaughey's acting, the radical appearance of the religious zealot, Skerritt's frustratingly opportunistic/exploitative personality etc) are far outweighed by the imagination and excitement the movie contains.  In fact, I believe that a script/film of this scope & type could be a breeding ground for inaccuracies, annoyances and loose ends.  While it certainly has some amount of these, at least the latter was in the movie purposefully. The others aren't so heavy that I didn't enjoy the movie, I was able to ignore them and finish the story... I THINK most would be able to do the same.You certainly have the opportunity to leave the movie with more questions than answers, something I view as increasingly rare for today's films (or maybe I'm just watching the wrong ones).  I'm a big fan of films making me think beyond the minute I leave the theatre, or turn off the TV, but even if you aren't... quite a journey.	4.0	Flawed, but quite a journey	2013-11-27	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A1DUIMS229CQR1	scott welles	"Occasionally in sci-fi movie magazines, you'll see articles like ""Top 10 Women In Science Fiction,"" and it's always the predictable fan-fave list of hot babes kicking the butts of vampires, zombies, robots, etc.  You never see Jodie Foster in ""Contact"" on such lists, and that's a shame.  Why?  Because that would involve an actual WOMAN (an intelligent, mature woman of integrity and subtance, as opposed to a kung-fu sex object on steroids) in an actual SCIENCE FICTION movie (an intelligent, thought-provoking premise, as opposed to yet another action movie in space).Robert Zemeckis made ""Contact"" as a follow-up to his record-breaking, critically acclaimed ""Forrest Gump,"" and the two make an oddly matched pair.  Both are epic stories centered around a single point-of-view character, one the simple man who takes us on a tour of our past, the other a complex woman who leads us into the future.  Foster's performance is easily the equal of Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning turn, but sadly this gem of a film didn't get quite the attention it should.  (Possibly because, like ""The Abyss,"" another classic, it was swallowed up in the midst of too many summer blockbusters.)""Contact"" follows in the footsteps (and the high quality) of both ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" treating its subject of alien intelligence with serious thought: the most plausible aliens ever put on film are the ones we can't quite see.  This leaves us free to use our imaginations -- which far exceed Hollywood's abilities in any event -- but also keeps the focus on the story's most truly important aspect, ourselves and our reactions to the prospect that we are not alone in the universe.Although the story may sound dry on paper -- there are no ray guns, bug-eyed monsters or flesh-eating mutants in this movie -- the pace is never dull, and there's plenty to keep audiences engrossed, including a large amount of sideshow silliness from the world media, some devious government politicking, a chillingly plausible subplot about religious extremists (with Jake Busey, a dead ringer for his dad Gary), and an exasperatingly funny convention of every UFO-loving nutjob in the western hemisphere.The cast is uniformly impressive, with charismatic actors like Angela Bassett, David Morse, Tom Skerritt, and the always enjoyable James Woods.  Stealing the show (and giving us the pleasure of having 2 ""Alien"" veterans in the cast) is John Hurt as a manipulative Howard-Hughes-ish recluse whose scenes are few but played with ""Silence of the Lambs"" intensity and power.  Personally, I'm not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, but he serves well as the pseudo-love-interest who quietly challenges the beliefs of Foster's character and makes her (and us) reexamine her deepest motives.Jodie Foster, however, carries the film's emotional center with aplomb, making herself both admirably resourceful and empathetically flawed in equal amounts.  Her emotionally wounded character is driven to delve into the heart of the universe through strictly scientific methods, yet resists any suggestion of religious faith, realizing only at the end that both are flipsides of the same coin.  Foster allows this conflict within herself to drive the story as much as the global events occurring around her.  (Note, incidentally, the recurring characteristic trait of curling into a protective fetal position while perched on the very edge of something -- a chair, a bed, a porch, a canyon -- and gazing upward and outward even while retreating inward.  Nice touch, Ms. Foster!)The plot is well-developed, with a particularly wicked double-twist ending, and there is some insightful social and philosophical commentary in this movie.  But, for sheer thrills, it also boasts the most exciting climactic sequence I saw that entire year, as Foster's character makes the last walk to embark on the journey to end all journeys.  And frankly, for the summer of '97, that's saying something!(P.S.: Can't let this review go by without a nod to author of the book, Carl Sagan.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	ANEDXRFDZDL18	Serene Night	"Contact is the story of Ellie (Jodi Foster), a tomboyish scientist out to prove that there REALLY is extra-terrestrial life out there. Mathew McConaughey stars as the unconvincing religious scholar Palmer Jones. I found Contact to be slow at first. Once the alien contact was made I found the novel much more interesting. I really enjoyed the slow buildup and the introduction of each new clue to the alien entity.I was rather lukewarm about Palmer as a love interest. He seemed to lack conviction and faded in and out of Ellie's life with no apparent. reason. I also found the religious message to be rather heavy handed.  (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind religious characters, but I hate to be bludgeoned over the head with a message). The whole ""Woman Looks For Aliens and Finds her Faith Instead"" message I could really do without. Also, the meeting with the 'alien' was anticlimactic and  seemed more suited for an episode featuring the star trek holodeck than a big budget film.Overall, I felt Contact was a rather tepid film, that started out great, but failed to deliver the goods. (Oh, and Ellie's hair stylist needs to be fired. The whole hair extension thing looked cheap and really, really fake!) I give this film 3 stars for the excellent promise. But I'm deducting 1 star for Palmer who was a rather weak and uninteresting love interest, and a half star each for the silly religion/science sideshow and the rather slow start."	3.0	Fails to Deliver the Goods....	2005-01-07	11	3	8

However, the war mongering NSA guy, the  new age holyman, and the incredibly self assured scientist are just way too stereotypical to be taken seriously.  Maybe if the characters involved were a bit more real, rather than comical.

I think everyone should see this movie at least once because they don't make them like this anymore.This is a fitting testament to Carl Sagan's optimistic point of view in regard to the cosmos. In his own way he was a religious man although one could argue the other way based on passages in the novel. Carl was just so darned meticulous with his thought processes and Dr Arroway represents an extreme of that process in this regard. She can't believe in God because of all the loss in her life so she sabotages her chances of going on the trip to Vega. The best she can muster is the weak, 'There's not enough data either way. ' and that's all the opening Drumlin needs to yank yet another thing away from her.The acting is top notch here. Jodie Foster does her role proud and everyone around her ditto.

In order to fully understand the poverty of this film adaptation, one needs to know more than a little bit about Carl Sagan. Dr. Sagan was an astronomer with a well thought out and unwavering view of what NASA should be about. He lobbied for the terra-forming of Mars as early as 1972. Four 02 machines, and 25 years, would produce a noticeable atmosphere on the Red planet. Another quarter century would produce an environment still very hostile to humankind, but sophisticated ""space suits"" would enable the few colonists (Engineers, Scientists) working there, to prepare Mars for permanent inhabitants. Mars is rich in gympsum, and thus few tools would be needed to erect permanent structures from the strong yet malleable rock. By the year 2042 - a mere 75 years after the start date - Mars would be able to support human life fairly easily. No special gear or out-fitting would be needed. People could tolerate the atmosphere wearing nothing but ""street clothes"" for several hours a day. People would probably carry a small 02 unit to combat any shortness of breath. Mars would be Earth-like and able to support human life by 2070. Perhaps man will learn from our mistakes on Earth and not rape the planet, or make war.Carl Sagan was also a politician. Genuine and enthusiastic, but not very effective. The scientific community tapped him to argue Evolution vs. Creationism with a team of debaters who trained in San Diego at the Creationism Institute. These debaters rehearsed with an IF-THEN approach to counter anything Sagan said. Sagan tried to bridge the gap between science and religion in a manner respectful to all points of view. He had underestimated the religous zealots, and thus, walked away from these public debates having appeared to be weak, ill-prepared, slow, confusing, and unconvincing. He made the same errors when testifying in front of Congress for additional funds for space exploration. His battles with NASA were highly publicized, and NASA looked as weak as him. He had a love/hate relationship with NASA in that he disagreed with their plans, but understood tha NASA was the only game in town. He died a slow agonizing death shortly before the film came out, and gave it a very tacid thumbs up. For all his love, all his work, he passed having realized none of his funding attempts and was ultimately one of the saddist people of the 20th c.THE FILM: Ellie Arroway (""Sparks"") brought to life by Jodie Foster, never met her mother as she had died at Ellie's birth. Her father died when she was 9. Ellie raced through High School, College, and Graduate school, and turned down Fellowship after Fellowship to devote her life to SETI. There is a lot of poetry here: Ellie's mother dying from childbirth is visualized by the tunnel-like Black Holes she travels through during her personal space odyssey. Her fathers caution that she'll need to take small steps to realize her frontier. And small steps she took during her quest.Ellie and her Research Assistants - one of whom is blind and thus able to hear nuances sighted people may miss - eventually receive radio signals that are sophistcated and repetitive. Not products of randomness. She had resorted to begging Billionaires for funds to continue her effort, and now it was paying off. They had made Contact. A message millions of pages long comes to NASA's computers in the form of unfinished diagrams, symbols of apparent mathematics, and endless blogs of HTML-like instructions. Nothing seems to fit together. A reclusive Billionarre tells Ellie to ""think like a Vegan."" She puts the pages together in a three dimensional format and finds the primer that enables her and the other scientists to read a message, get instructions, from another world.Palmer Joss: this unnecessary token religous character seems to have been inserted itno the film only to provide gratuitous nudity. Played by handsome Matthew Mc Coughnehy, this man of the cloth character serves only to interrupt the seamlessness of the film while spouting profound revelations, and presenting Ellie with a dichotomous love interest. This character sucks.After Congressional inquests during which Ellie is villified for being atheist; after a horrific act of terror by a religous zealot that kills the character nicely played by Tom Skerrit, Ellie becomes the traveler. Propelled through the universe by entering the fore-mentioned tunnels, Ellie meets a person who appears to be her father. The alien admits he has taken the appearence and persona of her father to make it easier on her.""Small steps Sparks. Small steps."" ""This is how its been done for billions of years"". Ellie returns with a story no one believes. A very lo-tech device aboard the capsule confirms her story, but remains a secret. A secret to everyone but Ellie."	4.0	Small Steps Sparks	2005-08-02	10	6	4
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	Somebody once said that good science fiction puts an ordinary situation into a futuristic or scientific backdrop. Contact is a prime example of how to make a good drama in a setting of science and exploration. It's as true an adaptation to Carl Sagan's novel as you can get considering what you have to do to make the events of the book fit into a feature film. They certainly don't skimp on the special effects either. The opening scene alone is beautiful in it's expansiveness. 'The Machine' hey build to do the space exploration thing is awesome to behold. They do a great job portraying the massive scale of it.What really makes Contact a good drama is... well... the drama. You have Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster) dealing with conflict from several fronts in not only the persecution of her profession, but also her own issues with religion and relationships. If you read between the lines you see reasons why she seems to be in denial about God and her relationship with Palmer (Matthew McConaughey). Add a boss stealing her credit, government spooks scrutinizing her, and a life long ambition so close she can taste it and you have a veritable melting pot of reasons for a breakdown. If you take out the alien transmissions and space transports you would still have a good drama.Contact takes a whole different approach in space exploration and alien contact. Contact is not an action film. It's a movie that delves into not only exploration of outer space but also the exploration of human emotions and faith in the unknown. If you're into SETI you're going to love this film. The attention to detail and consistency are really nice. It's about as accurate as you can get to that kind of research.The DVD is not exactly feature-rich. However back when it was made it was considered pretty nice. You get background information on the actors as well as a fair amount of technical notes on the production of the movie as well as the movie's evolution from book to film. There is also a really nice commentary track by the director and producer that is very informative without being boring or distracting. There is a commentary track by Jodie Foster, but I haven't listened to it yet.Contact might not be for everyone. But for those who dream about close encounters with extraterrestrials this movie delivers.	5.0	Carl Sagan would be proud	2006-09-15	6	4	2

SF - yes - but they make you believe it could happen exactly like this (and who knows - it  might...). One of the most interesting facets of this movie is the fact  that it has something that is rarely seen in Hollywood: a female heroine!  Jodie foster brilliantly portrais a woman who is strong, intelligent,  driven, courageous but also sensitive and emotional. Easily the strongest  female character since Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Alien&quot;. The DVD is a  showcase in itself: the 5.1 digital sound is clearly the best in over 100  DVDs I've seen, extremely dynamic (if you have a subwoofer: tie it to the  floor for the &quot;liftoff&quot; and journey parts of the movie or else it  will bounce all across your living room), there are wonderful directional  effects aplenty, the dialogues are crisp and easy to understand and the  score is a beauty, too. For me the highlight are the full-length  commentaries of Jodie Foster and director Zemeckis. They offer interesting  and often humorous first hand insight into the making of this great movie.  You learn a great deal about filmmaking (much more than through any  &quot;making-of&quot; featurette), share toughts, feelings, even doubts of  the people who brought this masterpiece to you and even learn about some  memorable human episodes that happened during the shoot. Last but not least  the image quality is very good, the contrast is high, the tonal balance is  beautiful and the sharpness is way above what VHS could ever offer.

Absolutely no artifacting, no motion blurs which would have been real easy to see for many of the scenes in this movie and no false colors either.  The colors created in post production are simply beautiful to look at and skin tones are spot on.  There were a couple of scenes where the contrast was so good, it was almost like watching it in 3D.  Contrast throughout the entire film is excellent and I do believe this transfer could and should be used as a DEMO worthy disc.  I do not have this film on Standard Def DVD so this review is not a comparison and I can not say whether or how much they did any remastering but the video is just gorgeous.AUDIO....The lossless PCM 5.1 audio shows how much audio editors can do when they put their minds to it.  There is a full usage of both the front and rear stages as well as many scenes of discreet channeling between the rears and front as well as pans of audio all around.  The very first scene will wake up your audio system and let it know it has some work to do.  The LFE channel is not called upon as often but it gets its own workout in many scenes. The dialogue is clean and very transient and transparent.  Audio levels are set properly so you will not have to roller coaster your remote's volume control.  If you know your chapters with this film, the audio is also, totally demo worthy.Extras consisted of making of documentaries cut to individual chapters mostly focusing upon how they created the various composite scenes in the film for special fx.  Also included were two trailers and 3 different commentaries( a touch of overkill IMHO)  Also included was a music only audio track.I bought this film on a lark, hadn't seen it in years but now am very glad I did.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Contact on Blu Ray	2013-06-08	1	1	0

It was a  book I just couldn't put down and one that sticks in my mind as a truly  great story. However I am always skeptical of films made from books, as  they never capture the true essence of the story. This one did not  disappoint though.Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a radio astronomer,  desperately seeking signs of extraterrestrial life in the universe. This  sign eventually manifests itself in the form of the above-mentioned  message.  What follows is a thought provoking journey of love, betrayal and  political intrigue as she fights for the machine to be built and for her  place on the maiden voyage. Her performance is full of enthusiasm and  heartfelt emotion.The DVD is positively brimming with extras including  insights on how certain special effects scenes where created as well as  three (yes THREE! ) audio commentaries from Jodie Foster, the director  Robert Zemeckis and the guys responsible for the special effects. Jodie's  commentary is informative and she puts herself across as a very intelligent  woman. As for picture and sound quality you cannot fault this DVD. The  picture is crisp and flawless while the sound is an audio treat for the  Home Cinema enthusiast. It will put your Dolby Digital amp to the test with  plenty of use of surround sound, especially during the scenes within the  machine. The opening scene with the camera pulling away from Earth will  leave you in awe.In a nutshell this DVD is worth every penny and one  that I will return to again and again.One to show your friends just how  good DVD can be.Steve."	5.0	A Brilliantly Crafted Movie	2000-06-08	95	89	6

It would be rather preposterous to presume that we're the only living thing existed in the whole universe.  As it is so well put in the movie that 'It would be such a waste, wouldn't it?'  This is why I am so fond of Jodie Foster's character in the movie; from a very young age, she is fascinated with the idea of receiving messages from intelligent living thing from outer space.  She has the support from her father but; unfortunately, he died when she is still very young. However, her interest remains unchanged and goes on to pursue her ambition and graduated with a doctorate in her desired field.  She has to go through adverse situations before she got her financial support from a prominent industrialist played by John Hurt.  She finally succeeded in receiving messages from a faraway place.  The messages she received is to build a machine but it is in code that no one can decipher.  Just as the hope of deciphering the blueprint is in vain, the industrialist summons her to his private plane and conveys the decoded chart to her.You can imagine the discovery of this magnitude when made known to the world, what kind of commotion it would create.  From this climatic moment on there is no dull moment. You see the ambitious contest and opportunistic seizure by some scientist to gain recognition and the right to ride in the spacecraft, the wacky religious cultist and his bent on destruction, and all kinds of outlandish demonstrations of human irrational reactions.  In the end Jodie Foster gets to ride the spacecraft.I don't want to spoil the fun of watching the movie yourselves, therefore, I'll leave it right here.  I guess I'm not the only one who got a kick out of the line 'Wanna take a ride' spoken by John Hurt in the movie.  There is one reviewer who put it as his title.Contrary to the famous critic of a worldwide fame weekly magazine who ridiculed the movie as being shallow, I think instead, it is very imaginative and has a profound sense of the unknown.	5.0	THE EVER MYSTERIOUS UNIVERSE	2007-10-28	3	2	1

I will only add my ""two cents"" here.I thought this was a very interesting movie and that it was made believable by the great performance of Jodi Foster. If another actress had tried to pull this off, it might not have worked.This is not your usual ""contact with extraterrestrials"" movie. I think that's refreshing. In most movies with aliens, the aliens are either nice or evil but there is always the usual way the aliens meet us or us them. In this movie, Segan uses a different approach. We get some real science tossed in. Cosmos fans will undoubtedly recognize some of Sagan's lessons scattered here and there. So this is more like science probability than actual science fiction.This is simply a movie that speculates about the events that will occur when humans discover that Earth is not the only planet with life in the cosmos and contact with that life is finally made."	4.0	Very enjoyable	2008-06-02	3	2	1

Forget renting it, find yourself a copy to own.This movie, at least as far as I am concerned, is Robert Zemeckis' best, even better than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.  Let me begin by stating that if your IQ is lower than 100 (or 120 for that matter), you probably won't enjoy it.  Why?  There are indeed no ""aliens"" or ""monsters"" that jump out of the shadows, nor are there big men with big guns that blow them up and cheer ""go back to your home planet, you scum...America rules!!!""  This isn't Star Trek, nor is it your typical cornball ""sci-fi"" flick.  If it were, I wouldn't be reviewing it, because I wouldn't have seen it.  What this movie is is an amazing rendition of one of Carl Sagan's most enthralling and intelligent novels, and it is indeed a fine example of just how good a film based on a work of fiction can be.  What this piece is is a work of art; rather than stimulate our animalistic urges to see ""little green men"" pop out at us with ""plasma rifles,"" like most everything else that's come out of Hollywood since its inception, the ending of the film leaves it up to our imaginations, essentially, to decipher precisely what happened to Ellie (Dr. Elanaor Arroway, the protagonist) during her journey to the galaxy in which the star Vega is contained.  The beginning of this film alone, in which a three-plus minute digression from our planet through seemingly trillions of miles of the universe takes place, was enough to hook me.  This film is about not only the endless debate between religion and science, of which Ellie is a firm believer in the latter, but it is about her transformation, more or less, in the end of the film to someone just a little less skeptical...what Zemeckis (and obviously Sagan) was indeed trying to portray in the ending of this film is that there is reason to have ""faith"" in the future, even in these desolate times, and to show us that there just might be more than meets the eye to our existence...and that there may be more than we know, and/or are capable of knowing, to ourselves, our race, and each other and what each of us believes, especially in the face of having no tangible ""proof""...and finally that we are indeed never as ""alone"" as we all feel at one time or another.  A truly unique and masterful film, consistently underrated and panned by critics, most often for its inclusion of a certain ex-president in a couple video clips...give me a break.  Does that really detract from the quality and purpose of the film?  I think not, and to give the film lower marks for it is ludicrous, in my opinion.I am not a religious individual, and am in fact an agnostic.  I could easily envision overtly religious people loathing Jodie's character beginning with the scene of the death of her father, as she hastily denies the support of the religious figure(s) at her father's wake.  However, like I said earlier, the film is by no means out to deny the existence of God or debunk any religion, nor does it attempt to verify these concepts.  It is merely contrasting the two sides of the argument and makes valid points in favor of each.  So, my main point is that this film is so much more than a ""sci-fi"" film (to say that this film doesn't compare to Star Wars or Star Trek is quite absurd; they aren't even honestly in the same genre in the first place, and this film transcends any of that...stuff).  Just give it a chance, and if you disagree, so be it...but I know that it moved me like no other film had in quite some time, and I'm a better person for having seen it, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films, even eight years after its release.

Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. ""Contact"", directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future""), is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us. Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space. It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be. Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them. And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book. It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life: A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.  Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain. But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form. And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is. Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities. There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination. In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.  The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel). Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis. Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film. Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about."	5.0	Contact  (1997)	2006-06-07	9	6	3

However it definitely has the agenda of presenting a world view that shows you cannot be spiritual and believe in science at the same time.  If you are a scientist, you cannot believe in God and if you believe in God you cannot be a good scientist.  Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists believed in God.  Albert Einstein, again one of the greatest scientific thinkers believed in God.

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2V2XRUGEYYCGG	Thomas Glebe	"""Contact"" is the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, and was completed after his early death.  I can imagine Carl having as mixed feelings about this movie as I do, but overall, I think he would've been generally pleased.  However, there are so many things, so many details, and extrapolations in this filmed version which were dealt with so much more satisfying and explanatory in the novel, that I wonder.Generally, ""wonder"" and a sense of ""awe"" at the scope and size and meaning of the universe, and whether or not we are ""all alone"" (as far as technological, advanced, intelligent OTHER civilizations in the cosmos are concerned), or not, is at the heart of this movie.  And considering Hollywood's reluctance to tackle such weighty cosmic matters, overall, this film has to be considered a moderate success.Unfortunately, crucial elements from the novel are simply ignored here or are given lip service at best, and the result is a film which is compelling and eye-candy in some parts, but in the end especially, lacks any solid ground and is overlong and in too many sections, insufficiently explained for the layman/average viewer.  Also, while the beginning of the film is one of the coolest major motion picture beginnings of all time, the payoff and end leave something to be desired.Technically, the film is almost perfect, with great pace, acting, and a mostly intelligent screenplay.  The opening sequence, in which we travel from our own little noisy corner of the universe, zooming out towards our real, rather insignificant and silent place in the greater scheme of things, is amazing.  It's just too bad that the whole film couldn't have kept up that quality.  And the end, in various ways, seems to contradict and/or diminish the same.Having read the novel long ago, I remembered an ending even more cosmic and mind-blowing than that which is exhibited here.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the ending of Sagan's novel, in which the whole question of ""religion"" and ""God"" and the ""cosmos"" is given as compelling an ending as the film's beginning, couldn't really have been ""filmed.""  Perhaps during the production, it was decided that the end of Sagan's novel, really couldn't be visualized with film, so while the movie as a whole is generally satisfying, the end is very disappointing.""Religion"" and humankind's views of such and how they may or may not explain our being and place in the cosmos, play a significant part here, but a more undefined ""belief in a God"" is confused with ""terrestrial"" religious tenets and symbols here.  And the whole government/taxpayer supported SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) ""scientific"" project and ""mission"" is eventually revealed to be nothing much more than just another ""religious"" idea, explored with science and technology and MONEY, instead of meaningless ancient voodoo and superstition.This leads to a confusion between ""faith"" and ""evidence"" which the movie never really addresses.  In a crucial scene, the question is asked, ""You loved your father?  Prove it.""  I'm sure Sagan could've and did (in the book) explain this, but in the film, this is left unanswered unnnecessarily.  As are so many questions and answers, up until the end.Many parts of the film and premise, are just too simple-minded and too much a set-up for easy answers later on, when it all could have been so much more.  And yet, a lot of this I'm sure, will fly light years above most people's heads.  Still, as one who has studied both UFO/ET/Abduction evidence along with that of the continuing mission of SETI, I'd have to call it a draw so far.In the end, the film comes nowhere near the truly mind-expanding conclusions and questions of the novel, but again, perhaps, this was just too much to be put in a Hollywood movie, and may even have been impossible to visualize with mere cinema.  The main problem here is that a very patronizing ending is tacked on where something more in keeping with the general spirit of the novel's original ending, would've been so much better.We are told, in the end, that the traveler's journey and contact with real ET, can somehow be proved beyond faith, with science and human measurement instruments, but besides the temporal moments the traveler spent light years away, the only proof of such, could lay in a 1000 different explanations, including the first one that came to mind.  The traveler could've dreamed it all up, in a split second.  While observers (and human science) recorded it as something more.This is an overall entertaining and intelligent movie, with some great special effects and wonderful music, but its basic premise, that of SETI itself, is flawed in my view, and is never fully and satisfyingly addressed within.  In the beginning, the young girl is told by her father, when asked if there was anyone else out there, ""if not, it would be an awful waste of space.""  Sadly, the end of the movie, refinforces this general idea, but it is as much a ""religious"" idea as is anything the movie preaches against.Space and our universe is big, really, really big.  But size and numbers of planets do not posit some sort of religious idea that life, let alone intelligent life, is somehow ""common"" in the cosmos.  And really, if there were such advanced civilizations, I think a more likely explanation would be that they've already been here for eons, and that primitive ""radio"" signals we might someday receive from them, would've been discovered long ago.  Long before the ""UFO"" phenomenon, long before our technologies, and perhaps beyond the reach and imagination of SETI scientists and researchers, who after all, depend upon money and peer status, for everything they pursue and have the courage to pursue.I would've loved to have read Carl Sagan's review of this film, because in his dying days, a lot of what he seemed to think and say, he seemed to refute, and was strangely contradictory to this pretty but too much shallow rendering of his great novel."	3.0	Good film, could've been great...	2007-02-25	10	5	5

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A4JHEO7H330AF	Tom Brody	"CONTACT stars Jodie Foster as an MIT-trained physicist, Matthew McConaughey as a self-trained ""man of the cloth"" and Jodie's love interest, and Tom Skerritt as the manager of a large-scale astrophysics project.  Smaller parts include Jake Busey as the religeious fanatic who blows up the astrophysics project.  James Woods plays a government official who is skeptical about the results provided by the astrophysics project, but (spoiler alert) who eventually changes his mind.  Angela Bassett plays White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton, who provides routine assistance to Jodie Foster.SUMMARY.  The film starts out with Jodie as a girl.  Her father trains her to monitor signals from space, using amateur electronics equipment.  One day, the father has a heart attack and croaks, leaving Jodie without a dad.  Eventually (fast forward), Jodie is a student at MIT acquiring a Ph.D. in astrophysics.  Years later, she tries to get funding to rent time on a radiotelescope in the desert to monitor signals from outer space.  Eventually, she is granted an audience with a funding agency, but she blows up in anger, because they are not sympathetic to her goals.  But an ""angel"" (angel is the technical term for a venture capitalist who funds projects on his own) steps in and funds her project.  With her project funded, Jodie continues to monitor signals from the radiotelescope in the desert.  John Hurt is one of her co-workers.  Eventually, the team discovers some strange signals that sound like washing machine sounds.  With the aid of computer processing (warning, another spoiler alert), the team discovers that the signals are really plans for building a huge machine.  The machine is an astrophysics gadget that enables the traveler to journey through a wormhole to meet her dead father.  The machine is built at Cape Canaveral.  Tom Skerritt, wanting to steal all of the credit from Jodie Foster, decides that he will be the first to use the machine.  But Jake Busey sneaks inside the facility, disguising himself as a technician, and blows up the whole thing, killing Tom Skerritt. Fortunately, (warning, another spoiler alert), a duplicate machine had been built on a remote island off of the coast of Japan.  Jodie Foster is allowed to take the journey in the machine in Japan.  She travels through space, journeys through a wormhole, and visits with her father on a beach.  When she returns, she is not able to convince anybody of what had happened, because the available evidence suggests that nothing had happened.  However, at the last minute in the movie, data demonstrated that what earthlings had perceived to take place in less than a second, actually represented a few hours of time for Jodie Foster.  The film ends with the the tantalizing realization that what Jodie had experienced had actually come to pass.GREAT LINES.  The screenplay is noted for some great lines.  For example, when Jodie was a girl, her father told her that it would be a waste of space if there was no life out there in the stars.  Years later, during her love affair with Matthew McConaughey, Matthew spontaneously comes up with the same concept, and says the same thing (""it seems like an aweful waste of space"") that her father had said years earlier.  This greatly increases the affinity that Jodie has for Matthew, as one might expect, given Jodie's love for her deceased father.At one point, Jodie is grilled by a large committee, where the issue is whether she should be allowed to journey in the machine.  Three people grill Jodie on the question, ""Do you believe in God?""  This was meant to be a provocative question, and to brand Jodie as an atheist and therefore not adequate to be the first passenger on the space gadget.  Jodie replies, ""I don't believe that there is data either way,"" referring to whether God exists or doesn't exist.  When pressed further on this point, Jodie replies, ""I believe, um, I believe that I've already answered that question.""  A similar dialogue occurs in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, where Mary is asked if she believes the wild stories told by Ted Danson, who plays Gulliver.  Mary refrains from answering that she belives him, but instead answers, ""I belive in him.""At an early point in the movie, Matthew opens up a box of Cracker Jack, and inside is a toy compass, and he gives this to Jodie as a momento.  This particular toy is kept by Jodie, through thick and thin, and it serves as a humble icon that is kept, just as Jodie keeps alive her affection for Matthew.  A toy compass in a Cracker Jack box also makes its appearance in the movie 1941, where actor Slim Pickens quickly swallows the compass so that the Japanese submariners will not be able to use it to find their way.  The common item (Cracker Jack compass) but totally different uses for this item, makes one of the more remarkable footnotes in the history of American cinema.Another amazing part of the script, is where Jodie Foster takes Angela Bassett aside, in order to ask an important question.  But as it turns out, Jodie's question is, ""Where can I get a really great dress?""CONCLUSION.  I liked every moment of this film.  There were no ""dead sequences"" in the middle, meant to use up time.  The film was full of twists and surprises.  The film ends with a few ambiguities, though these ambiguities were intentional.  More than most films, this movie calls for a sequel."	5.0	Great for repeated viewings.  Where's the sequel???	2014-04-11	1	1	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A2NE9XC4XAE5HA	"Tom From NY ""Tom From NY"""	Silly, self-important nonsense masquerading as deep profound Science Fiction.  Jodie Foster plays an utterly humorless and emotionally icebound BUT totally brilliant young woman (a type of role she is becoming tiresomely expert at) who is supposed to be carrying a torch for the appallingly inept Matthew McConaughey.  The lack of chemistry between them makes a significant part of the story rather hard to swallow.  Namely, one can't believe that Foster's walking iceberg has any interest at all in the McConaughey's inane all-purpose guru.This movie is to serious science fiction what a Hallmark card is to Shakespeare.

The story is engaging and it helps you stop and think a little bit about how small we are and what should matter to us.The main thing I didn't like about the movie was the sort of constant battle in it between supposed science and supposed religion; the movie doesn't lean one way or the other in the end (the protagonist for instance starts out very against pure faith, but ends up strongly in favor of it), but throughout it seems to be trying too hard to promote a tension between the two. There wasn't very much character conflict in the plot, I guess, so they had to create something for conflict, and it didn't go very well. The film is also longer than it needed to be, IMHO.Overall, a good movie, and fun trip back to the 90s.

Can you watch a movie more than once and still get something out of it? Can you read a book more than once and get something from it?""Contact"", the movie, seems to meet the criteria for replay value, at least for me. I have seen it possibly a dozen times, and I have enjoyed it every time.There are criticisms that it isn't like the book by Carl Sagan. The same can be said of many movies. I haven't read the book yet, so I cannot address this.What I can address is why I find this movie consistently entertaining and would recommend it.Acting:The actors are all pretty convincing and do a memorable job.Jodi Foster carries the film as Ellie Arroway with believability and a great humanity. In the scene where she is about to launch in the ""machine"", she shows a considerable amount of nervousness and even fear. Given the character's situation, I'd say, YES! I'd be scared out of my mind! It wouldn't stop me, but I'd still be scared. She also shows vulnerability as her character gets tossed over by political rivals, especially the Tom Skerritt character.Tom Skerritt delivers a fine performance as the smarmy intellectual uber scientist David Drumlin who seems to have made it is personal quest to defeat Jodi Foster's character at every turn. He is so unlikeable, just short of being a villain.Matthew McConaughey plays Palmer Joss with excellent patience and sensitivity. His sexual interest in Arroway is obvious from the start, and when she basically abandons him early in the film, he doesn't really hold it against her. It does come as a surprise when during the selection hearings for who is to go visit the aliens, he sidewinds her. Fortunately, the script is sympathetic enough to have him explain his real motivations were selfish, he wants her to stay around as his love interest, even though she is often not there for him.John Hurt as S.R. Hadden is a delight. He's confident and a real ""angel"" in the financial sense. He supports Ellie brilliantly throughout the film, and he has a cynicism that is fun to watch.The other actors ( and there are many!) are also very good and deliver fine and believable performances.The film is worth a look just for their acting craft.Another plus in the movie is the musical score by Alan Silvestri. He really knows how to make the most of the simplest melodies, and his score is understated, gentle and just wonderful to hear.Finally, the sets and graphics are very good to excellent. The design of the 'machine' is suitably pseudo scientific and looks serious enough, and the outer space scenes are top notch. In this movie, getting there really is half the fun!For all these reasons, the film is very entertaining.Now, as to the ""message"".Yes, the movie does try to pit science against religion, or vice versa. It's an argument that is getting so old it is almost cliche. No one seems to ever try the middle of the road where the two can work together, religion reveals mystery, science attempts to explain mystery.And it is because of the all black/white polarization that some of the plot and dialog miss the boat for me.I like the line where Palmer asks Ellie, ""Did you love your father, prove it."" It is a valid argument because love is something that pure scientific inquiry cannot yet prove or measure or replicate. It is a mystery. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.There is a point in the film where during the selection process, they ask Ellie if she believes in God. Of course, she has to hem and haw and finally say she cannot prove God. So, of course, she is disqualified because ""95% of the population of the Earth do believe in God"".If the film wasn't trying to make such an antagonistic argument between science and religion, it could have had Ellie respond in the most logical way. She could have responded: ""I personally do not because I cannot find proof to my satisfaction. However, as a representative of the people of Earth, I would tell the aliens that 95% of humanity does believe in a God. And as a scientist, I would ask them, what they believe."" The script doesn't allow this common sense response, and it was a bit disappointing.The faith vs. evidence argument is played out again after Ellie has returned from her journey and cannot prove that she has been anywhere. The film only leaves us with a question about 18 hours of static on the video recording device. However, what happened to the science here?If it seems like Ellie didn't go anywhere, and the 'machine' is still working just fine, why not send her or someone else on another trip? In other words, do what scientists are supposed to do, replicate the experiment. How they missed this is beyond me. It seemed so obvious!Conclusion:In spite of the muddy message of the movie, it is very well produced, well acted, has great sets and shows considerable restraint for a scifi movie. It is not an 'action thriller', it is thought provoking. It has great music and is an overall enjoyable experience. The 'message' and philosophical arguments are a bit too one dimensional to really hold weight, and the use of common sense would have made it a better script, but it wouldn't have the political and emotional tug that they got out of it. Still, its a movie I can watch over and over and still enjoy.That to me, is the sign of a truly good film."	5.0	Very Well Crafted and Entertaining Film	2013-03-02	2	1	1

You can almost believe that such conversation actually happened, if a bit dramatised.  Several visual sequences are stunning, although I have no idea whether special effects broke any ground.  What I like best in visual effects are the rhythm and montage.  Several unforgettable cuts literally take my breath away.The romance between the priest and Jodie's character is a bit artificial nearly from the beginning to the end, despite the excellent depiction of their conflict and resolution.  Although the narrative of the movie is not tied to this romance, a great deal of dialogues do derive from the relationship.  So this is a rather big defect.  The scene in the remote galaxy also feels forced and dry.  I'd rather it be shortened to allow development of her relationship.  Another weak story is the farce around &#34;International Selection Committee.&#34;  There is nothing international in the committee, but lots of important drama have to come from that story.  Since the rest of &#34;flying machine&#34; story is so U.S. centric, it may as well show chauvinism all the way through.Overall, the movies is beautifully presented.	4.0	Beautiful humanity	2012-12-31	0	0	0

0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"An exceptional looking Blu-ray, ""Contact"" tells the story of Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster)and the impact that her discovery of a message from an alien race impacts society. In essence ""Contact"" acts as both a literal title and a pun--the film is about contact between science and faith, between a woman who loses her family at a young age trying to reconnect in some little way with what's she lost and her unending faith that she will discover there IS life out there.Working with authors Carl Sagan and Anne Druyan director Robert Zemeckis has refashioned the tale adding the character of David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit)as an adversary who dogs Ellie every step of the way pushing her further and further away from her opportunity to embrace her discovery. Featuring a terrific supporting cast ""Contact"" focuses more on the humanity rather than the hardware but deals with a number of complex themes in the process. Rather than focusing on a team that goes to meet the Vegans Zemeckis and screenwriters James V. Hart & Michael Goldberg elect to make one person go throwing the finale into question--again, it comes down to a matter of faith and Ellie believes.The Blu-ray has all of the original extras that were on the 1997 DVD. While the transfer looks extremely good with nice detail, color and clarity. It appears to be digitally scrubbed though with a bit too much digital noise reduction used reducing the level of the detail in the process. Nevertheless, it does blow away the original DVD by leaps and bounds particularly the opening sequence as we look at the Earth following the radio waves as they leave our planet moving further and further away from our solar system.""Contact"" is a very good if flawed film. The faith vs. science themes that were so prevelent in Sagan's book are still here but presented in a bit of a muddled fashion. There's zero chemistry on screen between Foster and McConaughey. David Morse brings a strong, quiet presence to his role as Ellie's father. The ending although it is touching and does provide a sense of closure (and while it does make sense in many respects) may feel like a cheat to some. I thought it worked quite well within the context of the film. Some of the story elements like the subplot involving a terrorist attack on the ""Machine"" and NASA are deftly handled--they could have been blown up (pardon the pun)into soap opera spectacle but Zemeckis plays it low-key. The other flaw is the time compression from discovery to execution; while it was essential to keeping the film moving forward it also makes everything seem as it it happens rather quickly.Over all this is a exceptionally good looking Blu-ray and the fact that Warner has ported over all the DVD extras (something that many studios have chosen not to do)is a big plus as well. Highly recommended."	4.0	Secret messages	2009-10-21	2	2	0
0790733226	Contact (Snap Case)	A3VOW473J03GOB	"Wayne ""waynesworld857"""	Adapted with the help of famous astronomer Carl Sagan from his book of the same title, CONTACT brilliantly brings to life the fictional story of astro-physicist Ellie Arroway (Foster) whose passion for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is matched only by her resoursefulness. She is instilled with a sense of wonder about the universe by her adoring father, a widower raising her alone until his untimely death when Ellie is only 9. She finds no comfort in the words of the minister who advises that she must accept his death as God's will. As an adult, she chooses to eschew religion and devotes her energies to the pursuit of science. When she meets and is attracted to Palmer Joss (McConaughey), a religious scholar, there is a clash over issues of faith.The plot revolves around  contact with an intelligent civilization many light years away that transmits blueprints for a machine of unknown purpose. But the strength of the story is the very well developed central character and Jody Foster's emotional portrayal of her (and Jena Malone does a wonderful job as the young Ellie). The story's lofty contemplations on faith vs. science and the implications for our planet of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence lift this film above most other sci-fi. It also contains one of my favorite examples of imaginative cinematography. In a scene in which 9 yr. old Ellie discovers her father unconscious on the 1st floor, she races upstairs to get his medicine from the bathroom. In one continuous shot the camera tracks just ahead of and looking back at Ellie, from the 1st floor, up the stairs, turns down a hallway and into the bathroom. When she reaches for the medicine cabinet, you see that you have been looking into the reflection of the cabinet mirror the whole time. But of course, there is no way you could literally see Ellie's reflection in that mirror from the start of the shot, which began at the bottom of the stairs.	4.0	Intelligent Sci-Fi	2003-10-06	2	2	0

Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (""Contact"" came out the summer of '97 and ""Armageddon"" a year later). Toss in some elements of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)"" and -- voila -- you have ""Contact."" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: ""Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.The film runs two and a half hours.GRADE: B"	4.0	Science and religion in wedded bliss	2013-02-20	1	1	0
