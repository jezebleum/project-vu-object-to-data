B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AG9HMWSZPW3H4	13 year old	I first found out about his movie nearly two years before its release. When i read the plot to it and saw the director i knew it would be a great movie. I saw it the fist day because i could not wait any longer to see. After it was over i realized it was worth the wait. This is one of speilbergs best. Although it was very long it still kept me interested throughout the entire movie. This movie deserves to win best picture at the academy awards and it wasnt even nominated. I recomend any spielberg fan to buy this movie. Trust me its worth the money.	5.0	The best movie of 2001 and one of speilbergs best	2002-03-02	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A5KI6YH8EJV3C	"50 Somethin' Pop Pundit ""Old school arbiter o..."	If you grew up without a mother, then this picture breaks your heart and it sticks with you forever. It's the ageless, timeless, evergreen Howard Hughes recluse selection that you wanna watch in your old age or on into eternity. It's oh so perfectly subtle and intellectually sentimental. This was Kubrick's baby. It has his cryptic provocative style written in every frame. Most disillusioned reviewers and critics seem to forget that. Master Spielberg pulled off a cinematic magic trick as midwife lensman translating the late fellow giant's vision. In effect, the special effects melodrama foil combo make it the greatest sci-fi flick of all time.This awe inspiring film appeals in tone, content and scope to the broken home hearts of motherless children as well as those who find a special humanity, or dare I say wistfulness, in the futility of eternal unrealized dreams or wishes. In the lost and found fable, cast wise Frances O'Connor should have won an Oscar, since her angelic presence is what makes the movie work on a gut level. Those who won't allow art cinema a full range of emotion just want fast action or care free happiness in film when entertainment reality requires a fair balance to make us human as in real life. And in doing that, AI will never be surpassed.	5.0	Cinematic sci-fi therapy for the motherless child in us all...	2011-07-15	3	2	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2MAMTOR0SLF6G	Aaron C. Stewart	Stunning and captivating are two words I'd use cautiosly in describing this movie.  Captivating in waiting for the credits to roll, and stunning that it took them 2 1/2 hours to get that far.A highly produced movie which lacked any real substance beyond a set of &quot;that's enough for the audience to figure out what's going on&quot; style clues, it was disappointing to see great acting talent go to waste on something as poorly constructed as this.If you want to be unpleasantly awoken to what the general public will buy on the big screen, see this movie.  If you want to maintain a happy outlook on how this movie is, and see what they want you to believe, wait for the trailer to appear on TV, tape it, and watch it over and over.  The most interesting parts are there anyway.	2.0	Spoonfed detritus.	2001-07-01	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2GOAEF0ZRNG13	Aaron	A.I. is just that.  So far it's the only film this year that I really want to see again.  It's a pretty ambitious and risky film for a summer release, and that's GREAT.  Spielberg (directing with the ghost of Kubrick right along side him)has fashioned a dazzling and challenging view of the future.  I simply do not want to give anything away about this film, just go see it.  I'm really amazed how dark the film is considering Spielberg's rep (perhaps the Kubrick influence).  I love his post Schindler's List work.  He's a more complex filmmaker who is finally allowing some pessimism into his viewpoint.  The ideas presented in A.I. are quite provacative (the film definetly would have fit quite nicely into Kubrick's canon).  The production design and effects work are nothing less than staggering, the man simply has the BEST people working for him.  And little Haley Joel just became the front runner for Best Actor this year!!!  As for the ending, WOW!! An amazing film, I really cant see anything this fall topping this.	5.0	The Best American Film of the Year So Far!	2001-06-30	11	5	6
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2PVITFJ6UJG2C	Aaron	"I thought after 30 minutes or so the movie would pick up...It didn't.  In fact, it drags on and on with scene after scene of pointlessness.  Just when you think a plot is starting to develop, off you go to another meaningless scene.I expected it to be delightful, immersive, and futuristic.  But, you spend about 90% of the movie in depressing scenery...Eveything in the movie takes place at night or in the dark.  Heck, I felt depressed and sick to my stomach after watching it.And it's too bad that the movie is so boring that you have no chance to appreciate the special effects.

But in the end it is just so much of the same material done again and again and again. Let's face it even Star Trek has done the moral aspect of androids with Data and even had comments relating to that little wooden boy.There is just nothing new at all in this film. Spielberg tries to convince us how imaginative this film is. But it isn't. Just rehashed old material put in a sci-fi setting. And not a very believeable one at that.A small bottle of perfume is considered irreplaceable yet some of the meals the people consume are large, and they made reference to food being a limited resource. Fooey.It really could have been something good. But just fails. It gets 1 star for special effects were are quite good and 1 star for the robot boy david. If he had played Anakin Skywalker then not only would it have been a better film, but it may even have been believeable that the boy would become Vader.Give this one a miss. It is all hype and all talk. They didn't want to give anything away because they knew it was old material. Save your money, watch bicentenial man or read I, Robot.	2.0	It's just a great big yawner.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2RQUPLNU3AGKC	Aaron Snyder	Ok, the film starts out alittle slow and the relationship between David and his family seems forced and not too believable at first, but once this film gets started it really becomes something special.  This is one of the strangest and best films I have ever seen.  It's the most touching film I've seen since Titanic, Haley Joel Osmond's performance was magnificant.  His performance along with the bizarre atmosphere Steven Spielberg presents gives the viewer no choice but to be captivated by this tale.  The Teddy Bear is also a wonderful part of this film.  On the technical side, the special effects are outstanding, the best CGI I think I've seen.  I thought it was alot more believable than the CGI in Star Wars Episode I.  This is a teriffic and unique movie, the best I've seen in a long time.	5.0	Outstanding!  A beautiful film!	2001-06-30	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2QQ6HYP2SGQW9	Aaron Strader	"A fine swan song to supplant Eyes Wide Shut, this idea of Kubrick's was a labor of love.  Work for it carried on for close to 20 years going through many revisions and ideas.  When his death came to pass, with Kubrick's wife's blessing, Spielberg (a constant contributor to Kubrick's process with the film) got the go ahead to put his spin on what Kubrick had done up to that point.  Based on a short story called ""Do Robots dream of Electric Sheep?"" the tale is that of a sentient robot boy who wants nothing more than to love his adopted mother.  With little leaked from the set of the film, not many people knew what to expect from this film, and suprisingly, the reaction was mixed.  People enjoyed his take on ""Pinochicco"", while others didn't get it and felt like they were watching a ...  Granted the ending feels very out of place with the rest of the film, it's very touching and makes you realize that there's no one you can love more than your parents.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQ1QFAB8LY37V	A Customer	"When you consider the fact that this movie has generated over 980 reviews; it can be deduced that Spielberg has crafted a film truly worthy of Kubrick's name. You may hate it, you may love it, you may compose a page worth of ALL CAPs commentary about it, but you won't be able to ignore it. It's quite refreshing to know that at least 980 people were able to pay attention for 145 minutes watching a movie that contains no nudity. For that I have to give Spielberg credit, since even Kubrick couldn't manage to maintain viewer interest without the occasion breast cameo.Since the purpose of a review is summation and judgement, I'll be brief and try to give the reader a basis for either enjoying this movie on their own, or waiting till it's forced on them during a plane flight.In short, the main focus is love; or more correctly the concept of being able to love forever and ever.The story follows the robot David (Haley Joel Osment) as he attempts to regain the love of his mother (Frances O'Connor), to whom he has been forever imprinted.David is the experiment of his creator (William Hurt), who creates a robot capable of love to determine if humans can return that love. The film's environment is a world slowly freezing from an apparent lack of love. Humans have become so technological that they have forgotten how to love themselves, each other, and their own planet. Children are raised with robot companions to love, while sex robots provide an artificial cyber-love for adults. The next step is a robot child who can be electronically imprinted to ""love"" his mother. David's mother returns his love at first, but that love fades when her biological son returns home. It's roughly the same situation of the family pet after the children are born, and Rover is no longer tolerated in the house.Since David's imprinting is not reversible, his love can only be terminated by total disassembly or a complete discharge of his batteries (which can take a thousand years, more or less, your mileage may vary). Rather than face the hard reality of David's destruction, Mom decides to set David free in the wilderness.This begins Act II, where David wanders through a Kubrick-colored world as Spielberg attempts to translate his dead friend's message to today's comatose audience. We meet cast off robots, who wander the planet hiding from humans while attempting to maintain their failing mechanical bodies. We also meet the Flesh Fair, a nomadic sideshow where discarded robots are tortured and destroyed. Like ancient primitives sacrificing their animals, the Flesh Fair leaders seek to ""save"" the human race with their barbaric actions. While visually entertaining, this episode loses a lot to Spielberg's translation, becoming no more than a fiery Klan meeting with PT Barnum as the ringleader. David is befriended by Joe (Jude Law), a sex robot, who attempts to help him in his quest. Joe leads David to Rouge City (Spielberg's neon homage to Kubrick), where clues ultimately lead David back to his creator. In the end David is frozen, as his loveless world grows too cold to support his artificial body.With that, the Kubrick ends, and out pops Spielberg for the big sloppy finish. Future robots thaw David, recharge him, and give him one last day with mother. Not surprisingly, mom professes her enduring love for David. But, given that she only exists for one day, it's a Pyric victory for our hero. As his mom dies, David realizes that his quest for eternal love has ended, and he quietly shuts himself down.In my opinion, this film is a serene river that hides a brutal undercurrent. Spielberg's sugar sweet coating blends with Kubrick's knife sharp sarcasm in an occasionally unsettling manner. The transitions between scenes are turbulent, and often characters disappear with no explanation. The film's depiction of violence can be summed up using the Mafia analogy ""Death often comes from men with smiling faces"".If you dislike Spielberg or Kubrick, then you will hate this movie. Or conversely, if you idolize either filmmaker, then you may also dislike this film. The concepts and emotions can be difficult to digest, and often leave more questions than answers. In short, I recommend you view it in order to formulate your own opinion. Don't be swayed by the negative or positive reviews. This film will effect some sort of emotional response from everyone who takes the time to properly explore it. It is through discussion of these emotions that we ultimately begin to understand and develop compassion for others and ourselves.  As for love, well according to this story, it happens, but not forever."	4.0	My humble opinion	2002-07-23	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A69ORVVZQ6BJN	A Customer	In my book, A.I. was a huge disappointment. Not to say that I don't recommend it, because it is a very interesting film. But when the only message you take away from the film is that &quot;People Are Bad, Mean, and Selfish,&quot; how uplifting are you going to feel after you watch it.Many claim that the film teachs us about the dangers of technology, and if we make it too realistic, if we program machines to love us, can we love them back? The anwser the film gives is no, but you're asking the wrong question.Haley Joel Osment's David was programed to love Monica, so when Monica decided she didn't want to love him anymore, David HAD to keep loving her. He didn't have a choice in the matter, because that was his programing. He never felt what it was like to be a human, because he could do nothing but try to find Monica. It's not about the robot's love, because he never really loved her. He was TOLD to love her.Everything else in A.I. revolves around this, but if we're suppose to care about David the robot, why couldn't David had actually cared about Monica. Finding her was only to complete a task in his programming, and would not actually give him any emotional pleasure.David was emotionally disconnected from Monica, and I was emotionally disconnected from this film.	2.0	When All is Said and Done, We've Learned Nothing	2002-01-11	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AK4CRJC8OG7FN	A Customer	This may well be the last big-budget art film we ever see, folks. Word of mouth is killing it, but Hollywood has itself to blame -- and Spielberg can take some of the blame too. We all &quot;want to be entertained&quot;, but there was a time when this didn't mean leaving your entire brain at home. A satisfying movie was one that engaged all, or most, of your faculties, albeit pleasurably. That's all different now. The industry has spent the years since Jaws, Star Wars and Rocky, and particularly the last decade, weaning American audiences off films that don't flatter them, don't satisfy their cravings for power and sex fantasies, don't reinforce their disgust toward people less clever or fashionable, don't leave their point of view unchallenged, and don't always leave them cheerful, triumphant, &quot;uplifted&quot;, and feeling as hip as anybody else. I just read a letter-to-the-editor saying A.I. was the worst film the letter-writer had ever seen, because it left her feeling disturbed; it ripped her heart out and left it lying there. Well, how much of the world's cinema could this woman not enjoy? Chinatown, Citizen Kane, Midnight Cowboy, Blade Runner, La Dolce Vita, The Parallax View, Black Narcissus, Papillon, Raging Bull, in fact nearly anything by Stanley Kubrick, Nicolas Roeg, Ken Russell, Orson Welles, David Lynch, Franklin J. Schaffner, Sam Fuller, Ingmar Bergman, half of Shakespeare's output. A.I. is NOT McDonald's moviemaking!! It does not deliver on cliche' payoffs, it doesn't connect all the dots for you, it requires you to put two and two together occasionally. It doesn't traffic in cheap irony, phony uplift, contrived suspense, or sugarcoated homilies delivered as profound truths. It is for those with the palate for a richer diet of subtler flavors. It is fresh. For those who feel it doesn't develop any of its ideas but always takes the wrong course, realize that this is a picaresque, an innocent's (or semi-innocent's) journey through a world of rogues and vagabonds -- a genre older than Voltaire's Candide, and as recent as the re-release of Apocalypse Now. For those who think it's aliens at the end, note the astonishment of those strange beings that David has been in contact with LIVING things -- meaning they themselves aren't living, so must be robots. Our creations will inherit the earth. This conclusion was as Kubrick intended, even to the final virtual recreation of Monica, although Kubrick intended to show her fading out of existence before David's eyes. Spielberg elects to spare us this, though we know it will happen. For those who feel it makes no point, but add that it manipulates your emotions with the torments of a little boy, let me say that IS the point: for he is NOT a boy, but a machine; if you feel any emotion for this machine because it RESEMBLES or ACTS LIKE a boy, that IS the entire point: what is it you are actually responding to? To the reality, or to certain surface characteristics? Doesn't it strike you that this is the foundation of ALL manipulation and deception? Note that this is raised during the flesh fair by the robot-hunter, who tells the audience they are being manipulated by a robot designed to appeal to their emotions. He is quite correct; but his response is to destroy it for its very deceitfulness. The crowd takes the appearance for the reality and attacks the robot-hunter for (apparently) endangering a real boy. But this robot is designed to manipulate its owners not for any sinister purpose, but solely so that they may love one another. THIS IS WHAT HUMANS ARE ALSO BUILT TO DO! It's been said that if babies and toddlers weren't so cute, they would have been destroyed by their parents millennia ago and the race would be extinct. But we are programmed as thoroughly and deeply as David the robot: note what we respond to. Roger Ebert, on the other hand, has programmed himself to make other distinctions, and feels nothing for David BECAUSE he's a machine. Roger was not manipulated, and this says something about him. The point of the film is NOT what robots may be able to do, but the limitations of human beings. We are constantly reminded of human programming. We watch a female robot put on her makeup in the beginning, then we see Monica -- putting on her makeup. She grieves for her son, but we first see him as unconscious as a doll in cryogenic suspension; then we see him brought home, mother all joyful -- still inert, with tubes sticking out of him. Later, he informs David that &quot;I'm real&quot; -- and rises to walk on electronic leg braces, like a bionic cyborg. In the flesh fair, people respond to the apparent humanity of robots with hatred, to the apparent humanity of a boy-robot with sympathy. No surprise; we adore cute children but regard adult strangers with suspicion,and perhaps hostility. Evolutionary programming? If you think our capacity to learn and alter our &quot;programming&quot; distinguishes us, be reminded that artificial intelligence systems are designed to do just that. Finally, if David's quest is too monotonously one-dimensional, I ask, have you never met an obsessive?  This film is not being given a fair shake by many critics, and even by many of its supporters. There is more here than meets the eye, but many of us have allowed Hollywood to program us to respond positively only to movies with certain characteristics. If you think it's long and slow, could you sit through 2001: A Space Odyssey or Barry Lyndon or Lawrence of Arabia? If you think it's disturbing, didn't you feel that way watching Blade Runner (which also failed on its initial release)? This film will be revisited someday, and you can help. Give it another look. My wife and I are going to see it for a fourth time tonight. We're not fanatics, and the film is not perfect; but it is layered and subtle (unusual for Spielberg), and grows on you.	4.0	Unexpected and misunderstood - see it again!	2001-08-04	431	378	53

For the past year I have been wringing my hands in anticipation for A.I., knowing that with Spielberg at the helm of a Kubrick project would atleast prove to be a noble experience. I am a hardcore spielberg fan, make or brake, win or loose. A.I., is such a beautiful film.The graphics are seamless, in both the computer and real world. You see a new vision of Earth after the melting of the Polar Ice caps, due to Global warming...what else. (see Waterworld for a butchered-dirty version of this idea).I enjoyed it. And I think Spielberg did too. But what happens when you get two great, but entirely different visions of the same project: an immediate shortcoming. Two visions means two beginnings, middles, and ends, and there lies the problem. Haley Joel Osment, doesn't blink the entire film. That alone shows his committment to character. A.I. has its own pace and rightly so, because there are many characters and ideas in the mix. I just don't know...I am debating as I type. What was missing?I guess just enjoy it. Allow yourself an open mind and realize that you will not leave the theater with a frozen smile on your face. A.I. is just what it is. A story about a creation that can love, and all it desires is love in return. He encounters several odd characters, some helpful, some deadly. I wasn't let down, simply because I knew that there were two terrific director's speaking at the same time, and I was going to see the result. Maybe, the thing that was missing was already there, but there was just too much of it to see.	4.0	transendental: the constant desire to better yourself.	2001-07-15	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3GDUA1KO6SGRX	Adam Kelley	"What makes this film so amazing is not the special effects or the gee-wiz imagery, or even the plot line.  As with many Kubrick films, they're not really for ""entertainment"" but to provoke thought.  The title of the film, A.I. is the first question that Kubrick asks - is it really possible to create intelligence?  If so, then define what intelligence means.  Is there more to intelligence than simply logical reasoning?  Are emotions somehow part of intelligence?  Of course, you the viewer, must answer those questions.And in the end, think about what the aliens are trying to do, and what they say.  Or rather, what is Kubrick really saying.  Is it that he believes that humanity/intelligence, no matter how sophisticated technology becomes, can ever be duplicated or created?  Does the soul have something to do with intelligence?  Again, you must answer that within your own definition of intelligence.I can see why so many people disliked A.I.  They spent $9 to be entertained, and instead found themselves in a college philosophy class.  If you're the type of person that likes to sit back and be entertained, than this movie is probably not worth your time nor money.  If you like thought provoking films, than this is a typical Kubrick film, with the warm fuzzy Spielberg throw in for extra measure.There is so much more to this movie than I can write about in 1,000 words.  If you've already seen it and hated it, perhaps you'll spend the $5 to rent it and take the time to really understand what the film is saying and asking.  It really is an interesting piece of work."	5.0	Much deeper than many here may have you believe	2002-02-18	7	6	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2S166WSCFIFP5	"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com"""	Kubrick was one of the greatest filmmakers we've had. He made such classics as Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Lolita, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. He had his bad movies, like Barry Lyndon. And Eyes Wide Shut, which was a horrible movie to end up being his last. And he spent years planning on A.I. Two stinkers in a row, but to be fair, he wanted Spielberg to direct it and himself produce it. He felt it was more alon the lines of a Spielberg movie. And in a way he was right. There are many problems though. One is that Spielberg tried to make it a 'Kubrick' movie, which he can't do. It didn't have the dark humor or Strangelove, the coldness of 2001, or the creepiness of A Clockwork Orange. Nor was this movie cutting edge like Kubrick's work is (as he ages, Spielberg relies more and more on special effects and less on story). Second is that stories along this line never seem to quite work (see Bicentennial Man). The story is good on the page, but doesn't transfer well to the screen. And nobody can quite pull off acting human, but not-quite-human--the way a robot would. Not even an accomplished actor could do it, much less Jude Law. The story just wasn't great. I will say that the look of the film was impressive. The costumes, makeup, set pieces, and special effects made it a nice looking movie. All flash, no substance. It didn't even try to tackle the moral and ethical issues of a robot who has feelings. And the ending...well, the last 20 minutes of the movie was dull and should have been removed.Thank god there is no commentary track, because I don't think I could have watched it a second time, at least not without months of space in between. The reason I gave the dvd three stars was a little to do with the film, but as a dvd it really covers the process of making the movie. Everything involved. And for the Kubrick scholar, it's a good dvd to have because a lot of time is spent discussing him. I say pass on this movie unless you are a film scholar. And even then, it's the extras and not the movie that makes it valuable.	3.0	bad way to end	2003-01-26	1	1	0

This is an outrageous offence to any kind of intelligence, Kubrick would be dissapointed if he had to see what has been done in such a hurry with so little care to a project he had worked on for more then ten years.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3P4JLLM73ETAX	agentdoubl02	I love Haley Joel Osment. I love Jude Law. And I consider Stanley Kubrick to be one of the most creative and brilliant Directors of all time but I can't fathom why A.I. was passed onto Spielberg. Perhaps with Kubrick's talents the movie would have been more interesting but with Spielberg talent it just has good film technology.The movie has some great illuminate visuals that keep you watching. The graphics in the film where very well done and do not appear fake.However that is where the compliments end.A.I. essentially is the story of Pinnochio set in the future. The beginning of the movie is good.It focuses on a family adjusting to having a live in mecca (mechanical person).However the idea of someone replacing their child with one that will not grow is where the faults in the screenplay begin. How could parents accept a robot child that doesn't even blink,eat or bleed (however he can apparently breathe) which are normal,necessary and defining funtions of most living things and all humans.Furthermore, the family's real son becomes evil and vindictive towards the mechanical child. The living childs anger seemed unnecessary and appeared to be no more than a catalyst for the mechanical childs journey.The rest of the film, which seemed to me to be an eternity, centered around the mechanical child trying to become a real boy and searching for the blue fairy, the character which made Pinnochio a real boy.Everything in the story seems forced. Jude Law's character seems to be thrown into the film for no reason but as another catalyst. In this case, to lead Haley's character to the blue fairy after which Law's character disappears. It seemed that the screen writers couldn't find a way to make it believable that the child character could travel on his own so they threw in a chance meeting so the child could meet with an adult. I suppose this was to show how human like he was because he needed the care of an adult however the joining of the characters seemed awkward and too fantastic.Because 95% of the movie focuses on the journey, the movie soon becomes a picture with drying paint as it's plot line. I can't tell you how many times I checked to see when it would end. I believe in always finishing a movie but this one was hard to swallow. It was just boring. You stopped caring whether or not he got home early in the film because everything was forced at you so violently, there was never room for you to develop your own feelings. The idea of him being like any real child was drilled into your head instead of allowing you to observe and draw your own conclusion.The ending was absolutely horrendous and should have been cut out plain and simply!!! !!Perhaps the intentions where to make an Alice in Wonderland type film where the character meets many fantastic characters that effect the journey. However if this was intended to be a fairy tale, there should not have been human suffering and anger or the idea of big business men from New York taking over the world. That is all to real.In my opinion this movie was nothing more than a bunch of good ideas thrown into a film that absolutely could not connect the ideas so they used the classic road trip idea.You don't get more orignal than that??!!	1.0	A complete bore	2002-07-18	7	3	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFHM00NLAEIWJ	AgentOrange	This is a review, but also it is a response to those critizing the ending.  I've read how people think the ending was lacking, by simply not having a fantastical ending in which the boy-machine turns into a real human being.  Um, duh, this movie is set in a world that is fictional, but still retains the basic principals of life.  It is not a fantasy story with magic pixies, and spirits flying around.  So think about it.  Were you really expecting the boy-machine to find a blue fairy.  No, of course not, it was complete ignorance on the boy's idealistic pursuit.  But through technology, and technology only, is the boy-machine able to actually &quot;find&quot; the blue fairy, and no I'm sorry to say that plastic and metal, the boy-machine's basic components, do not have the ability to magically turn into flesh and blood.  This is reality, not fantasy!  In some instances I do have to agree that the movie became slow in some instances, but I thought that even when I started to become lax, I simply was sucked in by the unparalleling storyline.Furthermore, Mr. Chippy, you talk about how the know-it-all man was kind of foolish looking.  Well come on, please, this movie was partly lacking because it had hardly any humoring quality to it.  So, basically, you think that Spielberg should have given the preconceived notion that Mr. Who was a complete goofball, as portrayed somewhat in the movie.  Yea, that would really give you the impression that he knew everything, huh!  I thought that using Robin William's voice to provide an almost laughable quality to Mr. Who was a wonderful implication to the movie's atmosphere.  It gives us the sense that not everything in the future here it so synthetic and unfeeling.  But perhaps your idea of Mr. Who being a grandmaster, god-like being, towering over the boy-machine with a booming voice and fire covering his body would be more effective to someone like you.But really you must watch this movie and simply think about what is happening at the present time in the movie, without putting so much emphasis on what the ending will be.  The climax sensation should not occur until you know it is almost the end, not half-way through a movie, because then you simply forget about the rest of the movie until the ending, when everything is summarized.  Spielberg, Kubrick, you guys rock!  I only pray that you can surpass this film as well!My most humbling regards.	5.0	Absolutely Superb!	2001-10-11	0	0	0

""those who created us are constantly looking for those who created them.""  and later:  ""humans hate us because they know that when it all ends, the only ones left will be us""if you're one of those that saw this movie once and didn't like it, i reccommend at least renting it, and giving it another shot."	5.0	gets better with every viewing	2002-03-06	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A29APD6XQC4EX3	A. Lam	"What I dislike about AI is not that I'm supposed to feel sympathetic for a robot, or that the last act is just ridiculously out of place; but the entire plot in this movie is so.... Artificial. Everything that happens is contrived to draw emotion from the audience or shows off special effects (for which it does very well).  A sci-fi story calls for smart characters, not artificial dummies (no, I'm NOT talking about the robots) that are strictly one-dimensional and can't think logically.Consider David, the robotic main character, who is programmed to love.  But wait, once he is imprinted to love one person, it cannot be reversed. And in the event that he is no longer loved, he must be destroyed because he is no longer useful.  What??  What company exec would approve a model that is not recyclable?  No way would the environmentalists not complain about David.  And when Daddy doesn't want David around, I found myself yelling inside, ""just shut him off, godamit! It's a machine!""  Or throws him to the basement, whatever.  You don't drive your unwanted vacuum cleaner to the woods and leave it there do you?  And oh, David can only love one person, hence he loves the Mommy but not the Daddy.  No wonder the Dad is [mad], he's getting no love!!  Why didn't the scientists design David to love two persons (mom and dad, make sense doesn't it?) is what I want to know.As for the last act, it's wimpy way to end the story. Yes, I see the irony  -- artificial love for the artificial intelligence.  But there is surely better ways to bring this point across.  I did enjoy this move for the visual and the fine acting.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AD7PBLGQXCUGU	albemuth	From an outside point of view it's hard to tell where the problem lies but the end result of this film, one of infinite potential, ends up at best an interesting failure.  It is at turns overtly simple and sentimental, and at times attempts to be cold and sexy, but the Spielbergian &quot;cute&quot; obsessions run amok over Kubrick's and it all results in a mixed bag of a few goodies and a lot of mediocrity.Overall, the film lacks in energy that only Jude Law's character provides - he is the dynamo that keeps it from rusting on its tracks.  The worst thing about the whole is that it's not really a bad film, but it continuously shows potential of being a great film - yet, unfailingly, at every interesting moment, suggesting either a transcendetal evolution of the storyline or a brooding insight into the characters and the futureworld they live in, it diverts back into its earlier meanderings and the result simply fails to excite.  Even the effects, fine as they are, are nothing all that special.The preview I saw had people walking out in the middle of it, kids acting restless and 90% of the audience rushing out during the last scene.  I do recommend seeing it and making up your own mind, but please don't go in expecting heaven.  Maybe the Blue Fairy could fix it?	3.0	an interesting failure	2001-06-27	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2ENXOJYKH09KX	Al Davis	Stanley Kubrick is turning over in his grave right about now. I'm not saying that the movie is bad, because it's not at all. It's just that you can see where Kubrick wanted to go, and you can see where Spielberg decided to take it.Jude Law was great and Haley Joel wan't too shabby himself. There must not of been a budget on this film because Spielberg went all out. The ending was headed towards being a typical Kubrick ending, which means that it would take you the rest of your life to figure out the meaning. Spielberg cut in and tried his best to give it a clean cut, &quot;happily ever after&quot; finish.Aliens, most likely the same ones that have been in a few other of Spielberg's movies (Close Encounters, ET)play a pretty big part in the ending of this movie. Personally, ever since I saw Close Encounters, I've always wanted to see a movie based on those aliens. This is not that movie, but we do get a closer look at those lanky beings.Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I thought the movie was pretty good. It was very different and movies like this aren't made very often. The ending will leave you scratching your head (just like it did in 2001 A Space Oddesey). My advice to you is go check it out for yourself, and stop reading my review. Just win, baby.	4.0	Close Encounters of the Artificial Kind	2001-06-30	11	7	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A9UU8OR0TBMHE	Alexander Nordquist	Steven Spielberg's &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a very good movie! Stanley Kubrick had really started the project but after he died making it, Spielberg took over and he did a great job.The movie takes place in a future world made up of humans and robots called mechas. The mechas are originally designed to help the humans. But the humans end up making too many and they start to destroy them all. The movie starts out as a mecha is designed named David[Haley Joel Osment], who is designed specifically to show unconditional love, that was the dream of the scientist that made him. The robot is givin to Monica and Henry who originally lost their son, Martin. Everything starts out okay but when Martin is frozen than broughten back to life, Monica and Henry believe that David is dangerous and they leave him out in the woods. With the help of another mecha named Gigolo Joe[Jude Law], David must find away to return to his family.Haley Joel Osment's acting was amazing! This was the first movie I saw that had him in it but later I saw the movie &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; which was okay but not that great. I also remember seeing Jude Law before too.I liked the movie mostly but there were also some down parts. One thing I didn't like was that the movie had a sad ending. I usually don't like to watch sad movies and that's why I gave it 4 stars. But other than that it would have been a 5 star.If you love science fiction movies or you are a fan of Steven Spielberg's movies, then check this one out!	4.0	A Great sci fi film by Steven Spielberg!!	2004-01-15	3	2	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	To people who know me this will come as quite a shock. I'm going to &quot;defend&quot; Steven Spielberg's latest feature film! I'm not a fan of his work. There are only two films by him that I like, and infact I'm kinda embarrassed to mention them because it's become almost cliche to say that these movies are his best. I like &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Everything else he's ever made I dismiss. I find his movies to be &quot;childish&quot;. He himself once said in an interview (It was &quot;Inside the Actor's Studio&quot; to be exact)that &quot;(he) likes to make movies from the view of a child&quot;. He said this in a positive way, I use it as a negitive. I don't find his movies to be &quot;personal&quot; I don't get the feeling he puts himself into his work. I mean unless he has lead the life of Indiana Jones, I just don't see it. So, now that I have wasted your time explaining this to you, you might find it odd for me to be saying that &quot;A.I.&quot; is a wonderful, touching, and extremely impressive movie on a technical level. We should all know the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; story with this movie by now. Stanley Kubrick wanted to make this movie after reading Brian Aldiss' short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;. But, he decided that Steven Spielberg might be a better choice to direct it. I'm not to sure about that, but, this is one of Spielberg's best movies on my scale of things. In the very begining of this movie we see Professor Hobby (William Hurt) discussing the idea of making a robot that would actually be able to love. Can a robot ever love? Wouldn't emotional feelings, like tears make it rust? lol. I'm kidding of course. But seriously, this is an idea that Hobby has put much thought into. His final product is David (Haley Joel Osment). Monica and Henry Swinton have a child, Martin (Jake Thomas), that is in critical care. This is something that Monica cannot deal with. But everyone knows this part of the story already. Her husband decides perhaps it would be a good idea to buy a robot, not so much to replace their child, but, to try and ease her pain a bit. This is where the movie really starts to take off. The first 90 minutes of this movie was great. It truly had that Kubrick feeling to it. Then the movie goes on, and on, and on, until a certain part of my body started to hurt from sitting way too long lol. After the 90 minute mark the film becomes odd, not so odd that it's  uninterresting, but odd enough to keep a distance from the viewer and the characters. As far as visual effects and such are concerned the only real competition for this movie might be &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. &quot;A.I.&quot; was made at the highest quality of technical advancement, for sure. Like all of Spielberg's movies, this one is a fairy-tale, and I'm not joking, it's heavily borrowed from believe it or not &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Serval refernces are made to that story. But, for some reason I didn't mind that this one was a fairy-tale. I still enjoyed this movie. And I think others will too. If you haven't seen it yet, it's a must. The only thought I came away with when watching this movie is, it might of been better had Kubrick directed it himself. Try and spot cameos by Meryl Streep and Chris Rock. Ben Kingsly and Robin Williams do voice overs too! *** 1\2 out of *****	3.0	Is This Movie As &quot;Artificial&quot; As Everyone Says It Is?	2001-09-03	5	2	3

But he has fiathfully brought the IDEAS to the screen, and the ideas are really fascinating.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFXTPJOE2D4M3	Algernon D'Ammassa	Steven Spielberg is a director who likes to make lusty grabs at our heartstrings, but this drama is far beyond &quot;E.T.&quot; In a future America, a team of scientists (headed by William Hurt) design a &quot;mecha&quot; child who can feel love - or at least have it hardwired into his circuitry.The drama that unfolds keep opening up into wider perspectives and deeper questions.  It is an immensely human movie about &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence, probing human ideas about what &quot;artificial&quot; means.  (Does something cease to be &quot;real&quot; because it was designed by human beings?)The plays for our heartstrings feel intrusive.  There is scarcely a moment without John Williams's score leading us by the hand with strings, soft piano, and motherly voices; and Haley Joel Osment has a heartbreaking way with his eyes.  The middle section of the film, in which the boy goes on an astonishing quest for Pinocchio's blue fairy in hopes of being made into an &quot;real live boy&quot; (read: organic), accompanied by a male prostitute robot played by Jude Law (with a little digital manipulation of the actor's movement and appearance), asks for some tall suspensions of disbelief.When the film opens into a fascinating third act, there is an unresolved tension around the need (?) for a happy ending, but also some fascinating ironies about what makes a species consider itself real - or not real.  Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; is troubling and bittersweet, like the questions the film asks.  This is a different kind of film from Spielberg - it is not all special effects and feel-good sentimentality.  Recommended.	4.0	Beyond Pinocchio: How does one feel &quot;real&quot;?	2001-07-05	6	4	2

Is man going to be build technology which will ultimately be his own downfall in the end???  The question posed to the audience by this film was how can love?  Haely Joel Osment was robbed of an oscar for his performance in this film.  He is by far the best child actor, better than many adult actors also.  I get annoyed by people who bad mouth this film, if you didn't understand that is one thing, but making a bad comment about something you do not understand is stupid, oh well ignorance is bliss for a lot of people!	5.0	One of the best films of 2001!	2002-11-08	6	1	5

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3QURY6MILK4AO	"Allison Johnson ""allijohn38"""	I can't stop thinking about what this movie *might* have been.  So many provocative questions were raised, but very unevenly addressed.  What is love? Can an artificial being experience love, or can it only experience artificial love?  What is a human's responsibility, if any, toward a &quot;loving&quot; machine?  What happens when a being created as, and used to being treated as, an object begins to recognize that he/she/it might be something more?  How does this awakening change him/her/it and others of its kind?  Is physicality alone what makes us unique, or is it life experience?  Or both?  The movie glosses over these deep questions for the most part, generally copping out with displays of maudlin sentimentality. The entire third act seems focused on making the audience cry rather than more profitably spending its time closing off these issues (but since they weren't really addressed in the first place, there wasn't much to close off).  I would have been happier if the movie had ended right around Joe's exit and spared us the forced and contrived syrup of the last half hour or so. And oh, that awful Blue Fairy scene!  How did *that* escape the cutting room floor??I find I can deal with the ending -- sort of -- only if I reframe it as a tragedy rather than as the weepy reconciliation Spielberg intended it to be.  (And it had to be Spielberg's ending.  I can't conceive of Kubrick coming up with something like that.) David couldn't have got his wish.  We never saw Monica deal with the emotional repercussions of her act of betrayal.  We don't know if she ever grew to love David as a mother would love her own child (one of the big missteps of the film was its failure to show us that).  And even if we are to believe that memory patterns are kept intact in DNA, Monica's experience of truly loving David wasn't there.  He cut her hair well before those feelings could have been formed.  So at best, David's conviction that he is now a real boy because Monica loves him is a false one, an illusion, and there's your tragedy.  Unless you buy into the whole &quot;believing makes it so&quot; perspective, which I can appreciate, but it doesn't work for me in this instance.  Anyway, the tragic interpretation seems to be more in keeping with the overall tone of the movie.  It's a perspective that I imagine Kubrick would have preferred.On the upside, I thought Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were spectacular.  Law's Joe grows subtly and believably, right up until his epiphany about the potential of his own existence is cut short. (How Kubrickian!) He's also funny.  Osment is one incredibly talented kid who's got a terrific future in acting if that's what he decides to pursue as he grows up.  At several points in the movie, his David broke my heart with nothing more than a fleeting expression.  The visual presentation of the movie is extraordinarily beautiful and haunting.  Overall, &quot;AI&quot; was imaginative and creatively executed, but in the end its reach greatly exceeded its grasp.  What a pity.	3.0	I loved it --  no, I didn't - heck, I dunno...(SPOILERS)	2001-07-03	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A22MQ5SDVJJPOF	A. L. Spieckerman	"""Artificial Intelligence"" is the best film of 2001.  The magic melding of Kubrick and Spielberg works perfectly, bringing a haunting, touching, thought provoking, and experimental film to life.""A.I."" will haunt you for days after you see it; it is a powerful film with amazing preformances, especially from the stunningly accomplished Haley Joel Osment.""A.I"" will touch your emotions and bring you to the brink and perhaps over.  Spielberg returned to the three act structure of ""Empire of the Sun"" that worked so well in his other masterpiece.  The end of each act is emotionally grinding, the moments when David is abandoned by his mother or reacts to the other David robots, or the touchign ending to the final third act, will wrench you apart emotionally.""A.I."" isn't content to remain constrained by emotion and disturbing images, it seriously deals with many different themes and concepts foreign to blockbuster cinema.  ""A.I."" is that rare science fiction film that lives up to the potential of science fiction literature...""A.I."" lives up to that potential, you will be thining about the film for days, even weeks and monthes afterwards.  There are many themes and concepts dealt with in the film, either as asides ... or openly addressed.  A scathign retoric against racism, can be found in the flesh fair sequence, human fallibility and callousness are derided by the offhand way david is dismissed.  David himself displays many different human characterisics, often taking a single trait to extremes as he tries to understand and learn to be human: Especially telling are the sequences where David learns jealousy (spinach), or fear, humor, and protection (the pool scene), he also displays obsession clearly throughout the entire film.  The last act of the film is so startlingly dark that most people think it is schmaltzy.  It is extremly disturbing that humans will die and our creations will replace us, the way David is so carefully manipulated by them as they try to see how humans act is terrifying, but because this seems to be a happy thing for David most people mistake it for a happy 'Spielberg' ending, nothing could be further from the truth.A word should perhaps be said about fairy tales.  Fairy Tales are the main motif drawing the different segments of the film together.  David's Quest is inspired by a fairy tale, Pinochhio.  But his journey more closely resembles  _The Wizard of Oz_ with numerous references in the film to that more modern of fairy tales. The entire film is infact a fairy tale being told to a 'child' of the future.  This is indeed a fairy tale for adults, it has fantastical imagery can characters, with a moral message (however as mentioned above, there is much more to the film as well).  The fairy tale motif of ""A.I."" is one of the amazing touches that make this such a special film.Like every great Kubrick film ""A.I."" pushes cinema to be more.  Traditional filmmaking says that you can't have three endings, you can't break your acts up so completely, you can't be so dark or say so much in a single film.  Spielberg and Kubrick took all those tradtional rules and rejected them, the result was an astoundingly powerful film that by no means adheres to any specific rules of filmmaking.  Spielberg has often been criticized for the artistic license he takes to make stories more cinematic, his films celebrate the human spirit (for the most part), this film is a dark departure from what he traditionally produces.  Spielberg, over the past twentyfive years has delivered soem of the greatest motionpictures ever.  His storytelling was always within the bounds of the 'rules' and he excelled at it; his cinematography may have had new tricks or older, obscure tricks made popular, but he was always focused on telling the best possible story.  That is why his films resonate with so many people.  But with ""A.I."" Spielberg is pushing himself in new and interesting artistic directions, he is experimenting with how that peculair canvas of film can be used to tell stories in new ways, his achievement in ""A.I."" only serves to illustrate that before you can break the rules, you have to know them first."	5.0	The best film of 2001	2002-03-03	13	10	3
B00003CXXO	A.I.

Pretty pictures do not a good film make. Osmond, a future VH1 &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; candidate if there ever was one, does his best at playing the vapid David, a small android chock full of repressed psychosexual rage and abandonment issues. The audience is forced to trek with David through a landscape populated by machines with hearts of gold, leaving one to wonder if it would have been possible for Speilberg to force feed us the question &quot;what does it mean to be human?&quot; any more obviously than he does with the constant stream of bad human/good machine scenes. I took this movie as a personal insult from the director, since he apprently believes his audience completely incapable of appreciating subtlety or allusion. Want to set up android discrimination as a proxy of race discrimination? Why, have a mechanized Chris Tucker robot hurled by white rednecks into a jet turbine! Doesn't get any clearer than that, folks. The ending of the film fumbles its chance at redemption, choosing not to finish on a dark note, but rather to pound the poor audience with yet another hamfisted allusion (This movie is Pinnochio!!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AKUD2ELERD9Q8	Amanda	I have seen a lot of good movies in my life.  Movies like Titanic, The Sixth Sense, and even a lot more.  But i have to tell you- i have never seen a movie like this before.  This is the best movie i have ever seen in my whole life.  I thought that Haley Osment was great in the Sixth Sense, but in this movie i can't even say how good he was... Haley Joel Osment... he was so good in it- if it was someone else- i wouldn't have liked the movie.  I thought the ending was amazing and I couldn't have thought of a better one.  Right when Haley Osment blinked his eyes-- my heart was pounding and there were good tears dropping down my eyes.  No I don't think this was a movie for people the age of 10 and younger because it was a little confusing and it was a serious movie-- there were only about 3 parts that you can laugh at but everything else, younger kids can't understand.  I would like to tell Steven he did an amazing job, Jude Law had a very hard part but he played it awsome and for Haley Osment,... the best actor i have ever seen in my life...The only thing i would change in this movie was to make it not as much a fairytale because practically the whole movie was a fairytale.  Some of the fairytale parts you can keep but when he is under water than he hugged the blue fairy- that took up way to much time.  There was only one part i didn't understand...	5.0	My Review On A.I.	2001-06-30	4	2	2

Haley Joel Osment is just one of the best actors I have seen, and he is just brilliant in this film. Before I saw this movie, I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it because I was very afraid of robots. (Short Circuit was the the scariest movies I had ever seen because I'm petrified of robots) But I decided to watch it because I just love Haley. I am so glad I did.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2OEXGPZIQMLIS	"Amazon Customer ""cdf345"""	The night before I saw this film in the theater, I was told by a close friend that it was a horrible movie - quite possibly the worst she had ever seen.  Still, I had to see the film for myself simply due to the involvement of Kubrick and Speilberg.  Instead of a horrible film, however, what I saw in the theater that night was a remarkably touching and meditative film.  Osment deserves many great things for his turn as the robotic David, and the direction and special effects are perfection.  This film will move you in ways few films can if you will only let it.  After the film's final scene, my girlfriend and I sat in the emptying theater trying our hardest to fight back the tears.  This is a great film.

The story line of a family in the &#34;near future&#34; who's son is alive, but gravely ill and is being kept in a state of hibernation until there's a cure, &#34;adopt&#34; a robotic boy which is the first to have been made that can have real feelings.  The story is along the lines of a Pinocchio situation; the robotic boy loves his mother a great deal, and the family comes to &#34;accept&#34; him in a warm and charming manner.  Things change though when their real son comes home &#34;cured,&#34; and eventually the family chooses to abandon the robotic boy in the &#34;wilderness.&#34;  Depending on your nature and who you are, this story can be extremely heart rending, and your emotions can be taken from emotional elation to sadness and even despair.  If your character is of a different &#34;bent&#34; this film will seem schmaltzy, overly emotional and perhaps at times too much of a fairy tale.Since I gave it 5 stars you have probably figured out I like the film.  Yes, it's a fairy tale.  Yes, it's a modern Pinocchio story.  I grew up with stories like Pinocchio and when I watched this film for the first time, all of those heart-gripping emotions I felt as a kid watching Disney's version of the tale came back and gripped me even stronger, as all of the years that have past in between the two films have added a nostalgic yearning to the feelings.  There are some really good points to how the film was done and who played some of the characters.  Chris Rock was very funny in his part of an &#34;old fashioned robot&#34; with not long left to &#34;live.&#34;  Jude Law plays a robot by the name of Gigolo Joe (who knows all the right moves, and aims to please) that accompanies &#34;David,&#34; the robotic boy, after he finds his way back out of the wilderness.  Between the two of them many questions are answered as the movie progresses.  The roster of actors in the film is broad, varied and great.Again, if you don't care for films that tug at the emotions, then look elsewhere, otherwise this is a great film.Bob Wilson	5.0	A.I. - Artificial Intelligence	2014-04-23	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AK0CENM3LUM28	Amazon Customer	"A.I., Artificial Intelligence / B00003CXXP*Spoilers*When I rented this movie, I did not know what to expect, but I knew to expect ""something weird"", given the science fiction nature of the premise and the previous work of the talent involved. What I did not expect, however, was for this movie to be as moving as it was.A.I. tells the story of a prototype robot, fashioned to look and act and even love as an innocent young child would. The premise is laid out flatly in the opening scene - the easy part is making a robot who can love a human, the hard part is finding a human who will love, truly love, the robot in return. When the young ""boy"" is cast aside from his human parents in a scene that is at least as much reminiscent of The Velveteen Rabbit as it is of Pinocchio, he wanders a harsh, cruel world searching for something - anything - that can make him a ""real boy"" and, he hopes, cause his 'mommy' to love him as much as she loves her ""real son"".Our protagonist was programmed to think and behave as a child, and he does. With childlike innocence, he seizes fiercely on the idea of a ""blue fairy"" from his Pinocchio book who can turn him real. He stumbles through a world of backlashing crowds who publicly roast robots on stage in an attempt to return to something real; he charms disenchanted older robots who help him as much as they are able. When a ""pleasure model"" robot tells him, compassionately, that his 'mommy' ""loves what you do for her, as my customers love what I do for them, but she doesn't love YOU"", he resists, rebels against this unfortunate truth. He is willing to search until the end of time to find his mommy and, in doing so, demonstrates a depth of childlike love that she simply does not deserve and yet he gives anyway.I deeply enjoyed this movie for its depictions of humanity. For the conflicted position of a father who is caught between his family's safety and a 'mere' constructed robot. For the casual cruelty of a young human boy who must reconcile his damaged body and the 'replacement' boy his mother loved in his absence. For the conflicted emotions of a mother who is loved by her family, but who must make sacrifices for each of these loves. For the hatred of the raging crowd, composed of varied individuals with varying emotions - sadism for some, yes, but with a willingness to halt the destruction for a single child, even if it is 'merely' a robot child. And for the humanity of childlike love, expressed paradoxically through a small robot.This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.~ Ana Mardoll"	4.0	Tearful Humanity	2009-03-03	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2IB38KEKKRUNS	Amazon Customer	A.I. tells the story of Pinocchio, this time set in the future, where greenhouse gases have led to the melting of the polar ice.  Natural resources are scarce, and humans are in need of help.  They turn to robots, mechas, to take care of the dirty bits.  For reasons both known and unknown, one company produces a prototype of a mecha boy, a child, that has real feelings.They give this mecha, David (Haley Joel Osment), to ailing parents who yearn for their sick son.  Soon, the son is better, and the mecha is cast out into the world.  All that David wants is to loved by his mother, but this requires himself to become human.  So he sets off to find the Blue Fairy, the one he believes who can help.A.I. is a very sad story.  To watch it is hard because we have to hold two opposing thoughts at once: 1) We want to believe that David can become human, and 2) we know that he cannot become human.  If you can empathize with that plight, if you can feel for something that is not human, then you will enjoy this very much.  If you cannot empathize, then the movie will seem like an exercise in acting and effects and nothing more.A.I. was originally conceived by Stanley Kubrick.  One of the central themes of his work is the Clockwork Orange: something that seems organic, but is only a machine.  It was Kubrick's hope that Spielberg could make his movie, to make it live and feel.  So with wonderful acting, and a nuanced script, the film reaches for the stars.  In my opinion, it is an accomplishment that has been sadly ignored.	5.0	Can the Clockwork Orange Become Human?	2006-10-06	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UT75Z4PPGTS2	Amazon Customer	"The back story of AI is fairly well known:  It was a project of Stanley Kubrick's for many years, and after Kubrick died, Steven Spielberg went ahead and made the film.  Ostensibly it was homage to Mr. Kubrick, but in fact it serves as a fascinating study of directorial philosophies and styles, and how a director's imprint on film is indelible.Originally based on the short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss AI tells the story of David (Haley Joel Osment) the first robot that is built to love.  Many robots (or ""mechas"" as they are known) are loved -- animatronic sex toys called 'lover mechas,' are popular -- but this is a great leap forward:  David will love, not be loved.  A prototype David is built and delivered to the home of a couple whose son is cryogenically frozen.  At first the mother is appalled, but in one desperate moment she activates David's love circuits.  From that moment on, the instructions have warned her, David will love her completely and unfailingly.  As guaranteed, he does -- but she doesn't.It seems clear that Kubrick's original vision was dark; corporate interests who will exploit grief and sell love for greater market share, or a society where maternal love itself becomes another mass-produced disposable commodity.  But Spielberg doesn't seem interested in such themes, and steers the film into a rather dull retelling of -- surprise -- Pinocchio.  Yes, David is the puppet who wants to be a real boy.  Set against a backdrop of a post-apocalyptic earth where the sea levels have risen hundreds of feet, this top-drawer effects film is a routine rehash of Spielberg's favorite fairy tale.  The mecha David is the puppet, his manufacturer Geppeto, his animatronic teddy Jiminy Cricket.These two basic visualizations -- presumably Kubrick's and Spielberg's -- simply do not mesh.  A scene where a mecha is destroyed for human entertainment is a good example of crippling misdirection.  A robot is fired from a cannon, set afire, and passed through rotating knives.  The mecha is voiced by Chris Rock, who offers his usual street-jive patter.  Yet we hear (and perhaps laugh) at Rock's voice only an instant before the mecha's burning face, torn from its head, smashes against the bars of David's cage.  David -- and the audience -- recoils in horror.  It's a woeful mismatch.The film shows flashes of originality and a great deal of technical brilliance.  Jude Law, who plays a lover mecha (""Gigolo Joe"", he is called, but all such mechas might be called that) is superb, and his make-up is unnerving.  The supertoy, Teddy, is a perfect blend of pessimism and determination as he keeps up with David's quest for the Blue Fairy, all the while warning him of the dangers along the way.  Even Haley Joel Osment does the best he can with his bafflingly contradictory role.  He is most effective in the early scenes, when his skin looks like very expensive plastic, and his flat smile gives us, as well as his foster-mother, the willies.Visually the movie is stunning.  The effects are always good and in some cases astonishing (such as the flying craft seen in the film's epilogue).  Spielberg, even when he gets bogged down in mawkishness and sentimentality, is the master visual technician and takes us effortlessly through the surreal images of this strange future world.  But his screen story -- at least starting from Kubrick's black thesis -- seems untenable.  A story of a robot that can be ""switched on"" to love when it is convenient for the owner, and then cast away when not, should not have a happy ending. One can only wonder where Kubrick would have gone with the idea."	3.0	In the end, two different visions are incompatible	2002-05-30	4	3	1

If you came looking for Spielberg's happy ending or Kubric's hallucenogenic or dystopian ending, prepare to be disappointed.  But if you want a blend of the best of these two directors, a bittersweet and aching examination of love, its formation, its endurance and its consequences, you will love AI.I love absolutely everything about this movie.  From the first, Spielberg treats technology as incidental, not forefront in the movie.  It's simply there, part of everyday life.  Sure, it's more advanced than we have today, but it's so firmly rooted that it doesn't intrude on the viewer like a normal SciFi movie.The plot, true, is a variation of Pinnochio, but still, the upshot of the story is no so much that David wants to be a real boy so much as it is that he wants to be loved.  He loves, and doesn't understand why that love is not returned.  He thinks that by becoming a real boy, this will happen.The music, the direction, the way the film falls neatly into five main parts, the lighting, the acting by Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law and all the cast is pitch perfect.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2LZJ4XJS1A9XM	"Amazon Customer ""nospam"""	...but, alas, I could not. The touch of The Master, Stanley Kubrick, is visible, but his delicate, cold but perfect imprint is smeared into a Spielbergian happy-face. The first of the films' three acts is the best, showing the impact of an artificial boy ('mecha') on a couple whose own child was taken from them by illness and lies in a (supposedly) irrevocable coma. The mecha, played brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment, is capable of loving whomever it imprints on if a series of code-words are spoken. The couple agonize over the idea, repelled then compelled by the notion of a loving machine/child. Spielberg shows admirable restraint, allowing the cast to bring this conflict out at pace through sometimes humorous, often disturbing vignettes. Eventually, the couple decides to &quot;activate&quot; the &quot;love program&quot; (for lack of a better term), knowing full well that the process is irreversible - a mecha who imprints can only love the one it imprints on. Should the imprint-ee change his or her mind later, the mecha must be destroyed or face a lifetime of torment over not being loved in return. This conflict drives the last two-thirds of the film, because - guess what - mom and dad change their minds. To their credit, it appears that they have good reasons, but the scene in which the mecha fully realizes he is being rejected is one of the most wrenching I have ever seen. Osment should have received an Oscar for his performance. Osment goes on a quest to find his mother and get her to love him. The simple directness of his need takes him through various places and events designed to reflect various human traits and needs - violence, lust and fantasy. He will not, of course, be distracted by these. Osments' mecha is perfect in love as no human can be, pursuing that most precious (and obsessively singular) thing to the end. Literally. The last two thirds of the film show a steady lightening of tone from Kubrickian to Spielbergian. This is not necessarily bad, but Spielbergs' optimism about human nature can sometimes lead to saccharine excess and easy resolution. It is difficult to explain my ultimate disappointment in the film without spoilers, so suffice to say humanity gets let off the hook for deserting this wonderful loving creation and the mecha gets a happy ending of sorts. Prior viewers of the film should ask themselves - how much more poignant would the film be if it ended with the discovery of the Blue Fairy and the prayer of a little boy?	3.0	I wanted to love this film...	2002-05-10	2	1	1

The mechanical children are hard wired for one family and one family only.  Well as you can guess the family ends up deciding they don't want the boy.  Instead of doing the humane thing by taking him to be destroyed they abandon him.  This boy spends the entire life of a world trying to become human so his family will love him again.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2R4LM60ZHIDIF	Amber Dowd	A.I. is truly one of the most moving pieces of film I've had the extreme pleasure to experience.  A complex drama with equal parts science fiction and fairy tale, this movie is not for everyone.  Although the main character is an 11 year old boy, children under pre-teen age probably should not see it unless they are quite mature and can determine fantasy from reality, so, parents, please don't mistake this for a &quot;kid's movie&quot;.  Folks with short attention spans avidly interested in mass produced Hollywood rubbish with transparent plots also should avoid it at all costs.One of the darker movies I've seen, it is simultaneously heart-warming with scenes so memorable (a mixture of both fantastic and horrific) that, after seeing the movie only once in the theatre, I still have images of it etched into my mind to this day...images I doubt will fade with time.The score is fluid and breathtaking - perfect for the context of the film, and the acting is stupendous.  Although Kubrick sadly could not complete his vision, Spielberg has done wonders with his screenplay and has made it his own without candy-coating it and overshadowing Kubrick's original ideas, as I initially feared.  He wrote and directed this masterpiece with industry prowess and obvious respect for a late genius' wishes, having added his own superb touch of warmth and sentimentality that Kubrick would have struggled with, would he have been the sole screenwriter and director of this project.  The result is an ingenious collaboration from two very different yet very appropriate sources.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in sublime story telling and intoxicating visuals.  Be warned, however,  that the movie is lengthy, although it doesn't seem that way, so be sure to have saved up enough energy and focus to make it through 145 saturated minutes.

Marketing misrepresented the film by promoting shots of a laughing Haley Joel Osment but this film is filled with one depressing scene after another.The movie attempts to be a dark, twisted retelling of the Pinocchio story, a statement about discrimination, and a story about faith and love.  A.I. seems to have suffered from too many fathers.  Brian Aldiss created the characters in his short short, ""Supertoys Last All Summer"".  (Only David and Teddy remain true to his version.)  Stanley Kubrick originally planned the film and abandoned it before his death and Steven Spielberg inherited the project.Hally Joel Osment's performance as David is sincere and sophisticated but his characters flawed logic - find the blue fairy and become a ""real"" boy - is painful to watch.There are plotting problems as well.  Characters actions are inconsistent.  The ""organic"" humans are inexplicably brutal to the robots, even although they were created solely for the humans enjoyment.  A dense forest used as dumping ground for discarded robots contradicts the worldwide food shortages at the movie's premise.

It's a lot like a dream - filled with physical impossibilities, emotionally wrenching at times... but then, in most dreams, you don't have to wait 45 minutes for what you already know is going to be an unsatisfying ending. Better you should rent Disney's Pinnochio, or read the book... you'll get a better ending and possibly enjoy yourself.	2.0	uh, what... ?	2002-03-12	9	4	5

The first child robot programmed to love. When his family's lost child recovers and comes home. His mother leaves him in the forest alone and he is set on a &quot;Pinnochio&quot; journey to find the Blue Fairy and become a real boy along with his pal Gigolo Joe (Jude Law).The special effects are amazing! The voices of Chris Rock and Robin Williams also make cameo appearances.I would really like to see Osment win an Oscar for this incredible role which portrayals with absolute perfection.I recommend this film to all Spielberg, Osment, or Sci-fi fans	5.0	Haley Joel Osment gives an Oscar-worthy performance!	2001-07-06	8	8	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1GOI8745FGIDN	"""an_avid_book_reviewer"""	"In the movie, ""Artificial Intelligence,"" the future of technology in the world is depicted, namely with man creating a thinking being.A woman's son died in childhood, so she had his body suspended in the cryonics lab, with the hope of reviving him to life when the technology was feasible.  Meanwhile, scientists had been creating ""mechas""-- robots that look and act like humans and are designed for some specific, sole reason-- some purpose to serve.  David is the first of a kind of mechas, however.  He looks exactly like a human, with real skin and hair and all outward appearances of a person.  The main advance of David is that he has the capacity to love.  He was programmed to love his mother, and the reason David was created was for him to love her, to kind of replace her lost son.  Inside, David is mechanical and robotic.  He has no internal organs, he does not eat, breathe, or sleep.  But through the movie, ask yourself whether David really is human.The moral dillema is that although David will love his mother, will she, and other humans, love him?  The humans in this society are violently opposed to the Mechas.  They even hold a ""Flesh Fest-- A Celebration of Life"" where they violently demolish mechas.  When David's turn comes, the crowd breaks out into riot to prevent him from being destroyed since he seems like a human to them.  People think that it is not morally wrong to neglect or harm any robot or computer, no matter how sophisticated, because it cannot feel pain.  While David can feel pain, even the earlier mechas could clearly feel emotional pain, such as rejection, although not physical pain.2000 years later, the oceans had been frozen over and all humans have vanished.  Some aliens explore the earth, amazed at finding and reviving David, simply because he once knew real humans.  Neither the aliens themselves, nor David, they say, are living beings.  It was living beings, they conclude, who are the greatest thing to exist in the universe.  The aliens therefore seek to allow David happiness and through a hair sample, somewhat recreate David's ""mom"" which he so desperately had been seeking.  They also created the illusion of the ""blue fairy"" which David had been seeking.  He believed that this fairy could turn a mecha into a human, a ""real boy.""  When he found a statue of the blue fairy under water, he got trapped there in his vessel for 2000 years and eventually frozen into place.  After the aliens revived him, he embraced the statue, only for it to symbolically crumble.  The statue stands for a greater power that people have a need to believe in, like God.Throughout the movie, David was teased and even hated by the humans for not being ""real.""  He wanted so badly to be a real life human.  But David is real.  I think the humans envied him.  The main differences between him and humans are that he doesn't need to eat, breathe, or sleep to ""live"" and he can never die in the way humans do.  If I had the option of not needing to eat, breathe, or sleep, and being able to live indefinitely without suffering any aging, I would take it!  Sure, David has been programmed, but haven't we all?  We all are programmed by our genes, environment, upbringing, etc.I give this movie a mediocre rating because I think it is a simplistic portrayal of the future as affected by technology.  If you want to delve deeper into the ideas that this movie attempted to explore, research the topic of Transhumanism, namely transhumanism.org.  This movie is only about one aspect of transhumanism: the creation of AI.  There's a lot more to it than that."	3.0	Simplistic portrayal of our transhuman future.	2002-06-13	7	5	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	If you thought that Haley Joel Osment was nomination worthy in `The Sixth Sense' then sit back and watch this young child mature because he's award worthy in this masterpiece of a film.  `A.I.' may just be my favorite film of 2001, or at least very close to it, and it's shocking to me since when I first saw it I didn't remember being blown away.  It wasn't until I picked it up for a steal the other day and decided to give it another try that I realized just how amazing this film really is.  It may be flawed, but they're flaws I can't see.  Everything is cinematically superior to most the films released today.  The set pieces, the cinematography, the originality, the dialog, the emotions, the brilliant acting and Spielberg's classic direction all add layers to the finesse the film contains.  Adapted from the short story `Supertoys Last all Summer Long' written by Brain Aldiss, and then crafted by the legendary Stanley Kubrick only to be interpreted by Stephen Spielberg is quite a nice list of names t throw in the bucket, and the finished product lives up to it.The film, as has been mentioned, is a futuristic look at the tale of `Pinocchio'.  Young David, a robot child, longs to be a real boy in order to experience a real love from his mother.  His parents, Monica and Henry Swinton, adopted him after their only son Martin got sick and was hospitalized.  The doctors couldn't find a way to cure the boy and so, in order to help heal the pain, the couple decided to adopt a robot boy designed to love unconditionally.  The mother, while against the idea at first, soon falls in love with David and he with her.  But then Martin gets better and comes home and things change.  The attention and affection that Monica once gave to David now went to Martin, and Martin continued to resent David and try his hardest to make him falter.After a series of accidents Monica is forced to part with David, but her love for him is so strong that she can't send him back to the factory for destruction.  She leaves him in the woods with his supertoy Teddy and warns him of the cruel world, sending him on his way to face it alone.  David then devotes his energies to finding the Blue Fairy from the `Pinocchio' fable in order to become a real boy and thus win the love of his mother.  Along his journey he meets Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, a robot lover who's on the run from the law and so decides to help David on his journey.  The film beautifully moves from scene to scene and effortlessly captures our attention and emotions, attaching us to David and forcing us to understand and root for him.The acting is superb; everyone involved delivering an award worthy performance.  Jude Law is great as Joe, his charisma is a great attribute to the film and is a perfect compliment to Osment's wide eyed innocence.  Frances O'Connor is just utterly fantastic as Monica.  Her emotions are so raw and real that the audience is moved to tears for her character predicament.  As she leaves David alone in the woods we can feel her remorse and her destitution.  This is her son no matter what anyone else says about it.  The star though is none other than Haley Joel Osment who just delivers flawless brilliance here.  The transition scene alone, when his mother reads to him the few random words that attach him forever to her, is enough to hand him an Oscar.  His facial expression, from wonderment and excitement to awe and complete affection is so strong and mature its tear inducing.  `A.I.' is just about flawless and is sure to entertain and sympathize with the audience.  Truly masterful and completely absorbing, beautifully shot and brilliantly directed!	5.0	Visually mesmerizing and emotionally captivating, a sure fire cinematic masterpiece...	2007-07-16	4	4	0

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1MG24E536B3X2	Andrew Thomas	Much has been made of the contrasts between Kubrick's and Speilberg's respective styles, but such questions rarely inhibit the film's development.  Like all good science fiction, it creates a seamless futuristic environment that pays as much attention to the smallest household details as it does to the larger cities.  Jude Law's performance is astonishing (and full of Kubrickian overtones), but the film's best elements are the dark concerns that lurk underneath the surface.  Many of them, such as fear of abandonment and attempts for individuation, are primal and powerful, and drive the film into areas that prohibit easy answers.  It must be admitted that the screenplay isn't top caliber and several elements seem to be clashing against each other, but it ultimately poses unanswerable questions about loving imperfect beings and the neccesity of adapting emotional response.  And in the end, a film with abstract themes that polarized reviewers may be the best homage to Kubrick that could have been created.	4.0	a tribute in unexpected ways	2002-02-23	16	14	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	Though Steven Spielberg directed it, A.I. Artifical Intelligence is Stanley Kubricks film, through and through.The film bears the unmistakeable marks of Kubricks dark, visually rich, and detailed style, which blends (not entirely seamlessly) with Spielbergs warm optimism, sentimentality, and typically strong child and female characters.In fact the film seems like a strange mix.A.I. is sad, a dark film, really. The light of day is hardly seen excluding a few scenes the beginning of the movie. A film about heartbreak and loss, about identity and love.It's long, clocking in at 155 minutes (2 h, 25 m), longer, in fact, than it should have been.It's intense, with absolutely no humor or comic relief, and the emotional payoff at the end is bittersweet and perhaps slightly unrewarding.But A.I. is a film that's legacy has deepened with time.A.I. showcases the master laying aside his usual popcorn-worthy, entertaining, rewatchable, style, and taking up a more serious, mature one.It's Steven Spielberg's most emotionally complex film, short of Schindler's List.Haley Joel Osment delivers the most heartfelt and mesmerizing child performance in recent years, and Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, and William Hurt rounding the excellent cast.The visuals are top notch, and the story is well-written, sad, and beautifully moving.A.I. is a film that I will never watch again - it is too dark and sad, but I am glad that I watched it the first time.Strong recommendation!	4.0	Sad, Dark, Brilliant.	2012-11-27	2	2	0

The moral issues and dilemmas of a robots capacity to love and be loved could have been explored more deeply (as the opening scenes seems to suggest), but instead the film becomes an exercise (not surprisingly) in special effects ...(re: Planet of the Apes-esque post apocalyptic New York & ET/Close Encounters/Abyss aliens effects).  Unfortunately the special effects without substance becomes tiring and ultimately boring.On the otherhand Spielberg's panache and strengths in presenting wildly exciting and humorous entertainment seems to almost have been ""held back"" by his concern to pay hommage to Kubrick's more serious vision and ideas.This film bears some similarities to Bicentennial Man released a few years earlier with Robin Williams.  It may have been more comic book-ish, but it certainly had more emotional impact and is more memorable than AI.One thing is certain:  Osment's performance is extraordinary."	2.0	Dissappointing Spielberg/Kubrick collaboration.	2002-03-10	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	The film has obviously polarized people. To my mind it isn't as good as its proponents would have, nor is it as bad as its detractors claim.  One can only wonder how polarizing Kubrick's version would have been.It is the Kubrick legacy that haunted my viewing of the film.  But, this doesn't really come into serious play until the last part of the film.  The first two thirds of the film is fine, with astonishing special effects, and a story that moved right along.  I was drawn into the story of a robot child (Haley Joe Osmont) , given the &quot;artificial&quot; (or is it?) capacity to &quot;love&quot;, and his adventures into this post-apocalyptic world when his &quot;mommy&quot; abandons him.Compelled by the myth of the Pinnochio story that had been read to him, he searches for the Blue Fairy so that he can become a real boy too.  With him on this journey is another robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) whose function is self-explanatory in his name.  All of this is done well, with fabulous set design (Rouge City being a delirious riff on Las Vegas), and state-of-the-art effects.  Much of this design was provided by Kubrick's pre-production planning and artwork.What detracts from this modern fairy tale is the long last section, which seemed to me to have several climaxes and could have stopped anywhere in a couple of places.  It was at this point I wondered &quot;How would Kubrick have ended this piece?&quot;.My opinion, based on absolutely nothing but speculation, is that Kubrick would have ended with David being slowly encased in ice and forever asking the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy.  But, maybe Stanley would have elected to carry the ending forward as is done in Spielberg's film.  No matter.When you look at the absolute drivel that passes for popular films today, to say that A.I. is a bad film is preposterous.  There is much to like, and much to admire in this film.  That it didn't hit it out of the park does not diminish from the fact that it was a full swing at it!  Worth a look!	4.0	One Can Only Wonder.....	2002-05-12	5	4	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ATXO4UA7N1HDC	Ari Weiss	I cannot rightfully say this was a bad movie, but I'm almost tempted to. This was another greatly anticipated Hollywood film, due to the collaboration between the late great Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. I, personally, had no interest in the movie until I heard everyone debating whether or not the movie was a masterpiece or Hollywood garbage. To be a loyal movie buff, I had to see what it was all about, and discovered that it was paradoxically both of those descriptions. I did not have respect for Haley Joel Osment's acting ability, until he impressively proved in this movie that he could do more than whisper or act cute (Sixth Sense and Pay It Forward). Jude Law, on the other hand, has always been a favorite of mine. From Ripley to Existenz, Jude Law is an amazing actor, and this movie is no exception. There were moments of sheer brilliance that captivated the mind and even surprisingly gained some emotion, but there were parts that cancelled all that goodness out by making the movie appear a farce. The last forty minutes of the movie, unnecessarily explicated by a mindless, yet painfully didactic narrator, with a totally uninteresting, I would go so far as to say, stupid plot, serves as the best example of the garbage in the movie. It is saddening that Stanley Kubrick died before he could correct the fatal errors this movie is left with, but I'm not convinced that it would have been a complete masterpiece, even with his genius. At the transition, right before those remaining forty minutes, many argue the movie should have ended. I disagree, though it would have certainly been better than the tacked on Hollywood ending, it was still an interminable idea, that lost its intrigue even before that point. It's worth seeing this, but only if you care what everyone's been talking about.	3.0	The fuss over Kubrik's posthumous film	2001-12-30	8	3	5

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3S87ZOPB3UM9N	atmj	It was my own mistake, I did not read the reviews on this.  However, one warning.  If you are at all softhearted, you will sob through this one.  There is a reason, I say Frankenstein and not Pinnochio.I gave it a 5 for special effects and a 2 for being very single-minded in its story.  I felt it was made overly harsh to maximize on the emotional effect.  It was too much.A scientist gets a brilliant idea to make robots, feel love for people they are programmed for.  In this case a child robot. No specifics, but a means of imprinting a robot child's feelings to that of a family is found.  Of course this idea needs to be tested.  One catch however, there is no going back.  If this does not work out with the family, the robot cannot be reprogrammed but must be destroyed.A young couple who's child has been put &quot;on ice&quot; to suspend his potential life, until a cure is found is the obvious in-house choice, for this &quot;new&quot; concept of a robot.  With much second thought and guilty feelings this family decides to &quot;imprint&quot; on this robot child, sealing his fate if this does not work out.With Haley Joel Osment angelic face as David, you can imagine why, when he plays this guileless robot, it is all the more difficult.Well, so as not to ruin the story, you can almost begin to imagine the rest, if I said it's sad.  I won't give the specifics away, but that it is all pretty believable.I love sci-fi, and this was a well written one, however, I could not watch it again. It was too emotionally wrenching.This movie is well-written, the special effects are breathtaking, and the story is heart-breaking.The only feature of the movie that gave it some softness was a wonderful mechanical &quot;Teddy&quot; bear, a smart toy of the future.

I liked the portrayal of humans as less humane than the robots. I'm not a Haley fan by a long shot, but he does a good job in this movie. That said...This is actually a trilogy (or maybe more). There's a begining, a middle and an end movie; it's at least three movies in conception, and it's long enough to be three movies in fact. There are quite a few stories going on here. They're sort of tied together by the main thread, but it's a loose tie, and there are loose ends (or incomplete finishes). A lot of these subplots are big enough to be a movie on their own. And it can be very, very slow. I was somewhat bored, had to pee, and wished heartily for a bottle of wine and a sandwich at about the halfway point.I know writers and directors hate editors because they cut bits of your loved script out... but it's like surgery. If you get a good editor, you can have a healthier, leaner, better film or book. Without one, you can have overweight ideas. This movie, to stay a single movie, needs an editor. Or maybe a diet.Maybe on DVD, where you can pause it and get up, it'll be somewhat easier to get through.	3.0	It's very long...	2002-12-19	3	2	1

I found in the story of an ageless robot boy, so much more than that.This film makes you wonder about our, as human beings' most pure emotion, that of love. Our need for love, and it's pure purpose in our lives, and why we long for it so desperatly.A.I. also made me think, if an iceage, and the end of the human race looms in the future, What is our trueist purpose?We will all die in the future, we all know that, but what does anything matter if you think about it. What is the purpose of our very existance on this planet, since the planet will be destroyed by the sun in 5,000,000,000 years.This movie is the story of our quest for love. It is not only the human quest for love, since David is not human. But every creature that has, does, or ever will live wants and deserves to be wanted and loved. That is the pure message of this film.Above all, I found this to be a truely touching film, and if you have a heart inside you, be prepared to cry in the end!A wonderful film!	5.0	A VERY touching film.	2001-10-10	2	1	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1W0BPBGZSOS35	Avid Reader	Compared to most of the things we view on the wide screen this film appears as a visitation from another dimension.  The lighting, viewpoints, cutaways and music were near perfection. Many have discounted the story for a number of reasons which include violence, copying of other artists, dullness, etc. What I have heard in day to day conversations, though, is always the same thing:  The ending is the problem.No, it is not a smile-filled conclusion but it is a brilliant and poignant one, almost a wistful goodbye to the follies of mankind. In fact, given the scope of the plot and how it begins to move to an ethereal plane toward the last, it is a logical ending.  Spielberg pays homeage to many who have come before him (he has always given credit where credit is due) but he has reached a new apex with this work.  This is art in the truest sense of the word - stunning.	5.0	Cinematic Heaven	2004-02-16	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2GO4MLC7NCV1L	"AynRandLives ""A is A"""	The major issue with the film is that there is an obvious disjoint between the dark vision of Kubrick and the hopeful, cheery outlook of Spielberg.  The first half of the film, which is obviously based on the Kubrick material, is thought provoking, disturbing, and visually exciting. Kubrick makes us confront our own shortcomings by showing us that just because we can make robotic children does not mean we as a race are mature enough to handle the emotional issues and responsibilities they pose.  And the entertainment venues explored in the film leave no doubt that sex and violence still have a future, and that robots will have a place there as well.  It was shocking indeed to see a robot child commit an act of suicide from despair and brave of the film maker to include it, but from then on Spielberg takes over to provide a rescue and a happy ending involving benevolent aliens/androids.  It robs the film of the impact it might have had, and moves it out of the great category into the misfire category.  I do not enjoy Kubrick films, but I always go see them in order to see his mind at work.  It's too bad that he did not have the time here on Earth to finish this project.  Considering the bioethical debate beginning over the proper use of stem cells and human cloning, this is a good time to bring up the issues explored in this film, and the film is indeed worth seeing if for nothing else than the performances of Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law.  Osment proves once again that he is able to carry an entire movie on his juvenile shoulders, and his performance never hits a wrong note.  Jude Law is obviously enjoying his role-it's too bad that most of his part was cut in the theatrical version.  Here's hoping we'll get to see more of it on the evenutal DVD.  Bottom line:  a must-see for all of us sci-fi fans, but a misfire all the same.	3.0	A Misfire but Don't Miss It!	2001-07-17	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1RNKZK9Q8R8GP	B. Alexander	"I saw Artificial Intelligence about a month ago, and I'm still wondering what the whole point was supposed to be.  To create a robot-boy that can love unconditionally is a wonderful idea, especially for a family such as the one portrayed in this movie.  The obvious problem with this idea is that human beings do NOT love unconditionally.  This means trouble for a robot that can also feel emotional pain and suffering.  I think the very beginning of this movie is the most intriguing part of the film.  I'm referring to the scene in the large conference room where the seemingly brash and pretentious creator of David is explaining what they have accomplished.  If I remember correctly, near the end of the scene, someone in the room poses a question something like, ""This robot will love it's family, but what obligation does the family have to love it back?""  I think the creator-guy just smiles at the questioner and says nothing.  Probably the greatest introduction to a movie I have ever seen.  Well done. My question is this.  Why didn't the creators of David simply take away the robot's immense need to feel a reciprocation of love?  Why create a robot that can feel BOTH love and sadness?Hasn't everyone asked this very question to our own Creator at some point?  Why do we have the ability to do/feel/decide/act anything but what we know to be right and good?  Why do we have a free will?  That's the basic struggle of human existence.  Have we not learned ANYTHING?  I don't know, maybe the whole point of the movie is that we haven't learned anything, and that all the imperfections our Creator passed on to us will in turn be passed on to our creations.  Maybe our Creator ceased to exist long ago, as the movie seems to hint at in the very end.  Maybe we are alone.  Pretty bleak.  Pretty depressing.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	Steven Spielberg is one of the real geniuses of our time. This movie is a prime example.David (Haley Joel Osment) is a mecha (people like us are Orgas) who is a new prototype, designed to love. Unconditional love. The factory that made him searched through their employees for the right couple to adopt him: in this case, one whose son had been put in suspended animation because he was very sick. His mother continued to come to the lab and read stories to him (with a microphone on the capsule in which he was frozen), even though he'd been like that for some four years. She was put off by David at first, but eventually warmed up to him.Then their orga son was revived and came home. He was, not unsurprisingly, somewhat jealous of his new mecha brother. Things eventually got so bad that his mother took him and his super-pet, Teddy, out into the woods and abandoned him, not unlike what some people do with unwanted pets. She was told that if she ever took him back to the factory, they would disassemble him, so I guess she thought she was being comparatively kind.David and Teddy have a great many fascinating adventures out in the world, including meeting up with Gigolo Joe, a mecha lover who was framed for a murder and is on the run. David's mother had read the story of Pinocchio to David and his rather malicious brother, and so he has decided he must go find the Blue Fairy and ask her to turn him into a real boy so that his mother will love him again. Gigolo Joe is helping him, and takes him to see Dr. Know, an animated talking head that can't help reminding you of the Wizard of Oz. As a bonus, his voice is that of Robin Williams.The plot has many, many twists and turns, and I've probably already told you too much. Little Haley is marvelous in the role, and Jude Law makes an essentially perfect Gigolo Joe. The credits say Meryl Streep is in there somewhere, but if I tell you where, I'll ruin the story for you. She's a voice, not recognizable by face.This is not one of those frantic paced science fiction stories that normal adults cannot follow, although there are some heart-pounding chase scenes. Remember that both David and Gigolo Joe are essentially running from the authorities. And the Flesh Fair has enough flash and dash for anyone, not to mention horror for those of us who have come to accept the mechas as people in some sense. It's essentially a carnival for orga bigots.I think you're going to love this film, no matter who you are.	5.0	Spielberg is Brilliant!	2012-05-13	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A388KXVQ8W00WF	Barbara Jean VanDenburgh	First and foremost, don't listen to any critic's opinion, or the opinion of any disgruntled friend that might have stumbled upon the film. This is a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; film, with little room for middleground, and you will not know where you stand until you see it for yourself. Do not judge it without viewing it.That said, A.I. is a visually spectacular, emotionally moving, and mentally arousing tale about the quest of a little, unloved robot boy programmed to love the programmer. When David is shunned by the world he was born into, he embarks in a journey of great physical, emotional, and temporal expanse to find the only thing he was ever programmed to want. While the story itself is entirley original, in essence it is a futuristic portrayal of the fairy tale Pinocchio, complete with the mysterious blue fairy. Plot aside, the movie is expertly crafted in the hands of Spielberg and his actors. Spielberg seamlessly meshes futuristic sci-fi style with fairy tale sentimentality to create a visually rich and captivating future that deserves nothing but the most earnest praise. The actors bring this world to life brilliantly, most especially Haley Joel Osment in the role of David. The weight that this role carries is astounding, something I wouldn't entrust to some of the most skilled adult actors. Yet Haley is without a doubt one of the most talented actors to grace the scene, age be damned, and he gives the role the infinite, nearly impossible justice it deserves. Rock on Hailey, rock on.Like many viewers, I watched the last half hour through a filter of tears despite my noble efforts to restrain an emotional outburst. The last 30 minutse are so angering, heartbreaking, and beautiful, and the characters so real, that it's difficult not to feel for them. The entire movie is one emotional rollercoaster, at times terrifying, beautiful, humorous, and haunting. Certain scenes will stick with you for life.Never before has a movie inspired so many questions about the nature of humanity, love, and reality in my mind - it had me pondering for weeks. What responsibility DO we hold to the things we create? This question, while intriguing, also serves as a subtle warning. A.I. is so epic in scope, so deep with meaning, and so rich in talent that it merits saying that anyone who dislikes this movie has failed, truly, to understand it.	5.0	Breathtaking	2001-12-14	204	191	13

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AAV7I6CYFZ2DB	Barry Eysman	"Roger Ebert's review of A.I. can be of help inreflections on what the film, which looks andsounds magnificent on DVD, is about. I feel hemisunderstood some of its main points.  The storyby Brian Aldiss, on which the film is based, Ebertwrites, is about a machine pet abandoned in thewoods. What woods? There are no woods. There isno pet to be abandoned in them. Where did hecome up with this? In his review of the film:Comparing deserting David to the junking of acomputer is pretty cold, almost robotic. True, if theandroid had not been in a form we could identifywith, perhaps, it would have been harder to care.However, this thing of emotions and awareness,sentience, being the sole property of humans isjingoistic in the extreme. It's like saying there canbe no life forms in all of Outer Space unless theyare carbon based like us. Why? Who gave thisdivine right to humans alone? Throw a  beloved toyaway and it is us who hurt, not the toy, Ebert says.But this android is no toy.For him to write that the film should have followedthe ""adopting parents"" instead of the android boymakes little sense. Follow them doing what? Whatwould be the point? He contradicts himself later inhis review by saying the most interesting part of thefilm is when the android is abandoned. If Ebert hadhad his way, that most interesting part of the filmwould not have been there. Somehow this is linkedto his odd statement that Gepetto was THEpoignant character in ""Pinocchio.""Aldiss's story is a neat one on how robotic humanshave become and will in the future become moreso. With a terrific last line. The story carries out itsobjective with sly sardonic wit in precise, almoststaccato cadence that is sad and lonely feeling. Themovie expands it greatly. Ebert complains the filmdid not trod the line between machine and ""reality""but of course it did with every single scene Davidwas in. I never forgot for a moment this was anandroid who had become more than what he wasmanufactured to be.Ebert is right about Haley Joel Osment'sperformance--it is a very subtle one that isluminous. When he laughs at the dinner table, whilestill becoming ""one of us,"" with such mania, it'schilling. When everyone else joins in laughing, hestops, and looks at them curiously. When he eatsspinach and his face distorts, it's spooky and sets anedgy tone that persists throughout the film that saysthis is neither human nor machine, but more. Thathe does not sleep, that he does not eat, does notnegate value and worth in new and unique ways.Pinocchio became real when his wooden bodyturned into flesh and bones. David is not given thisluxury. Osment portrays such a difficult role that isinteresting, constantly thoughtful, profound and hehandles it remarkably. The film reminds me of theobservation, ""true horror is hearing a rose sing."" Ifit can sing, it can be aware, and if it can be aware, itcan feel. Pluck it, it may scream in pain. But only toitself. Does that make the pain less? David feelspain, physical as well as emotional. Certainly atbeing abandoned. Certainly with being hurt by theboys at the swimming pool. To denigrate that is tomiss the whole point of the mix of science andmysticism.Ebert criticizes the film for not delving intosomething totally non human, but there is only sofar the human mind can go in imagining what it isto be totally alien from us. No one will ever write abook, or make a film, about beings who are not insome ways mirrors of us. We think with our humanminds, therefore we are forever imprisoned in them.David is of course us. With art, we want to knowabout us in it. This is our inborn hunger to findothers with whom to identify, to soothe us, to helpus grow, to add dimensions to ourselves that werenot there before. Why do roses sing, if only tothemselves? Because we wish them to. Andbecause they just possibly might. No one knows.Yet.To say David is just programmed--we are allprogrammed. If I had lived in 1800 Spain, of courseI would not be writing this, but I also would havebeen a different person. From childhood on, we areimprinted. We play to our environment. We reallyare all actors. And one of our main ""conceits"" isthat we love to dream; we need it. And moviesshow us dreams. Do androids dream of electricsheep? Did the movie walk a difficult line betweenwhat is laughingly called real and what is dizzyinglywondrously unreal? Yes, to both.  If we dismissdreams, we make reality the poorer for it, andreality is poor enough as it is. Everything starts in adream. Everything is extrapolated from a dream.We have no right to think we alone live to tell thetale. If we throw away possibilities, we are like theWilliam Hurt character in the film--we have noearthly idea what we have created and how farbetter it might be than are we, who think we are sowise and crafty and clever.Perhaps we shall find one day this exact sentientfeeling and awareness in what we have created orwhat is around us already. God help us, if thiscomes true, and we just junk it away like an oldcomputer, before we find out, or, worse still, after."	5.0	A.I. and Our Fondest Dreams	2002-04-20	6	4	2

Many people think it is a masterpiece just because it was made by Steven Spielburg, but after sitting through those torturous 2 1/2 hours in the movie theater, I have come to conclude otherwise.A.I. is basically about a whining robot kid who acts like Pinocchio as he embarks on a quest to become a &quot;real boy.&quot; Accompanied by a robot gigolo, he wanders the earth in search of a certain &quot;blue fairy,&quot; whom he believes can transform him into a real boy.The story gets weirder by the minute; each new plot twist makes you more and more sorry that you parted with your hard-earned money to see this movie. The characters are annoying; the plot is strange and boring. However, if you are the type who can be moved to tears by a whining, robotic Pinocchio boy, or if you don't go to the movies to be entertained, then A.I. is a must-see. There was one good part about this movie, however: Robot boy's teddy bear, &quot;Teddy.&quot; Teddy is a &quot;super toy,&quot; an intelligent, talking, comical Teddy Bear who can run around and at least amuse you enough to keep you from walking out of the theater during this terrible movie.	1.0	Having Way Too Much Fun?

True, it will raise interesting questions, but who ever wrote the screenplay has never experienced parenthood.First, there is a line in the movie that asks &quot;imagine having a child that will stay a child forever.&quot; No parent would want that. Part of the thrill of being a parent is watching the child develop.There are also a couple of incidents where parents jump to a conclusion about something, I am trying to not give too much of the story away. Again this shows that the screenwriter knew nothing about parenting. The first thing a parent learns is that when something happens you ask a child to explain. They never do this. If they had there wouldn't have been a story. It is like a bad &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; script where there is an obvious and easy resolution to the problem, but you don't do it because you need to have a story.This is one of the MOST depressing films I have ever seen.

I think Speilberg is a great director, and I think Kubrick is terrible.  And half of this movie was good, and half of it was not.First, the acting was great.  Haley Joel Osment is a great actor, and so is Jude Law.  I enjoyed watching the robot boy David's mom, Francis O'connor.  The first 3rd of the movie ends with David beginning a journey into the wilderness.  This is the best part of the movie.  The flesh fair where the robots are destroyed is a creative combination of a carnival and a spectator sport.  After David and Gigalo Joe escape they go to a city where David searches for the Blue Fairy that will make him a real person.  The city is a feast for the eyes.  It looks a lot like the way Vegas will be in a few years.Then the ending comes.  This is where the Kubrik part comes in and it makes no sense.  Or maybe it did make sense but its point was meaningless.  Anyway, I liked this movie, but I can see why it was not a summer blockbuster.  The ending, by paying tribute to a dead, overrated director, leaves the viewer with an empty feeling because AI could have been a great movie.	3.0	Incredibly well made movie, but no point	2001-08-22	7	2	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2P0ESIOIZPYPA	bill joselyn	Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick's film, &quot;AI-Artificial Intelligence&quot; is one of the most mind-blowing, provocative films I have ever seen in the theater. I am 23 years old, obsessed with films, and, I must say, have watched many mind-blowing films. But, I must add, I've watched most of them on VHS or DVD. I have never had the chance to see &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; or &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; on the big screen. I've never seen &quot;The Godfather&quot; or &quot;Jaws&quot; or any classics on the big screen. The last film I can honestly call a &quot;classic,&quot; that I saw in the theater, was &quot;E.T.&quot; Nothing since has entered the collective, pop culture pantheon as a true classic. Sure, there have been giant blockbusters--there have been hundreds of blockbusters--but none will be remembered like Spielberg's ode to childhood, to magic, to dreams and fantasy.Until now.A lot of people are saying &quot;A.I.&quot; is one of the worst films they've ever seen. They are hating with a passion. I don't understand. In fact, I'm baffled. I am an aspiring screenwriter an director, and, honestly, I couldn't find anything wrong with the film. However, I'm not saying the film is perfect. It is a flawed masterpiece, is what I'm saying. But what masterpiece isn't flawed? I pose this question with the knowledge that such &quot;classics&quot; as &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; &quot;It's A Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;The Godfather,&quot; &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;2001,&quot; and many other films on Kubrick's and Spielberg's resume have been critically reviled. Pauline Kael, the famous film critic, despised &quot;2001&quot; on its intial release, as did many others. Spielberg has been burned at the stake by several respected critics, often thought of as the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; of filmdom. It wasn't until &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; that he gained the respect he deserved.However, you ask one person you know if they don't like &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind,&quot; or &quot;Jaws,&quot; or &quot;E.T.&quot; or the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films, and I bet you receive a &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; as an answer.&quot;A.I.,&quot; as I have said, is flawed. It is a collaboration, however, of the two greatest directors ever. Yes, I consider Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg to be the two greatest directors ever to work in the medium of film. So I was biased when I heard of &quot;A.I.&quot; It was like a dream come true. My expectations for the film were beyond belief. And you know what? Each and every one was fulfilled. Upon seeing the film, I wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, I was thrilled. I felt I had just seen one of the most engaging, intellectually stimulating films I had ever seen. I couldn't talk about it for at least a half-hour after my viewing. I wanted it to sink it, to seep through every part of my being. And isn't that what great films do? Sure, I was a little disturbed by the ending, a little thrown off by the tonal shifts between the stereotypical &quot;Kubrickian&quot; darkness to the &quot;Spielbergian&quot; hopefulness. But how can you &quot;hate&quot; a movie that makes you feel something, even if it isn't what you want to feel? Did anyone want to feel the horror that &quot;Schindler's List&quot; provided? Or how about the gut-wrenching beginning and ending to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; that Spielberg provided. Those aren't &quot;feel good&quot; movies, I must say.And neither is &quot;A.I.&quot; It isn't a &quot;kid's&quot; movie, despite the main character being acted by Haley Joel Osment--if he doesn't get nominated for best actor, I'm never watching the Oscars again.&quot;A.I.&quot; provides a new generation with something to think about. Watching the news every night, the latest debates about stem cell research and human cloning, I think the film is very topical. It's the age-old theme of man-playing-God. Spielberg has visited it before in &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but that film is nowhere close to providing the thrill that &quot;A.I.&quot; provides.You can say you hate &quot;The Animal&quot; with Rob Schneider, or &quot;Dude, Where's My Car,&quot; but never say you hate a film that actually has ideas flowing through its veins. Please. I beg you. For the more people who say they hate &quot;A.I.&quot; the more horrible movies Hollywood is going to produce. I know there are intelligent filmgoers out there--please show yourselves. Make this film a classic. I guarantee you, in ten years, people are going to look back and see the groundbreaking film that &quot;A.I.&quot; truly is.	5.0	One of the most incredible movies I've seen.	2001-07-31	7	5	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1EKTLUL24HDG8	Bill R. Moore	I have been anticipating this movie for a long time, and I can honestly say that... I was not let down. Steven Spielberg has done an excellent job directing this film, and the special effects and sets are all top-notch. You can definately tell that it is a Spielberg film, but there are some obviously Kubrickian elements in it as well. This is particularly evident in the darker second tier of the film, with the &quot;Flesh Fair&quot;, robot gigalo, and so on. This movie is an epic. It has an above-average running time (2 and 1/2 hours), but it really could have been extended further (the first 1/3 of the movie would've benifited from extension.) It is also wide-ranging in the sense that it will put you through a lot of different emotions in the course of it's running time. There'll be moments where you'll say &quot;Wow&quot;, where you'll say &quot;What the hell?&quot;, where you will be disturbed, and, possibly, where you will cry (in the theater where I saw the movie more than a few people were moved to tears.) Also, it must certainly be said that the actors in this movie do a terrific job. Haley Joel Osment, is outstanding in a near-impossible role... how often is an actor his age the lead character in a major, non-juvenile film? Not very often, for sure, and he shines in this one. Jude Law does very well with his role as well. To top it all off, John William's score is great and hauntingly appropriate. It's a bit rough around the edges at some points (YOU try being one of the world's most famous directors and taking over a project from another one of the world's most famous directors), but it is a very good film. This will be looked back upon as one of the year's best films. A must watch.	5.0	Best Movie of The Year So Far	2001-07-01	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A48THA5X4OUAB	Billyjack D'Urberville	"Unfortunately many people's approach to this film is wrecked by: (1) its genesis between dueling directorial ""giants"" Kubrick and Speilberg; (2) its ""science fiction"" tag, as apparently a harbinger of some soon to appear ""future.""  Buried under all this hype, confusion and pretense, many will never get into this admittedly  quite difficult film.  Perhaps, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, it is ""headed for the museums"" -- thus not to be understood, paradoxically, until as far into the future as when the proverbial space aliens land, and nobody gives a rat's hind end who Kubrick or Spielberg were.  And most sadly for the younger, intelligent crowd that the film is aimed at, their own intelligence has been artificially reduced for three (count 'em, three) generations running of public ""education"" as indoctrination, with ALL literature presented as politics and/or polemic.So before even ""suspending"" your disbelief in preparation for AI's fiction, ALSO temporarily suspend some bad present day cultural assumptions: (1) warp drive; (2) inevitable progress; (3) ET is out there; (4) Kubrick and/or Speilberg is not only a talented film maker, but also an important ""thinker"" necessary for you to grapple with; (4) sentimentality is ALWAYS bad, rationalism ALWAYS good.  There are many more, but this will do.  And substitute this, which your teachers should have told you if they were anything other than prancing monkeys, despite presumed millennia of evolution to achieve their hack wisdom:  ALL human societies have suppressed truth,  NOT ONLY Hitler or Mussolini or Ghengis Khan or some other era from the bad old days, but EVEN us, and right now.  When this inevitably occurs, truth nonetheless bubbles up through folktale, word of mouth, comic strips, graffitti, whatever -- often not through the esteemed ""great"" artists or writers, but more often by some artless, at least unpretentious genre writer like Brian Aldiss.  Upon whose little story this great hairy mammoth known as A1 landed.I am not going to tell you what you should think about this film, not because I don't HAVE an opinion, either.  For one thing, its so deceptively simple that any plot analysis is a giveaway.  But more importantly because this sort of art is exploratory, tentative, scratching at the things presently unsaid or perhaps politically incorrect.  AI is a challenge, like a medieval knight throwing down a gauntlet.  Its no accident that your feelings will be involved but no, they are not yanked.  The sentiment here is not false, nor the ideas cheap.  The film is about what is going on in America today -- not about any imagined, probable, or likely future.  It uses the artifice of ""science fiction"" to confront us about who we are and the choices we are making.  Yeah it will enrage many too, simply because we are all conditioned to a certain degree of public suppression -- indeed, a degree of that is necessary to any society functioning above the level of anarchy.  But the question is what each of us, finally, can suppress, and what it is simply inhuman to suppress.  What bubbles up through such cultural concrete used to be called ALLEGORY: something standing for something else that is nonetheless quite potently real.  It is said in this manner because the artist is somewhat intimidated too, but needs spraypaint his message on a wall in the dead of night.  So is important first not to be ashamed or afraid to cross a little imaginary line with the artwork, and yeah, to take some jeers from the intimidating crowd the next bright morning, for doing so.  Here there is a return, way beyond the spectacular effects and flawless performances.

The least commercial director dies and hands off a project to the MOST commercial director (other than Michael Bay)?  Hmm.  Intriguing.  I've noticed that Spielberg often alternates between his money films (Lost World, etc.) and his personal films (Schindler's List, etc.)  This one is definitely in the more personal category, as there is almost no mainstream appeal here.  This movie should be recommended to anyone who enjoys mid-20th century science fiction novels, like Asimov and such.  I love those books, and since this story sprang from that era, it's no wonder I liked this film so much.  Also, the extras on this DVD are decent, even if they are a bit light in content (why was this 2 discs?  Oh yeah, so I could pay more!)  Rent it, at least.	5.0	come on!

The opening and introduction of the movie alone almost put me to sleep.  The movie really keeps you guessing - guessing how much longer it is going to be.  With every contrived anecdote about the human condition and the search for love and happiness Spielberg drags the viewer more into a tangled web of mediocrity and a storyline that keeps repeating itself scene after scene.  Spielberg's runaway ego creates more false endings and new beginnings than I would ever have thought possible in one movie.  Osment, who has 85% of the screen time speaks in his almost whisper-like &quot;I see dead people&quot; voice, which was sometimes silenced by the collected sighs and yawns of the frustrated and bored audience.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A29NQ2GM8U0LBB	BNYTown	A bloated, disjointed, disconnected, slow, methodical mess. It's finally happened to Spielberg: I call it the &quot;Barbra Streisand Syndrome:&quot; The truly great ones eventually lose all touch with reality and become a caricature of themselves. Barbra doesn't sing anymore, not with the sweet purity of her early career: She plays herself, singing. Spielberg doesn't create spontaneous beauty anymore. He's so lost touch with anything real, he's caricaturing himself, throwing in director's tricks that worked in his earlier movies; and in this one, tacking on an ending so absurd and disconnected, you leave wondering what ... the man's on. Bottom line: A truly great, classic movie was Spielberg's Empire of the Sun, one of my all time favorites, a perfect film. The difference between that gem and this dog is much like the plot of A.I: Empire of the Sun is a real movie with real heart, this one is a mere &quot;robot&quot; of a movie: an arrogant conceit of its creator. Many people will mention the &quot;darkness&quot; that Kubrick added to Spielberg's so-called &quot;sunniness.&quot; Bunk. Darkness for it's own sake is a waste of my time.

I have been thinking about it every hour or so since.Yes, there are three parts to the movie - all Spielburg, zero Kubrick.  The final part, when the aliens come, is the best part.  It is the message.  To my knowledge, this is the first time we have ever witnessed another intelligent life form celebrate the greatness of humans.  Isn't that Spielburg's true message here - that we should all be happy, proud, and thankful that we can think, express ourselves so incredibly well through the arts, and truly feel and express love...life?  David is great because he embodies the greatness, the uniqueness of mankind.No one seems to have picked up the significance of David going to sleep after spending the best day of his existence.  Think about it.  Watch the entire movie closely.  David goes to sleep!Too long?  Are you kidding?  My wife and I never thought the movie dragged or that precious scenes could be cropped.  Next time, eat before going to the movies and don't plan anything after the movies.  We can hardly wait for the Director's Cut DVD which I hope ADDS footage.If Haley Joel Osment does not win the Golden Globe for Best Actor it will just be another awards show that I'll have to stop watching.  I've already given up on the Oscars.  This is one of the greatest single acting performances of the history of film much less the 21st century.  As good as Robert Downey Jr. in Chaplin.And one other thing.  The aliens wanted to give David what he wanted.  Neat.  I mean, David had only wanted it for two centuries!  So they gave it to him.  Was that really Monica or the essence of her?  Could they really bring back a human for a day?  WHO CARES?

The greatest works often provoke the greatest controversy. When it first played in theaters, I saw ""A.I."" three times in a single week and from the start considered it one of Spielberg's most profoundly important films. Seeing it repeatedly on DVD has only strengthened that view.This is no film for those who prefer to check their minds and hearts at the door. It is a film that forces us to look in the mirror to confront ourselves and our values.""A.I."" raises profound and disturbing moral questions that many folks would rather avoid. What is our responsibility to what we create, especially when our creation has feelings? (The Flesh Fair offers the most brutal answer. Those who find this an improbable touch seem to have forgotten about the slave-auction blocks and lynchings that were long business as usual in this land.) We all yearn for ""undying love,"" but what might such love look like if it actually did span millennia? (David is one heartbreakingly pure answer.)It is particularly sad to see that so many people have missed the film's roots in fairy tales (which, if you read your unexpurgated Grimm or comparable stories from other lands, offer far sterner fare than you'll find in the Disney puree that most folks know). To the astonishment of his own creator, David exceeds his programming again and again. By film's end, David may have pulled off the most spectacular feat of all: he may have become a ""real boy"" like Pinocchio -- but by a very different route that leads to a far darker fate.It is easy to imagine that Pinocchio lives happily ever after. David gets but a single golden day after a quest of millennial proportions. The clue to the well-concealed darkness in this deeply deceptive ""happy"" ending comes from the narrator, who tells us that as he curls up beside his reconstituted mother, David -- who, as a robot, has never required sleep or even been able to *go* to sleep -- for the first time visits the place where dreams are born.The narrator's insidiously soothing delivery conceals the film's most disturbing riddles. Will David wake up the next morning -- beside his mother's corpse?  After experiencing this irretrievably perfect day, would he even *want* to wake up and go on without her? Will he then sleep forever? And most troubling of all, does this first sleep mean that David has become fully human -- and thus subject to death itself? Sugar-frosted endings do not pose such riddles. Indeed, Spielberg has here turned himself ironically inside out.""A.I."" thus ends on a series of disquieting cosmic question marks. As a result, the film makes many people so uncomfortable that they reject it in horror before they take the time to understand that they are only cursing a strange messenger who has startled them awake in the midst of their own darkness."	5.0	One of Spielberg's most profoundly important films.	2003-05-31	9	8	1

The film poses many questions, but primarily focuses on the human urge to create, nurture and abandon on both personal and macro levels. The more I think about it - and it's occupying a lot of my mind time today - the more I realize how ambitious, profound and prescient this movie is. It questions, on the most fundamental levels, our relationship with our own creations -- living and artificial offspring, as well as society itself -- and wonders where we draw various lines and how they are determined, and are we even equipped to make those decisions, considering we are emotional and capricious and selfish and mortal. Whew. Way too much. And the conclusion drawn by the filmmakers will be taken differently by many different viewers, but, to me, it shows that when faced with the starkest truths of permanence, we are not only willing to settle for illusion but will chase it as far as our imaginations will allow.Other notes: Jude Law in a turn that creates one of the great tragic characters of film history ... the Blu-Ray version is stunning visually and aurally and every movie shown in the home with good equipment should be in this format; nothing else comes close."	5.0	Nuture and abandon	2011-11-14	6	6	0

The trouble with AI is that it is an attempt to merge two completely different styles of directing into one film.  Both Kubrick and Spielberg have made some great films, and also some awful ones.  In the good ones, Kubrick films impart the viewer with a sense of something unfinished, worthy of further contemplation.  Spielberg's better films are designed to leave no doubt about how he wants the audience to react to a particular scene.  Putting the two together creates more than a little confusion.In a nutshell, Kubrick wants you to think, while Spielberg wants you to feel.  For me, I just couldn't feel for the mecha-child, and the ending was scripted as typical Spielberg, so there was no opportuninty for much thinking.  If you're looking for a similar-themed film, I would reccomend Bicentennial Man, excellently played by Robin Williams.It seems like most people reviewing this film either loved it or hated it.

Legendary director Stanley Kubrick actually bought the rights to this film, but sadly passed away in 1999, thus giving Steven Spielberg the honors. The film itself, while lengthy, still is a fascinating and intriguing film all the way through. A major highlight of the film is the awesome scenery used to portray the future. Turning an artificial life form is not a new idea in Hollywood, as films such as ""Bicentennial Man"" and ""Pinocchio"", which is what part of the story of this film is based on, have already been done. Haley Joel Osment, as in ""The Sixth Sense"", does another great job in his role as David, the android robot desperately seeking to become a real boy, with strong feelings for his mother played by Frances O'Connor. One negative thing about this film is the ending, which to me failed as a point to end the film. Had the film ended a little earlier, before the final scene, it would have been a much better ending. Robin Williams provides the voice for Dr. Know, the animated wizard, which aids David in his quest for becoming real. The animatronic teddy bear, appropriately named ""Teddy"" (how long did it take them to come up with that name) is also fun to watch. The closet scene in the beginning is a direct rip-off of E.T., as the animatronic teddy bear is a descendent from HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Jude Law does a nice job as his role as ""Gigolo Joe"", as well as William Hurt, who plays the professor that designed the robots. All in all though, a neat idea for a film.

But nearly 2 1/2 hours later, I walked out, astonished and with tears in my eyes.The story of an artificial boy named David who goes on a journey with a sex robot named Gigolo Joe in order to become a real boy, so that he may win his mother's love.  It is a hauntingly beautiful movie: a combination of Stanley Kubrick's sensibilities with Steven Spielberg's passion for emotionally-charged fairy tales.  The music by John Williams was astounding, and the visual effects were absolutely amazing.The film is also supported by a trio of strong performances.  Haley Joel Osment must carry the amazing role of a robot boy who slowly becomes more human than many of the humans around him.  Osment is not only the greatest child actor of all time, but one of the greatest actors of all time.  Jude Law is excellent as the sex machine--literally--Gigolo Joe.  And Frances O'Connor is incredible as Monica, the trial mother who becomes a mother to David, but must give him up.With all this going good for it, nothing can stand in the way of this movie.  It is another Spielberg blockbuster classic.  Filled with unforgettable performances and incredible moving emotions, this is one film that will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you think.  It is a beautiful, thought-provoking experience that holds you in its grip and never lets go.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3SEPNBSUYNO92	Brendan	A.I. has almost everything you would expect from a Spielberg film: an excellent and intruiging story, good acting(I heard the voices of Robin Williams and Chris Rock in A.I.), good characters, some humor, John Williams' good music, remarkable action sequences, and best of all, a couple scenes that show you something that disturbs you, but makes you think(like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, the Holocaust scenes from Schindler's List, and the slavery in Amistad). I am a huge fan of Spielberg's films, but not this one. A.I. is mssing something very important: a good conclusion.I'm not the first person to criticize the ending, but I'm going to do it anyway because it single-handedly brought A.I. down. A.I. was an excellent film until the last fifteen minutes. I am used to Spielberg's endings being normal, but not too predictable. At the end of A.I., I was thinking &quot;What the!?&quot; I felt cheated.	3.0	One of Spielberg's most disappointing films	2001-10-13	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1ACJDICC34OUB	Brett C	A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a story about a grieving family who has lost their son. At the same time, a person who has built robots comes up with an idea. We all know that robots can't love and can't express human emotion. But what if there was? What if there was a robot that can love, like a child who loves his parents? This is exactly the idea of this scientist. He creates a child, a boy robot (David), who is one of a kind. A robot who can love, and has human emotion. The grieving family then adopts this boy robot, and that's where the real story begins. If you have not seen the film, you may want to skip the rest of this review as alot of the story is revealed.At first, it's the questions if a human can love a robot. The mother has a hard time adjusting to David, as she knows that he is not a real boy. Then, their real son is healed and he is brought home. Since the void is now lifted, eventually, the mother abondons David by leaving him in the forest alone. You feel sorry for David as he cries out to his mother on why she is abandoning him. He feels that she does not love him, and that he has displeased her. Again, this is something a regular robot cannot do. But this boy robot was created to love, and to be loved. But he feels that he is not getting loved in return. So, he sets out to find a fairy who will turn into him into a real boy so that his mother will love him.Some may not like the fact that the movie is sort of based on Pinocchio. But this did not bother me at all. After all, this is a young boy so wouldn't a fairy tail be more appropriate?As the story goes, David ends up being with other robots in a circus-like act where all the old and stray A.I. robots are destroyed in a brutal manner. David watches as the robots are put to their death. A man and his daughter then discover this boy caged with the robots, and the man is shocked to discover that this boy is a machine. He doesn't want to put David in the act, but the leader does it anyway. David hangs on to another robot, who was introduced earlier in the film as a robot who is obsessed with the ladies. The two robots, David and his companion robot, are then prepared to be melted by hot liquid. Your own emotions are once again played with as David cries out for his life. The other robot does not though. And why? It goes back to the beginning: David was created with human emotion. The audience of the act notices this, and they stop the act from being performed. David is now able to continue on his adventure.The film has a touch of humor to it. This makes the film enjoyable as well as emotional. There are happy times, and then there are sad times. These are great recipies to making a masterpiece.As the story goes on, David makes many other discoveries along his adventure. We see a underwater Manhattan, then a old underwater amusement park. Then David finnaly finds the fairy. He prays, and prays, and prays for the fairy to turn him into a real boy. But we know better, and the film does not make the fairy tail come to life that easy. 2000 years go by and now everything is ice. Humans are now gone, and David is the only one left with memory of human beings. Other beings, who look like aliens but may not be, read David's mind and see everything that he has seen. As the end of the film arrives, David gets the answer to the question he was asking. Somehow, he is suddenly in his house again, but it's different. And who is there? Why, it's the magic fairy! David gets to spend time with his mother for one day. And then his mother tells him at the end that she has always loved him. This is the final scene where your emotions are tested, as David can no longer see his mother again. Yet, as he sleeps next to his mom, he still dreams and goes to that place where dreams are made.Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and every star in the film did an outstanding performance. The effects of the film are amazing and future-like. In conclusion, this film is a masterpiece and it tugs at your heartstrings. It makes you think, it makes you feel, it makes you a part of it. I recommend this film to everyone, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	5.0	A film that pulls you into it	2007-07-20	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3ERX4U7T5TLY4	"""brezzie"""	Spielberg and Kubrick seem the unlikeliest of bedfellows, so it's all the more remarkable that their lovechild should be such a pleasing one.Perhaps Spielberg took his inspiration from his own Jurassic Park, where extinct animals were resurrected from found DNA crossed with frog's? Here, two years after his death, we have a new Stanley Kubrick film, assembled from 15 years worth of development material crossed with Spielberg's own take on the story.As an exercise, it is incredible. Although he never shot a frame of it, A.I. feels like no one's work so much as Kubrick's... well, except perhaps Steven Spielberg's. It's a bizarre hybrid; structured like Kubrick, looking like Kubrick but with the showmanship and doe-eyed sentiment of the other guy.Of course, it doesn't always work. For all his insight into Kubrick's vision, Spielberg occasionally seems to be following the recipe. You just know that Kubrick would have made the `Flesh Fair' sequence central, made it something unforgettably nasty, tattooed it on to our brains. Spielberg doesn't seem to know what to do with it, and squanders it showing off what the boys from ILM can do with computers these days. Consequently, it's where the film sags.But, my God, does he make up for it. See A.I. and try to forget the submerged Manhattan, the ferris wheel collapsing underwater, the approach to the frozen future-Earth, the performance of Haley Joel Osment, the sense of quiet despair that humanity is getting it wrong and will ultimately get it wrong.It's impossible to look at the Manhattan section without referencing the atrocities of September 11, and while everyone involved with A.I. may have felt uncomfortable about the year of release, the bad timing actually helps the film. We now live in a world where it's much easier to imagine the human race bringing about its own extinction. A.I. foretells it beautifully.	4.0	A Clockwork E.T.&#65533;s Jurassic Odyssey of the Third Kind	2002-03-29	7	5	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3H4TIVTTA5IBB	Brian A. Wolters	"I sat down to A.I. expecting a movie full of wonder and amazement. I got that at times. At other times, I wanted to turn it off. When it was finally over, I really wanted to like this film but I just felt like I was in a ship on stormy seas and was seasick from it all.The movie starts out in a very somber tone. It explains how the earth is suffering the effects of global warming and the creation of robots, specifically one who can love. David, the loving Robot, is purchased by a family whose own son is on life support. Soon enough, the son improves and the mother decides she doesn't need David anymore. So she drops David and Teddy (the best and warmest character in the movie) in the woods and David goes on a journey to become a real boy and to earn the love of his mother.This is a very sad way to start the film, but it is then that we start to see a little of a ""quest"" in the movie (a la Wizard of Oz) and it begins to feel magical. Then, we get depressed again as we are introduced to a ""pleasure robot"" and how a woman is afraid of his ""functional abilities."" This totally lurches the movie from a kind of magical quality to in your face smut. Then, we see a ""flesh fair"" in which defective robots are destroyed in an arena to the delight of the humans. Then, we are taken to a city which has buildings in the shapes of women in provocative poses. I knew this was a pet project of Kubrick but I didn't know a lot of his perverted imagery and characters would be included in the film.Once we get past that, then we have a few more magical moments and then we are introduced to more dark images and finally, more magical moments. By the time it is all over, I was exhausted.Did I like the movie? I liked the Spielberg ""moments"" but I disliked the Kubrick ones. This maybe what they had intended but to me, it made for a very uneven and overall unsatisfying film."	2.0	Very Uneven	2002-12-09	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3V5OZR0HJQQPN	Brian Elis	I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but when a masterpiece comes along, in any genre, I'll check it out.  I'm glad I decided to gamble and see A.I. when it was in the theatres.  This film, which shares the talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg, is bold and intense.  The effects are breathtaking, but its such a small aspect to this powerful movie.  It tugs at the heartstrings, energizes with unique action sequences, and offers a different philosophy about what the future might hold.  On so many different levels, A.I. is a masterpiece that was made years before its time - and in my opinion, will remain as one of the most under-appreciated films in motion picture history.	5.0	A perfect blend of Kubrick &amp; Speilberg!	2002-01-19	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3B1ACCJMX36HB	"Brian E. Spitz ""BRiAN"""	Nuts to all you who said that this movie is anything short of a masterpiece.  Firstly, I am a student who has studied (both independently and formally) the work of Spielberg and Kubrick respectively.The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski reflects Kubrick's dark style perfectly (see: A Clockwork Orange for the best example).  Spielberg said himself that he tried to capture, to the best of his ability, Kubrick's complex and unique artistic direction.The acting by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law was spectacular.  You liked the people you were supposed to like and hated the people you were supposed to hate.  A mark of good casting and good acting.As for the ending, thematically, it fit in with Spielberg's other movies (ET, Catch Me If You Can, Empire Of The Sun, and Schindler's List most notably).Would Kubrick have ended it differently?  Probably.This movie is an exploration of what makes us human, correct?  Without Spielberg's (often referred to as) &quot;tacked on&quot; ending, it would have left us with a considerable plot hole.	5.0	What Are You People Talking About?	2003-05-07	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	APP5MBH2BSX6I	"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2"""	"This wonderment of a film takes place in a future that presupposes the ice caps have melted from the greenhouse effect, and that man is mastering the art of making robots who look so real that you can only tell them apart from people because they look perfectly healthy and, well, man is not.  Robots to be soldiers, servants, even lovers.  In this environment a scientist takes the next step and creates a robot child, and finds a way to make him feel love for his human ""mommy.""  What happens along the way is not formula and is not forced.  What happens is magic.I can understand why there's such a wide variance of opinion on this film.  Amid the long stretches of beauty and heart-wrenching emotional themes, there are inserted jarring moments of seediness, violence, and echoes of many Spielberg & Kubrick films, including ""2001,"" ""Close Encounters,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""E.T.,"" with a little ""Mad Max"" thrown in for flavor.  It's a lot to take in, and its unevenness makes one uncertain if it's a kid's movie (it often seems like one) or not (no, I won't be explaining to my child what a gigolo is).But this long-awaited film receives my highest praise for several other reasons.  First, life itself is a bit uneven, isn't it?  The film's jarring moments prevent it from being predictable in any way, and that's welcome in a world filled with movies written by pea-brains who seem to have Xeroxed somebody else's script and changed the names and locations.Beyond that, the phenomenal talent of kid actor Haley Joel Osment, perhaps better known for ""The Sixth Sense.""  This little guy is a better actor than most grownups; there's not a false note in his performance.  Also the magical sheen of music that hangs behind the visual like a luminescent backdrop, the special effects that rival anything seen in any ""Matrix"" film, the believable and understandable relationships of the characters, and above all, the story itself, which is a sure draw for anyone who, like me, is a sucker for unrequited love."	5.0	For anyone who loved their mommy	2003-04-22	5	4	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2N0GSETUHL3SW	Britton	Kubrick said that a committee never wrote a good book and unfortunately this was a product between two great (but different) directors.  This movie orignally had been Kubrick's and so you have the dark twists ala Clockwork Orange.  But Spielberg rewrote it and directed it so you have some of the cute sentimental parts as well.  In sum - you never know what the movie is trying to be - drama? comedy? horror?  The trailer gave NO indication of the disturbing portions of the movie.To move from one theme to another was disturbing - definitely NOT a kids movie.  I found the Mother to be unsympathetic, the father to be worse, the creator of David to be uncaring, and David's love for his [...] mother to be tragic.If the movie had kept to a tone of being a dark drama, or a comedy, or horror film it would have been easier to stomach the plot twists.  As it is none of the tones/themes remain on screen enough to be fully developed.At 2.5 hours long it was one of the few movies I was seriously tempted to walk out before the end.  Some couples in the theater did though.  Technically well shot, nice sceens, but from a story point of view just too disturbing and chaotic to recommend at all.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this movie.	1.0	Too mixed	2001-06-30	14	7	7
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2OX23CD1VAABS	"""brotheryoda"""	The first review that came out about AI had the word &quot;frustrating&quot; in the title. I wasn't sure what that meant. In my experience a  movie can either awful, good, or outstanding. What the hell does &quot;frustrating&quot; mean? I can now tell you. It means a film that is able to defy all of your expectations and still let you down. It means a film that has enough flashes of brilliance that it can almost make you forget how badly that rest of the movie played. Almost. It means watching one of the best performances you've ever seen unfold before your eyes only to be overshadowed by the cruel and depressing nature of the story.I don't know how much I should say here because you may want to see it anyway. But I warn you, this film is an exercise in cruelty from beginning to end. There is no happy ending here. Or, for that matter, a happy beginning or middle. I didn't crack a smile once in the 2 1/2 hours that I sat in the theater. And for the last thirty minutes I sat there dumbfounded as to what I was watching. &quot;What the hell was Spielberg thinking?&quot; was the only thing running through my mind.I'll break this into three parts. Act 1 was the introduction to the characters and the world that they live in. Very Kubrickian in that it was VERY slow and drawn out. I was willing to let this slide in hopes of a more engaging 2nd act. Which it was. Act 2 was the only part of the film that I dug even a little bit. Here, you still had Kubrick's influence as far as disturbing story elements, but it was peppered with the type of visuals one would expect from Spielberg and it worked in my opinion. There was a chase sequence that used some really cool visuals that reminded me a little bit of the movie Tron. There was a shot of a fake moon that reminded me of ET a little bit. The scene where they arrive in Manhattan in nothing short of magnificent. Then there was the 'Flesh Fair'. This is where humans would watch the dismemberment of robots for fun. Very cool visuals, VERY disturbing images. Then there is Act 3. I have no words to describe how absolutely silly this came off. I'm still trying to figure out how this even made it past the first draft of the script. It's just dumb. I would've rather seen the movie end at the end of act 2, even though it left David trapped on the bottom of the ocean. Forever praying to the blue fairy to make him a real boy. (I know that makes no sense, but it was in there. I swear.)I didn't like it because it was utterly without joy. It's hard to explain. I can dig sad movies, but this was something else entirely. As a member of the audience, you know from the minute he sets out on his quest to become human (so his mother will love him) that he is going to fail. There is no hope of success. You spend the next hour feeling nothing but bad for David and dreading what he's going to do when he figures it out. I just don't think that's good for you.	2.0	What Was Spielberg Thinking?	2001-07-23	12	10	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A12GXUPYNM7HAJ	Bryan Erickson	I'm not too surprised to see some very negative reviews here, this is an unusual and challenging film that requires some patience. If you are looking for a breezy date flick or sci-fi romp, look elsewhere. If instead you want a thought-provoking quest that examines a whole range of fundamental human issues from daringly original perspectives, you must see this. Kubrick began by asking, what is the limit to what our machines can accomplish? Could a robot actually learn to love, to be human? By the end of Haley Joel Osment's quest, you might ask yourself if we could ever be as human as this robot. Along the way, the film also asks, how we are intelligent and conscious? What basis do we have for holding a machine, or a human, morally accountable for his actions? What is it that makes us care about our loved ones, or feel devotion to a higher being? How real is any human interaction? How much are our relationships really worth to us? This film elevates science fiction to its highest calling, to use fantastic technology and an outlandish scenario as the only possible method to make a totally new and original strike at the most basic human questions. In that way, it is on par with Kubrick's previous sci-fi masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and with the Carl Sagan film, Contact. I never knew what turn it would make next - I was astonished. The film's only weaknesses come from the changes made by Spielberg after he took over the project after Kubrick's death - for instance, the occasional and totally needless narration. Those are minor distractions though from a fitting finale to Kubrick's startling career.	5.0	The year's greatest film	2002-03-19	12	12	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A227E26SPZO7A1	Caesar J. Cabalfin	A.I. is the wonderful sylistic hybrid of two of Hollywood's greatest directors: Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. For the past twenty years, Kubrick had struggled to bring this story to the big screen. After his death in 1999, Spielberg assumed the mantle and has made this his tribute to his longtime friend and colleague. Set in the distant future, our story details the journey of an android boy's (Haley Joel Osment) search for love and acceptance. Osment, star of The Sixth Sense, is perfectly cast as the young robot child David. He is the first robot programmed to love human beings. Jude Law turns in a dizzying performance as Gigolo Joe, a robot prostitute who accompanies and aids David on his journey. Frances O'Connor is also quite convincingly heartfelt as Monica, the &quot;mother&quot; whose love David yearns to receive.The first act of the film is pure Spielberg as we see David coexist and ultimately exiled from his surrogate family. Spielberg's influence is clearly visible in the scenes between David and Monica. (Think E.T. and Elliott.)The late Stanley Kubrick's hand print is all over the film's second act. In the first scene, Law's Gigolo Joe is front and center as we witness him on a &quot;job&quot;. Although his female client is a bit reluctant and nervous, his tenderness and rationale overcome her inhibitions. There is another scene where Joe and David are captured and taken to a Flesh Fair. Here, rabid crowds cheer on as robots, or mechas as they're called, are destroyed on stage for entertainment. Spielberg successfully captures Kubrick's soul during these scenes.The film not only documents the clash between man/machine, but the clash between Spielberg's and Kubrick's ideologies is also evident. The running theme with Spielberg is that, though flawed, humans are basically decent. Kubrick, as shown in his past films: 2001, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, forces the viewer to deal with the darker side of humanity. Human beings are not inherently evil, but are more than capable of acting without regard for their fellow man.The final act is one that will cause audiences to either love or hate this film. Spielberg borrows from his own work in Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well as the final act of DePalma's Mission to Mars. To me, it seemed as though Spielberg ended the film this way because he couldn't allow Kubrick's vision to ultimately win. It's as if he tried Kubrick's &quot;acid&quot; and had a bad trip. Evidently, Spielberg's inner-child wouldn't allow audiences to go home completely dismayed.If not for the final act of this movie, I would have given this movie 5 stars. This is definitely a movie that will provoke conversation and re-examination of one's values.	4.0	A.I.: Artistic &amp; Insightful	2001-07-02	3	3	0

(robot)  It is a s-l-o-w movie.  I never did understand why his ""mother"" really chose to keep him.  It was predictable that his ""brother"" would re-enter the parents lives. David yearns to become a real boy after his trouble making ""brother"" insists on the book Pinnochio being read to them.  It was appalling when the ""mother"" took him to the middle of nowhere to dump off her responsibilities.  (reminded me of Hansel and Gretal meets Pinnochio)  He then searches to find the blue faerie to get back with the mother that abandoned him.  The most dependable character in this movie for David is this toy bear.  The bear's animation is incredible, that is why this movie even earns 1 star.  However, the bear is almost creepily real and I expected his to turn into an evil Chuckie doll at anytime.  The movie goes on and on, seemingly not knowing when to end, and when it does you are not even rewarded with a ""good feeling"" about the outcome.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2DB8OYWNBHGM9	Camelot Scorpio	&quot;A.I.&quot; is one of the best films of the year.  It's a gutsy, inventive, and visionary Spielberg-ian take on a story by the late Stanley Kubrick.  The story begins an uncredited narration that explains to us that greenhouse gases have melted the polar ice caps, thus flooding coastal cities such as Amsterdam, Venice, and New York.  And no, this isn't a remake of Waterworld.  In this cold future, mankind is busy creating life-like &quot;mechas&quot; that lack only emotion.  That is, until Professor Hobby (William Hurt) discovers that by mapping neurological impulses or something to that effect, mechas can be designed and programmed to have feelings.  20 months later, an employee under Hobby brings home David, the first of these feeling mechas (Haley Joel Osment).  Yadda yadda yadda, stuff happens, and after hearing &quot;Pinnochio&quot; as a bedtime story, David is left on his own to find the Blue Fairy and become a real boy.A lot of critics who dismissed this film are very biased, basically putting forth that &quot;A.I.&quot; isn't a good movie because it it's neither vintage Spielberg nor vintage Kubrick.  I actually found that the Spiel-brick formula makes it more intriguing and compelling.  Even when there was an obvious stylistic conflict, the acting (I guarantee Haley Joel Osment will no longer be referred to as &quot;the kid from 'The Sixth Sense'&quot;), the script, and ASTONISHING production kept my eyes glued to the screen.  The only other problem with the movie is that it doesn't quite know how where to end.  There were three different times the movie could've ended. I found this distracting and it took away from the film's real ending. But despite its forgivable flaws, &quot;A.I.&quot; is definitely the must-see movie of the summer.	4.0	Great movie	2001-07-02	8	7	1

A horrid, jumbled, cinematic throat gag, this movie started with such promise and simply continued to descend and unravel, managing to offend both my ethical and artistic sensibilities continually. Kubrick and Spielburg are simply too far apart in their means and ends, and the result is an abused audience that is constantly out of phase in an inconsistent and ineffectively constructed cinematic environment. The filmmakers couldn't decide what they needed to communicate, thus the plot merely nicks a plethora of morally challenging questions, but invests nothing. More telling (and far more annoying), since the plot didn't really know what it was trying to accomplish, Spielburg couldn't decide on an ending that would satisfy a purpose he apparently failed to define, and instead forced the audience to endure countless faux endings that only served to agitate.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AYOYZ5E3WC9UW	Carlos Alberto Meja Colindres	In one of A.I.'s most meaningful scenes, Gigolo Joe and David ask Dr. Know (a virtual oracle) about the blue fairy. After several unsuccessful queries, they try combining the &quot;Flat Fact&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tale&quot; categories. Dr. Know's answer is a poem that is not only the key for David's quest for the blue fairy, but the key to the film's true meaning as well: &quot;Come away, O human child/To the waters and the wild/With a faery, hand in hand/For the world's more full of weeping/than you can understand.&quot; Stanley Kubrick's work was about the struggle human beings have in controlling the beast within. He knew that, as a rule, the beast ends up showing up. On the other hand, Spielberg's films celebrate the exceptions to that rule. These are in no way mutually exclusive points of view. In fact, they are both the sides of the same coin. The best fairy tales manage to be hopeful and dark at the same time. They are simple and sweet on the surface, but complex and even terrifying underneath. A.I. is one of those tales. It's the best metaphor about the human condition ever put on film.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	Finally, a really intelligent movie by Stephen Speilberg that doesn't hammer at my heartstrings every three minutes on its way to blockbuster status.  My friend Joyce and I saw this at a matinee and we were the only two people in the theater.  Proof positive as far as I'm concerned that even the public noticed he had abandoned his usual overdose of schmaltz.  Perhaps this is so good because it is a hybrid work, inherited by Speilberg as the late Stanley Kubrick's project.  I found myself thinking throughout the film of many things but especially what it would be like to have an artificially created person, who was just like us, among us.  Superb actors were used. Haley Joel Osmont, who may be the best child actor ever, is wonderful as the boy who simply wants to be loved by his mother, who wasn't really his mother but he doesn't know that.  Jude Law is marvelous as a gigolo, who is also an artificial being, but you can tell his roots as a machine.  There is a qualitative difference between the Law character and Osmont character on how machine-like they are.  It is a heck of a directing and acting nuance.  The settings are superb as are the aliens who come into the picture towards the end.  Probably if Kubrick alone had made this film it would have been a lot more cynical.  Also, probably if Speilberg hadn't had Kubrick's influence, this would have been a lot more sentimental and schmaltzy.  By the two directorial giants coming together, the film itself benefitted by coming out just right.	5.0	Speilberg's Best Movie with Kubrick's Spirit Intact	2001-08-09	10	7	3

I am usually not very impressed with most movies - they are predictable, labored and just plain stupid.I saw the soft preview for the movie, with the ever-loving mother and son scenario.  Little did I know what I was in for.  I will not give anything away, but this movie will take you on quite a ride! You never knew what to expect next.  I went through the full range of emotions on this one.  I cried, I squirmed, I laughed, I was in awe!  The special effects are spectacular and seamless at the same time.  Some special effects are overdone and obvious - not here.  I would like to know how some of this was done!!A.I. is both a tug of both light and dark.  I wasn't left with an overwhelming sense of one feeling or another, but this movie will have you thinking about it for days.  It makes you think about life itself, the future, your mere exsistence!  Okay, I'm getting too deep here...While I was walking out of the theater, some people were obviously emotionally moved, while others felt drained, and disenchanted.  This movie has some very dark aspects that made me very uncomfortable, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 10.  Spielberg said he would let his 9 yr. old son see it, but after explaining some things first.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about this movie, and can't wait to see it again.  There is so much that goes on, and so much detail, that it is a must second-see!  This is an incredible, complex intelligent film that I highly recommend.

Monica is uneasy at first, but begins to &quot;love&quot; David, and she imprints her love on him using a series of words. This makes him love her, but after appearing to be a threat to Martin, he is dumped by his foster &quot;parents&quot; near their home in New Jersey. On his travels, he meets Gigolo Joe, a gigolo robot played by Jude Law, he escapes from a flesh fair that destroys robots, and he works his way to Manhattan in search for the blue fairy. David becomes trapped for 2,000 years, with a super teddy bear named Teddy being his only companion. He is rescued by extremely advanced robots, only to find that his mother is dead and the human race is extinct.A.I. is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and it is a masterpiece from the cooperative minds of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg.

It is really good and I recommend reading the short story it is based on: Brain Aldiss &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;.  Its a futuristic spin-off of Pinocchio - but don't let that fool you into thinking its a kid's movie, Disney has no place here.  Its very thought provoking, gut-wrenching and tear inducing, never mind the outstanding performances of Haley Joel Osmet and Jude 'Gigolo Joe' Law.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	"At one moment--hopefully VERY far in the future--the human race will cease to exist. Whether we survive long enough to evolve into something even more adaptive than homo sapiens is something this present generation cannot answer. But only human beings (as far as we know) can create machines that extend our capacities to ""compute"" information, and if we create machines that can feel pain--further, a machine with the capacity/drive to yearn to be more than it has been ""programmed"" to be--we will have created artificial life. This movie ultimately asks: can we, should we, create machines to carry on the memory or ""spirit"" of the human race? The race of robots at the film's end, I conjecture, are machines which were created by human beings to evolve themselves, but no longer have a living memory their own origins. They find David, and through the granting of his simple wish at the film's end there is an interface between the most basic human emotion and the pinnacle of human creation. Thus the ""spirit"" of humanity can become immortal, through its own genius? I don't know if this is the intended message (it's ambiguous yet uplifting like 2001), but this movie is fantastic in just about every way. The acting, art direction, music and visual quotes from Kubrick's earlier films all make it an emotionally rich and intellectually stimulating film. Forget the ""what-if-Kubrick-had made-it"" comparisons and enjoy a postmodern fairy tale that simultaneously asks serious questions about human destiny."	4.0	Postmodern Pinocchio	2002-01-03	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A314QIDIT0IS9Q	Charles M. Lee	"I think the problem that most people have with Sci - Fi is that Hollywood has so bastardized it that the true genre is lost. We have been bombarded with action movies posing as Sci Fi, until most of us think that Sci Fi has to be ladened with humongous explosions and tons of special effects. Thus, when a motion picture comes along that is true to the genre in its purest sense, it is not fully appreciated by many. This is one of the few films to come along in years that is pure Science Fiction.If takes a premise and explores it. What if we could make robots that seemed to love, and that seemed to have souls? What would happen? What moral issues would arise from this? ""What if"" is pure sci fi. The what if goes further and creates a scenario, not of good guys and bad guys, but of situations. The situations guide the characters and their actions. While not quite up to the standards of Asimov's ""I Robot"" (the book not the movie), this movie is a classic. I do not expect it to be recognized as such until years from now. We are in an age when accountants control what is on the screen and thus Sci Fi is reduced to silly action movies.In this movie, a little boy is created to be a son. Of course he is adopted by a set of parents who's child is for all intent and puposes dead. He is being kept alive by being frozen in a deep sleep. The mother and robot child start to bond, but then the entire foundation of their relationship is shattered. The robot child is abandoned and left to fend for himself. He sets out on a quest to become a real boy - okay okay there are over tones of pinnoocio. What some reviewers called contrived, I found to be very moving. Alas all of this is merely my opinion.Are the AI robots merely machines? Or have we created something different? Is their pain real or is it just bits and bytes? Is destroying them moral or is it murder? These are the type of questions good sci fi presents to the readers or viewers. Not ""will this explosion be bigger than the next?""If you like pure sci fi and not the Hollywood accountants assembly line non sense that is passing for it, you MAY like this film. All I can tell you is that I think it is a great sci fi story and I am grateful to finally see real sci fi return to the big screen."	5.0	Time Will Vindicate this Movie	2004-01-10	13	12	1

But when it's gone, it's gone. AI is watchable only for the remarkable Haley Joel Osment (who isn't seeing dead people in this movie, but he might as well have been) and the always splendid Jude Law. Hey, even the Teddy (as in mechanical teddy bear with functional intelligence) was good. The first half of the movie isn't terrible; the second half sinks like a stone. No amount of acting talent could rescue this turgid, overlong melodrama. Not even the return of those onion-headed, big-hearted stick people (from Close Encounters. Remember them?) could rescue this story. It's worth seeing for the special effects, and for Haley Joel and Jude Law. It has few other redeeming features.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3RRBPUGD7UOSP	"chemikalguy ""chemikalguy"""	This is the usual Kubrick film. Many people just wouldn't get it. I saw it because the trailers looked good, and I love sci-fi. The special effects in this film were awesome. I really liked the woman who is talking facing the camera, then turns away, revealing that she doesn't have a head, only a face mounted on a mechanical stalk. Pretty neat.Anyway, the film involves a family whose son is in cryogenic freeze because he has an illness with no known cure. They get the 'mecha' (Haley Joel Osment) as a 'replacement' for him. He gets himself into all sorts of trouble, as he is only a day or two old and is learning his boundaries. The mecha possess a program that will make them 'love' the person who reads a certain set of instructions to them. The mother ultimately reads these to him.Things get a bit crazy when the doctors tell the family that they've found a cure for the disease their biological son has. The son comes home from the hospital, and begins to wreak havok on the mecha.Eventually, he is dumped off on the side of the road, much like a pet that has grown to big for the house. The boy begins thinking that if he finds 'the blue lady', the entity who turned Pinocchio into a 'real boy', that he will be able to come home and stay with the family. He begins his search, and meets many people, both good and bad, along the way.The film had some great (and I don't use that word lightly) acting by both Haley Joel Osment, and by Jude Law. Both of them are fantastic actors. This type of film stretches the talents of actors, as they find that in many scenes they are talking to someone who really isn't there, because the person will eventually be added to the scene via computer animation. Robin Williams even makes an appearance as Dr. Know, a computerized magic 8 ball. That scene is one of my favorites of the film.If you want a movie that has more messages than a fortune cookie factory, rent this. Many of the messages will be lost if you only watch the film.

There was good character development.  There was a dramatic story line which kept you waiting for more.  It very very good cinematogrophy.  It had a very well done soundtrack by John Williams.  And the whole movie was well directed.  It is a futuristic retelling of Pinochio with a science fiction twist.  However two things are not good in the movie.  The first thing is the way Dr. Who looks.  He looks a bit silly for te way he was talked about in a poetic way by Jude Law.  And the final thing which I think every movie lover would agree with.  The ending was stupid.  It was like the whole movie is leading up to this finale which no one could expect and when we see it we raise our eyebrows.  I do not want to tell you the ending but I think that Spielberg should have ended the film when David the robot jumps in the water from the New York building.  Once you see the film you will agree with me.

Now, After waiting for AI on DVD, I watched it, and was *really* impressed. It was very compelling with lots of visuals and deep meaning to human emotions. I especially liked the idea of the toy robot, Teddy. Without getting too sweet, his part in the movie made me feel very comfortable, David had lots to understand about the real world and with Teddy being a guide for David, was an excellent piece to add into the film. Also, the acting is great! Haley Joel Osment is superb, as usual, so is the amazing Jude Law (gigolo joe), and very surprising was Frances O'Connor (david's mother) and William Hurt (david's creator). Both of them give very worthy performances in this film and gives additions in AI that deepens the realtionship between their characters and David. Therefore, AI is truly a movie that is sure to please both kids and adults.The DVD is also a great buy, lot's of information on the story and the characters.Not to Be Missed	4.0	Deep Story; Deep Movie	2002-03-24	3	2	1

It makes no sense??I had heard from a friend, that the movie was a disappointment.  I didn't care.  It was a KUBRICK idea.  Kubrick confided in Spielberg.  How could it possibly go wrong?Upon viewing it, I strongly disagreed with my friend.  The movie is beautiful.  A tremendous performance by Haley Joel Osment.  The images are unforgettable.  The story is heart-warming, yet disturbing at the same time.  The effects are fantastic, but low-key.Odd. Yes.  But what Kubrick movie isn't?  Kubrick had a unique vision.  That was what made him a genius.  Simple stories told in extraordinary situations.  Normal and relatable characters put in extranous situations.Spielberg directed A.i. after Kubrick suddenly passed away.  Yet, Spielberg managed to capture Kubrick's style in a lot of ways. The elaborate echoing sets that seem to put off a vibe of loneliness.  The feeling of entrapment and overpowerment by the authorities and corporations of the world around us.  Not to mention, the multi-layered characters.Yet, he still managed to keep a lot of his own.I personally think it's a fantastic mix.  Which, again, makes me wonder how this movie hasn't received more respect.Oscars or not, like all Kubrick movies, ten-years down the road, everyone will look back at A.i. and find a new respect for it.  Unlike most movies that come out these days.  Movies we forget twenty minutes after viewing.	5.0	A BEAUTIFUL AND DISTURBING VISION	2002-03-18	6	5	1

But not entertain. This isn't good old American escapism, it explores our human emotions deep down to its core. At the same time, it is a beautiful movie, with striking images and an amazing vision of the future, with a tight script and outstanding acting (why nobody from this film got an Oscar nom, I don't understand). It combines Kubrick's love of the bizarre with old-school Spielberg sappiness, and somehow manages to pull it all off.The story follows the life of a robot child named David, the first robot made to love. The First Act of the film shows David introduced to his human family, and all the strange conflicts of love, jealiousy, and even repulsion that occur. These scenes are utterly chilling and creepy while being strangely sweet, and they play on our emotions just as easily as David's programmed whispers of ""I love you, mommy"" confuse the emotionally precarious mother. In a scene that belongs in film history, the mother finally abandons David in the woods, and he clings to the car screaming as she drives away.In the Second Act, David joins with Gigilo Joe, and a robotic teddy bear to embark an quest, sort of like a twisted sci-fi vision of the Wizard of Oz. The Third Act catapults us 2000 years into the future, when super-robots discover David in a block of ice. While this future is beautiful and fun to explore, these story sequences aren't nearly as interesting as the first third of the film, and yet there are many many interesting throw-away shots and min-stories which can hold your attention. Spielberg consistantly blurs the difference between humans and robots, and when new characters are introduced the audience is left wondering ""is its real?"" for more than a few seconds. The acting performances are consistantly brilliant. Not a single bad actor in the film, to be truthful. Jude Law is unfortgetable, and Haley Osment is so good he puts adult actors to shame.Many have said this movie is both brillant and flawed, and I can agree. There is simply too much to digest the first time you see it. Also, the pacing of the movie is all wrong, and some of the greatest climaxes come early in the film. All this makes for an excellent DVD, though! Now you can simply watch the moments that you feel like, and not sit through the entire saga.THE DVD - is okay, but not great. Spielberg does not give audio commentaries for his movies, which is a tremendous crime for filmmakers now and in the future. The ""making of"" documentaries are numerous and detailed, but with a film this complex, I discovered that they simply do not tell us enough. The audio and visual quality of the DVD is excellent."	5.0	It's OK to dislike a good movie...	2002-03-18	77	70	7

The only good thing about it was Osments performance. He is truely amazing. But the movie...I thought it would never end. I left the theater feeling so let down and depressed. Definatly not a &quot;feel good&quot; movie. The ending was so far fetched and rediculous that I was laughing to myself.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2001ZBP6FDDB0	Christopher Bladon	This movie isn't terrible but because it comes from two great directors, the bar must be raised a bit.  At it's back-bone, the movie relies on a series of plot-points that are contrived to push your emotional buttons.  The first is when the robot designers claim that the big question when designing a robot is &quot;will it be loved&quot; - oh, please.  This is NOT the &quot;big question&quot; in brain AI development.  The real &quot;big questions&quot; are ones like: &quot;will an AI brain develop a soul&quot; and &quot;what are the moral implications of shutting off an AI brain.  The question of love is just a typical application of &quot;Spielberg's special sauce&quot; to make you cry in the end.Next, the imprinting burn-in - another rediculous contrivance.  An AI brain as sophisticated as the boy's would behave like a real boy. It would develop attachment like an orphan adopted into a family - over time by mental imprinting - not some half-baked process like entering your serial number whilst installing Photoshop.Now, remember that the parents signed up for this experimental robot-boy with the &quot;Dad's&quot; company.  Why then did the &quot;mom&quot; dump the boy in the forest?  Didn't she realise that the company was going to wonder where their $80 billon robot was?  Why couldn't she just give it back to the company?  Maybe because this begs the very interesting question, &quot;what are they going to do with it then?&quot;  But this movies carefully avoids these and other interesting questions.What about the robot hunters?  Why are they flying in a futuristic balloon?  Why not one of the many cool flying cars in the movie?  And how about their &quot;futuristic&quot; bounty-hunter lingo?  Is this clich&eacute; dialog Spielberg or Kubric?  I guess it doesn't matter - it's bad both ways.Let's jump to the end.  The ET-looking-people have travelled the countless zillions of light-years, settled on the earth, and can bring &quot;Mom&quot; back to life but only for 1 day!  This is the final blow.  After witnessing this, I felt used.CONCLUSION:Instead of being achieving a kind of gestalt effect, &quot;AI&quot; suffers from it's association with both of it's great directors. It not only fails to address REAL questions of AI, it avoids them.  The periodic introduction of contrivances makes it painful and sometimes laughable to watch.  There is really no end to the movie.  It just kind of slows to a full and complete stop.	2.0	contrivances and clich&eacute;s; no real AI	2004-06-13	15	5	10
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A7C2XWQKK8OB1	Christopher Brandon	Kubrick's icy cold intellect and Spielberg's cheery sentimentality play tug-of-war in this Pinocchio tale of a robot boy who just wants to be made human. For the first two acts, it works tremendously. Hefty emotions drive the mother/robot child relationship, and nice effects imagine a stunning future world in which the polar icecaps have melted. But all that comes to a screeching halt in the inexplicable third act that feels as if someone stopped the projector and started a completely different movie.

And after waiting and looking for more for over 2 hours, I was rewarded with such a muddled ending that the writer forced his characters (synthetic at that) to overexplain the simplest details. I thought it was much more a monument to self-indulgence and self-centeredness than to any vision of what love and reality are about.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Ever have one of those situations where somebody's telling a joke or a funny situation that you saw/heard/experienced but there's something about the way they're telling it that's a little off-center? Late Stanley Kubrick probably would've felt that about A.I., a film that was in development in his mind for a long time but since passed away so buddy and fellow filmmaker Steven Spielberg took over. You can see the blend which is probably what makes it a bit off-center.It's a question that bears repeating: if we create something, how much investment emotionally do we put into it? And if that thing we created can love us, do we have to love it back? We've created simple machines to do menial tasks because they're too much of a strain on us apparently that we almost have a ""we can build things even if we don't have to"" and make our lives easier when you think what if it becomes too automated and we can't do a thing.With that piece of ranting, we come to the story of A.I. David, a mecha(another word for robot) is the first of its kind, the first that can actually love someone. He is then introduced to a married couple who's son is in a coma. At first, the mother doesn't accept him until she eventually does and makes the robot imprint on her so she's gonna always be on his mind. However the son comes home and rivalry ensues. To avoid David being destroyed, she abandons him in the woods.Accompanied only by his moving talking thinking teddy bear(appropriately named Teddy), he's off on a quest inspired by his mother's reading of Pinocchio: to find the Blue Fairy and turn him into a real boy so his mother will love him again. His quest will take him into a Flesh Fair, where robots are dismantled and destroyed for sport and entertainment to Rouge City, a kind of futuristic Las Vegas to the end of the world, a flooded Manhattan.Performance wise, it's quite good. Child prodigy/annoying runt depending on who's seeing it, Haley Joel Osment pulls off that robot with a purpose attitude perfectly and shows some nice emotion like when his mother abandons him. Jude Law has the sidekick Gigalo Joe, basically a male escort love robot, is quite perfect as that kind of bouncy spirited type who acts like he had a bit too much sugar. Some people find Teddy a bit creepy due to his monotone voice but it fit perfectly and how could you not love a walking talking bear? Wish my bear did that when I was little.There's a scene in which the creator of David, a professor tells him(this is the gist of it) is it a flaw to hunt down things that may or may not exist or is that what makes us special: the ability to chase our dreams even if they're extravagant? It's a nice question. Is it foolishness for us to chase down what we want even if it can't be done or is it great that we have the ability and probably the resources for it?It's looking at A.I. because the melding of 2 different types of filmmakers is on screen and you have to wonder if it gels properly. Kubrick I find was always a detached and kind of cold filmmaker while Spielberg likes the fantastical and is at times a bit too sentimental so A.I. has scenes that would be unsettling if it wasn't robots and there's a certain coldness but it does have that more sentimentality that Spielberg likes. Whether or not it all makes a great movie is up for debate but personally, it's interesting to watch even if you don't know what to think of it."	4.0	It's interesting to watch but it's missing something	2005-04-09	4	2	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQXFJLHW7BFLU	Como Gomez	Given the title, I would guess that Kubrick's intention in starting this project was to introduce the film world to the metaphysical and ethical questions that life-appoximating machines would raise.  The only philosophical question raised by Spielberg's product, however, is whether artificial intelligence might one day correct real stupidity.  While I'm sure Teddy, the talking teddy-bear, was Kubrick's idea, (yeah right), I doubt Kubrick would have approved of the Chris Rock and Robin Williams cameos (which say it all).  In my view this film is a cynical insult to movie fans.  But as would be Ricky Martin finishing a Beethoven score, it's a triumph for false consciousness everywhere.	1.0	Sad and evil film	2002-03-15	9	2	7
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A23CELC1PWB219	Continuity Fan XT-Alpha	Movies exist to entertain us, to make us happy, to give us relief from our tedious boring lives or to give us something interesting to think about. Even movies with sad endings fulfil at least one of these purposes but AI Artificial Intelligence was extremely depressing for every minute of its 146 min length.Artificial Intelligence is set in a future world where rising oceans have sunk many of the world's coastal cities. Humans have created androids to be prostitutes, nannies, etc. The androids are very intelligent and can feel emotions but have virtually no rights. They are hunted and slaughtered by fanatical humans who serve as antagonists in the movie.The story is about an android boy seeking the love of his human mother. It was hopeless right from the beginning. David seems like an ordinary child but his behaviour is inhuman in a very subtle way (excellent acting by Haley Joel Osment). David is programmed to love his mother unconditionally but he is manipulated by his human brother into making some very big mistakes. Feeling sorry for him, his mother abandons David, instead of sending him back to the factory to be disassembled. He spends the rest of the movie wandering around, looking for the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy. He's accompanied by an android gigolo and an intelligent teddy bear that do their best to put some comic relief into this dreary movie.Artificial Intelligence is supposed to be a story about the human inability to love anyone who is different. David is impossible not to feel sorry for. No one deserves what happened to him. Monica seems really evil for failing to love David after making him love her. But the real sin is getting David in the first place. Humans are not supposed to love machines. It's unnatural. It's wrong. If our lovers and children are replaced with machines it can only lead to the inevitable extinction of the human race. It may be immoral to kill sentient beings but the Flesh Fairs are doing the right thing. They instinctively see the androids as a threat to the survival of their race and for good reason. The real tragedy in this movie is not David's personal story, but the fact that androids will gradually overcome humanity's instinctual revulsion as they become more human-like and humanity will condemn itself to a slow, lingering death.The movie's ending is happy, sad and very bizarre at the same time. This is a movie that will leave an unpleasant feeling in your mind long after it's over.	3.0	Watch this movie if you are excessively happy	2007-08-14	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2ZJBECS81I3HU	Corey Mudd	Brilliant movies make you question.  And this is a brilliant movie.  The reason this movie is great is obviously the acting, special effects, story, and of course, the two masterminds behind this project.  What make this movie brilliant, though, are the questions raised and finally answered as the long epic ends.  There are many of these in this movie and most have been reflected here.  However, I feel one important quandary has been left untouched.  The question:  Can the creator, whose creation was made to love the creator, love the creation?  This may raise some eyebrows, as this can be analogous of God as creator and humans as the creation.  If you do not want to read, as some may perceive as blasphemous, please refrain from reading any further, this is only my opinion.  My words will be judged when it is my time.  I just feel I need to say something, to get this off my chest.The answer to this question is answered throughout the movie but really reaches finality when the epilogue ends, even though some may say an unnecessary epilogue.  My conclusion is that the answer is straightforward in the movie and tells us: No, the creator may be fooled into loving its creation for a while but in the end, the creator will not truly love its creation.  The creator will always be reminded that the creation is artificial.  You are to recognize throughout the movie that this is a robot but in some instances you may be fooled by its looks or its love.  Some people, notably film critic Roger Ebert, did not buy into these facades; this may be a flaw in the movie for some but shouldn't be the reason why not to recommend the film, it seems naive to do so...	5.0	Great Movies Make You Think...	2002-05-25	6	4	2

Was it a fairy tale? A dark twist on that genre? It alternated between polar opposites too drastically to be coherent, and managed to be boring all the while.Other elements came out of left field (&quot;Then a thousand years go by and hyper-intelligent robots make everything all better!&quot;) interrupting what little narrative flow there was. I like to be surprised, not flabbergasted.Another Steven Spielberg film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; is my favorite movie, and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1AE95BSQFQWI7	Cowoth	Well, this is definitley another film that failed to lived up to its hype.  Th ebiggest problem with this film is its direction.  I think its like mixing coke with cheese when u put Spielberg and Kubrick together, the show tries to convey a lot of messages, but ends up looking like it over-reached and fell over backwards.As a Sci Fi film, the plot is full of holes at best, quite lame at its worst.  Since the film is only about one robot, it doesnt set how everything fits together in this futuristic world, or the overall impact of the theme on society.However, kudos again to Haley for an excellent screen performance.  The acting in the film was simply quite superb.  If there is anyone born to act, then its gotta be this kid.While the film left no particular impression, its probably a good date movie or for snuggling with your gf on some Firday night.  It seems to be a huge tear jerker for the girls.Myself, I prefer Bicentenniel Man starring Robin Williams.  Definitely better development and better overall movie to me.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3VDGERHHLOQVQ	Crabby Apple Mick Lee	"At least part of the scientific community has an intense interest in the possibility of artificial intelligence and that interest is reflected as an obsession among some science fiction writers and devotees.  I have a casual relationship at best with the sciences myself and I generally find science fiction not to my taste.  There are exceptions.  I thought ""Blade Runner"" was one of the finest films made.  But I emphasize that ""Blade Runner"" is an exception in my book.  ""Blade Runner"" rises above much of the rest of science fiction because although the film seems to be about robots it is clear by the end the film is a mediation on the human condition in the face of death.  The problem with A.I. is that there is no such reflection on the human condition; instead, the concern is about the future welfare for the fantastic machines we may build in the future.Many in the scientific community believe that people are essentially ""walking machines""-fantastic ""machines""-but ""machines"" nonetheless.  What is meant by this is the rejection of any notion of a ""spirit"" which animates the body.  We are simply collections of atoms which evolved over great stretches of time-a complex amalgam of conditioned stimulus and response reactions.  Moreover, it is believed that consciousness and thinking as we commonly think of them are really illusions-they are no more than physical chemical interactions within the body.  In fact, the notion we have of something called ""I"" is also just an illusion.  There really is no ""I"" and educated men and women really shouldn't take the concept seriously except as a way of speaking.  Philosophically, this is known as ""radical materialism"".If you accept these premises, then one can believe it is possible to one day create a ""thinking/feeling"" machine, which very much resembles a human being.  Indeed, such a machine could one day be regarded as very much the same thing as a human being.  And why not?  If one assumes that there is no ""ghost"" in the machines we call human beings then we can dispense with any concern that these fantastic machines we will build may need a ""soul"" to be regarded as ""real"" beings.  Thus since we will be essentially equal we need to care about their dignity and well being.In science fiction we as the reader just have to accept that certain assertions in the text are ""just so"".  But when a serious ""real world"" message is being made we have to question the foundations that message is laid upon.  Much has been made of the similarity between the story in Artificial Intelligence and the story of Pinocchio.  But a comparison of the two stories only shows how different they are.  In A.I., David is made by human beings.  David is much like other robots these humans have made except he is programmed to have ""feelings"" and ""affections"".  David's dependence and love for his human ""mother"" are imprinted and programmed in-once so imprinted it is irreversible.  David's ""human mother"" is essentially ""his"" as long as David exists.  If something goes wrong and David's human parents no longer want him, he must be returned to the manufacturer to be deactivated.In Pinocchio, a wooden puppet is made to live by a magical spiritual being.  Although it is not explicitly stated, we understand that the wooden Pinocchio has been given a spirit or soul.  Pinocchio's affections and feelings do not have to be programmed in because they are real aspects of his soul.  Both Pinocchio and David want to be real boys.  Both feel deprivation with the separation from their ""human parents"".  The message of Artificial Intelligence seems to be we should be very careful in building artificial beings because we may develop creatures who are essentially like us except we will feel free to subjugate them and submit them to inhuman cruelties.  Pinocchio's message in part is a Christian one.  It's message is that our human failings lie not in our ""flesh"" as the Gnostics believe but in our souls.  Because Pinocchio had a soul he was ""real"" and he was capable of real human failings and greatness.  In Christianity, wood is a symbol for man.  The Great Carpenter fashions men to His purposes.Human beings have long had a fondest for their tools.  While men and women often treasure their tools and inventions, they have never regarded them as equals to themselves.  If one believes the only beings that really matter are those with spirits or souls, it is unclear why we should care about ""machines"" with the intensity Spielberg and company want us to.  Moreover, there are serious doubts that ""artificial intelligence"" as they mean it is possible.The message of the film is that like an unwanted baby it would be better if such a ""thinking/feeling machine"" were never brought into the world.  But the more serious question is is the ""lack"" in that unwanted ""baby/machine"" or is it is our hearts?  Exploring that question would have given us a far different film."	2.0	SERIOUSLY FLAWED	2004-04-19	5	0	5

But he tried too hard to make this film reminiscent of the work of Stanley Kubrick, who began the film before his death. About an hour into the movie, the story takes an almost tangible turn from Spielberg's world of warm and heartfelt, tear jerking fantasy to the grim un-reality and horrific science-fiction underworld of Kubrick, whose passion for the underbelly of storytelling definitely has a place in the film world, just not in this particular movie. Closer to the end of the movie, an attempt to bring the two opposing ends of the spectrum together backfires, leaving the audience with benefit-of-the-doubt thoughts like, ""Maybe no one could figure out the best way to end it,"" or, ""Maybe he meant to end it an hour ago and the camera just didn't shut off."" Either way, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is definitely not a feat of fine movie-making, apart from the captivating, however misplaced, special effects and the brilliantly mastered talent of Haley Joel Osment, who stars."	2.0	MIA: The plot, which goes AWOL early in the story	2002-03-19	4	2	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A72S4SWJWIBCV	Cutre	"Ok, ok, first of all, I don't see this movie as a modern Pinocchio. This movie, as other great science fiction films, I think it deals with the identity topic. Philip K. Dick once wrote a story named ""Do Adroids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"", and that story would later inspire the movie Blade Runner. And Blade Runner has a lot more similarities to this film than Pinocchio, simply because it deals with the idea of artificial intelligence. How do we respond to this great advance of technology?David, the young robot created to be an adoptive child for couples, knows he was artificially created. Because of that, his new parents aren't sure he can actually have feelings, so they treat him like a toy. His ""mom"" is even affraid of starting to love David because ""it's only a machine"". And there are people around who even enjoy destroying these robots, known as ""mechas"", while the ""orgas"" are the human beings.So David starts a search for a way to become a ""real"" boy so his mommy can love him. And during his search, he only receives the help of a classy Gigolo (Jude Law) and a little mecha teddy bear (one of the finest things about the movie) and during his search, he realizes of a few important things about himself, about his identity, and about the fear of mankind to the uknown. This take us to the climax of the movie, which many people thought it wasn't as good as the rest of the film, but I think it's the perfect ending. And no, people, IT IS NOT a happy ending. If you still think so, maybe you didn't get the point of the film.This movie is not great because of its special effects, it is not great because it is a Spielberg film, and it sure isn't great because of Haley Joel Osment. Yes, they sure are good elements, but what makes this movie exceptional is the storyline. Its premise, pure and simple. But that's my humble opinion, though.

If your looking for a big action sci-fi you will not find it in A.I., but if you open your mind (and heart) to what the story is saying then you will find yourself at the end of the movie wondering about what our actual future may be like.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	Hey, I'm shocked, too, to be beating up on this film. I figured I'd love it.I wonder how much Stanley Kubrick would have changed AI had he lived to make this film, as he supposedly planned to do? Although I also wonder if given Kubrick's record of starting into a project and then moving onto another without completing his last work---such as his long-awaited but never-made 1970's Napoleon bioflick---would AI truly ever have been shot at all? As he's indicated was the case, Steven Spielberg was perhaps being honorable in sticking as closely as possible to the vision and script of his hero as it was written at the time of Kubrick's death, but I can't help but wonder how much (or little) AI would have resembled the final product we encountered in this version. AI was not a movie I enjoyed, and that surprised me. It felt hollow, it wasn't endearing or satisfyingly alienating, either, and it will never justly be dubbed a classic. Its minuscule plot was twisted around itself until it was like some sort of coiled wire, and its outcome in those famous last twenty minutes was simply terrible. AI was slow-moving, visually underwhelming, not thought provoking, not well fleshed out, and if it wasn't for Jude Law's sexbot character adding interest to the production, I'd go so far as accuse AI of being a waste of time in its entirety.	2.0	Behold!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UCT83QM8N71X	Dan Duncan	Spielberg has given the parent/child puzzle an epic scale, but without the preachiness of the red raincoat in Schindler. Anyone who has ever faced the mystery of individual identity and the double mystery of being the child of a parent or the parent of a child, will be more challenged than comforted by this film.Everyone we know has a mommy and a daddy, biologically if not emotionally. But, what if the emotional element were to be somehow replicated without the biological? At the same time, everyone you know is going to die. What happens to the love you feel for another once you are not here anymore?These are some of the issues that Spielberg evokes without explaining or preaching. At the same time he incorporates both his genius for showing the conflict of personal intensity in relationship as well as his sense of impersonal awe in the epic sense of time as the film progresses.This film is a proper sequel to 2001, not in plot, but in exploration of the significance of life as we sometimes are lucky enough, in rare moments, to understand and then pursue.	5.0	The Epic Significance of Love	2002-02-17	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A16F2K8VG7GDS9	"Daniel Friedman ""dfja17"""	A.I. is one of those coulda-woulda-shoulda movies.  I love Steven Spielberg and I've never believed that he deserved the bad rap he had among &quot;serious&quot; filmmakers as simply a popcorn moviemaker, but there are points in his career where even admirers have to admit that he goes over the line when it comes to sentimentality and sappiness.  Sometimes it works (as in E.T. although I guess I'm the one person who didn't care for it) and sometimes it doesn't (as in Hook).  Even in those cases, there are plenty of things about the films that make them at least worth a viewing, but A.I. is the first Spielberg film where I just couldn't wait for it to be over.For those who may disagree, let me just say first that I did indeed &quot;get it&quot;.  That aside, I found the film to be tedious and pedantic and running at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to.  Yes, it's a simple story but it doesn't mean that the characters can't have nuances and devices to make them more than just the one-dimensional characters they were.  Okay, you could argue, but they were supposed to be - they were robots.  That's true too, but Jude Law stands out as the truly memorable character because, even though he was a robot, he showed that he could respond to the situations around him more convincingly.So why did I give three stars instead of two or one?  Because Spielberg, in his genius, still managed to hook me and get me to react emotionally to David's plight.  I can't remember the last time I saw a sci-fi tearjerker.  I suppose if were a little younger and single I might have reacted differently, but being a parent can't help but force reactions to a boy who is abandoned by his family and spends the rest of the film trying to get them back.  This is also a common Spielberg theme and, as mentioned previously, sometimes he makes it work and sometimes he doesn't.  I hated myself for falling for it, but sometimes you tip your hat to the filmmaker for pulling it off.Also, as is typical with Spielberg, the effects are tremendous.  Although it's fantasy, everything appears plausible and realistic.  True dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi fans will probably enjoy this film more than I did.  I can't help wondering what it would have been like had Kubrick made it himself.	3.0	Uneven	2004-04-14	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1EFS5PV3HOFDI	"Danielle Muller ""Shulamith"""	A.I is a wonderfully, emotional movie about one boys journey through the world to find acceptance and what makes us who we are. The truth of the matter that the only real thing that makes human's what we are is the capability to love.Haley Joel Osment is exceptionally brilliant as the young Android that is given to a family as a replacement for their injured son until he gets better. But heaven only lasts so long for Osment, and soon he finds himself at the center of the family's son jealousy. He is sent away where he finds himself on the run for his life as he escapes from robot flesh festivals and those sent to capture or destroy him. All the while, Haley is trying to find away to become real so that his 'Mother' will love him like she did her real son.Jude Law is also spectacular in his own role as the pleasure giving Android who finds Haley and vows to help him find his way to the city at the edge of the world. Where the blue fairy can turn boys into humans and make his mother love him. What happens will leave you crying as the film unfolds for its a film of intense emotions and and one boy's desires to just be loved.Originally the film was to have ended with Haley stuck at the bottom of the ocean that flooded New York. Alone with Teddy, staring at the everlasting smiling blue Fairy, but Spielberg (My hero) stepped in and decided the ending was just to depressing. So it was changed, and I believe that it is ten times better than if it had just been left. Definatly more emotional, but better nevertheless.Humanity will never look the same again.	5.0	The modern day Pinocchio	2005-05-01	5	2	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A30FXUXQZBDTAD	"""dansgroove"""	Before you read on this review will probably contain spoilers, you've been warned. But if you are reading this you are probably like me, you just got out of the theater and you are not exactly sure what to think.As you probably know the story takes place in the distant future and the main chacter, David, is the first robot child built to love.  The movie chronicles his journey, a journey based on the fairy tale Pinnochio.  The movie is told in three parts, somewhat like Kubricks masterpiece 2001, the first &quot;act&quot; is an introduction to David as we watch him grow as we watch him love,we are also introduced to the best furry sidekick ever(better that Star Wars Chewbacca) Teddy, David's stuffed bear, and like David an intelligent robot.  David although is dropped and left in the forest with Teddy, David believes that if he becomes a real boy his mother will want him back.  Thus he begins his search for the Blue Fairy.  Act two follows the classic style of a three act piece and becomes dark and scary, we are taken away from the pleasent home life shown earlier, and dropped into a setting similar to Blade Runers Los Angeles.  We are also introduced to Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, as well as a large cross sampling of amazing robots. Law is incredable as Joe, who is not just a simple love machine, he is passionate, caring, and intelligent.  Joe travels with David as he searches for the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy so he can return home.  This leads them to the sunken Man-hatten (to understand that you have to see the movie) where he finds his creator Will Hurt who tells him that he is &quot;as real a boy as I have ever made.&quot;  But discovering he is not unique he leaves and travels underwater with Teddy, where in sunken Coney Island he finds the blue fairy-a statue.  Where he stays praying for years and years and years-2000 to be exact. In act three, like in 2001, all that we know goes out the window. And I will not describe it because you have to see it.  But it was one of the only scenes in a movie ever that has made me tear up.Many reviews I have read have said that the humans are unfeeling and empty, but I believed it worked because it was amazing that the robot was more human than the humans, full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions.  Haley Joel Osment is wonderful.The film is filled with amazing scenes, many of which you can tell were Kubric inspired, the most gripping of which is definatly the Flesh Fair, a circus where robots are destroyed in painful ways as entertainment, have I mentioned that the robots feel pain.  The robots in this scene are techniocally amazing, and the preceeding scene where this group of rag tag bots are fixing themselves with scrap pieces is technically astonishing.And while scenes like that probably came from Kubricks origional vision there are also some scenes that are very Speilberg.  Many of which have to do with David's interactions with his mother.All of this comes together as a masterpiece, the music by John Williams is great, the special effects ffrom ILM are top notch, the acting is superb, and the story is emotional and though provoking.PS: The Jeannie Salla mystery continues...	5.0	IN A DISTANT FUTURE.....	2001-06-29	5	3	2

The pool side scene with the kids made me cringe; I could imagine kids hassling a gay companion that way.  Also: who in their right mind would allow a child to sit and watch the red necks pouring acid  on etc. and other wise mutilating robots?  I had to turn my face when the nanny was being murdered. Too much.  This is Spielberg?  I do not want to go see another one of his movies if this is characteristic of his work.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg originally teamed to produce &quot;AI: Artificial Intelligence&quot; years ago.  In the meantime, Kubrick died.  Therefore, Spielberg was left to produce by himself.  Despite this tragedy, he continued to perform at his full capability, genius.  He also directed and wrote this movie wonderfully.He hired a wonderful crew of actors to express the movie's emotion.  David, played by Haley Joel Osment, is a robot whose unusual advancement makes him look like a real boy.  He yearns for his mother's love during his quest.  Finding the fairy who will turn him to a real-life boy is his goal.  Once finished, he can return home to his mother, who'll love him more because of his change.  David's hard times express the stereotypes robots are faced in his world.***This is not the actual storyline.  This is based on a quote that David said within the first hour of the movie.Haley Joel Osment proves on this movie role that he is one of the best young actors of today.  His acting evolution from &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; to &quot;AI&quot; proves that someday, he'll be the next Tom Hanks.  Jude Law brilliantly plays a robot who's highly popular toward women.  All other actors, major or minor roles, also act their emotions wonderfully.The visual effects are marvelous.  Few computer artists can achieve such spectacular buildings and lights.  This is seen in the &quot;city of love&quot;.  Underwater New York City is recreated resembling the real town.  The characters toward the end are wonderfully crafted; however, revealing them would reveal the end.Though not Steven Spielberg's best work, it's still entertaining.  One may have to watch twice to truly further appreciate &quot;AI&quot;.  The first viewing may seem confusing, but after the second, the missing pieces fit together as one masterpiece.	4.0	Great Stanley Kubrick commemoration	2003-08-08	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"As the decade is winding down to the half-way mark I will say in all honesty that this may be one of the best pictures of the new century.  I am hopeful in years to come that people will come to appreciate this collaboration between directors Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick.  This story was originally conceived by Kubrick and in his inherent wisdom he did not feel that he had the right mindset to direct this film.  Kubrick was a tad cynical about humanity whereas Spielberg was a bit more optimistic about mankind.  Spielberg imbued this film with a heart that Kubrick could not.  The story, about a robot who is programmed to love and then discarded when he becomes an inconvenience is a good one.  The odyssey that the robot,(Haley Joel Osment), takes is fraught with wonder and pitfalls in his search for the elusive ""Mommy""(Frances O'Connor).  The art direction and special effects here are spell-binding as well as another solid score from John Williams.  The film would not work if not for the impeccable acting of Osment who, as the central character of this film, has to make you believe in ""David"".  The work he does here is more impressive than his Oscar nominated turn in ""The Sixth Sense"".  If his character is unbelievable the film just plain doesn't work.  O'Connor does a solid turn as ""Mommy"".  Jude Law gives another outstanding character turn as ""Gigolo Joe"", the pleasure android.  Also, I just adored the robot toy ""Teddy"".  I wish I could get one for Christmas.  This is a film where audiences(and critics) had certain pre-conceived expectations and may have been disappointed with what was delivered.  I think viewers should re-visit(or visit) ""A.I."" and just accept it for what it is."	5.0	One of Spielberg's Best	2004-11-20	2	0	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ADOPC4VRUJCX4	"David B. Hutchison ""The Book Tavern"""	"After reading many of the reviews of this film, I am suprised at the number of people who feel the movie is about a robot.  Often people seem to bring up the issue of whether or not a robot can love.  But the real subject matter of this film isn't technology.  It's love.  Human love.  The movie challenges our archaic and Puritanical aspiration to display Divine Love.  It shows that love is very hungry.  Love needs.  Love seeks love.  The theme of the nature of human love is consistently explored throughout the film.  First through the relationship of Monica and David.  The mother/child relationship is the first expression of human love.  At this point, perhaps you're tempted to say, ""but he's a robot!!""  But David is not a robot.  Created by man but the express image of man.  Therefore, all David's responses and provocations may be seen as representative of our own reactions and choices.  David is us.  The movie provides an important context for public discourse on the nature of love.  This next part is a spoiler, but I want to leave you with an illustration from the film.  Near the end when David discovers his ""twin"" (rather, discovers himself as that is how David sees it) and literally kills himself, the god-man, the Doctor, in cold selfishness leaves his ""creation"" to serve his own interests.  How often have we treated love in this way?  The person we claim to love has just destroyed a piece of themselves.  Their security and esteem lie dead on the floor.  And we serve our own purposes.  But David loved.  Love is not always beautiful.  Sometimes it is jealous.  It's hunger never ends.  And when a society refuses to satisfy it's need for love, jealousy begets violence and suffering.  Surely David suffered as he sat watching himself dead on the floor.  The movie is rich with material of this nature.  It is an important film for Americans.  It addresses issues we continuously refuse to admit exist.  In effect, viewers were so psychologically challenged, felt so uncomfortable, and decided they didn't like the film.  Another judgement on the emptiness of American spirit that only finds expression when a madman destroys those we believe are ""our own"".  Reminds me of the old south.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	The story of a robot boy searching for the mother he was programmed to love. This film raises a fascinating question that we may have to answer for ourselves one day--at what point does a being become deserving of human rights? We faced this question back in the days of slavery and the genocide of Native Americans and did not exactly cover ourselves with glory then. As a society, we have decided that animals do not have rights, although we may lavish them with affection. If we are ever able to create human simulations that also mimic our human responses perfectly, what kind of treatment will they deserve?This is an exceptional film in many respects. The cast, particularly Haley Joel Osment, is excellent, as are the set design and direction. Many people have been disquieted by the combination of Stephen Spielberg's sentiment with Stanley Kubrick's more cerebral approach. I thought they complimented each other rather well. Spielberg sometimes pulls at the heartstrings far too insistently, and I was afraid that the subject matter of this film would lead into his worst excesses. Rather, he was able to smooth the edges of what would probably have been a much colder film if Kubrick had lived to finish it. For example, I'd bet that the character of Teddy was Spielberg's addition. Did Kubrick's vision really need to be softened? Probably not. I'm sure he could have produced a fascinating film from this material. But this is the film that was made. And it is very good.	4.0	The nature of humanity	2001-09-08	4	1	3

I had no sympathy for any of the charcters and the plot becomes so muddle so obviously pretentious that I could barley watch it. It is like watching a potperri of film clips from Close Encouters, Blade Runner and Love Story! To bad Speilberg allowed himself to indulge himself in this melodrama. It supposes to move you into a feeling relationship to the charcters and their life adventure and instead does just the oppisite.

Haley Joel Osment did a fine acting job as a robotic boy, named David, who was remarkably realistic and who was programmed to have human emotions. He became programmed to love his  human ""Mommy"" who adopted him. However, conflicts with her husband and real son led her to an agonizing decision.Like Pinocchio, David wants to become a real boy. In fact, David is familiar with the story of Pinocchio, and many references are made to it, which takes any subtlety away from the parallels between the two. In David's quest, we see much gratuitous cruelty as other humanlike robots are sadistically destroyed while David continues on his quest. If the movie was more entertaining, I suppose I would have tolerated it more despite it's lack of any discernable point. Unfortunately, the movie tended to drag at points. The reason I saw this movie, in the first place, is because it kept comming up as a recommendation on my Amazon welcome screen.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2119HJPLN350K	David F	This movie is Sci-Fi/Drama with a hint of Fantasy and Fairy Tale.  Expect laughter, expect tears, expect a bit of the unexplainable; it will crawl into your heart in a very unique way.  This concept by Stanley Kubrick will play on your heart with a little boy robot, whose only fault, like the former 2001 computer Hal 9000, is that he is exposed to sensations and information that he interprets in unpredictable and dangerous ways, sometimes to his credit, sometimes to his peril.We see a lot of historical overtones and issues in this story.  Man, who once put his fellow men into the arena for barbaric slaughter games, recounts this episode with robots, who are too many in a world of people.  Morality is at issue on the premise of how real can a robot can feel.  &quot;Did not God create Adam to love Him?&quot;  states David's creator, Professor Hobby.  Adam's eyes were opened to the world of sin when he ate the forbidden fruit, David's eyes are opened to the real world to which he is plundered.  The forbidden fruit is a place at the end of the world to which David quests himself, along with his friends Teddy Bear and Gigolo Joe.  Here he meets his destiny in the eyes of his creator, and the eyes of something else his circuits were not designed to experience.  He finds what he seeks, but not in the way you'd expect.  Fault to anyone who reveals what brought tears to my eyes at the movie's end.I would recommend this movie in good rating.  I am not easily touched to a story-line on a 2-D screen, albeit 3-D sound, but Mr. Speilberg does well to bring Mr. Kubrick's concept to life, as a metaphore to the movie and a unique robot boy, David.

Instead i'm here to tell you to avoid it.What did I hate about it?1: The first part of the film where 'David' (Haley Joel Osment)  joins the tragic family, well this was positively bizarre!2: The rubbish tip where the deformed robots were scrabbling for  spare parts to improve their functionality and appearance. Sad  and tragic!3: The 'flesh circus' where the so called humans torture the  unfortunate robots for their pleasure. One sad looking 'Mecha'  turns to a robot friend (just before it's his turn) and says  ""would you mind turning off my pain sensors?"" Entertainment?4: The sentimentality of the ending.I'm sorry, but I couldn't wait for this film to end. Avoid It!"	1.0	I had to give it 1 star as 0 wasn't an option!	2002-03-10	45	12	33

It will make you a much much better person.  This AI is better than Shrek, actually better than anyother movie in the history of US movies.  This AI is about American Dream and American Spirit.  It is about true love. (becareful in taking your kids, not appropriate for under 13. Sexuality suggestive regarding this AI Joe Jigallo doing his job for women.) It is funny, witty, sad, love, and happy - I have never seen a movie that has all this emotion.  I almost cry. There are very very few American movie that has tears in it. Any way, I will see this movie again. I will buy this DVD when ever they release it out.  This movie is a treasure.  I don't think Steven Spielberg will ever make a movie that will top this one.  This AI is unique, and one of a kind.  I love love LOVE this AI movie.  I cry, and I laugh.  This is a movie that I have been looking for, and I hope a blue-fairy will grant me true love too ...

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3EIG4FQ6DJ55U	David H.	I personally gave it five stars, but that's just my opinion; nearly everyone I've talked to thought it was too dark and depressing, expecting your average Speilberg movie; but it's impossible if it's Stanley Kubrick's story.  What we're left with isn't necessarily a hybrid, but defininetly something unique.  I loved this movie.  Visually, it's spectacular (especially the last part), and perfectly paints a post-apocalyptic, humane world that has been shaken by mechas, or robots.  I found just watching the different cities and landscapes breathtaking.  The trailer is deceiving- Haley Joel's character David is not some warm, loving robotic son; he's not a human E.T.  Instead, he's an overprogrammed robot who desperately and even self-destructively is trying to win the love of his mommy, and this poses danger to those around him.  Haley Joel's acting prowless in this film far surpasses his disturbed character in &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; or his bright, love-the-world stereotype in &quot;Pay it Forward.&quot;  He does a flawless job as David, very spooky and haunting.  Jude Law as Gigalo Joe also does a wonderful job as a bot; he kind of reminded me of the Artful Dodger from &quot;Oliver.&quot;  The entire film is dark, but never uninteresting, and very provocative.  It's definitely not a kid movie; one of the most haunting scenes in the film is when David hacks the face of a clone of him to pieces.  It ends perfectly, and I won't give it away, but it's very Kubrick, especially &quot;2001.&quot;  I really recommend it to you, but don't be expecting your average Speilberg in it.	5.0	Dark, but one of this year's best	2001-08-02	0	0	0

I felt the entire movie really treated the audience as if we couldn't follow a point made a single time. I couldn't stand the constant and obvious references to Pinnochio throughout the film. The thing that really killed the movie for me was the ending. Not just the emotional manipulation of it, but the constant voice-overs.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2KG8WLR1AKO12	"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator"""	The is the first film that I have seen starring Haley Joel Osment. Where have I been? Osment's role as the pre-adolescent male robot capable of love alone justifies viewing &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; This child actor is by far the greatest in the history of cinema. Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, and Jackie Cooper together do not equal this young boy's enormous talent. He is certain to be nominated for an Academy Award. The emotional and character range displayed by Osment easily competes with those male stars many years his senior. William Hurt has his hands full sharing the screen with Osment. The former plays an inventor with something akin to god-like powers proceeding boldly into uncharted scientific territory. Jude Law is limited to portraying a one dimensional sex machine. His character, though, provides more than a bit of humor to this often chilling movie. A robot teddy bear also adds warmth and affection as the constant side kick to the boy-robot. John William's music score is masterful and compliments &quot;A.I.&quot; without overwhelming it. Ben Kingsley is splendid as the narrator.Stanley Kubrick's beautiful and challenging &quot;2001-A Space Odyssey&quot; earned many honors, but sold few tickets to the general public. I suspect that the present collaboration of the recently deceased director and Steven Spielberg is likely to receive the same fate. This is a magnificent movie not meant for the mainstream movie crowd. &quot;A.I.&quot; compels the audience to dwell upon disturbing existential questions. There are scenes in &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; reminding one of the  Nazi holocaust. &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; by novelist William Golding also readily comes to mind.Many like myself do not consider it possible to invent robots able to engage in give and take conversations. The development of computers is a positivistic scientific activity and language is intrinsically nebulous. Yet, what if I am wrong? A number of people also predicted that human beings would never travel to the moon. Far too many critics nitpick a film such as &quot;A.I.&quot; to point of overkill. Please do yourself a favor and enter the theater with an open mind. I, for instance, strongly disagree with the not too subtle hint in &quot;A.I.&quot; declaring global warming to be a legitimate planetary threat. Nonetheless, I am still able to sufficiently surrender my intellectual reservations to the story line and thoroughly enjoy this fascinating and rewarding experience. &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a five star movie deserving of much praise and success.	5.0	Haley Joel Osment Alone Justifies Seeing &quot;A.I.&quot;	2001-07-01	6	3	3

I have been a Kubrick fan since I first saw the Old Dave Bowman point to the Monolith and then turn into the StarChild. I get goose bumps when I watch A Clockwork Orange, and I shuttered when I saw Eyes Wide Shut, but not in a good way. So it was with mixed emotions I entered the theater to see this film. The room darkened and the movie started. I sat enthralled for 2 and a half hours. Here was a Vision I didn't think possible, and a film that restored my faith in Kubrick, and gave me new respect for Spielburg ((hey I liked Hook sue me)) The casting in this film is right on, and you identify with David ((Haley Joel Osmant)) from the first frame he enters the screen.I have to say the defining moment of the Movie is the last half hour-45 minutes. It is such a shift that people started to get up to leave, and even I thought the film was over. But then the real message of the film comes across. ((Sorry to say guys the creatured at the end of the film are machines. David's Great great great... grandchildren... figuratively speaking))This film gave me goose bumps. It restored my faith in two great film makers, that had made some, ((in my opinion)) clinkers. Open your mind, and be ready for the possibility. This is a true Science Fiction film. It asks questions and leaves some of them for you to answer. It was wonderful, it was horrific, it was full of messy human emotions trying to be understood by a boy who didn't have any of his own. Everyone should see this film, if nothing else then to appriciate all the feelings we can feel.	4.0	A dark film... that feels like..home.	2002-02-08	15	15	0

It would have made Issac Asimov, &quot;I Robot&quot;,  proud.This was a great movie from plot to cinematology to music.  True, it is based on an old fairy tale, but is much, much, more.  It is a story of human failings and desires stretched to a futuristic limit.  With Spielberg, I expected a lot of fantastic special effects, but became so engrossed in the story that I missed them along the way.My wife left the room in tears, no less than 3 times during the movie, and I am glad, so that she wouldn't see mine.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1T9YSDAYS097M	D. Bannister	This is a magnificiently flawed movie and who could expect anything else? It had been in development by Kubrick for a number of years and completed on his death by Spielberg. It would have been better for Spielberg to have just dedicated a movie to Kubrick than to actually try to capture what he may or may not have done.But in his doing this Spielberg's failure is without parallel. Where Kubrick would have given us edge such as in Rouge city Spielberg gives us a sanguine alternative. Where Gigalo Joe would have been... well a gigalo, Spielberg gives us a dancer. And where Kubrick would have given us primary colours to knock our eyes out, Spielberg manages only a portion of the palette. A Kubrick movie that would have been about love, sex and relationships was turned by Spielberg into what he always does - a movie about a boy and his mother or a movie about a boy and his non-mother (maybe this was both).The performance of Jude Law is excellent and an important counterpoint to Osment and I think the ending fails because his character disappears about a half an hour before the film finishes.We should celebrate this movie on a number of levels but foremost is that this failure by Spielberg proves that no one can make a Kubrick film but Kubrick. Hopefully Kubrick wantabees will take a page from Spielberg's experience and find a different way to pay homage to this great director other than by copying him.	3.0	Perfectly Flawed	2002-03-14	1	1	0

This young boy only grows stronger in his craft, and I find myself marveling that he is still a child. His actions were unerring, and the initial bonding with the human mother was startling and actually made me cry, as it was something my own daughter would do.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1AEDW75371P5M	Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com)	After leaving the theatre of A.I. I found myself in a quandry as to how to react to it.  Intellectually I wanted to hate it.  In typical Spielberg fashion, the movie is increadibly manipulative, but where this technique is perfectly acceptable in films such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; it comes across as grossly macabre and self-indulgent in &quot;A.I.&quot; which uses the tormet of a young boy to move its audience.  However, despite this reaction, I could not deny that I was moved by many of the scenes.  In many ways this film is beautiful, the special effects are tremendous and the acting of Haley Joel Osmet is superb.  However, this film stops and starts more often than any other movie I have ever seen.  It engages a new interesting idea countless times and never fails to make the wrong choice in dealing with it.  The end result is that none of the issues the movie cowardly skirts around are ever dealt with and the film ends up being an odd mixture of alternating cynicism and optimism. I think there were many good reasons that Kubrick didn't make this film.  The primary being that he couldn't find a way to unite all his interesting visual ideas under a single coherent and intellectual plot.  This film is not some grand treatise on what it means to be human, it is essentially a re-hashed version of &quot;Pinnochio&quot; and it fails entirely to make a meaningful point.  Enter Steven Spielberg, who obviously couldn't resist the marketing advantages of joining his name with the legendary Kubrick's.  But the obvious problem is that these directors are as different as night and day.  Can you name two movies that are more opposite than &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot;? Still, this movie might have been pulled off if Spielberg had maintaned the necessary discipline to adhere to Kubrick's vision rather than interject his own fairytail trademarks.  There were obviously gaping holes in whatever script Kubrick had produced that Spielberg saw fit to fill in with his standard touchy-feely nonesense.  It is like you watch five minutes of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; and then five minutes of &quot;E.T.,&quot; the end result is infuriating.  Individually, the brief segements that belong to the philosophy of the interchangeably dominant director begin to become interesting.  However, they are abandoned right when they most fully start to engage your attention.  Plus the sheer contrast between the two styles is enough to completely shock your emotions.  Kubrick's contributions give us something disturbing and thought-provoking, Spielberg's fairytale solutions (which he seems to default to out of desperation) are obviously inadequate and absurd.  The fact that they are meant to actually stand as some kind of answer is intellectually grotesque, a result you never would have predicted from Spielberg. Spielberg is defniately the one most at fault in the construction of this film, simply because he was the main force in its actual screen realization.  The script is quite frankly terrible, and many of the shots are needlessly complicated.  As always, the motion of Spielberg's camera hangs heavy in the picture and it is an unwelcome presence (it feels as if Spielberg himself is hanging around behind the curtain and winking at you to acknowledge his cleverness).  Increadibly, however, the movie is watchable and this is mainly due to Spielberg's tremendous confidence.  He fearlessly takes the viewer through a series of totally inapropriate plot directions and still manages to keep the film afloat through the power of his vision.  I'm not going to go into detail about the plot problems, but they are the type of cliched garbage teachers warn you about in any introduction to writing class.  Despite great performances and stunning visuals, A.I. is a total mess.  However, it is a sort of egotistical tour-de-force as Spielberg holds the film together with a bunch of amateurish tactics that so obviously are intended to manipulate you that you want to be offended.  Still, amazingly enough, these devices do work to some extent and you can't help but be somewhat moved.  It really is a movie that anybody interested in films should see.  Not just for the Kubrick/Spielberg coupling, but for an example of what reputation and confidence can do to a promising story if left unchecked by any honest pursuit of quality.	3.0	Interesting as a Curiosity	2001-07-17	9	8	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	I understand that Steven Spielberg took over this project started by the late Stanley Kubrick, which would explain the uneasy edge to the usual Spielbergian treatment.  The remnants of Kubrick's message, namely that humans are soon-to-be obsolete beasts, contend with the usual Spielberg formula of corn syrup, tears, and awe, so that the result is unsettling and more than a bit curiouser and curiouser.First of all, be aware that, despite the fact that there is a full serving of the Spielberg recipe here (cute kids, dazzling special effects, a beautiful score by John Williams, social consciousness seen largely from a kid's POV, etc.), this is not a &quot;feel good&quot; movie that will appeal to the mass audience at which Spielberg usually aims.  The heartland of America will find this film disturbing and will tell their neighbors to stay away.  Sci fi afficionados of the hard science variety (like myself) will have mixed feelings since some of the science is, shall we say, unlikely.  The fantasy/sorcery crowd will probably be disenchanted for other reasons, although there is a glorious ending that might mist up one's eyes (it did mine).  Overall, however, this is an unsettling look at humanity and where we're headin' (&quot;Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?&quot;), and the treatment is definitely NOT something for the kiddies.  It's liable to give them nightmares.The central hook of the film is that we are made to identify with the robotic mechas, especially Haley Joel Osment's David and Jack Angel's Teddy and Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, while being reminded that they are not human, or more properly, that they are more admirable than human.  In a way the robots resemble the have-nots of the current society, the handicapped and the poor, while the humans in the persons of Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), her son Martin (Jake Thomas) and the Flesh Fair entrepreneur (Brendan Gleeson) represent respectively the privileged, the cruel, and the exploitive.  Monica's compromised morality is made clear in the scene in the woods (which I won't describe for fear of giving away too much).  One also gets the sense that she and her husband (who portray the usual kid-show parental mentality) are not actually bright enough to figure out what has happened when siblings and friends have conflicts.  Monica simply sides with her biological child and throws David to the wolves, as it were.On another level this is a movie about a child's undying love for his mother, a love that lasts for two thousand years and a day and is never compromised.  It is about believing in fairy tales and the miraculous, a modern day Pinocchio in Wonderland as might be dreamed up by admirers of Blade Runner (1982).  In the Spielberg canon, echoes from his cinematic predecessors mesh with echoes from his own movies in a sometimes all too obvious way.  Note the return of the moon (in sinister splendor) from E.T. with Teddy (who could have been retrieved from the set of Blade Runner--as could Prof. Hobby, AKA Geppetto) trudging across the top of a rise in front of it.The sets and the animations are sumptuous and beautiful.  The robots and the aliens are ingeniously crafted.  I very much liked the vision of a drowned Manhattan with the upper stories of the skyscrapers rising above the level of the sea (presumably from global warming), giving us a very quiet and almost contemplative Manhattan, and then the skyscrapers immersed in ice as the earth falls into a prolonged ice age.  The sense of the rapid passage of awesome time reminded me a bit of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), while Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) recalled The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the Blue Fairy (voice of Meryl Streep) something from Disney.This is a substantially compromised masterpiece, as it certainly had to be coming from the ghost of Kubrick as fashioned by Hollywood's most powerful and most commercially successful director, but an engaging, ambitious spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.	4.0	Best Sci Fi since Blade Runner?	2003-12-05	4	4	0

But it is a real teat-jerker because Healy Joel Osment is the perfect choice for the part that he plays and he plays that part extremely and most convincingly well.  During his childhood acting period, his cute, boyish innocence radiates.  In the Woods scene where his adopted mother abandons him to the world with only his teddy bear for company, if you are the sentimental type, you'll go through a box of hankies.

It seems amazing that so much of what it is to be human, to be in love, and to be loved is described in this motion picture.Frankly I don't know where the comments about this film being somehow flawed come from.  Haley Osment is astounding, I can't recall any child actor putting forth a perfomance even close to this in it's span of emotions, I'm not sure more than a handful of adults could have done as well. The blending of Spielberg and Kubric is seamless to me.  You will find yourself forgetting the characters are actually human actors and not mechanized.Science Fiction should always teach a lesson that is relevent to today but told in the context of tomorrow.  As such, this movie is Science Fiction at it's very best.	5.0	A movie you can't get out of your mind	2002-03-07	24	22	2

They are the evolutionary descendants of David, machines with full emotional capabilities.#2: David does not merely simulate love, he genuinely feels it. Many people reject this premise at the outset, unable to accept the notion that the emotions we feel boil down to neurons in our brains firing in specific patterns, and that an artificial brain could conceivably do the same thing.#3: Speilberg was faithful to Kubrick's vision. Speilberg wrote the screenplay himself, but he did not deviate from the story treatment completed years earlier by Ian Watson with input from Sara Maitland, under Kubrick himself. e.g. Kubrick's version of the story didn't end with David trapped under the Ferris wheel. It continued on to 2000 years in the future, just as seen in the movie.There is a lot of info out there that predates the production of the film by several years, if you care to look for it.	5.0	Exploding the top A.I.  myths (*spoilers*)	2002-03-04	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A268P9HZD272Q7	dld	This is one of the films that I couldn't wait to finally be released on Blu-ray. I knew that the Blu-ray format would greatly enhance this film visually. The original director died and wanted Steven Spielberg to complete the vision for this film. I can see why. With all of the detail necessary for this sci fi movie that is set in the future, I don't know of another director who could have handled everything necessary for this film to be done so well.The film has an excellent cast with Haley Joel Osment as the primary character for the film David. Frances O'Connor and Jude Law were also excellent in their supporting roles.Artificial Intelligence is set in the future. Human society has been dependent on robots for quite some time. Humans seem harbor negative feelings and even sometimes hatred for the very A.I. that humanity created. A.I. are targeted so much that some of them have to become fugitives and hide in order not to be hunted and destroyed.&#34;David&#34; was created as a replacement for the gravely ill son of a couple. Frances O'Connor's character as the mother can't accept &#34;David&#34; despite his desperation to please her and need for her to love him. &#34;David&#34; can't understand why. When O'connors gravely ill son suddenly improves, &#34;David&#34; is eventually forced from the home and left in a wooded area to fend for himself.David runs into other A.I. who are fugitives and hunted. He gets some help from Jude Law's character another A.I. While on the run with Jude Law's character you see a lot more of this futuristic world in the film. This futuristic world is filmed with great detail and vision. At some point in the distant future after humans no longer exist, Aliens come and rescue &#34;David&#34; reactivate him and try to help him. The only thing that David wants is to have his mother back again. The Aliens let him know that their technology will only allow them to give David his mother for a very short time. For David it's enough to enjoy a short time again with the mother he loves so much. A.I. is a very touching story due to the depth of David's love for the mother who rejected him.Steven Spielberg does an excellent job with this film and the special effects are so great that it's visually stunning. What truly makes the film A.I. however is the superb acting by Haley Joel Osment as David.	5.0	A I Artificial Intelligence blu-ray	2013-08-14	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	The test of a worthy movie is its ability to keep audiences involved in its story without losing their interest in what happens to the central character(s). In my grade book, &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; fails this test for a number of reasons. With Steven Speilberg helming a project conceived by the famed Stanley Kubrick, you'll be surprised at just how uninvolving the film actually is.In a futuristic world where humans have developed robots referred to as &quot;meca&quot; (short for mechanical), a group of scientists makes plans to create a small child robot, something never done before. Their intentions are to give it not only human characteristics on the outside, but to give him the full emotions of a human heart as well. And so young David (Haley Joel Osment), who will forever be young, is built, beginning his life in the home of a family who is on the brink of losing their human son.The mother, Monica (Francis O'Conner), is quite skeptical at first, but soon warms to young David, even so after her own son, Martin, regains his health and returns home. After many silent battles in which Martin makes David out to be a bad child, Monica takes him far into the country and leaves him in the woods, unprepared for the harshness of the world outside of his once-happy home.Up to this point, the movie hasn't gained much momentum. The movie tries to build the relationship between mother and son to a point at which the pivotal scene in which she abandons him will have more of an impact. In fact, what the movie does is take certain scenes and make them too long for comfort, sometimes to the point of annoyance.And the movie continues to do so as it goes on, when David crosses paths with Joe (Jude Law), a Meca programmed to be a love machine, so to speak. David reveals his plan of finding the Blue Fairy, from the story of Pinnochio, so that she may transform him into a real boy (how ironic that a story such as that should end up in a story such as this). Their travels lead them to Rouge City, full of bright lights and millions of people, and to Manhattan, which is awash due to the melting of the polar ice caps.And through the entire experience, there is this feeling that nothing of importance is going on. The material wants to be emotional, but comes off as being detached in places and in-your-face in others. What is supposed to be a strong story about the will of the human spirit is turned into an exercise in patience as we are transported from setting to setting, and seemingly left there just as lost and confused as young David himself.The settings themselves can be quite spectacular, some of the best pieces of futuristic visions I've seen in any film. The woods in which David is left become the forest from Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; once night falls; nary a day goes by without intense cloud cover and rain, providing a dismal setting. The Manhattan scenes are the ones to wait for, from skyscrapers poking out of the water, to the looming ferris wheel in the completely submerged Coney Island, where the movie will come to its drawn-out conclusion.There are certain scenes with some impact, such as the scene in which David is left alone in the woods, his entire future resting in his fearful hands. But other scenes are handled in all the wrong ways. When David and Joe are captured, they are taken to what is called a &quot;Flesh Fest,&quot; where Meca robots are taken to be destroyed in front of hundreds of cheering spectators. While this scene is supposed to be emotional and heavy-handed, it takes on a comedic tone, especially when a black Meca with a very close resemblance to comedian Chris Rock (could that be his voice, too?) is destroyed.The actors have some good work, this being the movie's sole saving grace aside from the set pieces. Haley Joel Osment is a brilliant young star, and is convincing as David, from the naivety he displays about his surroundings to the emotions of love and outrage later in the film. Francis O'Conner makes a nice segue from skeptical to accepting, and her maternal nature is something to appreciate. Jude Law practically steals the show as suave and debonair Joe, even if his screen time is limited.But sets and a sparkling cast cannot pull &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; out of its own shadow. The movie is just too long to be of any lasting interest, nor does it have a lasting impact after its final frame. Given the running time of the movie, you'd think the filmmakers would have some extra time to fit in some of the movie's themes and meanings. A nice try, but that and nothing more.	2.0	Poor pacing brings down a potential hit.	2001-07-24	16	11	5

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AS09CJ2GLNXNV	D.N.	I thought AI described a world where everything good that existed was no longer 'real'. His mother (not just the 'aliens') was a robot at the end, too. He was just fooling himself, or couldn't tell reality, because he wasn't real himself. Had he become a real boy, I don't think so. Just satisfied after searching, but he was probably programmed to know better.People thought A.I. had a stupid, happy ending, I think it was sad. You see his mother never changed in life she was cold and cruel to the very end (before the underwater ship). She did not come back to reunite with him, another robot did, which is why she could not remember. A completely bitter misanthropic ending, yet in an ignorant way he is satisfied. It's technology making our dreams come 'true', only they can never really be 'true' - Look at 'Gigolo Joe' for instance, he has no point, other than to remind people of that. AI DOES NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING, MY FRIENDS! Just because it looked like her doesn't mean it's her. It's like Kafka's Metamorphesis book, a man wakes up one day and just is a giant cockroach, no reason, he just is. His sister takes care of him, but she soon becomes tired of caring for her brother, the monster. She throws him out. Many people thought the metamorphesis was about the man who turns into a giant cockroach, but it was actually about his sister, who changes from a loving character into a cold one, towards the same person for nothing of his doing. It's bitter, despite the soundtrack, the smiles, etc. and no one has realized it.all the human are stereotyped as being 'bad'. From the brother he has, to his mother, to the people at the 'flesh fair', to the guy at the beginning who feels a need to 'test' the sex robots, etc. Then compare with 'Gigolo Joe' and 'David', good people, who aren't really people, because good people don't exist anymore in the world. Gigolo Joe only exists in the film to show this. It's a film noir nightmare parable. Maybe the robots realized this, and decided to kill them off.I love all of Kubrick's work and I love some of Spielberg's, though Kubrick was gone, you can still see his influence.	4.0	Kind of drones but Interesting and fun - like this review!	2002-03-09	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1Z0Y9JGEEWXKI	"Dogan Bilge ""iBug"""	I've read the review and what I wanted to write about this movie he already did. I have just small additions. As a movie score fan, I want to talk about John Williams's score.I bought the score before seeing the movie so I knew the music for every scene. When I first went to the theater, it was quite amazing journey for me with knowing the music, but without knowing the scenes. The theme written for Monica is outstanding even for Williams. But that was not enough for Williams, in the dark future with ice covering all the world, he wrote such a music which actually make me freeze like the ice and the smooth tranisition from that cold music to Monica's theme at the final is perfect. If you liked this movie and can see cinema as a dance of motion and sound, listen to the music somehow and watch the movie afterwards again.I want to talk about the script also. The only &quot;weak&quot; part of the script was when David threw himself in the ocean and by &quot;luck&quot; saw the blue fairy deep down. It was too fast, maybe some additional scenes would smoothen the transition of the storyline.  And it was needed since the story changed it's mood to a &quot;tale&quot; in that scene. I'm not complaining about it because  it started like that in the beginning of the movie with a narration but the narrator didn't show up until that scene again, I would say that second act was too short, maybe a 3 hour movie would be better.Anyway, except that part, there's nothing which was not enough for me, I always loved Spielberg's storytelling and everything about the movie was almost perfect. And like Robert Sercombe wrote, there's more than meets the eye in the movie. Did you check the website of the movie and talked with the A.I. in the website? You should since it's one of the most successful bots written so far and for the ones which can't understand what the movie says about &quot;Artificial Intelligence - Human difference&quot; or better explained as &quot;Artificial Intelligence - Human resemblance&quot;, talk to the &quot;bot&quot; and notice that it isn't so much different than talking to a person, and it's only the year 2002 yet. The movie was I think trying to show the part we can't understand about the concept of &quot;feelings&quot;. But afterall, aren't emotions also some kind of a program code written in the language of logic? They are just more complex than first order logic so we simply reject that a robot can &quot;feel&quot;.  The scene where David talks to the blue fairy is one of its kind I think since he was programmed to chase his feelings to love and he does it for 2000 years which certainly humans would do if they could live so long.I really can't write everything I think about the movie here since it would be too long and too hard to put together in such a complex story which looks so simple.So as Robert Sercombe I suggest you to watch the movie again and again and try to understand what you didn't so far without prejudices.I personally will buy the DVD and watch it 15 times at least since these kind of movie can't be understood in the first few times.Also a personal notice: Spielberg is the best :)	4.0	Additions to Robert Sercombe's Review	2002-01-06	2	1	1

The last 20 minutes of the movie will have any intelligent viewers moaning in disbelief and saying ""they couldn't possibly make that plot twist"" only to watch even worse, more emotionally manipulative sequences transpire on screen.  I often rate other terrible movies by how many times I could watch them again before I could sit through A.I. one more time.  No other movie has a score lower than 4, meaning I'd rather watch that dreadful movie 4 times in a row rather than watch A.I. again.  I'd rather watch 16 hours of Jar Jar Binks doing a dance/song interpretaion of the U.S. Constituition than watch A.I. again.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A32BEW34PPEAXJ	dolly_	I'm amazed by all the bad reviews this movie is getting here. I didn't find this movie boring or stupid at all. And no, the audience I saw it with did not yawn loudly and scream, 'this is stupid' at the screen. If you are the type of person the needs gratuitous nudity and things blowing up every couple minutes to keep your attention then yeah, I can see how you would get bored but I hope that the average film filmgoer is not like that. Some people say that Spielberg messed up the film by giving it a happy ending. I don't think that to be the case at all. I don't want to give it away but I feel that the ending only appears to be happy. The ending is very Kubrick.In the movie, David (Haley Joel Osment) is a child robot that is the first of his kind to be programmed to love. The woman who adopts him, Monica is warned to think about the programming because once she programs David to love her, it is irreversible. If she ever decides that she doesn't want David, she has to send him back to the factory to be destroyed so she is suppose to be 100% sure that she wants him. But guess what? She programs him and she soon decides that she does not want him anymore. She leaves him in the woods to fend for himself with only a teddy bear to keep him company. David thinks that if was a real boy, Monica would accept and love him like she does her real son. Monica read the story of Pinocchio to David. In Pinocchio, the Blue Fairy transforms wooden Pinocchio into a real boy. David soon meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and they set off to find the Blue Fairy.For most movies, the only comments I usually hear are, &quot;I like that movie&quot; or &quot;'so-and-so' did a really good job.&quot; Not with this one. I've had many discussions with people about the themes and questions this movie brings. Maybe if Kubrick was alive, this movie would have been better but we'll never know and it doesn't really matter, it's still a great movie.	5.0	Did I see the same movie everyone else did?	2001-07-14	2	1	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3BXK3HE0XUG7	Douglas Hahner	Here is why I think this movie works: It is because people are so polarized about the film.  If you are a Spielberg fan you feel the movie is too dark and depressing.  If you are a Kubrick fan you feel the movie is sweet and nice.  It doesn't matter where my feelings lay, but it is because of this polarization that I feel the movie works.Osment is perfectly cast as the boy robot.  I feel that his performance here is much stronger than the one he gave in The Sixth Sense.  The Flesh Fair and Manhattan are two scenes where he truly shines.  I feel that his performance begins once he is imprinted on his &quot;mother.&quot;As for Jude Law, there was not nearly enough of him.  My one complaint about the film is that (don't worry no spoilers) if they took the time to set up his story why don't they follow through and show us what becomes of him?  Why couldn't David (Osment) have just met Joe (Law) at the Flesh Fair and have that be the first time we meet him as well?Why should you go see this movie?  1: If you are a fan of Spielberg. 2: If you are a fan of Kubrick. 3: If you are a fan of Osment. 4: If you are a fan of the magic of cinema.I feel that if a movie can make you feel strongly one way or another than that film works.  The worst movies are the ones you leave saying, &quot;that movie was okay.&quot;  If you are saying &quot;I loved that movie,&quot; or &quot;I hated that movie,&quot; than that means it touched you on some level.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1W30CHNVZ4GEP	Douglas J. Bender	"I just finished (a few hours ago) watching this movie.  As some others have said (more eloquently and informatively), it is an odd mixture of brilliance and sappy Spielbergian ""E.T.""-ishness.  I would like to point out something I'm not sure anyone else has noticed (of course, I've read only a very few of the over 1000 reviews of the movie here at Amazon), and that is that the love that David supposedly felt for his mother (and, I thought the initial claim in the movie was that the child-robot would ""imprint"" his love on BOTH his ""adoptive"" parents) was not FREELY MADE by him - it was something his creators BUILT INTO his being.  And it is here that any possible comparison to the story of God's creating Adam and Eve fails:  God created Adam and Eve with FREE WILL, since it is only by exercising FREE will that GENUINE love can exist.  In the movie, did David at any time love his mother (or anyone) OF HIS OWN FREE WILL?  No.  Thus, he was not, and never became, a real boy, since he could never love FREELY.  Which makes the whole movie pretty much moot, though flashy.Perhaps next time, in a hypothetical sequel, David can seek salvation from the ""Blue-Tooth"" Fairy.  No strings attached."	3.0	Love cannot be programmed.	2006-01-21	8	4	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3OY6AQSG19HM7	"""dpowell73"""	"Just like the title says.I found this movie fascinating and absolutely incredible both as a movie and as a brief glimpse into humanity's future.  First of all, the movie by itself is incredible.  The acting is superb and the special effects are equally good.  The plot line, although a bit stretched towards the ending, is compelling and draws you right into the action, making you really feel like a part of this eerie and not-so-distant future.  And for all of you who don't want to see this just because it's another Spielberg sci-fi, don't worry - it still retains just enough of Kubrick's original influence to keep you off-balance and uneasy even after you leave the movie theater.In addition, or as some people may argue at the heart of the movie, are many philosophical and moral dilemnas that make us question our everday existance and at the same time present a compelling, if disturbing, vision of the evolution of technology.  At the core of the plot is the conflict between Humans and ""Mecha,"" which are basically highly advanced robots.  This conflict constantly makes us call into question exactly what is human and uses emotion to blur the line between human and machine.In the end, this movie feels a lot like Blade Runner meets the Matrix, minus the guns.  The special effects compliment the plot line just enough to make it deeply engrossing without overdoing it.  To be fair, however, I should warn you that this film, as with any of Kubrick's, can be an ""acquired taste,"" if you will.  If you go into it looking simply for action and special effects, you won't be entirely dissapointed, but you will miss out on so much of what really makes this movie great.  However, if you want a deeply engrossing film that takes the genres of sci-fi, drama, romance, and even that deeply disturbing comedy that only Kubrick can achieve, and rolls them all together in perfect unison to create an emotionally wrenching and deeply disturbing Kubrick-esque film, then this movie is definitely for you."	5.0	Great Movie!	2002-02-16	3	2	1

Technically, it is a fine demonstration of what can be done today to make a large screen shimmer with all the action of a three ring circus. The acting is suitable to the theme and the characters involved in the story, ""live"" and ""robotic"". Given the film literacy of the creators, many sources are acknowledged within the film and many more are knowingly alluded to; this is not plagiarism, it is fair use in maintaining traditions as well as  seeking to give them a fresh look and thus perpetuate them.  Perhaps, it should be made a family viewing project so that various differing perspectives can be brought to bear to elicit meaning from the film. Just don't make it the only film available for the evening so that it is a case of watching it or nothing.Amazon informs me that I wrote the foregoing and could not write a second (as I well know). I had no memory of having seen it before either when buying it or seeing it. I'll let it stand as it is since it was my opinion then.

Perhaps it is just the greater number of years I have behind me now, but, I have to admit, I was touched by the movie. So, if there is still a mushy core somewhere in your heart, give it a try."	4.0	A Film for Some of Us	2009-11-03	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3EQQP0LD4Z375	Dr. Lee D. Carlson	One of the purposes of art and literature is to allow one the opportunity to participate in an event or a scenario that is not currently realized. It allows individuals to project their hopes and dreams via the vehicle of fantasy. In the movie A.I., one can participate in an adventure that will no doubt be realized (hopefully) in the near future. The focus of the movie is on the relationship between synthetic humanoids and real humanoids, a distinction that is somewhat clearcut in the movie if one removes the main character, an android manufactured to look like a boy, and love like one.Both Kubrick and Spielberg have done a brilliant job in this movie, as it brings out the issues that a society of &quot;Mechs&quot; and &quot;Orgs&quot; would be facing. The behavior of the synthetic humanoids in the movie makes them &quot;easy to spot&quot;, with the exception of the boy, who was made to take on the more emotional aspects of human intelligence. The acceptance of the boy and his eventual rejection by the family who takes him in motivates the boy to search for a way to become a real boy. This Pinochio theme may have bored some moviegoers, but I think it verifies exactly what one would expect if a machine were to attempt such an endeavor. The point of this part of the film was to show how a mechanical but intelligent being, not needing sleep or food, would behave if it were &quot;programmed&quot; to have the emotional development of a young boy. Indeed, the film encourages the viewer to understand how such a being, not burdened with biological needs, but still basically a child, would reach his goals. The sense of desperation and the pain and sorrow that go with the attempt of the boy to become human, coupled with his view of the world that is no different from a modern boy indulging in computer games and Pokemon, makes the movie one of the most thought-provoking in many years.But even some of the scenes which take only a few seconds of film, such as the beautiful feminine student android who takes out her compact and puts on lipstick, or the toy robot-teddy-bear who struggles to get out of a garbage can, convince the viewer that it is purposeful activity that makes these machines intelligent. Human intelligence does not like to be confined, it gets bored with rigidity, and it loves to be playful and free. Problem solving utilizes pattern recognition, induction and deduction, but also a sense of adventure. Its goals are checked by the emotions, which work as kind of a signal, as a monitor of progress. These attributes of human intelligence are carefully worked into the dialog of the characters in the movie, making them believable, and leave the viewer more convinced that the movie is actually a glimpse into our future. It is a magnificent celebration of the genius and creativity of human intelligence.	5.0	A celebration of human intelligence	2001-07-07	10	5	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	There's a great series of ethical questions just dying to be asked here, but they're buried beneath so many layers of glossy effects, shameless sentimentality and routine overacting, it's hard to say whether they're worth digging up. A.I. is quite Kubrickian at heart - complicated, fascinating and occasionally bizarre just for the sake of it - but also so thoroughly lathered with the strokes of Spielberg that it could almost function as a parody of his career. That duality is often mesmerizing, but also quite destructive. There are a few moments where this picture shines brighter for those combined efforts than it ever could under a single master, particularly in the fleshed-out world itself, but they're frequently outweighed by the long stretches where the two visions clash loudly and horribly - as the entire third act can attest. An aspirant, visually stunning genre-straddler, it's an uneven, long-winded showcase of the best traits and worst indulgences of both directors.	3.0	The Ultimate Conflicted Identity Crisis	2012-09-10	0	0	0

It was a disgrace to Spielberg and seems like this movie was made to, well, I have a lot of money so lets make a movie.  Who cares if it entertains.  The idea of artificial intelligence, our human race, what we think, what is becoming of society and technology are all thems that the director tried to define in 3 hours; portrayed through the emotions of the characters.  If I want an emotional roller coaster, then I can find one like most people; but I'm definitely not going to pay money for one.  This movie was kind of like making art just to make art for art's sake.  You know how you wonder where people get the time to do stupid things like stand in line for four months to see Star Wars?  I wonder who had the time to make this movie.

The movie drags at points, but is lifted by spielberg's classic action sequences soon after. The ending was great in my opinion, almost too short, but still great. It left me pondering the movie for days afterwards and I could barely sleep that night after watching it.  My girlfriend who watched it with me hated it though, so basically I think is it a love or hate movie. In that way it goes along with Kubrick style of writing, because in movies like clockwork orange people either love or hate that movie as well, no in betweens whatsoever.

Science had made Robots, or ""Mechas"", to do everything, from workers ""mechas"" like Miners and Nannys to ones that can provide a plethora of pleasure.  To fulfill a certain emptiness though, one mecha was made...A child, one who can give love, genuine unconditional love...David.  David is put in a home situation with a family whose child is terminally sick and in stasis.  The ""Mom"" dances around the idea of replacing her son with a mecha until David touches her heart and gives in.  To accept the child and personalize it to a particular family, Specific commands have to be read to it.  Once this is done, the Mecha is imprinted with the family and the brain is sealed to lock it in.  This makes the mechas non-returnable.  Because of this non-reprogrammable brain, if it is rejected by some means and can't stay, it has to be destroyed.  When Monica imprints David to her, he is loyal as a puppy and a wonderful son........All in all a Good movie on a bizarre rollercoaster of scenery and emotions.  Teddy is adorable.

Many people were bored by the movie, but that would be common in a world where people are bored by their own children.Haley Joel Osment plays David, an android that is made to appease the loss of another child.  He is brought home, given a room, toys, a family and also shown great amounts of love.  When the family's child comes out of a coma, David must adapt to having a brother (as any other kid would have to adapt to: an adoption, a new baby, a displaced family member, etc).Looking at our lives today, and how much family/child therapy is occuring, you can see where this film is going.  It is showing how we, subtly or not, can forget about other kids in our lives.  The reality is, all kids need our attention.The movie becomes interesting when David becomes scared and grabs his brother and falls into a pool.  Everyone thinks David is malicious in his fear but the reality is, he was scared of a bully.  When we yell at our kids for being scared, what happens?  They can feel that nobody cares and they must run-away.  His ""father"" wants him destroyed after this and his ""mother"" doesnt want him around, but doesnt want him deactivated.  Now his world is turned upside down and he must fend for himself.If you look past the sci-fi you will find a story that many children feel or experience.  David represents the kid that is ignored and his brother is the one who can do no wrong, when in reality they are both equal; needing guidance and support.  If you have a child who seems like they are depressed and wont talk, and you need an ice-breaker, this movie can be a great opener to that needed conversation.  They can associate with David and explain their problems in a third person vantage point.  This allows for kids to open up when they are scared of reactions."	5.0	A Movie About The World For Children Today	2006-04-18	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2C497NO8HIL8A	ED	"First of all, a quick rant about reviewing movies.  Not every movie is for everybody which is why, with very few exceptions, you'll find both positive and negative reviews for each of them.  One man's Battlefield Earth is another's Citizen Kane.  But why do people act like their opinion is the only one that matters and those who disagree must be evil?  People write stuff like ""I can't believe that anybody liked this movie"" or ""if you don't like this movie you are an idiot.""  How is that constructive?  Besides, comments like that say more about the writer than they do about the movie.Anyway, what about A.I.?  Well, I am a huge sci-fi fan.  I like fast paced action oriented sci-fi and I like slower paced sci-fi too (Solaris, Sunshine, Moon, Gattica, 2001 to name but a few).  I found A.I to be very thought provoking and quite profound.  The question of what moral obligations we have to somebody to whom we've said ""I will love you forever"" is fascinating and well handled in this movie.And then there is the movie as a visual feast.  All of the various art departments did an incredible job and you can watch the movie simply marveling at why particular choices in lighting, design, etc. were used at specific times.  And watching Spielberg do Kubrick is also fascinating.  It's as much a collaboration between those two as Raiders was between Spielberg and Lucas.I will say, however, that I have to agree with those who said the original marketing campaign misrepresented the movie.  I think it is not only unfair, but devious when studios do that.  Folks should have an accurate idea of what they are getting themselves into.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie and for some viewers that's a bad thing.I love this movie and enjoy not only the message but all of the artistry involved."	5.0	I LOVE (!) this movie!!	2013-04-11	3	3	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A35J4XGRWXVZ00	Edward	"Steven Spielberg's ""A.I."" was one of the most imaginative films in the year of its release, but the powers that be were not aware of it, the Academy choosing as Best Picture a sword-and-sandal romp. Originally picked as a movie project by Stanley Kubrick (it's dedicated to him), ""A.I."" combines that director's ideas (there are impressions of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"") with the domestic themes associated with Spielberg. In an unspecified post-deluvian age robots (called ""mechas"" and used primarily for servile jobs) have become increasingly utilized and despised. The head of a robotics firm (William Hurt) dreams of creating a mecha that can do just that -- dream. The obvious choice is a child, so David is constructed by the firm and ""adopted"" by an employee and the employee's wife whose own son is comatose. Brought into the home of Henry and Monica, the doll-like David's reactions are strangely inappropriate. (His first words are ""I like your floor"".) Initially repelled by David's unblinking smile and mecha-nized politeness, Monica (a difficult role well-handled by Frances O'Connor) is eventually drawn to the robot and, following the prescribed instructions, she unlocks the filial love which has been programmed into him. A problem occurs when Monica's real son comes out of his coma and returns home. Contemptous of the mecha, the ""orga"" boy causes conflicts which doom David's chances of staying with Monica; and the scene where Monica deserts David in a forest has a Grimm-like terror. Then the script opens a completely different story line as we follow the misadventures of a mechastud Gigolo Joe (Jude Law)who, fleeing the police, comes across the disconsolately wandering David -- and his companion, a super-toy Teddy bear. Together, David and Joe are captured by orga entrepreneurs and forced into what is called a Flesh Fair, a sort of circus of horrors where robots are violently destroyed for the thrilled amusement of humans. (Actually, it looks pretty much like a demolition derby.) Escaping the fair, David and Joe proceed to a neon-drenched Rouge City (you'll hear a quote from ""Der Rosenkavalier"" -- Kubrick's idea), David seeking Pinocchio's Blue Fairy, the power to help him become a real boy and win his mother's love. There's a very funny scene when they visit Dr Know (""There's nothing he doesn't""), designed to look like Einstein and voiced by Robin Williams. Advised by this cartoon guru, David and Joe enter an inundated Manhattan and an unsettling glimpse of the World Trade Center -- which, of course, wouldn't exist in the future. (""A.I."" was released in June of 2001.)At this point the film becomes more abstract (and it should be stressed this fairy tale is not for children), but I think it's here that Kubrick and Spielberg merge most successfully. The ending is dark but gentle: throughout the story David has longed to be a real boy -- in other words, a mortal -- and at the end his dream comes true. John Williams' lovely score is especially effective in these final scenes. The outstanding quality of ""A.I."" is the almost Garboesque acting of Haley Joel Osment as David. In scene after scene, he displays a remarkable sensitivity. The performances and special effects were some of the best of that year, and the screenplay was one of the best-written. But, as I said, the Academy chose to brush aside the whole production. Perhaps it thought ""A.I."" stood for Absolutely Ignore."	5.0	Spielberg's futuristic fairy tale	2004-02-23	7	6	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3LK5T7GNGJO3U	Edward Perkins	Let me start with the ending first.  This part was a total unnecessarily drawn out, and over emotional part of the film.  I agree with another reviewer, stop the film when the boy finally finds the blue fairy.  That was his goal throughout the movie.  There were few moments of joy in this robot's immortal life, all the pain the we are forced to witness just makes you emotionally numb at the end and checking your watch waiting for the ending (if you haven't turned the movie off already).  It started promising enough, with a good concept, but Spielberg made it too hard to bond with the little creature that was nothing but an embodiment of pain and loneliness.  The film is visually beautiful, but without a strong story, it is an overall disappointment.	2.0	Long, slow, and unabashedly melodramatic	2002-03-15	2	0	2

I thought the ending was just Spielburg trying to force a happy ending onto a movie that didn't need one. This kind of ruined the rest of the movie for me. But, upon rewatching it the other day, I realize that the ending fit with the rest of the movie. I'll avoid spoilers here, so I can't really say much more.The one real problem with the movie is that, while already a pretty dark movie, especially considering Spielberg directed it, it should have been a bit darker. I don't know exactly what it is that seems too 'friendly' about it, but it is. Spielberg, apparently, couldn't bring himself to make this movie as mean as it needed to be. Gigolo Joe should've been more of a con man, I think. But Jude Law was in fine form in his performance. I think he'll end up considered one of our era's finest actors.Really, you should give this movie another chance.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AOE7IAVVL0D9I	"Eliphas Levi ""eliphas"""	While a cinematographic feat and a beautiful film to behold, Speilberg's sentimental spin on what would have been a dark Kubric rumination on love and its possible objects is a challenge to the skeptic and agony for the cynic. The film is unevenly divided into three parts.  The first part concerns the introduction of the roboting boy and the family's trials learning to except (and eventually, reject) him.  The part begins with a heavy-handed, poorly acted screed of mush by Hurt, but picks up and rides well until part two.  The second half of the film is conflicted: The robotic boy meets a male prostitute android, they endure something akin to the Terrordome from Mad Max III, and end up on Japetto's stair in a flooded Manhatten.  This part is simply WEIRD--both dark but sentimental, Speilburg manages to wrend what was undoubtedly a crotch-rubbing fantasy for Kubric (a cosmic Las Vegas where the entrances to everything are literally orafaces of one sort or another) into a Disney-esque, anti-sexual land of &quot;Dr. Know.&quot;  The third part of the film is the absolute worst--obviously an attempt to resolve a number of threads left hanging by Kubric.  Basically, it's a LONG, LONG coda, an encomium to motherly love with more sap and sugar than this viewer could take.  I left the film laughing so hysterically that I was chastized by a fellow viewer: &quot;Next time you come to the theatre, leave your opinion at home.&quot; Parts one and two could have comprised a movie themselves, and perhaps done well. Strung together with part three, the movie makes its way into &quot;bad&quot; territory.

I think of this movie as a future fairy-tale (in fact, that is one of the themes of this movie---the robot wants to be a real boy...sound familiar?).  Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of directing, Haley Joel Osment pulled off his character well and Jude Law, once again, shows that good looks and talent CAN go hand-in-hand.To be truthful, I had avoided watching this movie because of the hype over the special effects.  Usually when this type of hype happens, that means the movie is just a showcase of the special effects crew--not the case in this movie.  Yes, the effects are beyond what I could have imagined, but they work hand-in-hand with the movie.The second disc is chocked full of special features---I enjoyed watching the interviews with Steven Spieldberg and the two main actors.  Also, I truly enjoyed watching how they did all of those special effects, the second disc itself stands alone.Bottom line: the movie is excellent, beyond what I could have imagined.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1H9QGF7D2CA5D	"""ellars3"""	"I screened A.I. on opening night at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.  The crowded house was packed to the rafters with as broad a spectrum of moviegoers as one could hope to assemble for a big Summer release.  I mention this to emphasize that their reaction, their vocal and very unanimous response was not that of a few Kubrik fanboys or Spielberg shmoozers, but of a fairly representative slice of American Pie.  I don't want to retread ground laid by other reviews, however, in light of this crowd's reaction I must agree - A.I. hung around longer than the Griswold's cousin Eddie.  With the last twenty minutes Spielberg dared go where only a few wretched films have gone before; Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster comes to mind.  The unanimous reaction began with much seat squirming, followed by awkward giggles, then groans of disapproval culminating with hearty laughs.  Even before the credits began to roll, dozens of people stood up and shuffled for the doors.  Some were talking aloud as they left - for they knew, as we all did, that the movie had indeed ended  30 minutes earlier.  Then, as the screen faded for the SECOND time, some 300 people collectively groaned, booed, and even hissed at the screen.  It was eerie, and a bit frightening.  My buddy suggested we leave before the riot started.  I agreed.  The reason people were so unsettled is hard to describe, but it was spawned by two distinct things; The future-alien/robot things, and the obsessive, phycho-sexual relationship the boy has for his human mother.  This obsession is resolved by a sequence so brimming with innuendo it had folks covering their eyes in disgust.  To add fuel to the fire the toy teddy bear crawls into bed with them at which point the crowd erupted with a roar of comic horror.  In defense of the filmmaker, I don't believe this was his intent, but it was the reaction, and it should have been.  I'm not a fan of the practice of using test-audiences, but in the case of A.I. it could only have helped.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	Maybe it was the confusion of which director's vision was supposed to come out.  Maybe it's the feeling I have that the ending should have been &quot;happier&quot;, although some can argue that it was a happy ending.  I'll try to express this without giving away too much, but I feel that the film goes through an awful lot of good things, only to leave me saying &quot;Huh?&quot; when it ended.On the good side, Spielberg seems to have put as much effort into this film, both plot- and special-effects-wise as anything he's done.  The story begins in the near future, where lifelike, but unfeeling robots are commonplace.  William Hurt plays a scientist that wants to take it one step further and create robots that have feelings.  Done with good intentions, it is done to give people who can't have children of their own something to love that can respond to them.  This is, of course, when an old-fashioned puppy just won't do.So they make a robot that looks just like Haley Joel Osment, who is named David.  They try it on a family whose only son had been frozen after having an incurable disease.  These first moments are some of the best in the movie, as we can see reluctance, followed by acceptance, followed by something that comes pretty darn close to being love.Alas, a question is asked early in the movie.  If we create robots with feelings, then, do we as humans have a responsibility for those feelings?  This comes to a test when the frozen human son brought back to life and cured.  All of a sudden there is a lack of compatibilty between the human son and the robot.  Even though we lean towards the robot as more loveable, we can't just dump the original son, so the robot goes.At this point the movie has it's good points and bad points as David explores the world in search of a mother.  He is joined by his robot teddy bear, who is underused in the movie, and another robot, played by Jude Law, whose function is that of gigolo.  Here the creators of the movie get a free ride to show us the state of movie effects, and we get to see a political movement that doesn't like the robots.  While not uninteresting, I wish less could have been spent on effects, and more on character development.I won't get into much spoiler detail here, except to say that an incredibly patient David just tugs at your heartstrings trying to fill his robot function, which is to love his mother.  I say incredibly patient, because a span of 2,000 years goes by at one point with his faith undeterred.  With all this effort put in, then comes the ending I thought was unsatisfying.Yes, one can debate whether it is a happy ending or not.  Technically, David SEEMS happy at the end, and he does technically reach his goal, but that's where the &quot;Huh?&quot; comes in.  I suppose if Kubrick had done it, the ending wouldn't have nearly been as upbeat as this one, and we should be grateful for some kind of Spielberg touch here.  But in a movie filled with an incredible amount of love, David deserves a lot more.  Even if he is just a robot.	3.0	Big movie needed a bigger payoff	2002-05-29	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ATA9L747CJ622	Emily McB	This is one very, very, frustrating film.  Swinging between dark to the point of gruesome and cloyingly syrupy, it is both fascinating and dead boring, worth watching, and a total waste of time.Firstly, Spielberg spends about 50 minutes setting the scene, introducing us both to the earth as it is now and to the family, particularly the mother Monica, (Frances O'Connor) who takes in the robot boy David.  These scenes occasionally drag, but since you assume they're going to set up the main story and make it more effective, you put up with them.  Then there's a good hour and a half of David running around in search of mommy, who has abandonned him, meeting up with Jude Law as a robot prostitute, and surviving various traumatic experiences...and then the movie just keeps going, on and on and on.  After a while, all tension and suspense dissipates, and it becomes schmaltzy and slow and well, robotic.  And then there are a bunch of aliens, and a fairy, and so on and so on.Its not so much disjointed as unfocused.  It resembles Kubricks Space Odyssey in that individual shots go on forever.  It resembles E.T in that you can't quite stop caring, even though you begin to hate everyone and get bored.The parts that work the best, in fact the only parts that work, are those scenes with Jude Law.  Although he's in about and hour of the film it feels far to short.  He portrays the robot with feelings even though he's not programmed to have them much more effectively than Haley Joel Osment, who really cannot carry this much material.  It's Gigolo Joe who is the one really remarkable character, and maybe TeddyAs for the rest......aaaarrrrgggghhh.	2.0	Aaaaarrrggghhhh	2002-05-07	9	3	6
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3W0POMI33YQXQ	"Enlightened ""Both Eyes Closed, see what u don..."	I'm not going to totally trash this film because it does have replay value.  I can watch it over and over again to try and figure it out.  The acting is pretty good.  The boy (forgot his name) will go far in life with those type of acting skills.  I don't own the movie but I've watched it several times.  The robot lover was entertaining as well.  The special effects and graphics were top notch.  Spielberg always does a good job in that area.  But the problem I am having is that I'm trying pretty hard to figure out what the movie is about.  David is trying to become real so he sets out on a 'pilgrimage' to find the 'blue fairy'.  The reason he believes in this is because his mommy read Pinocchio to him.  I know that much.  I also understand that he is saying that the end of the world is near because we are trying to get rid of the macines because humans won't live forever and all that will be left is machines because humans will destroy themselves.  Im guessing thats what it is but if someone can give me more insight into this then that will be greatly appreciated.  I would recommend that every one see this movie at least once; maybe youll understand it better than I have.	3.0	Its Aight...I guess	2002-03-20	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3LCYZJ5OZ5DVW	"ENRIQUE VELASQUEZ ""EV"""	Please... to all these people who criticize this film. If you don't like sad films, then of course you wont like this one. This is one the best spielberg's films since Schlinder's List. Very, very powerful in emotional content, the acting is very good (excellent from Haley's part) and the story takes so many twists that you keep on wondering how will it end. Now to all these people who didnt like it.. Ask yourselves, Don't you just keep on wishing this kid gets something in return, some loving for all the struggle he goes through? The beauty of this story is that are we human so selfish that a robot can eventually learn to love more than us? I think no human would go through what this kid did, and wait for so long and still unconditionally pursue the person he &quot;Loves&quot; I think that's the main message of this film, and is a very smart and interesting point that a lot of people may be missing. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars (which this film could have) is due to some inadequate scenes that cheapen the whole movie. Particularly the Flesh fair (which I would have omitted completely or at least made less disturbing) Overall I think this movie is worth much more than the 7 or 8 dollars you may pay for seeing it.

Although, it also seems like a completely different movie mixed into one.  Its hard to explain so you should go see it for yourself! It's about two parents whos only son was in an accident and probably wont live. They buy a child droid programed to love named David. Somehow, this droid really feels and everything. When the couple's real son comes back, they are forced to get rid of David. On his own, he must survive the torture humans put robots through. He even looks for the blue fairy. But it is better than Pinocchio. Definately not a movie for kids!	4.0	Pinocchio Meets The Future!	2001-07-15	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1CNKWTO9ZIF9A	E. P. Scott	First, Haley: Following his work in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Pay It Forward,&quot; Haley Joel Osment's convincing &quot;A.I.&quot; portrayal of a robot child who gradually becomes more human completes a trio of outstanding performances.  We may well be witnessing the accomplishments of the finest boy actor in the history of American cinema.  (Ask yourself, &quot;If not Haley, then who?&quot; and start working back from present day.  Pretty soon you're all the way back past Dean Stockwell and Freddie Bartholomew, and still no rival has emerged.  Haley is left standing above them all.)Second, the heart of the film: &quot;A.I.&quot; explores the allegorical territory of two questions: What does it mean to be human? and What are the responsibilities of creators to their sentient creations?  Its answers are not flattering to humanity.  In &quot;A.I.&quot; the behavior of the robots is almost always more admirable than that of the humans.  Young David (Haley's character) yearns to become human.  In one telling moment in the second act, without realizing it, he does.  Contrary to his programming, he files into a rage and murders another David, the robotic equivalent of his younger brother, Cain slaying Abel.  The filmmakers' true genius is revealed in what happens next: William Hirt's character, the creator and father-equivalent of both Davids, enters the room and registers no shock, disappointment, or even acknowledgment of what has just happened.  It is the worst possible response, because it underscores the unimportance of the creation to the creator.  The indictment of the human race is complete, the failure in its obligations to its technological children is total.Finally, the third act: Some critics have attacked it, but I think it appropriate.  David learns, as all humans do, that there is no love that does not end in loss. To make artificial beings who can love, and to make no provision for them to deal with loss, is ethically reprehensible.  The inevitability of loss can be temporarily skirted, though not averted, only by something approaching the scale of divine intervention. In this film, that is the arrival of empathic alien robot archaeologists.  If the reason why David's human mother could be recreated for only a single day feels a bit contrived, the alternative proves less appealing upon examination.  Had she lived longer, she would have begun to miss her husband, her biological son, and her life beyond her relationship with David.  That would have made him unhappy, and, in the end, he would have lost her anyway.&quot;A.I.&quot; is a heart-wrenching, thought-provoking film, one of the best ever made.  I have two thumbs; they are both up.	5.0	A.I. is remarkable filmmaking	2002-03-08	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AVIDYDZS9ATI5	Erica Casasola	I went to see A.I. opening night.  I went in not knowing what to expect, having stayed away from other reviews and even some of those spoilers that give away the whole film in order to come in as virginal as possible.  I'm glad I did.  A.I. is not a perfect film, which is why I can't give it five stars.  However, it is a very thought provoking movie that some people will not like at all.  Actually, after seeing some other people's reviews on yahoo and elsewhere I can see that your either going to love the movie or totally hate it.  I could say that Haley Joel Osment is super in this movie, but that isn't a reason to go see this movie.  Go see it because it's fine movie making.  However, it does ask a lot from its audience.  So, if you want to go see a popcorn movie that you can passively watch don't go see this movie.  From the very beginning you have to watch intently and carefully.  Some of the reviewers who have hated the movie point out supposed plot mistakes, but they are all explained.  Granted, the ending was a little out of this world, but it does hold up to what Kubrick was going for.  I thought about other possible endings, but any other ending wouldn't have made as much sense in the context of what went on in the film.  The running debate in my mind is, is David's love real?  Sure, he was made specifically to 'love,' but it's never really a free choice.  He sticks to his 'mother' like glue before he was imprinted, but didn't display affection.  It wasn't until she imprinted herself into his memory that he turned into this loving robot.  Hense, I tend to lean towards the side that David's love is not 'real' in the sense that his mother's love for him eventually is.  It is rather a product of his program, one that was designed and written to replicate the outward indications of love.  And yet, I also lean to the fact that for David his 'love' is real.  He knows nothing else but to give of himself 100%, which in itself may not be classified as love, but rather obsession.  He becomes obsessed with being a real little boy, in the hopes that his mother will love him back.  Sadly, he doesn't realize that she does love him, until the end of course.  However, I think that David is no more than a smart automaton who is hardwired to think only one thing.  I cried, but not for him, but for the fact that love is such a precious thing that humans will go to every extream to have it, even to manufacture it.  Gigolo Joe was built to fill the physical 'need' in the love equation, David to fill the emotional.  I know I'm rambling but the film makes me think of so many things at once... like what is the price we pay for our own hubris?  Do we have the right to play god?  Just because we can create an artificial being, does it mean that we should?  What happens when our creations have a mind of their own?  Again, if you want a film that asks that and many other quesions, but will leave it up to you to find the answers, go see A.I..  If you want to see jiggling boobs, car chases and over simplified plots that you could find on a 'Friends' episode, don't, I repeat, don't go see this movie.  You will not like it because you have to bring something of your own thoughts into the process.	4.0	Love it or hate it, it's a great movie	2001-07-02	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK	"Eric James Cooper ""ejames43"""	"I was riveted to this movie for the first half of it. The idea of the robot boy giving and recieving love was so intriguing. You had to feel so bad for David as he was continually abused and misunderstood. That was the charm of the movie and it tied into the ""can robots give love and can we give it back?"" theme. So, when David was left alone - he becomes the tragic figure that strives for love and redemption.However, the plot changes into a moral message and I was left twisting in the wind. Spielberg kind of goes off into a ""we should take care not to abuse technology and A.I."" diatribe. What is lost is the original story and the compassion for what happened in the first segment of the film. I was expecting a reunion with his mother in the present-day, I suppose. Was that too much to ask?I am a big fan of story-telling. This one had me and then lost me. I came away feeling lost and sad. Yes, the effects are brilliant - but that's beside the point in my opinion.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFYGGRLCBSAX7	Eric Lee	A.I. (The movie that late Stanley Kubrick mothered and was waiting to direct) is a very dark and depressing story about a robot who wanted to become a boy. The movie isn't just a modern retelling of the story Pinocchio, (Some joke its Pinocchio 2001) it's beyond that. Its Features issues of discrimination and it has a disturbing look into the future like the growing Prostitution and Death.Most critics argue that A.I. is not Kubrick enough and has too much &quot;Heart&quot; coming from Spielberg. But they forget that Spielberg was a dear friend of Kubrick and that Kubrick was leaning towards joining forces with Spielberg. So it was likely to have the heart it already has in the movie. But, then again no people really knows with Kubrick.The Plot, Acting, Characters and Visuals are all spectacular. Haley Joel Osment did a better then I excepted as David the robotic boy. I think he surprised everyone in how well he played the role, as well Jude Law as the robotic gigolo, Gigolo Joe. The movie also features voice actor Jack Angel as the brilliant heart-warming voice of Teddy the robot toy bear and Frances O'Connor as the first skeptical then loving mother Monica. In the movie she must decide if the family should keep or destroy David after he caused a near fatal accident. All the actors made the characters come to life. Especially the four I mentioned, who literally steal your heart and make you believe that their real. But, you must thank the brilliant John Williams as well for creating somewhat of a theme song to fit each character's mood in his musical segments.In the end, A.I. seemed more like the joint Kubrick and Spielberg Production that some say Kubrick was aiming towards. The movie itself was an emotional ride between happiness and depression. At one point movie got so depressing I didn't cry...I wept. Overall I would have to say that A.I. is One of the Best Films of 2001 and is definitely worth seeing more than once.	5.0	A Very Dark and Depressing Prophecy.	2001-07-03	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AHXTBDZMMK84E	Ernst Oberdorfer	If you watch this movie for the first time, you may think, oh dear, why do they play this in the evening - while the obvious target group is dreaming in their cribs yet. But after an hour you feel, there is something wrong with this superficial harmony. And so on, increasing cracks spread out all over this lovely, hearty family-toy-story. Your suspects grow - horror is near, terrible things will happen. And so it does. But don't expect the clear and the obvious. Suspense is the striking mood in this picture.For me it's the best Spielberg - even better than schindlers list, which I saw nearly ten times. But it's boring to compare this absolute different things - in my case the (trivial but) decisive point is: I prefer colour in movies and I like SF and utopian stories.CAUTION: Please leave your below-10-aged-kids at home to spare them that grievous experience of repudiation of a loving child by its own mother. I think particularly people who ever had the experience of losing a beloved person will become very appealed by this movie. Special Remark: if something like TEDDY will appear on the market anytime - i'm sure to be one of the first buyers. I love him.	5.0	fairy-tale for adults	2001-09-25	4	4	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1U3QQ1BOXWH22	"E. Roppo ""science buff"""	This is a spoil-free review.First I'll start by saying that this is a really good movie. It's a well told story, compellingly acted, and beautifully shot. But after it passed the 2 hour mark, it started to lose steam.This feels more like a Kubrick work than Spielberg. It's decidedly not warm and fuzzy and it paints a view of the future that is at once captivating and frightening. It's refreshingly free of cliched &quot;futuristic&quot; gizmos and clean-room like dwellings. However, that doesn't mean there aren't eye-popping visual treats. The key is that in A.I., the future feels very 'lived-in' - and that's a nice change from your average sci-fi film.Most of the acting is superb. Haley Joel Osment is incredible, it's the kind of performance that is so convincing, that you don't even think about him as an actor playing a role...he really  IS the character. I had some problems with personalities in the movie making decisions, and having reactions, that seemed out of character. Some choices that didn't ring true for me. But they were never enough to detract seriously from the experience. Jude Law is also fantastic, and a very good complement to Osment's character.The story is good, parts are dead predictable, but enough is surprising that you don't find yourself waiting for it to unfold.  It takes you through some wildly different experiences and scenarios, but the characters are solid and it usually works well.However, the main reason I didn't rate this as a '5' is because of the end. There's a moment right around 2 hours into this film, where it feels as if it's ending. It's not a particularly happy 'ending', and it would leave certain issues unresolved. For me, however, it felt appropriate...and I would have left the theater deep in thought about the events in the film and about the amazing journey that the main character goes through. It wouldn't have come to a perfect resolution, but very few things in life do...which allows everyone to take their own 'message' from the experience.Alas, it wasn't to be, as the movie took what I consider to be a drastic turn. My complaint about the end isn't about how drastic the turn is, but the fact that it presents a number of huge contrivances that feel very forced. It's like the writers desperately wanted a perfect ending so they invented dozens of plot devices, some of which contradict each other, to help them achieve their goal.During this part of the film, there were audible snickers in the audience (I wasn't one of them) as the real end unfolded...which is unfortunate because until then, it was a very quiet and involved audience, very much into the story.Yes, the end holds some big surprises, and some stunning visual treats, and I enjoyed them. But those moments quite frankly weren't enough to overcome the sheer disappointment I felt that this wonderful story was being brought to a close in such a clumsy manner.DO go see this movie, you will enjoy it. And if you're like me, you'll find enough greatness in the first 2 hours to forgive the out-of-place ending	4.0	Great, but...	2001-06-30	10	8	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1FE8EDP4JJEAC	eva del cid	The mix of Spielberg and Kubrick makes A.I. an instant cult classic.  Altho Kubrick died before this movie was made, Spielberg had Kubrick's story boards.  I think Spielberg honors Kubrick by staying close to Kubrick's vision of a future that shows what can happen to us after we blythly destroy our planet for the sake of profit. I think the film's view of an alternative future satisfyingly goes farther and deeper than other sci fi films of this genre such as Soylent Green or Blade Runner.Also, I like the element of suggestion that maybe E.T. aliens known as the Greys might actually be tourists from our future who come to see our world recalling a lost existence just as we might do today by visiting a natural history museum.For fun, when A.I. comes out on video, I want to do my own editing to make it a perfect 5 star film by my standards.  I will shorten the vroom-vroom mass appeal portion, as well as shorten the number of Haley Joel Osment's cloying &quot;Mommy-Mommy&quot; scenes.  Wow! Isn't Osment a great actor!!!  Can he really be a child????My favorite scene was when the three A.I.s are lost in the woods.  Each has limited knowledge of the real world.  Their three minds collectively still didn't know enough, yet their limitations were so endearing.One further observation: At the very start of the film, the characters talk using really BIG words....wow!!

I loved Haley Joel Osmont's acting, he is brilliant!! He immediatly makes you believe he is a robot, and all through the film his acting made his character believable. I also really liked Teddy, and I am looking forward to owning one (well, if they ever exist!) he is funny, sweet, intelligent and extremelly loyal, and you can't help but like him.  The special effects are also brilliant, but I won't go into them. As for the story... I loved the first part, life in the future, how comfortable it could become, the relationships between humans and robots, the substitution of a real child by a robot child, the adaptation of a new &quot;articial&quot; member into a family and so on... that was good!But then, the movie made a 180 turn, and it became depressing, sad, meaningless, boring and over all cruel. As soon as David gets thrown out from the house, it looked like someone had changed the movie we were watching. I didn't like the plot, I hated the vision of the future and I thought the ending was lame and sad.I consider myself a Spielberg fan, but in this case I have to say that whatever Kubric was doing, Spielberg couldn't pull it off and it just turned out as an hybrid, depressing and boring story.	2.0	Depressing, Boring and very long!!!	2001-10-09	1	0	1

The performance by Haley Joel Osment is excellent.  Judd Law also offers a very good supporting role as a luvbot, Giggalo Joe.  Based on the story of Pinnochio this movie explores a possible future in which robots take the step from machine intelligence to the realm of emotional intelligence.  At times the movie can be corny but essentially it is moving tale of awakening, loss, a journey, finding and then losing again.  In addition, there are many fine cinematic touches which are reminescent of Stanley Kubrick to whom the movie was dedicated.  Perhaps not destined to become a ""Blade Runner"" nevertheless, in many respects A.I. explores in much greater depth the moral conflicts which may arise as machine intelligence becomes a reality."	5.0	At moments a little Spielbergesque but very good	2002-03-02	4	1	3

As every Holywood movie, this one is also full of unnecessary details, which do not go with the story line. And in fact at some points, this fact is far more exaggerated for AI.  Take the scenes where the lover robot enters the story and then leaves out, and you'll end up with the same movie but 45 minutes shorter.  It seems like those 45 minutes were added by Spielberg, but were not in the orginal score.  Those trailing scenes really do not go with the movies &quot;soft&quot; approach.  There are some plausible points though, like he did not flick his eyes even once during the movie.

The movie is paced very slow, only made worse by its constant need to say &quot;Wait, that's not the ending we want!&quot;. The movie attempted to be thought-provoking, but then unfortunately shifts direction into an action-romp/wizard of oz/e.t. thing.I disagree with the main reviewer. The first half of the movie seems very Kubrick, with its unsettling strangeness. The last half is much closer to Spielberg, with its desire to make you feel wonder and sympathy. Watch Kubrick's movies and you'll instantly notice the awkwardness of the characters. Something always seems &quot;not quite right&quot;, that is the same impression you get from the first part of A.I. I'm not sure where the main reviewer got the idea that the first half seems like Spielberg and the last like Kubrick?! (especially since the aliens in the end resemble the ones from Close Encounters!)Overall, it was a decent movie. Better than most of the Hollywood drivel, but sadly not quite good enough to be great. The acting is good on all parts. The special effects are nice (but that doesn't mean much to me). The cinematography is excellent. The story unfortunately is so-so. I give it 4 stars for great visuals and an &quot;ok&quot; plotline. It wasn't quite challenging enough for me, but it's still worth seeing.	4.0	Left Wanting	2001-07-03	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2NFBV9Z3VVHFF	Felipe Oyarse	This movie proves that cinema still deserves to be considered as an expression of art, and this is possible because of the talented artists involved in this project.The key to understand why this movie is so good, lies in the fact that we have Stanley Kubrick's vision in a Steven Spielberg movie, this is so great, I always thought that certain movies had so much potential, but the director's point of view was the wrong one. This is why I think the best way sometimes would be to work in a team. I know this is not possible, but in A.I. we get the closest thing to that, we can see Kubrick's dark and interesting point of view of humanity mixed with Spielberg's technical perfection plus his &quot;common sense&quot;. (I always thought that Kubrick, as a genious artist, sometimes abused too much of his audiences, while Spielberg ussually seems to be a more &quot;down to earth&quot; director.)OK, that was the cinematic and technical comment, the scrypt and story are really interesting, and of course this is the most important thing in a movie. I believe A.I. is a story based on the search for happiness and the purpose of one's existance, wich reminds me of some japanese animation series, where these topics are touched in a very interesting way. It is a movie that will make you think, laugh (at some scenes) and cry, it is a movie about humanity. (and it's a very good one).Haley Joel Osment is a great actor, I think he shows what a real actor must do, &quot;David&quot; is so different to &quot;Cole&quot; (Sixth Sense&quot;) that you can see he is really acting in these movies, he should get some award for this work. Also Jude Law made a very good job in this movie, and the music score is amazing, but the main stars in this movie are Haley Joel Osment (playing an unforgettable &quot;David&quot;), Spielberg (for making such a perfect work with some help from Kubrick's style) and the story itself. I would like to see this scrypt winning the oscar.This movie is a true masterpiece and it must be a part of your DVD collection.	5.0	A genuine Masterpiece!!!!!	2001-10-10	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1AHE8CFKRFSKT	Fernando Castillo Daz	This is a movie that goes by the future. Human beings and robots coexist in this new world. The last ones are called Mechas (mechanic) and live to serve normal people. But one day, an idea crosses human's mind: they will programme a creature that is able to love, since is the only ability Mechas do not have. This presents an important ethical question: should he be loved, too, and how could someone love a Mecha?A married couple have a son, but he's been unconscious for a long time and rests now in a frozen capsule till he is able to wake up. Meanwhile, it occurs to the father to adopt and look after a Mecha boy. The boy (Haley Joel Osment) results to be a perfect son: he is handsome and obedient, and he seems so real for everyone. However, the couple start to feel uncomfortable with his presence, because he neither eat anything nor sleep, since he is a robot, and he's always his eyes fixed in them, without blinking.They finally decide to make him being able to love. For the moment, their own son finally wakes up and comes back home. This will bring many problems; the two kids are different. The real one treats the Mecha boy badly, like a toy, because that's what he really is for him. This conflict established between them force their parents to abandon him in the forest. He's miserable, but now he tries to find the blue fairy in order to ask her to be transformed into a real boy. He goes with another Mecha (Jude Law) who helps him in his search.I liked this movie because of many things. This moving story is the same as the Pinocchio tale set in the future and, at the same time, it deals the struggle between human beings and robots. I had seen some action movies in which robots always are bad and want to destroy the humanity. However, in this movie the robots are the ones who are controlled by real people, and this shows a different view of seeing this conflict. Here we have a Mecha boy being able to love and the incapacity of his adoptive parents to love him in return. Besides, in some scenes we can see the sport of killing Mechas like a way to amuse people, and this makes robots seem good, because they don't harm anybody.Steven Spielberg's work in this movie is really good, because of  the places on which he puts the camera. Again, Osment shines in his portrayal of this Mecha boy, because it is quite well-depicted and he manages to not blinking in any moment, which must be something hard, I think, and the same for Jude Law.This movie also has some beautiful scenes, for example, in which we see Osment falling silently to the sea. However, there is too much feeling inside, too much love which sometimes can be ridiculous and childish. The real end is when he gets frozen,the rest with the aliens is stupid and boring	4.0	If Kubrick would be able to see this...	2002-06-29	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AXKQUMC2WEVTT	Fiona	"What a neat premise this movie came up with at the beginning: show us what turns life can take if a machine becomes truly intelligent and able to bear emotions.But then the movie almost immediately starts to stomp on its own feet. Our hero, David, the first of the new robot generation able to handle emotions, is apparently not the first. Otherwise his predecessors would not be able to fear death, develop cynism beyond their limited programming or forget their programming at all. Best example here the lovebot ""Gigolo Joe,"" who tries to go undercover when he finds a dead woman in his apartment and later befriends David - all this goes far beyond ""programmed reactions"" as explained in the movie (why would the manufacturer program these into a lovebot at all?). Oh, and if you wonder how much thicker the plotline became due to ""Gigolo Joe"" imagine his role being deleted and try to think hard if he delivered anything useful.(Ok, I will *not* argue about the question why David gets shortfused when he eats spinach but can fall into a pool and nothing happens or why with all the elaborate technology to mimic humans none of the bots blink.)Then we see David getting left by his mother (or the person he was programmed to love) and his endless quest to find the ""Blue Fairy"" from ""Pinocchio"" who he thinks can make him a real boy and win him the love of his mother. Did I say endless? Yes, because all of us past age 8 know that this quest will be futile. You may feel sorry for David, but you will also feel like watching an accident happen and you can do nothing about it.But then enter Mr. Spielberg. When you watch the last 30 minutes of the movie you will know what I mean. You can almost tell where Kubrick's notes ended for sure and where Spielberg took what he described as ""his own intellectual freedom."" At this point you will feel like watching ""E.T."" and ""2001"" at the same time - on an LSD trip. Spielberg tried so hard to reach the heights of Kubrick (and had Williams throw in some ""2001""-like tunes for the final) it is almost pitiful how he ruins his own ambitions with his pink popcorn attitude to sooth the viewer. Spielberg just can't let us go without a pat on the shoulder and a reassuring ""everything will be fine!""How swell would everything have been, if the movie ended right there with David staring and begging and Teddy eternally sitting with him. Audiences would have left the theaters wondering ""are we aware of what a responsibility we are getting ourselves into there?"" I would have even forgotten about the above mentioned implausibility of the emotional reactions the earlier robots had, which most likely were delivered to pull us onto the sides of the robots.Which brings me to the one character I liked the best and felt genuinely sorry for: patient, enduring and quiet Teddy."	3.0	At least cut the last 30 minutes	2002-04-10	7	4	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ALA0USK6TO4VG	"Fisafire ""Gadgetlover"""	I would like to thank Steven Spielberg for making Stanley Kubrics last story. There are very few though provoking mind-bending movies out there and this is one of them. Its only flaw is that it runs a little to long but that is true of a lot of Kubric movies. This film shows how evolution is passing from humans to machines. As we humans have so many flaws the robots can be an improvement and inevitably replace us.  Many people wont understand this and many more will even hate this movie. That's their problem.  I loved this film and will watch it over and over again.  And I am kind of sad that their will never be another Kubric story.  But Spielberg is still around. I hope he makes a few more like this before he retires.	5.0	A GREAT FINAL VISION	2001-07-03	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A34HD9QD5QSXN7	"F. Kogan ""koganf"""	Good movie. All what it said about the ending is right, although it is also intersting - how this robot, who developed intelligence and emotions, would live forever with the burden of being sole carrier of the humankind memory? Osment was amazing, I hope he'll continue to amaze us the same way. He seems to be intelligent enough not to succumb to the usual early celebrity vices.To everyone who liked the idea of the movie (as opposed to its realization) I strongly recommend the works of Stanislav Lem. He developed the problem of interaction of humans and theyr future artificially intelligent creations to the very high level, and many of the images in A.I. seem to have jumped from his books, such as Flesh Fair from Return From The Stars and the scene of the row of hanging David copies and piles of spare parts - from Peace On Earth (same as Matrix, btw, which seem to be directly copied from Lem's The Futurological Congress).	4.0	At last managed to see it...	2002-03-28	3	2	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	One would think that a science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg (who also contributed to the screenplay) inspired by the vision of the late Stanley Kubrick would have to be a brilliant work of monumental significance.  Think again.This story was a passion for Kubrick, who always wanted to film it.  Spielberg picked it up as homage to Kubrick and attempted to imbue it with Kubrickian nuances.  While the film is clearly infused with the sci-fi spirit of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it has neither the dramatic power nor the philosophical depth of that classic.  Instead, we have an insignificant and disjointed human interest story, full of sentimental pap about a boy who isn't even human.To be sure, the visual effects are outstanding.  With Spielberg at the helm, this was bound to be a given.  Using the latest technology and a $90 Million budget, Spielberg cranks out another effects show that rivals his latest Jurassic Park episode (another dud of a screenplay with great visuals).  However, the story never gets any traction and we are left hoping the characters would just shut up and get to the next computer generated image.The first hour of the movie is boring and tedious as we see robot boy David (Haley Joel Osment) attempt to adapt to his new human family and vice versa.  Then suddenly Spielberg tries to shake thing up by throwing David into the standard futuristic anarchical society, a backdrop long ago rendered hackneyed in this genre.  Shifting into third gear, we are then taken on a sci-fi junket to old New York, now semi-submerged from the effects of global warming, which have caused the oceans to rise at least 200 feet to cover all but the highest skyscrapers (we cannot possibly have a sci-fi film lately without some political hyperbole lurking in the subtext).  Then fourth gear and we go on a journey far into future where David comes face to face with advanced beings in his quest to become a real boy, just like Pinocchio.Spielberg attempts to meld ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001 A Space Odyssey, to create a mosaic of themes that does justice to none of them.  The last segment is punctuated by the advanced beings driveling about how the human race is the one true link to the meaning of life.  This is extremely ironic given the events of David's journey including vile children mocking him, parents who abandon him, a flesh fair and a futuristic red light district full of violence and debauchery.The film is also full of annoyingly unbelievable depictions, such as a love robot (Jude Law) who is a sophisticated piece of technology able to reason and operate at a very high level, who has to crick his neck to turn on his mood music.The acting is terrific, despite the vapid dialogue.  Haley Joel Osment just keeps getting better and better.  He presents just the right balance of robotic disconnection with his human counterparts and the sincere efforts of an emotional being attempting to emerge.  Jude Law also gives another outstanding performance as Joe Gigolo, stealing just about every scene in which he appears.This was supposed to be one of the all time blockbusters, but despite putting up decent numbers, it failed to even match its budget at the box office.  For once, I have to agree with the masses that this film just failed to distinguish itself beyond the special effects.  I rated it a 6/10.  Mark it up as a bad day at the office for Steven Spielberg.	3.0	A bad day at the office for Spielberg	2002-04-06	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	Steven Spielberg's &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; continues its quest to become a real success with an ambitious two-DVD set. The discs lack a director's commentary -- Spielberg doesn't like them -- but is packed with details of the science fiction drama's three-decade history, from its genesis with Stanley Kubrick to its realization by Spielberg.Laurent Bouzereau's DVD team had liberal access to the filmmakers during production, with key craftsmen emerging as the supplemental disc's stars. Interviews and docu footage are segregated into unusually specific craft areas -- sound editing, lighting, costumes -- along with the usual categories: visual effects, production design, animation, etc. (The short and specific extras follow a trend in studio DVDs away from lengthy film docus that could trigger additional talent costs.)Picture quality is more than up to major studio standards, with detail apparent throughout, even in some of the dark soft-contrast scenes. The many scenes with CG and blue-screen composites appear vibrant and convincing, especially in the much-maligned third act. The DTS audio setting provides more punch, bottom and dramatic effect than the Dolby, as usual.	4.0	Intelligent extras	2002-03-14	12	10	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1JDD5O4U7HPX7	"""flyswat16"""	A.I. is a brilliant, and powerful film. Started by the late Stanley Kubrick, this film has been worked on for 15 years, until being passed on to Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death. This film is about a robotic child who is programmed to love, but the question is, will the humans be able to love a robot in return. David (Haley Joel Osment - a spectacular performance) is that child. He ends up living with Monica (Frances O'Connor) and Martin. Monica is the mother of Martin who is a real boy, but she quickly begins to love David even though she knows that Martin is becoming extremely jelous. David is sent away after almost harming Martin, only with a Teddy Bear named Teddy who can walk and talk. He soon begins a quest to find the Blue Fairy from the Pinnochio story with his new friend Gigolo Joe (Jude Law - very good permormance) because he figures that if he can be turned into a real boy, his mommy will love him again. Much more happens than I told you, but that is just the basic storyline. An amazing film to look at with all of the visual effects that include robots and futuristic cars and houses. Only such a movie could be made with outstanding creativity and powerful acting, given by Stanley, Steven, Haley Joel, and Jude. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone.  *A.I.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AKH7DFCVBR2AP	forever_dreamer	"I will be honest here. When I heard about this movie ten years ago and rediscovered it recently I really wanted to not watch it at all since it was a ""Speilberg"" film and you know how sentimental and stuff his movies can be (despite having seen and enjoyed many of his movies including ""E.T."" and ""War of the Worlds""). However since movies about robots, more specifically ""human"" robots greatly interest me and also seeing previews of the film with Haley Joel Osment's incredibly convincing acting as David and his lovable companion Teddy I knew I had to see this film.I really believed Haley was the robot David who just wanted to be loved by his mother. I felt his pain, joy, and loneliness. Stanley Kubrick originally did not think a child actor would be able to portray David but in my opinion Haley did the role justice. I could not see anyone else bringing Teddy to life as Jack Angel did. He really made Teddy feels like a loyal guardian type who wasn't afraid to be stern with you but would always be there to comfort you at the same time. I also felt Jude Law was convincing as Joe.**POSSIBLE SPOILER**I wish more imagination had been put into the mecha towards the end of the film. I was not impressed by their appearance but this did not hinder my enjoyment of the film.I recommend anyone who loves Speilberg films, sentimental films that tug at your heartstrings,  or  just loves robot/sci-fi films (especially with ""human"" robots) to rent or purchase this film."	5.0	I wanted to hate this movie but I loved it!	2011-06-18	1	1	0

I was utterly  bored throughout the entirety of this movie. That actor, Haley or whatever looks really funny, and annoys the hell out of me. If the robot kid was portrayed by some other child actor, I would maybe have not hated this movie so much. The movie drags on for way too long, and I found myself watching the seconds slowy tick by on my watch more entertaining than this movie. The acting didn't come off as very good either. Overall I would say the only thing worth seeing in this movie is Teddy, the talking robot /toy teddy bear.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2RMO8E5AZWRYZ	Frank J. Gonzalez	"I am not one to join these general online forums.  It has to be something very compelling or meaningful for me to break this rule of thumb.  So it was that I joined Amazon membership primarily to write a cathartic commentary and critique about this amazing movie, A.I..I had seen this movie in the theater when it was first released in 2001 because, unlike the rest of the pure garbage we get from Hollywood, it looked precisely like the kind of complex movie for which it is worth risking $9 of my already wrongly heavily taxed money.  I admit that I did not grasp fully back then the sophistication of the movie's message.  It just hit me like a sledgehammer 4 years later in August of 2005, some days ago, when I saw it for a second time.I say my writing here is cathartic because my parents divorced when I was a boy of 8.  My mother left our family.  It fostered and strengthened in me resentments against her throughout my life that I had not realized were tearing me apart underneath miles-deep layers of denial or distraction.We spent the overwhelming majority of the last 10 years without speaking to each other.  I could not understand how she, as the mature adult, could not make a stronger effort to stay in touch no matter what angry words I fired at her, especially because it was her decision that brought me into this world.  My anger would have eventually subsided if only she had tried a bit harder as the adult above my desire as a rebellious, rude teenager to be alone during her visiting rights.  I wish she could understand that it had far more to do with wanting autonomy at that stage in my life than rejecting her.Her apparent indifference only reinforced my resolve.  Out of principle for how I would never treat my own child, I had even resigned and prepared myself psychologically to accept that she was dead to me even though this, even now, is not the case.This movie forced me to a crossroads that I had not expected.  While I still carry this justified resentment, I feel terrible that I feel it for my own mother who--of all people--I wish could understand how very real and distinct was my disillusionment over her departure and how she could have mitigated it.  Even this last reflection causes me great distress as I type it.I offer this background to illustrate that our reactions to this movie, A.I., will definitely be influenced heavily by what experiences we have had in our lives.I gave this movie 4 stars out of 5 to acknowledge the valid criticism about its incontinuity of mood and plausibility during the middle.  It is true that the movie took an annoying departure from the up-'til-then superbly dramatic mood it had set in its first third.  It is true that Spielberg could have made the fictional ""orga"" society that disparaged ""mecha's"" a bit more realistic and less flashy as he had done so well in the first third.  It is true that the second third lingered a bit too long in this detour.  But even this section had its saving graces.  This section was indispensible for the message of the movie to depict the lopsided, even unwarranted conflict between two different groups and how not everyone on either side was as dumb or shallow as they seemed.  In fact, the reaction to this movie itself indicates on what side of the conflict's fence the viewer would likely have fallen had he been written into its script!This critique aside, the final third of the movie fully recaptured and surpassed the mood it had previously lost, in time to matter.  It happened at about the point where David set out to meet his creator accompanied by Gigolo Joe who tried giving David some lessons in the ways of the world in a way that earlier his adoptive mother admitted too late she wished she had done at the moment when she forever abandoned her adopted son in the woods.I found Frances O'Connor's portrayal of Monica, David's adopting mother, to be truly disturbing and right on the mark.  She was a woman capable of despair, callous calculation and soft, loving sweetness all in the same movie.  Haley Joel Osment was exceptionally brilliant as her son and main character, David, for reasons you really must see for yourself.  Though Jude Law's character, the experienced Gigolo Joe, was dramatically certainly nothing out of this world, he was the ""voice"" of the necessary additional dimension so critical to making the viewer seriously reevaluate the parameters of what we, as humans, have considered ""human"" up 'til now.  How could ""real"" humans be so capable of destroying beings who(?) had evolved into emotional ""parity"" as demonstrated through their capacity for fear, pain and love?  Again, what does this say about the critics who ""didn't connect"" with David merely because he was ""not real""?  Have they no capability to adapt a protocol to conditions that will minimize suffering in other entities?  The very way I ask that question is intentionally robotic.Here was a boy who, whether by programming or not, had nothing but pure affection and enthusiasm for his adopting mother.  He would have achieved happiness only to hear her say that she loved him.  His mother, on the other hand, truly did not understand the nature of what she was unleashing when she decided to speak the words that would encode David's affection solely for her forever, even long after she was dead.  The foreboding question's prediction came to pass when David's creator was asked something to the effect of, ""It's not whether artificial creations can love humans but if humans are capable of loving them back.""Had the movie ended with David trapped in his hover copter with ""Teddy"" and that longing stare at the Blue Fairy, I would have been greatly disappointed that it really went nowhere.In fact, the movie's message was NOT complete, in my view, UNTIL the element of far-future time was introduced, and WITHOUT descriptive text at the bottom of the screen.  It was NOT complete until we saw future ""mecha's"", who obviously outlived all the ""orga's"", rescue David from his icy grave and, thanks to extremely advanced technology AND human(?) compassion, were able to give him, whether real or not, what he had single-mindedly sought his entire life, even if only for one brief moment in his indefinite existence.Stop reading now.  The next two paragraphs will spoil the dramatic end for you if you want to give the movie the chance to show you instead of reading about it through my words here.The end began its crescendo of sadness when Monica and David interacted throughout this entire single day like never before in literally thousands of years, even though David understood that it would end by nightfall as his rescuers had warned him.This crescendo of tears reached its peak as we saw a smiling David holding his never-to-be-woken-again mother's hand on the bed while ultra-brilliant composer John Williams's piece ""Where Dreams Are Born"" interlaced with Barbara Bonney's sweetly melancholy lyricless voice played as the camera receded from their peaceful scene, and the lights dimmed one by one from each room of the house.This movie was a love story, though not at all the kind most would suspect.  It had, by far, the most unforgettable, gut-wrenching ending I have ever seen in my life.  I still have flashback pangs of sad reflection days after watching it.  I think Stanley Kubrick would have been proud of what Speilberg did by taking his creation in an equally or MORE interesting direction.Having said all of this, I close by highly recommending this movie to anyone with a brain but, more importantly, a heart and a little patience.As for me, I will send this critique to my mother in the hope that it will make permanent reconciliation a likelier possibility."	4.0	"The most deeply moving, though imperfect, movie I have ever seen at 33.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A25KH15JDDXB8G	fungo	It would be difficult to suggest a director less-suited to the handling of Kubrick's work than Spielberg. Kubrick is cerebral, passionate, hallucinatory... Spielberg is prosaic, predictable, traditional. Kubrick likes to get under your skin with unsettling insights; Spielberg is the master of soapy drama and cheap-shot schlock.Separately, each director rightly has his fans. Together... well, AI fully demonstrates just how disastrous the pairing could possibly be. It is a film without any redeeming merit whatsoever. Anything that Kubrick brought to the table is lost in a morass of Spielbergian sentimentality and a gush of glossy yet unappealing CGI special effects.Spielberg has claimed that the (admittedly!) appalling Deus-ex-Machina ending was Kubrick's own. If so, we can only assume that Kubrick would have handled it very differently... or, in fact, that there was some sort of logical bridge that was not yet in place when Spielberg set to work. The first two hours of this film are nauseating and tedious beyond belief... but the ending is like an additional slap in the face, brilliantly emphasizing what an idiot you were to sit through the rest.If you crave light entertainment, see Jaws, or Jurassic Park. If you want Kubrick, see A Clockwork Orange, or Paths of Glory. But if you value your time and your sanity at all, run a mile to avoid the embarrassing mess that is AI.	1.0	Bleccchhh!	2008-06-19	14	3	11

Robots wanting to become real- seen that already.  But this was Speilberg- so I just had to see it- and boy did I love this film!!  I just sat there for two hours not moving at all- eyes glue to the screen- this movie did something to me!!  This, in my mind, is Speilberg's best &quot;drama&quot; movie of all time!!  Sure- there's Jurassic Park and all those other great action movies he made- but when it come to drama- this is far beyond the Color Purple.  The acting is great by all- the special effects are some of the best I've seen to date- and the music score- that single piano note played over and over again- is so creepy that it adds a whole new level to the film.  Jude Law's performace is great!!!  I also liked the fact that the &quot;Jimmy Cricket&quot; charactor was played by a robot teddy bear- that's right, incase you didn't know- this movie is based on Pinocchio and it was fun to see all the charactors we remembered from Pinocchio &quot;revisioned&quot; in this film.  I want to go in to detail about many things- but don't want to ruin the movie for you.  So I'll just tell you this- I manage a video store and watch basically every movie that comes out- but I still can't remember a movie being as great as this one!!  This film really is Oscar worthy.  I didn't want this movie to end!!  Just when I thought the movie -was- over, a whole new &quot;idea&quot; began- and without ruining the ending for you- I'll just say it was weird.  I use &quot;weird&quot; in a good way.  It's something you'd never expect in this movie's ending- but Speilberg has done movies of that type before- but not quite like this.  I was surprised to see the movie go in the direction it did near the end- I guess that was Kubrick's idea?  It was a great idea- but I don't think Speilberg would of done it that way would of it not been originally Kubrick's story- you'll know what I mean when you see it- ok that's all- go see the movie now- you'll also like Robin Williams' and Chris Rock's small cameos.	5.0	GREAT GREAT !!!!!!!!!	2001-08-01	6	3	3

This is a fascinating sci-fi story without focusing on the sci-fi too much, as most revolve around the fantasy aspect of the technology that the story gets lost.  This is definitely not the case, and is obviously meant to be watched and for it to entertain.Spielberg did a very good job of creating the mood and atmospher so it makes the viewer feel at home with everything and feel completely lost in all the right places.All the actory, especially Jude Law and William Hurt, did tremendous jobs in helping to create the atmosphere.	4.0	a sci-fi Pinocchio tale	2002-09-15	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	I've seen this a few times now and the voice-over is definately the weakest link. Spielberg does not seem able to do poetry, nor will he allow us a poignant moment without intruding cap in hand. The ending of this film is like attending a funeral of a much loved relative only for the funeral director to have arranged for the flowers to be delivered by an absailing SWAT team, conveniently landing on top of the coffin during the sermon. Anyone who has seen Spielberg's 'Minority Report' will not find this scenario entirely outside the bounds of possibility. Subtlety is not Steven's Forte. May I call you Steven? Oh.Also, the various 'buff' references to Kubrick's movies are in questionable taste, turning potential art into kitsch. The main flaw in this messy but compelling drama is the question of how David became the unique and enduring memory of the human race when we clearly saw dozens of other David's about to be shipped off to customers. Presumably as these would be delivered to dry land they would have had an even greater chance of surviving the big freeze than David. Mr Spielberg, I claim my fave poonds.

There is a depth of emotion and a knowledge of innocence in this movie that Kubrick could have never captured.

Don't expect high action, and don't look for constant explainations of what you see.  Active contemplation is what I expect Spielberg wanted from his audience with this outing.  Several reviewers on this page remark that the third act of this film is overwrought, even hokey.  For those of us who pay attention and understand that the ""aliens"" (which assimilate David's memories) at the end of this film are not aliens at all, but self-evolving mecha which have discovered a missing link to their original creators (i.e.: humans), then we are rewarded with one of the brightest speculative fiction films in many years.  To paraphrase Gigolo Joe: ""Humans hate us because when they're gone, we will be all that's left.""  This search for the creator is ultimately a very human endeavor.  I found that my fondness of this quiet bit of specualtion grew exponentially with multiple viewings (at first, I also thought those mecha were aliens--which cheapened the film a bit--once I came to the realization, it was as if I had seen an entirely different film).

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3ASII49QLNC93	Geoff Prescott	Artificial Intelligence comes across to me not like a movie in the usual sense. To me it was more like Spielberg spending 2-1/2 hours worshipping what little is left of his creativity. And why is this clunker so excruciatingly long? Simply because Spielberg couldn't figure out how to end the thing. As a modern rehash of the old Pinocchio myth, Artificial Intelligence is a complete flop. The special effects are interesting (thank God for special effects!) but Spielberg spoils the fun by applying a thick layer of cheap sentimentality to everything in sight. Haley Joel Osment is incapable of doing anything other than whining and making spaniel eyes at everybody. The single bright spot is provided by Jude Law who sparkles in his role as a sex worker robot. Who should see this movie? If you are among those who think that drug store greeting cards provide interesting reading, you should definitely see Artificial Intelligence.

You want to grab onto the screen and take the teddybear right into your arms. The acting is very good and this wide screen edition is the best way to view it since nothing will be ""chopped off"" the edges and excluding some of the great background scenery.

Ramas	I need to say that the field will be divided down the middle as to those who like/love this move and those who absolutely will probably walk out.  This is absolutely NOT A KID MOVIE!!!  This movie is about abandonment and a child seeking love from his parents.  This could be very frightening for a child.  Don't take one here!I will have to admit that about an hour into this movie I didn't like it.  I thought the 'Flesh Fair' segment was not done very well.  You have a crowd in the movie who is loving what they are seeing then all of a sudden they turn on the ring master.  It didn't make much sense.  A WWF crowd who all of a sudden has feelings.Many of the main characters disappear from the movie.  The parents are in the beginning then you never see them again.  The inventor of the child is only in a few segments.  Jude Law, you never know for sure what happens to him.  How the kid came upon the answer as to where to go to find 'all the answers' was very contrived.I must say though, by the end of the movie I loved it, though it took me over 2 1/2 hours to do so.  I found it very emotional and I loved Haley Joel Osment.  He did an absolutely wonderful acting job and hopefully at least he gets a kid's Academy Award for his performance.  Needless to say for me, he caused my handkerchief to be soaked by the last scene.Don't leave until the very end of the movie, you'll be sad but you'll be glad you did.  This is a very 'different' movie and you need to appreciate all the great acting and great special effects by ILM (George Lucas's company).I'm looking forward to buying this DVD.	4.0	AI - Not Typical SS Movie But Great	2001-07-16	4	2	2

It is actually frightning in that (without giving away the story) the events are plausible which makes the movie very disturbing.  The movie was excellent.  The actors were fantastic.  Halley Joel Osment, Jude Law along with the rest of the cast do an amazing job bringing the story alive.  I did not look at  my watch once nor shift in my seat.(it is about 2.5 hours) You can see both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubik in the film.

However, it really fails to explore or develop these characters in any significant depth.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	"Steven Spielberg pays homage to the late Stanley Kubrick with the film ""A.I. Artifical Intelligence"". He goes in a completely new direction from anything he has done previously.  I have seen the film in the theatre once, and twice more since on DVD. With each viewing, the impact it had on me seems to grow.  It is a premonition, a warning.""A.I"" takes us to (our?) future where the human obsession with technology as the solution to all problems has gone to the point of no return. The full range of human emotion is intermixed with a world dependent on intelligent machines. We are already headed in exactly this direction-just how far are we willing to go?Greed, lust, materialism, love, even the afterlife and the final destiny of mankind are touched upon.Haley Joel Osment (as the robot boy ""David"") and Jude Law (""Gigolo Joe"", a pleasure robot) are simply marvelous, as beings restricted by their purpose-specific creation. There are many questions in this film, and few answers. Can a machine think, even love? If it can, can we love it in return?  If insist on making them in our own image, won't they want the same things we do?The film has spectacular effects, but these are an enhancement to the story, not a distraction.  From the opening sequence, when a female robot's face opens up, revealing the most realistic humanoid machine yet seen in movies, the film is full of CGI and animatronic marvels. The little bear, Teddy, is a wonder to himself, created by the genius of Stan Winston studios and ILM.  Spielberg's musical collaberator, John Williams, has created a spare, atmospheric soundtrack unique to this film - and perhaps his best work.The DVD only makes the experience of watching this film even more enjoyable than in the theatre. The extra disc gives insight into Spielberg's desire to make a film that the enigmatic, secretive Kubrick would have been proud of.  One can feel his presence throughout the production process, from the artwork, to the effects, to the final product.Some have criticized the film for being too long, too sentimental, etc.  My own belief is that many American moviegoers think that plotless action is what film is all about...; this movie is for those who are able to fill in the blanks-thought is involved.  Just take real look around you!  What is happening to the world we live in?  This is what Kubrick and Spielberg are asking us to do.I can only touch on the ways this movie affected me; I will attempt to relate the experience by saying that this is an extraordinary film, like nothing I've seen before. It does feel like a Kubrick creation in many ways-I believe that, as the world catches up to the vision of the film, appreciation for it will grow.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	APASOUCF2UD42	Greg Curtis	"A.I. marks Steven Spielberg's return to fantastical storytelling, depicting a futuristic society in which androids are created as servants for people. The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment stars as David, the first android child (and the first android programmed to love), who is given to a couple as an experiment after their natural son falls into a coma.Sadly, A.I. is a boring film interspersed with scenes incomprehensibly weird (originally conceived by the late Stanley Kubrick, his influence is clearly evident) or sequences that are extremely dark and disturbing. Thus, despite promotions as a magical fable, it is not suitable for anyone under the age of 12.A.I. also suffers from a misguided vision that tries to blend together too many elements. Lacking originality, it borrows heavily from Bicentennial Man, Blade Runner, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Waterworld and Spielberg's own Close Encounters, all of which developed their storylines and themes in a much more exciting and dramatic manner.The movie also parallels Pinocchio, as David sets out to find the Blue Fairy so he can become a ""real"" boy. (It's surprising that 'When You Wish Upon a Star' was not used as background music -- but, of course, Spielberg already did that in CE3K.) Along the way, Osment is joined by Jude Law as a cocky android gigolo who forms an unlikely attachment to the boy. Together, their journey takes them to a sexual playground called Rouge City, the ruins of New York, and an arena not unlike the Roman Colosseum -- instead of feeding Christians to lions, spectators cheer as outdated android models are executed in a variety of horrific ways.One would expect to find some interesting personalities in a world so dramatically different from our own, but the film is populated by a collection of annoying and one-dimensional characters. The vapid and shallow culture of the future does include some rather unique accessories and vehicles, but clothing that is distinctly twentieth-century.Overall, A.I. is far too melodramatic and offers little point or punch in its weak message about our need to love. Spielberg's biggest disappointment since Hook, the film is also spoiled by the 'Once upon a time' fairytale narration, and an abundance of questions that are left unanswered.The conclusion, set 2000 years after the main events in the film, is far too long in coming...it seems like you have to wait two millenia for a pay off that never delivers. One thinks back to the arena where unneeded androids are blown out of cannons -- so, too, should the entire effort for this tiring and tedious film.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A9YA983MXKCEL	"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius"""	People who see this movie seem to fall into two categories: those who absolutely hate it, and those who love it because they see it for what it really is. I'm part of the latter group. This is one of the best movies ever made, sci-fi or otherwise. The events of this movie are so unexpected, the emotions so intense, the sheer scale staggering, and the issues so deep, that I cannot help but admire its beauty. When his innocent and loving motives lead him to extremely dangerous actions, his parents cannot keep him - but they love him too much to let him be destroyed. He is left feeling alienated and confused, incapable of understanding why he has been abandoned. His single drive to be reunited with his parents is beautifully idealistic, but at the same time ultimately doomed. His quest leads him through a nightmarish world with just enough of a glimmer of hope to keep him going. The Flesh Fair's motto, &quot;A Celebration of Life,&quot; takes on a whole new meaning after an otherwise destruction-hungry crowd stands up for David's right to live, neither knowing nor caring that he isn't human. As the movie comes closer to what would seem like a dead end, David's discovery of his true nature - that he is not really unique - leads to one of the most powerful scenes in science fiction history: that of him falling off a tall building into the ocean, no longer caring whether he lives or dies. When he first meets with what he believes to be the &quot;Blue Fairy,&quot; he touches her, and she shatters like glass in front of him. The ending is not guaranteed to satisfy everyone, but is not too depressing either, and it perfectly sums up what the movie is about. I could not imagine a more fitting end for a movie like this.Through it all, the sheer visuals are outstanding. I'm not just referring to the special effects; I'm referring to the camera angles, the lighting, the set design, everything. Even the puddle of water in front of the church serves a purpose.Watch this movie. I can't guarantee that you'll like it. If you hate it, then you will have lost nothing but two hours.

Great look, wonderful sets, Fabulous production values, CGI and special effects. The actors are superb, the characters are complex and multi-dimentional, rich and believable. The story line is engaging, surprising and entertaining. So why do people seem to either hate or love this movie. Because underlying the entire movie is the theme that human beings, in general, are an evil disease infecting the universe and should be eraticiated. Every human being featured is a degrading, psychopathic monster with a civilized veneer. The final scenes are horrific in an emotional sense and deeply disturbing as well as intellectually false. Do not let your children watch this movie. No matter how artfully done, I wouldn't want to watch someone torture a being (organic or artificial) to death.

In many ways, this is Kubrick's swansong, despite being directed by Steven Spielberg.  It's one of the greatest, most moving, haunting science fiction films ever made.  It made me think for days afterwards.  I love the structure of the film.  It's very Kubrickian, in that it has 3 main acts, and there's no linking between them.  It's very similar in style to 2001, where you jump from prehistoric times to 2001, then to the moon, then to Jupiter, then beyond the infinite, or in Full Metal Jacket, where you're in boot camp, then, bang, you're in Vietnam.  Haley Joel Osmet gives a superb performance as David, the robot who longs to be loved and human.  And Steven Spielberg does a masterful job directing this film.  It's interesting to note that this is one of the few Spielberg films (Close Encounters of the Third Kind being the other) that he wrote himself.  Even though the material was based on Kubrick's treatment, this film along with Close are 2 of the best science fiction films ever made.  He really was the only other director who could have made this film.  He even remarked that he made a Kubrick film, in that the film really polarised people.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AG6NBC3NLVVJ	Gubben	I've read many fine reviews of this movie here at Amazon but none that look at the religious aspect of AI. The young mechanical boy is looking for the blue fairy (Mary mother of Jesus) to make him a real boy (give him a soul).  The irony of his situation is he was created to last (live) forever a promise Christianity preaches in the afterlife yet he is unable to become mortal as a real boy. The failure of the blue fairy to make him mortal and the crumbling of her statue towards the end of the movie is a strong cynical view of the promise of religion and its icons. The film is packed with contrast and the reality of what it is to be human and aspirations and hope are a very big part of all our lives.  There is no happy ending for a general audience here and hopefully in the not so near future the masses or part of will come to appreciate the achievements of this future masterpiece.	5.0	A movie about religion as well.	2005-12-29	10	7	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ANIMV3SPDD8SH	Guy De Federicis	"Steven Spielberg's sci fi mega movie from 2001, is a time traveling, bumpy carpet ride of exciting and profound entertainment, combining a boy's wondrous adventure, albeit an 'artificial' boy, with meticulous film construction of inspired images of the near and far future. From the sterile and precise modern suburban culture of the near future at the film's onset, to the carnival holocaust, spectator sport extermination of artificial beings in the film's most striking, and emotionally riveting scene, and the towering decadence of a destroyed New York City towards the film's end, and finally, to the very fringes of time itself, (as in Kubrick's ""2001""), ""A.I."" paints an astounding canvas of a likely tomorrow.Its conclusion, however, so absolute that one expects an almighty god to enter the picture and wrap things up, seems elongated and not entirely focused, as if Spielberg had many endings to choose from, and decided on them all. Other problems weigh in. Our hero's infatuation for The Blue Fairy, from ""Pinocchio"", and the love of 'mother', are crossed swords, where one super maternal figure would suffice, and the boy's last wishful fantasy come true, a very human desire, seems much less than the milestone, (or light year), one expects him to cross. The beginning too, a platform discussion on the ethics of biological tampering, is a fistful contrivance. Still, it's the journey, not so much the destination. that makes ""A.I."" so appealing, and once the robotic Pinocchio, who only wishes to be a real boy, is set on his way, through the door of a couple who adopt an artificial boy, there is no stopping the film's childlike wonder, adventurous spirit, and mature thought provoking insight. I really felt the desperation of the 'artificials' being threatened with extermination in the carnival concentration camp, (The Flesh Fair). Speilberg's subtle characterizations of human want and need, particularly in the artificial junk rummage scene, with humanoids pilfering for needed body parts, makes these pathetic unfortunates soar with humane value. Haley Joel Osment, who always spooked me before, as an unfortunately gifted child actor, is masterful at creating a robotic, spiritualized protagonist with a heart of tin. The special effects are excellent, maybe the best I've ever seen, and the credits include Meryl Streep and Ben Kingsley in cameo roles.Some tweaks here and there aside, this is ""The Wizard of Oz"" of the modern era."	4.0	A CLASSIC FOR THE AGES	2005-12-27	5	4	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A37DLVPKJZGSQF	Hannibal	Yikes, what a disappointment! A.I. Artificial Intelligence, one of the most hyped movies of 2001, has finally come out and what did I think of it? Not much really. This movie, frankly, sucked. The movie starts out very well, and I was intrigued. However, as soon as Haley's character David is dumped in the forest by his parents I started to lose respect for the film. From then on the movie just was a feast of over-done visuals, unoriginal plot twists and extremely cheesy lines, even for robots. There were some things I appreciated about the movie. Haley Joel Osment was just stunning. He almost bests his stunner in The Sixth Sense in this lead role as the robot David who just wants to be a real boy (yes, it is as bad as it sounds). Frances O'Connor was also brilliant, and one of the best supporting females in any movie I've seen this year. The visuals are good for the robots, but for Rogue City, they are pretty ridiculous. And I have to mention how much I loved that teddy bear! He kicked some ass and was the coolest, most respectable character in the film. But at the end of the day this is just a mess. The story is really horrible, the characters empty and the whole feel of the movie isn't there like I thought it would be. And I have to mention the Flesh Fair. What utter silliness! I was sitting in my seat disgusted at the thought of Steven Speilberg writing this trash at that point of the film. A.I. Artificial Intelligence will be liked by many audiences but to me it was boring, over-long, repetitive and seemingly endless trash. A big disappointment.	2.0	So long and empty...almost put me to sleep.	2001-09-21	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AZOW89D0NXMUT	H. Georges	Artificial Intelligence is a great science-fiction movie.The actors act well.The movie is really realistic.Maybe the future would be like this? , there are still existential questions about his programming and whether the conclusion is a realization of the human condition, despite being a fabrication.It's never boring but it's sometimes confusing.The film not only documents the clash between man/machine, but the clash between Spielberg's and Kubrick's ideologies is also evident.The running theme with Spielberg is that, though flawed, humans are basically decent. Kubrick, as shown in his past films: 2001, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, forces the viewer to deal with the darker side of humanity. Human beings are not inherently evil, but are more than capable of acting without regard for their fellow man.Watch it!	4.0	I liked it	2003-07-09	1	0	1

I did, and I enjoyed the visual display, sifting through scenes to catch a ""Kubrick"" moment.  It is obvious Spielberg, who was supposed to collaborate on this project with the late Stanley Kubrick, left in many of his trademark touches.  Yes, it IS about robots and really spectacular effects, but, the real underlying message here is love. ""David"" the A.I. robot designed after the creator's dead son(his image) is as human as any natural child. The difference between him and the usual Mecha(regular robots) is that David feels Love. He comes to be the charismatic ""replacement child"" for a young couple who's son seems terminally ill. Martin, the son is never expected to wake from a coma-like state. David is a prototype used to give a grieving parent like Monica a chance at love again. The young ""boy"" rapidly becomes part of his new family. However, to his horror and chance he eventually finds himself left on a roadside because his Mommy must rid herself of him. Martin revived, returned home and a few coincidences and accidents later David is unwanted.The next chapter of this story has a really interesting ""Blade Runner"" feel to it. David is determined to make himself a real boy. Monica once read him the story of ""Pinnochio"" and David believes, now abandoned, that he must search and find the blue fairy so he will be real and his Mommy, Monica will love him again. David's search takes him to many places, meeting frightening and sometimes helpful people. His pal in crime happens to be an old-model ""love"" robot played by Jude Law, a very tongue-in-cheek, sexy, washed-up mechanical ladies' man. Together they must escape capture and many human enemies to help David find his fairy tale ""blue fairy"".The beginning, middle, and end of this movie are very different from one another. They seem like different movies all tied together with ease and many heart-warming moments. The ending was bizarre, but having seen this movie twice, I decided it was more thought-provoking than unrelated. Performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were beyond remarkable. This was no surprise to me. The movie is packaged with two discs...one, being the movie. The other disc having an abundance of fabulous cast, movie, and special effects extras. It is definately worth watching. As for the movie in whole, I give it five starts. I love a flick that can force me to feel many emotions in an hour or two...The hallmark of a job well done..."	5.0	A Love for a Mother Never Dies	2002-03-09	5	2	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This film starts with a fabulous premise: to give a child robot of the warm  behavior, being capable to substitute a real child. But then the script experiments a sudden twist that will lead to unexpected places of the imagination with a warm homage to Pinocchio, leaving behind the possibility of making a film of major caliber and conceptual rigor. You will find certainly some intersections with Blade Runner, but the tearful approach affected seriously the original proposal of Kubrick. You can argue the arresting special effects and the laughable presence of Jude Law who adds the film a second breath but with a script so sinuous and so lineal, in which the humans are cruel and merciless in the Flesh Tournament led the film to an evasion picture and not a dramatic crossroad that somehow would have reached a major status.Think for instance what would it have happened in case of being directed by Terry Gilliam of Ridley Scott, who had explored previously in these lands, with remarkable results.Spielberg wanted to recreate a film but the main fault is the excessive use and abuse of the romantic gaze who dilapidated the treasured message of the script.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3VWDEE211B3GX	"hvgutman ""hvgutman"""	Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Kubrick fan, but Spielberg tends to put me on the fence.And THAT'S the problem here. This movie suffers from an extreme identity crisis. It starts off almost resembling a Kubrick film. The landscapes, the acting, the concept setup - all close to &quot;Kubrick-ian&quot;. It's almost cold and sterile enough to make it. By the end of the movie, though, it's a schmaltz-fest. It becomes Spielberg-squared. And as a result, the whole film feels disjointed.I won't give away the plot. I hate reviewers who do that. But, suffice it to say, this is a Pinnochio story, with all kinds of scientific ideas thrown in just to be left on the roadside. In the opening, someone raises the implications of creating a creature whose sole purpose is giving love. William Hurt, as the scientist laying out the concept asks :&quot;Well, isn't that what God did when he created Adam ?&quot; Kubrick would've spent the rest of the film exploring that idea. Spielberg ignores it entirely. Considering this is a film people would see purely on the basis of Kubrick's involvlemment, that was a bad idea.Adding to the disappointment, by the end, you start to realize how much of this is just taken from elsewhere. The blaring example is at the end when he recreates the Death Star attack shot from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. I almost blurted out &quot;Use the force, Luke&quot; at the movie theatre.Now, having got all the bad stuff out of my system, I still think this is worth seeing. It's not completely without merit. The cinematography is spectacular. Jude Law turns in a very nice performance, as does Haley Joel Osment ( he was just creepy enough ). And kudos on the teddy bear supertoy. He's about the best character in the movie.See this. There's stuff to appreciate. But if, like me, you want to see what Kubrick left behind, be prepared to be annoyed.	3.0	Worth viewing, but ...	2001-07-02	1	1	0

Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not leave well enough alone. Instead, they drag the film out into a series of seemingly endless subplots and twists.In the last reel or so, the film rolls off a series of endings which mostly fail to generate the emotional impact that is Spielberg's trademark. Some semblance of a theme survives, but its impact is weakened by the film's lack of urgency. The theme is also not brought out in the most compelling way.

If I had to rely on the opinions of movie critics, both pro and amateur, I don't think I would have ever bought this movie, and that would have been a huge mistake on my part. I loved this movie, and without divulging too much for those who are still on the fence trying to decide to watch it or not, I'll tell why:1) I got it that the mecha boy took fairy tales to be the truth, that he could relate to the Pinocchio character, and that in his eyes the Blue Fairy in the book could solve his problems for him.2) I got it that the one thing that meant more to him than becoming a real boy was being loved by the only mother he ever knew.3) I was so engrossed start to finish that I didn't realize over two hours had gone by when the credits began to roll.4) I was happy for a movie with no blood, only a brief suggestion of sex, and no guns.5) I got it that the screenwriter wasn't trying to solve all the world's problems with one movie. It was about the boy, and the goal he wanted to reach by the end of the script.6) Young Haley Osment is going to go down as one of the best child actors in history. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him make me believe he really was a robot.As an amateur writer, I have to say that I think it took one heck of an imagination to come up with a story like this. I was impressed with the visuals, even the more poignant ones showing an underwater Manhattan, complete with now-nonexistent Twin Towers. I hadn't been this engrossed by a sci-fi movie since the original Close Encounters of the Third Kind in '78, and I've always thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was pure torture. So, frankly, I'm happy to have been unaware of Kubrick's influence while watching the movie, and even happier to learn that his influence was minimal.Sometimes, you can be too much of a brainiac about a movie. Sometimes, you just have to turn the brain off and let your heart and your eyes enjoy the movie. I did, and I don't regret it.

People who dislike AI aren't as misinformed or unintelligent as some may think - given that many of those that dislike it happen to like Kubrick films. But AI is what I like to term an ""Oscar-whoring"" movie - it attempts to sell on emotion. It's not so much about conveying vision, as it is about soliciting emotion.AI does have a philosophical background - it surfaces at times. At other times, it's sunk deep below the numerous layers of emotion solicitational goo, to be visible...Overall, AI is an okay movie. However, (as mentioned before) it tries to be too sentimental, and definitely drags on for too long. The last third of the film is disconnected enough to belong in another one. And it's not just the elapsed millenia. The flow of the last third of the film is very irregular - it accelerates quickly, then slows to a crawl, then accelerates again. That's hardly great filmmaking - just proof that there were two highly separated visions involved in making this film.In general, I recommend anyone interested to see this film - it has its moments. It's not ""the best thing since sliced bread"" but it's also not irrepairably horrible. It's just filled to the brim with Spielberg's main ingredient - lots and lots of sentiment with little regard to the original director's vision."	3.0	It's barely alright	2002-03-14	1	1	0

A near faultless movie - ruined only by subplots involving Jude Law that don't go anywhere and a final scene that I felt could have been a bit better - that is emotionally satisfying and far superior to I, Robot (a film with a similar theme of whether robots should be treated like human beings).

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This is an amazing film because it reveals why we, humans, should not play with artificial intelligence. To make robots that look like human beings to the point of being fooled completely by them is a rather easy task. But that robot is nothing but a machine as long as it does not have human feelings and first of all the capacity to love. The second drawback of such robots is that they do not grow or age. If you give the capacity to love to a child robot, he will be able to love but not to grow. He will remain a child forever though his love will grow more and more intense since it will feed on non-material energy. The genial element Steven Spielberg introduces in that story is a competition with a real boy and the subsequent disposing of the robot by the woman he calls his mother. He then attaches himself to fairy tales, to Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy who could change him into a real boy. That turn in the tale transforms the story that could have become over-sentimental into a magical and deeply ethical story. We discover what humanity would do as soon as such human robots existed. It would organize hunts to catch the stray ones, the abandoned ones, those chased by the police or any authority for crimes they had not committed but they had been made guilty of by the real criminals to save their own skins. The presence of these robots would cover up a new wave of crime that could go unpunished. So the human beings could organize some circus games with these robots as gladiators, but not gladiators who would die after a severe and honorable fight, but as sacrificial victims on the altar of the human dignity that is infringed by those robots. Shower them with acid, throw them through fire and through fans, hack them down with saws or all kinds of axes, etc. In front of that horrible fate, our boy and his gigolo of a partner on this trip will manage to escape due to a last breath of humanity in the audience of those games that will liberate them. And off they go to the big city of games, rides, casinos, brothels, music-halls and so many other attractions essentially performed by robots of all types. They are looking for the Blue Fairy. Then their trip will take them to underwater New York, the twin towers proudly dominating a sea of water. There David, our little robot, meets with his creator and escapes to the underwater world where he discovers the Blue Fairy of Coney Island where he is trapped by some accident and survives two thousand years of freezing which will bring the water down of course. That shows how absurd a project of producing robots who can feel and express sentiments is: these robots are bound to suffer at the hands of humans and many humans are bound to become cruel and sadistic, and to suffer in return, when confronted with the extreme demands in love and passion of these robots. But the film goes one step further and makes the story finally luminous. Extra-terrestrials arriving on earth and discovering the lost civilization of the earth completely wasted in the vastly human produced or amplified glaciation. These extra-terrestrials have powers that enable them to read the memory and the most subtle desires of David and to recreate the environment in which he met with maternal and filial love. But his demand to have his mother resurrected raises a question. When one has run one's time, if you revive or resurrect them then they are what they were at the end of their time, and that is dead because they cannot live beyond their time span. Then the story becomes full of sunshine. The young David will keep his desire and his demand, even though it will be entirely artificial and will only last from sunrise to sundown. And there maybe he will be a real boy when he goes to sleep with his mother who will go to sleep for ever. He will, so Steven Spielberg says, finally visit the world where dreams are born. Does it mean he will not wake up? Does it mean he will wake up but the recollection of this day with his mother will be the dream he needs to go on living, and maybe discover new forms of love or new people, even Extra Terrestrials, he could love? We don't know. Steven Spielberg ends his story on a sleeping boy going to dream and a sleeping mother going to eternal inexistence. Why on earth do we want to create robots that can feel sentiments when we have so many human beings around us we could love, which would improve our society and our world?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID	5.0	Man should trust his own natural intelligence	2002-05-24	7	2	5

The story is unmatched but very gloomy.  I guess thats why the whole setting is fixated in the future where everything is simplified and possible.  However, love is still untainable even if artifically created.  The conflict begins when the catalyst is introduce - which is jealousy.  I will not destroy the story as everyone wrote practically the whole story.  In essence, as vague as this rating is, is that love is a force which not even humans can control.  Robots are programmed and so can we.  The possibities of creating an artificial intelligence is endless.  This story provokes fear and thought.  The concept of an inanimated object to love so unconditionally is so heartbreaking.  After I saw this movie - all I can think of is how cruel we can be.  I guess acceptance is something we must rely on to control the fear of love.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A8DPYBNM2YX6H	Jaime Palencia III	Steven Spielberg has been and will always be one of my favorite film maker.  He seems to always choose topics that are cutting edge even before the general populace realizes it is cutting edge.  This film was no exception.  Stitch together the fantastic visions of Stanley Kubric and you've got what could potentially be...screen magic.  Somewhere, however, between thought and action, the film looses something.  It seems painfully diluted, both in story as well as aesthetic.  Spielberg's excesses of ornament plus Kubric's masterful minimalism equals a movie that is excessively (obviously?) compromised. We discover this new world through the eyes of a child. Only this child is not a boy but a machine set out to become a boy.  The story brought thought provoking ideas about man and machine, about consciousness and  self-awareness, and the ongoing struggle of man and his intolerance to difference (or in this case - his own mirror image).  However, no answers were offered, no ideas were resolved. Instead, we are taken on a roller coaster ride that took us higher and higher into the sky, but never let us drop.  Never gave us the satisfaction of resolution.  Sorry Steve, next time stick to the fairytales.	2.0	a virtual bomb	2001-07-02	2	0	2

At first you  think that the movie will be good because of the beginning of the movie. The beginning is good but then is slowly starts to get worse and worse. This retarded robot goes on some kind of quest to find the disney fairy from the movie pinnoccio so he can be turnned into a real boy because he read in some book that it was possible so that he can get back with his mother. Insted of him excepting himself for what he is and trying to get back with his mother he trys to be something he is not. Insted of this movie being something like a quest for him to get back to his mother it is a quest about him trying to do something that isn't even possible. Kinda like watching a movie about a man that wants to learn how to fly without wings so he keeps jumping off cliffs hopeing that he'll fly insted of him just finding logical way to learn how to fly like the Wright brothers. Basicly this movie is a waste of money and most of all time.

Kind of like Blade Runner meets Pinocchio with an excrutiatingly long ending as Spielberg tries to sap as much emotion as he can out of this.  Personally, I thought it was enough when David finally discovered he wasn't real.  That scene carried with it a ton of emotional weight, but of course Spielberg couldn't content himself with such a somber ending to what was a very long journey for the boy to meet his maker.  Probably the most impressive scene was that in the robot graveyard under the light of an artificial moon, where robots tried to piece themselves back together from the left over parts.  It really gave this viewer empathy with their plight, especially when they were rounded up for the ensuing carnage in a carnival of robotic horrors.  Spielberg picks and chooses from a number of science fiction themes as well as children's stories to piece together this ode to artificial intelligence.	3.0	Blade Runner meets Pinocchio	2007-02-23	4	3	1

I know many people hated it, but I guess that's the sort of movie it is (most of Kubrick's films are purely love/hate achievements). The film seems to be most famous due to the collabaration of Kubrick and Spielberg, but I think the story is great. The futurist fable plotline seems timeless and profound. And whatever you think of Spielberg's somewhat overbearing sentimentality, the acting cannot be faulted - Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are two of the best actors around (and Teddy is the best character!). The special effects and design team create a really tangible atmosphere of the future; it all seems completely real. Maybe other people's opinions are useless in the case of this movie deeing how varied people's reactions are. Just see it anyway. Definitely worth buying in my opinion.	5.0	I don't understand why this has been blasted so much...	2002-09-24	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	Are we getting ahead of ourselves? Is it that we are imbuing computers with too much 'human-like' qualities? Now we can turn on our T.V from a cell phone call, meals can be cooked with the same call. Even fridges that can make a virtual shopping list reminding us of what we need. It is this continuation of technology that is addressed in 'A.I Artificial Intelligence'It was the vision of film auter Stanley Kubrick in making his film that dealt with the human condition and our need to correct the mistakes humans made themselves. Unfortunately his vision was never realized when his met his untimely death in 1999. What was left was a half-filled shell of a film that needed some fleshing out. Steven Spielberg met the cry and decided to make 'A.I' as an everlasting tribute to a man who made some of the most brilliant and controversial films to touch the silver screen.The narrative reaches its heights through finding the complexities within simplicity. A pseudo child David (Haley Joel Osment) on a mythopoetic quest for a mother's love. In this sense the film can be seen as a futuristic 'Pinocchio' as David is on a quest to become real, and therefore find the love he has been reaching for. Along the way David experiences a myriad of emotions when he is forced to deal with the cruelty of the human race, embodied through the 'Flesh Fair' as well as meeting the unlikely character of Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who serves as his friend and guide. Along with David's trusty Teddy who serves as a comparable Jiminy Cricket character. The film has the feeling of an epic in every sense of the word. The timespan shifts some 3000 years through the course of the film and David's quest itself can be seen as an epic journey.'A.I' has been critised by many as running too long, and that Kubrick's projected ending was better than the one Spielberg came up with. I however disagree with this summation, yes the Kubrick ending may have been darker, have more of an edge and a film noir feeling. The Spielberg ending however has more of an emotional ending, which I feel works.I will go as far as saying that the ending as it is now is very much like Kubrick would have wanted; It is thought provoking. If we look at Kubrick's previous work we can see how he had an uncanny ability for playing devil's advocate on film. In '2001: a space odyssey' no one speaks for the first 20 mins of the film. In 'The Shining' we are told that Jack may be from the past. Leaving the viewer confused and wondering if the film was about time travel. In 'A clockwork orange' Malcolm McDowell is changed back to his original persona.Overall 'A.I' is a fabulous film and an amazing DVD, the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound is amazing and the picture is fabulous. This is the best way to see the movie since the cinemas and the added features will make the audience see the film in a whole new light.	4.0	Too much unfair critism in my mind.	2002-03-17	6	5	1

However, in the months since I've developed a fondness for the story, and its ending, and after purchasing the DVD and watching it again, A.I. has become one of my favorites.  It is an incredible story, once you grasp the extent of its message, and a truly beautiful film to watch and experience.  Both Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law deliver remarkable performances, and John Williams tops it off with a wonderful musical score that will tug at your heartstrings as the film reaches its end.The DVD is of exceptional quality, both in sound and video.  The DTS sound is especially clear and lifelike.

I enjoy movies that make you reflect and talk about the themes and meanings. This film was one of those. My husband like it for the sci-fi, futuristic aspects and the story.

Having said that, I wish I had. AI is a subject that I have studied since graduation and therefore I was interested in what Speilberg though of it in the future.

Unfortunately much of the film was not suitable for viewing by children.  There were violent acts and sexual connotations not appropriate for young viewers (those in attendance looking for an E.T. plot).Also, the story seems to depict the director's view of the world today and what his impression of tomorrow may become given the current status of our nation and our use of resources.  This may be probable, but I felt that I was being lectured instead of entertained.Finally, the storyline referenced the (Disney) character of Pinocchio throughout the movie.

"This film was started by Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Oddysey) but finished by Stephen Spielberg (E.T., War of the Worlds).A modern Pinocchio-like story, Haley Joel Osment plays an artificial intelligence that is ""programmed"" to love the Mother who buys him and speaks a specific activation code. However, his adoptive family rejects him, leaving him yearning for love and looking for the ""blue fairy"" for his answers--and a reunion with his beloved Mother.Osment's character meets up with another A.I. named Gigolo Joe (brilliantly played Jude Law), as they navigate the city for answers.Kubrick's edgy and gritty fingerprints are on several sections of this movie such as the sadistic gladiator-like games. Some parts were heart wrenching to watch, and Osment's and Law's performances were amazing. John Williams' score was also exquisite. I was a little disappointed at the ending, but the mystical themes of ""what defines life?"", alien intelligence, yearnings of the heart, and the cruelty of humanity make this movie both thought and conversation provoking.Had Kubrick lived, I have a feeling the ending would have been much less hopeful (a signature of Spielberg films)."	4.0	What Definies Life?	2005-12-06	5	1	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A173KVBVAYWRC7	Jared M. Flint	This much anticipated project presented Speilberg with the daunting task of filling the masterful Stanley Kubrick's shoes in his pet project that was on the back burner for years.  Speilberg does his best attempt at making a Kubrick film, which ends up being much better than most of the Hollywood duds that infiltrate the theaters.  An ominous flavor runs throughout this film made greater by performances by Haley Joel Osmand and Jude Law.  Also, the tremendous special effects add the the believability of the plot which takes place over the course of three thousand years.  Although some scenes come across with the Kubrickian luster of years past, few scenes detract from the movies purpose and goal, including the cameo by Chris Rock.  Although, never exactly deciding on a direction, the film is a refreshing change in todays movie market that makes the long theater time go by quickly.  Even with a questionable addition of characters at the conclusion of the film, A.I. comes through as a contemporary classic.	4.0	Expectations	2001-08-09	4	2	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	"In a futuristic world where humans and robots coexist in a shaky relationship, a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) is taught to love and is given to a family. Being the first of his kind he is sorely misunderstood and a series of unfortunate events leads to David being on the run. All David wants is to be a real boy, though, and be loved by his mommy Monica (Frances O'Conner). So with his new found friend, Love Bot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), David travels out to find the Blue Fairy of Pinochio fame to make him a real boy so his mother will love him.AI was originally the brain child of legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, but as he was working on it he felt that the sensibilities of the film better suited a filmmaker such as Steven Spielberg. Stanley Kubrick approached Spielberg with the idea that Kubrick would produce the film, and Spielberg would direct. Of course, Spielberg was excited at the chance, but also reticent at the fact that this was the brainchild of the great Stanley Kubrick. They worked and worked on the project, Kubrick even had voices recorded that eventually appeared in the finished product (including those recorded by Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and even Jack Angel who performed the voice of Teddy) until Kubrick had much of the concept art and even the complete treatment. Eventually Spielberg pushed back and asked Kubrick to direct and he would produce, and Kubrick relented but was unable to film the movie prior to his death in March of '99. Out of respect for his friend for the project he was originally asked to do, Spielberg picked up the work on AI and finished the film that Kubrick spent more than 12 years visualizing.AI is a flawed masterpiece. Combining the strengths of two very different filmmakers is definitely the way to create an interesting work, and bringing out the sentimentality of Spielberg and the cynicism of Kubrick makes for great interplay and a certain tension between the two different sensibilities. On the one side you have the power and endurance of love, and on the other side you have the moral dilemma of man playing god and than dehumanizing it's creation. When juggling these two images of modern society Spielberg is at his best, and most of the movie is as good, if not better than anything else the director has ever commited to film.The acting in this film is superb. Most of the movie revolves around Haley Joel Osment who was in his prime at the time (an unfortunate thing to say for a talent so young at the time and so good), and does he shine. Playing the first of his kind to feel love (or is it obsession) you truly feel for a robots plight, one of the few movies to actually grab you in that way. As his companion through most of his plight, you can tell Jude Law as Gigolo Joe is having a blast giving his ""Love Bot"" (read: sex toy) a bit of the smooth edge of Fred Astair. All of the performances in this movie truly shine though.The problem, and what makes this movie flawed, is Spielberg's recent obsession with overindulgence and the need to place pieces from his older movies in his newer movies where they don't belong. First off, the ending of the movie should have been cut off. I'm not typically the type of person who will hold anything against a long movie, and it's not that this movie is long, it's that the last half hour is completely unneeded and somewhat ridiculous. Some of the acting choices make the last 30 minutes really feel more like outtakes than an integral part of the film. To add to that though, and secondly, Spielberg felt the need to inject scenes that he had planned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind into the end of the movie, confusing audiences as to what's going on in the end with the alien like robots.Over all, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie, and it could have very well been a masterpiece and in ways it is, only if Spielberg hadn't followed his need to overindulge this movie wouldn't have lost steam. I do recommend it though, it's a movie that works well on multiple levels, for either just entertainment, or for further exploration into it's deeper meanings."	4.0	A.I.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2IF845YKIDO7T	Jason	It seems like everytime a movie from either Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg comes out it's either loved or hated. Both men have made some of the most amazing movies ever and of course each film that they do has to live up to everyone's expectations and be just as huge as their biggest hits. Eyes Wide Shut wasn't A Clockwork Orange, 2001, or Full Metal Jacket but it's still one of Kubrick's greatest films and what a final film it was, love it or hate it. Spielberg is the genius behind many of the biggest films in movie history. This is the guy that has brought you films like the Indiana Jones trilogy, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and many many others. For me Spielberg has has had some off moments in his carrer but the moment that A.I. ended I knew that I just witnessed something amazing. I'm only 24 years old but I was lucky enough to see E.T., which is one of the greatest films ever along with the Star Wars films in the theater (it happend to be the first movie I ever saw in the theater). I don't rmemeber seeing it but I do recall seeing it many times since then. After viewing A.I. I just was in awe and couldn't saw anything. It was such a breataking, heartbreaking film much like E.T. was 20 years earlier. To me this is Spielberg's sequel to E.T.! Speilberg has become such a serious film maker since E.T. and this was such a treat and proves that Spielberg is one of the greatest film makers alive and can still bring that magic to the screen. Many people who are fans of Kubrick feel that this film would've looked alot different had Kubrick lived to make this film and many have bashed Spielberg for destroying Kurbrick's vision but it's not like Steven Spielberg just stole his ideas. Kubrick was working with Spielberg on this project and as a tribute to the great film maker he finished it. I do think that this is what a collaboration between these two greats would've looked like. This movie is a little bit of both directors visions and i'm damn glad this film was made. Like it or not but this truly is a film that has to be seen. Like all of Kubrick's projects this will continue to be judged. All of his other ideas are either understood or missunderstood to the point that the viewer just dislikes the film, which is a shame. As for the acting in the film I think it's top notch. I've always disliked Haley Joel Osment's acting (I lothe the overrated garbage that is The Sixth Sense)but in this film he truly shines and makes you feel for the character that he's playing. Bottom line..this is what you get when you put two visionaires ideas together. The end result it one of the greatest films in movie history.	5.0	One of the greatest movies ever!!	2002-12-05	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ABDHAYPNM28US	Jason	"Even though I haven't seen ""A.I."" in a long time, its futuristic fantasia of sight and sound, as well as its moral, philosophical, and emotional undertones, have occasionally crept into my thoughts since the last time I saw it. I have also pondered what to write about the film, which I perceive as a haunting meditation on human nature. Oddly enough, its protagonist is a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is made to resemble a boy. As the first robot programmed to feel love, he develops a bond with his human mother Monica (Frances O'Conner).As one can glean from a number of reviews, whether on Amazon or elsewhere, people have either praised or scorned the film. Much of the scorn comes from those who believe that the late Stanley Kubrick envisioned ""AI"" as a stereotypically unsentimental tale, and that director Steven Spielberg turned it into something syrupy. Even some who generally praise ""AI"" still shame Spielberg for giving in to his relatively more sentimental worldview towards the end, and ruining what may have been a ""masterpiece.""As for myself, I belong to the crowd that sees ""AI"" as a well-crafted film in its entirety. If Kubrick had lived to direct it, I have little doubt that he would have made an excellent film. However, for whatever reason, Kubrick believed that Spielberg could also do justice to the story, even believing that it suited Spielberg better than him. Perhaps Kubrick paid Spielberg a backhanded compliment because he considered ""AI"" too potentially sentimental for his liking, but that sounds rather implausible; I have little doubt that Kubrick could have removed sentimental sheen from a Hallmark Movie of the Week.Despite the differing worldviews of their films, Spielberg obviously has a deep respect for Kubrick. Several shots seem reminiscent of Kubrick's own films, including ""Strangelove,"" ""2001,"" and ""Clockwork."" Most of the film deals with Kubrickian themes of human folly and meanness, especially in the cavalier way with which humans treat the almost humanlike robots. David's ""family"" treats him like a toy, and Monica ultimately abandons him in the woods, though for more complex reasons. Also, during the subsequent scene at the ""Flesh Faire,"" humans watch abandoned robots get destroyed for entertainment; perhaps humans have transcended racism in this futuristic dystopia, but its vestiges are manifested all too clearly in this sequence. All this disappears in the film's ""final act,"" after humans have become extinct.Kubrick also respected Spielberg's filmmaking skills, and he believed that the younger director would do something wonderful with ""AI."" Although Spielberg attempted to remain faithful to Kubrick's style, one could still play a parlor game speculating on the elements that would have appeared in a pure Kubrick version of ""AI."" It probably would have been R-Rated, with more scenes portraying the exploits of the pleasure robot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), as well as some more graphic activities and images in the adult playland Rouge City. Kubrick likely would have included a more extensive sequence in Rouge City with the waltz melody from Richard Strauss' opera ""Der Rosenkavalier,"" which John Williams transformed into a brief ethereal snippet.As Williams mentions in the featurette about the music from ""AI,"" Kubrick specifically requested that the film include the waltz melody from ""Der Rosenkavalier."" However, he apparently did not give specifics about its use. Williams decided to have the reconstituted excerpt accompany David's and Gigolo Joe's hitched ride into Rouge City, which seems apt since ""Der Rosenkavalier"" could be summarized superficially as a bedroom farce. However, both the opera and film have similar themes, including musings on the passage of time; the facades we use to fool others and ourselves; and trying desperately to hold on to someone we love before we have to let go. It even would have seemed appropriate to have the moving trio from the end of the opera at the conclusion of the film.The ""final act,"" set during an ice age 2,000 years after the other events in the film, remains controversial since it does not have the trademark cynicism of Kubrick's other work. I could never understand why some people believed that the movie should have ended when David fell into the water after being pursued by the authorities; such an ending would have seemed too abrupt. However, I finally realized upon reading a recent Amazon review that they might have been referring to his futile attempts to be turned into a ""real boy"" by the Blue Fairy statue at the underwater Coney Island. That ending does seem aptly Kubrickian, underscoring the impossibility of achieving many of our own grand dreams, even though we hope against hope that we will actually fulfill them.Now that I realize the possibility of that ending, I suppose I should condemn Spielberg for not stopping at that point. However, in good conscience, I cannot deny that I was profoundly moved by the film's conclusion, where a team of robots finds David frozen in ice and reactivates him to learn about their predecessor's history. In an hommage to the recreation of a familiar environment for another David in another Kubrick film, the robots recreate the ""AI"" David's home from 2,000 years earlier. At David's request, they also resurrect a replica of his human mother Monica from a strand he kept of her hair. However, they tell David that she will live only one day. After spending a ""perfect day"" together as parent and child, Monica finally tells him before ""going to sleep"" that she loves him, reciprocating his own perfect (albeit programmed) love for her. Perhaps such a reunion is not a scientific possibility (Ist's ein Traum?), but it works at a level that transcends the rational. (And, yes, I also cried when Ellie Arroway met the extraterrestrial who appeared as her dead father in ""Contact,"" and when Fox Mulder finally met his sister's ""spirit"" in the ""Closure"" episode of ""The X-Files."") The conditions of the reunion stipulated by David's ""descendants"" makes the finale even more powerful, the camera fading out just before the sad finality that occurs beyond the confines of the film. Although David has another chance to be with Monica, which seems like a happy way to conclude the film, the ending reminds us of what we all need to confront as we go through life: saying goodbye permanently to those we love. For this reason, I disagree most strongly with those who claim that ""AI"" has a happy ending.Unless we could somehow bring him back to life, we will never know Kubrick's opinion about Spielberg's treatment of ""AI."" Some will continue to shake their heads and remain convinced that Spielberg totally ruined Kubrick's vision. However, like a number of films that received mixed reviews and generated little box office revenue, ""AI"" may be re-evaluated and praised in the coming years by critics who do not believe that Spielberg betrayed the memory and trust of Kubrick. After all, Kubrick's own films did not receive ""universal"" critical acclaim immediately; time worked in favor of Kubrick's own movies, just as it may work for Spielberg's bittersweet tribute to Kubrick."	5.0	Der Mechakavalier	2005-12-02	13	12	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1PNF4W765MBYA	jason	First off let me just say that many people who are bashing this film are mainly bashing it and calling it a steven spielberg film...and that's where they are wrong! Sure some changes were made after the great Stanley Kubrick passed away but this still has the feel of a classic Kubrick film. The people who have seen Eyes Wide Shut (which is a very beautiful and haunting film) bashed it mainly because they didn't have a good knowledge of Kubrick and the way he worked. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman drew people to the theater but it wasn't the stuff they expected from them and that's how it should've been and was. With A.I. Kubrick let Spielberg into his vision and a project that he held so near and dear to his heart and had been working on since the mid 80's. When Kubrick passed away Spielberg was given the chance to helm A.I. and create Kubrick's vision. Kubrick originally wanted Steven to direct the film and he'd produce but Steven was thinking the opposite but with Stanley's death he really had no choice. A.I. is a beautiful and mezmerizing collaboration between two of the greatest directors ever and comes out so well. To some Kubrick's films may be a total bore because of their length and how Stanley really got into telling a story in full detail and never cut any corners but Kubirck was never the type of guy Spielberg is that has the mainstream appeal and his films were often cult hits and not the big blockbusters like Spielbergs (which is another reason many people are bashing this film but to me it's his greatest work since E.T., his best film and one of the best of all time). A.I. is a fairytale and nothing more than that and that's what I rook from the film. Haley plays a robot who is very much like any other human being and that's all he wants to be treated like. He's looking for love just like everyone else but because he's not a real boy he's not treated the same way. All he wants is for his mother's love but doesn't understand why he can't have it and he realises if he find the blue fairy he will be able to become a real boy and his mothers love he will have. The ending is such a beautiful ending and I really don't see some people's problems with it. -SPOLIERS- David makes every possible attempt to show his mother than he is just like everyone else and wants to be a real boy and does so no matter how long it takes. 2,000 years pass and David still wants to prove that his love and already has shown that he is just as real as everyone else. David finds out that his mother has died along time ago but has a chance to bring her back for just one day and it proves how real he is and how much emotion he has when he accpets it just to hear his mother say she loves him and to show his mother how much he loves her.-END SPOILER- It's a very hearwarming and emotional ending and even though it's not what we'd expect from Kubrick in the end Spielberg throws his visions into the final half hour of the film and put his stamp on A.I.! Kubrick had so much faith in Spielberg and was Kubrick's choice and it's sad that people bash Spielberg for his visions and wanting to make Kubrick's dream film a reality! For those that have yet to see this or were turned away by bad reviews (I had huge expectations for the film and when it came out the bad reviews piled up and turned me off of it until now)please don't listen to all the negative stuff and view this movie and make your own opinions on it. Kubrick's stuff is either understood or misunderstood and with Spielberg in the mix it made it alot different to review a film like this!

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	When I first rented the DVD I didnt know if I was going to like this too much (I hate that Star Trek, [etc.]), so I thought I would give it a chance. The movie was 10x more than I anticipated! The movie is flat out a milestone in Spielberg's list of greats. Haley Joel Osment deserved atleast a Best Actor nomination. The movie is all around good and the dvd has plenty of goodies.	5.0	One of Spielberg's Best Movies!	2002-03-05	4	2	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1F7RILC4F8YLA	Jason	As most movie goers already know A.I. is basically a strange collaberation between Steven Spielburg and the late Stanley Kuberick.  This seems to be Spielburgs attempt at creating a &quot;2001&quot; homage to the late Kuberick.  After seeing it I am deluged at what ive seen.  Ill say what will probably be said alot about A.I. That I simply dont know how to feel about it.  Sure it was cinematlly amazing and the acting was top-notched but the overwhelming feeling it leaves is somewhat hard to take. You can deffenitly see the 2 directors stlyes which is both an asset and a weakness.  Can Kubericks stark reality be held up against Spielburgs brash opptimism?  The answer is no. And yes.  Like most modern marriages (forgive the anology) the 2 directors bot clash horribly and compliment each other very well.  Most movie goers will complain about the ending, Which is somewhat reminisant of Kubericks 2001...20 minutes of virtaully no dialouge and a somewhat an ambigious ending.  The advertisments do not completely capture what the film is about so preconcived notions will be shattered and viewers will probably be angry and resentful towards the movie, which is a shame because theres alot here to look at and read into...albiet some of the execution is off. But all in all its worth.  Another negative note is that this is simply not a summer movie.  I know Im stereotyping here but most movies that come out during this period are somewhat mindless brain candy. With that being said most will come in with different expectations.  When dessert is being served we are given the main course dressed up like dessert (again another anology, forgive me)  Some will be let down.  Others will be pleasently surprised while others are left shaking there head wondering if they liked it or not. Will this stand up to the test of time like &quot;2001&quot; and Spielburgs other classics?  I sincerly hopt it does, left for us to savor and appreciate it as the main course it is.	4.0	Theres alot going on here	2001-06-30	5	4	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A27RFBMPCWGZSZ	Jason Waldman	The best way to describe AI is probably as three movies packed into about two and a half hours.  The first part focuses on David's relationship with his new family.  The second part is about his journey to find the blue fairy.  The third part is about what happens in the future.  I know that's a little vague, but I can't give any more away than that.That's a very different way of doing things, to say the least, but it sort of works.  The storyline about David's attempts to get his mother to love him is really quite fascinating, but it only manages to loosely tie the three story arcs together.  However, even loosely tied together, the story stays constant and doesn't stray from the same general plotline.By themselves, though, the last two parts in particular are very well done.  The journey from the woods to the home of the blue fairy is really brilliant.  Everything from the Flesh Fair to Rouge City, while new and strange, never seems too out of place.  There are nice little touches thrown in that add to the story as well.  I particularly enjoyed the last half-hour or so because it is both brilliantly thought out and amazingly emotional.In terms of acting, AI is very good.  Haley Joel Osment isn't quite as good here as he was in Sixth Sense, but he still is perfectly believable as a robot with feelings.  Jude Law is excellent as Joe, a pleasurebot on the run who helps David and William Hurt, who is one of my favorite actors, is outstanding in a small role as the doctor who creates David.Visually, I'm not sure &quot;stunning&quot; even begins to describe AI.  I have seen many big-budget movies in my time and this is the most incredibly detailed and spectacular film I have ever seen.  Painstaking detail went into this whole movie, from the backgrounds to the robots to the sets.  The whole thing is simply to incredible to be put into words.My only real problems with this movie are really found in the first part.  The whole concept of a robot child moving in with a family who has a sick son is just a little strange.  It could have been done better I think if more time had been spent in the movie explaining the relationships between David, his parents, and the son.  Also, I think Teddy, the walking, talking bear could have been used more.It's only fair to warn people about a couple of things with AI as well.  There are hardly any humorous moments in the movie.  It is a dark, sometimes depressing look at the future.  Also, this movie might be too intense for children.Overall, I think AI is one of those films that could have gone down in history as one of the greatest, but a few little flaws keep it from getting there.	4.0	A Spectacular Film, But Not Without Flaws	2002-03-20	5	3	2

People saw the Spielberg name and cool visuals and instantly thought it would be an exciting family film.That's not the case though. This is a very dark and very emotional movie. It deals with subjects rarely touched upon by most modern films.Without spoiling anything, this film brings philosophy and spiritual thinking to the science-fiction genre. It is amazing to look at thanks to the brillant art direction, cinematography, and lighting along with the excellent direction by Spielberg himself.If you can surrender yourself to its story, you will be rewarded with a film that is truly beautiful in both appearance and story.	5.0	Not something for everyone, but might be everything to someone.	2011-03-22	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	"I'd love to take the high road and bash this film to pieces, but I can't. AI: Artificial Intelligence is a very well crafted film that succeeds on many levels. The film's plot is intriguing and captivates the viewer for almost the entire running time of the film (well over 2hrs 30mins). Based on the premise of families who cannot conceive or have lost children to tragedy, a MECCA child named DAVID is born. He is taken in and programmed to love only one person FOREVER. David's journey is long and frightening but rewarding. Haley Joel Osment, child or not, is one of the finest living actors. AI will cement his status in hollywood as a top notch child actor and even (eventually)leading man. NO other child actor could have even come close to pulling the empathy out of the audience that Osment does. He is simply incredible. Jude Law's role is very overplayed and less essential to the overall plot than I had originally perceived. Nonetheless, he does a fine job as Gigolo Joe, a suave ladies man who hooks up with David by mere chance. AI contains some of the most breathtaking computer animation ever seen on the screen, especially in the city and in the underwater sequences. Many people seem content to bash AI simply because it is not Kubrick's COMPLETE vision. To those people I say, who better than Steven Spielberg to finish Kubrick's vision. I am a hardcore Kubrick devotee but I loved the ending of AI (one of the few). The contrasting directorial styles of Kubrick(dark) and Spielberg(light) meld into a perfect nightmare of a fairy tale. Many people have said that Spielberg's ending is too happy. Personally, I found the ending unsettling and eerie even more so than Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" Overall, AI: Artificial Intelligence will go down in history as one of the greatest film achievements of all-time. I wholeheartedly endorse this film for purchase."	4.0	AI= Awe Inspiring  AI= Alienates Idiots	2002-03-08	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A61VFLXPI073P	JBT	This movie falls into the ever expanding category of movies that are terrible from a non bais point of view but somehow deemed great by hype and good marketing.It is impossible to feel anyting for the main character because when you look at everything from a sane person's perspective the main character is still just silicon and a battery.  Call me heartless or what you will, but I would feel nothing (but fustration) if my computer's hard drive failed no matter how inspiring the daily quotes it spits out are.It is obvious that this kid was not programmed to love - unconditionaly that is - but rather was programmed to be insecure about love.  This came across as very annoying.  Mabye a bug in the code.  I wonder if there will be new firmware coming out?Oh, adults make the connection, or in this case do not make the connection, that it doesn't matter - after all its just a robot.  This movie does far more damage to children.  Children recieve the message that they are replacable when inconvinient (twice).  Always nice to see a children's movie depict a future of prostitute robots.The bottom line is this.  You SHOULD NOT feel anything for the boy and SHOULD feel something for the mother.  The focus should have been on real people.  I found that 'Teddy' was the only redeeming thing in this movie - he gets the one star.Should we cry about a robot that has the best lithium battery not yet know to man being trapped in ice for a long time?  Should I feel sorry for it?  I know that I feel a little guilty when I think about that 386 that is rotting in a dump somewhere.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A17EKHH12XNBNE	"jcaraway ""carawaysd"""	I was originally afraid that this movie would either be cold and heartless, like so many of Kubrick's films seem to be, or verge on sickly sweet, like not a few of Spielberg's. However, I feel the result is best explained by comparing my feelings coming out of it to my feelings about it to Spielberg's most serious work before now.When I saw &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; it was so powerful that at the end, everyone left the theater without making a sound. While the tone of the audience was less reverent at the end of &quot;A.I.,&quot; (some people were downright rude and noisy) I consider the movie to be no less powerful. Here's some broad strokes of the brush, to show you why, without ruining for you if you haven't seen it yet:- Jude Law's flawless performance as a robotic &quot;Gigolo Joe,&quot; was humorous but affecting - near the end of the movie, we get an idea as to what might be in the thoughts of a robot programmed to be sensual, but without regard to the added emotion or feeling he might develop towards those he serves.- I had very mixed emotions about William Hurt's character, &quot;Dr. Hobby.&quot; I so much wanted to believe that he was acting out of pure motives, but eventually I came to realize that he couldn't see the life at the heart of his creation - the very &quot;thing&quot; he was celebrating. To say more would spoil the movie, but I can't resist pointing to his early answer that God created Adam to love him, in response to a certain moral question... and then pointing to his actions and treatment as his unfortunately real answer. Get past all the imagery and references to Pinocchio in the plot; this is the deeper, darker story we must consider.- Haley Joel Osment: his David was stiff and un-boylike in the beginning - but you'd expect that from a robot, wouldn't you? And he never fully carries off the feeling of being a real boy until the end - but you'd expect that from a robot trying to become a boy, wouldn't you? If you threw out the rest of the movie, (and perhaps certain parts could and should have been thrown out) his performance would still stand on its own.I remember being very displeased when Ben Kingsley was not nominated for a supporting Oscar for his role in Schindler's List. It would be no less than sheer insanity for Haley Joel Osment to not win the Oscar, now, for Best Actor. I can't think of any movie that could displace this one for the Best Picture slot, either. And while I felt like crying a few times during Schindler's List, I was dry-eyed at the end. I only remember snippets now because it hurt too much for me to want to see it again. If my sister hadn't been there with me during the screening of A.I., on the other hand, I would have bawled my eyes out. Painful though it is, I plan to see this movie several more times in theaters, to etch it even more deeply in my mind.Finally, personal experience may have quite a bit to do with how affecting this story of a boy just wanting to know he is loved was, for me. But everyone must deal with the questions presented by the movie. When you walk out of the movie, maybe you, too, will find new answers when you ask: &quot;Am I loved? How can I know this? How far will I go to be sure?&quot;	5.0	You *are* a real boy, David.	2001-07-03	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AEA7W3W1YF8YL	J. C. Nunez	I go to the movies once a week. I consider myself a connoseur of good cinema. Nevertheless I can enjoy an action flick as much as the next guy. In the case of Artificial Intelligence, however the movie is much more than an adventure flick, or &quot;The Adventures of David&quot;, the protagonist of the story. It really is the story of a boy who's looking for his &quot;mother's&quot; love. It touched me in such a primal way I was astonished.It goes to the core of our existence. The movie also speaks of the responsibility we have as human beings of taking care of the &quot;things&quot; for which we are responsible. To finalize this review, if Haley Joel Osment doesn't win the oscar on this one, he's being robbed blind. He should have gotten it for The Sixth Sense. I just can't undestand how a 12 year-old can master such a wide range of emotions with such mastery. The movie's 2 hours and 20 minutes long . It felt like 2 and a half minutes.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2X5FCG9AUP9VP	jcphoenix	When watching A.I., one gets the feeling that this is not your everyday conventional movie, and it is definitely not anything like any of Spielberg's other pieces. While his touch is definite in this film, there is nonetheless a darker, more sadistic and cynical feel to this that smells strongly of Stanley Kubrick, of whom this was a pet project for. What is interesting to see in this film is that while Kubrick did not actually direct this film, Spielberg tried to do it Kubrick style -and ended up with a very unusual but unique film that was a mix of both talents.The first half is almost magical and enchanting, and reminded me strongly of another film I love extremely, Edward Scissorhands. In both, the movie flowed along like a fairy tale, but at the same time, you knew that the fairy tale would end. And that is where Edward Scissorhands and A.I. are both unusual. The happily ever after part really comes first, and the obstacles come after, which of course leaves you inevitably with no fairy tale ending as it has already happened.David's quest to find the Blue Fairy and become a real boy is reminiscent of Pinnochio, but is much more sad as we, the audience know that the Blue Fairy cannot exist...or can she?In fact, David's world seems almost like a sci-fi fairy tale come true -at a first glance that is. Taking a closer look, you will see many wrongs in it, especially with the treatment of the robots at Flesh Fairs -the cruelty there far surpasses most of the cruelty in our [humans] history which is pretty darn bad. His world can seem like a dream come true at first, but can turn around 180 degrees and suddenly become the darkest nightmare you've ever known.All performances were brilliant, and all involved captured the mood of the movie. However, Osment was exceptional in an already ingenious cast, and I personally feel this is one of the most underrated performances of the year.The second half of the movie, on his quest to become a real boy so that his mother will love him, David encounters Gigolo Joe, who decides to help him on his quest. There are several times where the movie seems to end, but starts going again in this section. This second half is somewhat flawed, and while some would say the last thirty minutes ruined the movie, I wouldn't go that far. The introduction of some entirely new characters altogether at this point is startling, and while it was more negative for the movie than positive, it still provided for some interesting &quot;food for thought&quot;. (SPOILER: Yes, I know they weren't aliens)The ending is very open to interpretation however. It is really up to each person to decide for themselves exactly what happened to David. For me however, the last ten minutes were some of the best moments in a movie from 2001, and enraptured me as the tale came to a close. Although fate may not have been kind on David, in that last bittersweet scene before the movie ends, you can almost see in David's eyes that he captured everything that happened that final day into a mosaic of memories imprinted in his mind forever.	4.0	A flawed work of art, A.I. is still one of the year's best.	2002-06-18	10	8	2

I believe Spielburg did a good job at keeping the film in Kubrick form, up till the end.There are some elements that are purely Spielburg (Teddy), but this was likely going to be a Spielburg/Kubrick joint effort anyway ..., so the film is probably a lot closer to what it ""would have been"" than people suspect.The actors do good jobs, the robot actors in lead roles (Jude Law and Haley Joel) do outstanding jobs and deserve awards for their work.I found the special effects outstanding, yet not overdone. As with Kubrick movies the story is very deep, but what you get to see only skims the surface. I would watch it again, with select people who I think would get it, but I won't want my children to see it. I found Bicentennial Man (a highly under rated movie) to tell a similar story in a much more enjoyable film. But this one will leave you thinking about it for a few days (even if you want it to go away).

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"It is possible to pinpoint the precise moment that AI loses its mind. Like its main character--a robot boy abandoned in the woods--this film with great promise is left to wander aimlessly.AI starts off as a compelling tale of a grief-stricken family whose young son is in an apparently irreversible coma. While medical science seems incapable of helping him, robotic science comes to the rescue. Hoping to pull his wife Monica out of her grief, husband Henry brings home one of his company's creations - a ""mecha"" or robotic boy (the ever-wonderful Haley Joel Osment) built to love its owner. But a robot is not a boy, and soon things get out of control as the mecha expresses emotions like clinginess and jealousy.This whole first hour of the movie is gripping and real. It's less of a question of ""Can a robot express love"" than of ""Can human beings love a machine, knowing that it is just a machine?"" The dramatic possibilities were endless. How *real* do the parents want their new son to be? Will they love him? Treat him as a pet? Include him in family pictures? Or just stand him in the corner when it's convenient?But let us recall that there is another semi-human influence at work: Steven Spielberg.As soon as the movie gets almost unbearably interesting, it pops its clutch. Suddenly parallels to the Pinocchio story abound and the film becomes a monstrosity in its own right. There are sex-mechas and helicopter chases and a garish amusement park and frozen oceans and advanced robots from the future--an entire top drawer of colorful, useless junk and half-witted ideas strewn across the screen. The entire premise of human-robot interaction is completely dropped in favor of high-tech lachrymosity. It's as if someone spliced an hour of a magnificent Merchant-Ivory drama with the back end of Mad Max movie and overlaid all with a maudlin soundtrack.If you love visuals, this movie has them in spades. Robot faces split apart and come together; mechas attracted to a pile of junk replace their own worn parts; a ""super-toy"" bear walks around quite realistically; coastal cities are inundated or buried in ice. But if you're looking for a film that takes ideas seriously, you've come to the wrong place."	2.0	Didn't trust its own intelligence	2006-07-13	15	7	8

And then it hit me.That's what Stanley Kubrick used to do to me when I first saw his movies in the 70s!And then there were the similarity in themes. The Star-child at the end of 2001 is a resurrected David Bowman, representing a resurrected mankind.The scenes with David (in A.I.) sitting in a replication of his ""parents'"" house, alone, observed and then approached by alien-like robots of the future.And Dr. Strangelove -- the disturbing world comes to an end theme (albeit handled with profound humor).The scenes in Rouge City and the bars frequented by the delinquents in Clockwork Orange.Kubrick was all throughout this movie.And for me that means it was disturbing. But not necessarily in a bad way. Even perhaps in the best way. Yet, I cannot deny it was disturbing.At the same time, Spielberg has his imprint all over the movie too.The innocent little boy faced with both great wonder and awareness of the most profound horror about life.The boy looking toward a light-filled image. (Remember the famous scene in Close Encounters. And other Spielberg movies.)Of course, the special effects are top rate, another Spielbergian fingerprint.The movie delivered in a lot of ways. From the opening sequence I wanted to see New York City submerged under water. But at the same time I wanted it to deliver perhaps the impossible -- making David into a real boy that his ""mother"" loves. The ending is bittersweet. But perhaps the message is that miracles do not happen; only in fairy tales. This seems much more Kubrickian than Spielberg, at least classic Raiders-Spielberg. But I had hoped perhaps the future robots could somehow resurrect humans in soul as well as body. To do so for one day, and then have them die is Kubrick. And I think Speilberg intentionally put himself aside in this regard out of respect for Mr. Kubrick.I don't blame him for that.But that is what makes the movie ultimately disturbing. It doesn't deliver the emotion I -- we -- really want.Again, which is OK for a Kubrick film. And perhaps OK for a teenager perhaps too caught up in his philosophical inner dialogues. I think Kubrick set out at least making disturbing movies in order to get people to think, to change. And he certainly did that for me in my younger days. It is too early for me to gauge the effect of this movie in that regard. But I think it will.And for that I have to give his high marks.And I do.But it is still disturbing. There is still a frustrated emotion after the credits come on screen.Still, thank you Mr. Spielberg for resurrecting Mr. Kubrick, even if only for one day. That fact, mirroring the movie's theme as it does, sends a chill down my spine."	4.0	Kubrick Resurrected	2002-05-08	1	1	0

I rented it tonight (on DVD).  As I watched the movie, I wanted to like it.  It had interesting concepts in it, and they were intersperesed between 2.5 hours.... a total of maybe 20 interesting minutes in this mess of a movie.  All casual and serious movier-goers beware.... Those who critically watch a movie will be insulted as well as those who casually (passively) watch a movie alike.  This is a movie with no emotion, no plot, no direction (sorry Spielberg), no satisfaction, and a horrrible ending.  Sorry, this was the worst of Speilberg, unless I missed a few worse (like &quot;Hook&quot;).  It had no focus, and while I enjoyed parts of it, and up until a point I liked the subject of the movie, it was a complete disapointment.  It takes a turn for a worst in the last half-hour.  Rent with extreme caution.  I rented it against every well-meaning friends reccommendation and ending up agreeing with them.... that never happens.  I gave this movie 2 stars for the few interesting concepts introduced and because the DVD is well-produced if you liked the movie (however, lacking in trailers and teasers).  I wrote this review, and I don't EVER write reviews, and if I did, they would be praise.... the reason I came here is to seriously warn against people wasting to 2.5 hours of their lives.	2.0	A Big Miss	2002-04-11	12	8	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2JTCIWD50EG4B	"Jeffrey Belcher ""gigusa"""	A.I. is Steven Spielberg's take on Stanley Kubrick...and in my opinion, Speilberg was successful in creating a very &quot;Kubrickian&quot; tone and pace, while still leaving his signature of intense emotion.  The piece unfolds very gently, and Spielberg doesn't rush things, a trait which I've heard chided by others who have seen the film.  Speilberg uses a very static camera technique for much of the film, something Kubrick always utilized.Haley Joel Osment is the only child actor who could have pulled off such a demanding role, and his performance is wonderful as usual.  Osment doesn't blink throughout the entire movie, something which takes great concentration while still giving a very convincing performance.  As is present in many Spielberg films, Osment's David is built upon the emotional strength of innocence.  His quest for love and normalcy is quite touching, especially by the last frame of the film, when you're left to think...and think I did.The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular and seamless.  The CGI effects are not used as flash, but as a necessary part of the setting and flow of the film...expertly executed.Granted, not everyone will like this film, or leave the piece feeling fulfilled, but I for one did.  Highly recommended for those with the patience to let A.I. be A.I. until the end.	5.0	Subtle and very moving...	2002-04-06	5	4	1

Haley had better not get ripped off again when Oscar time comes around because he sure deserves it this time!! If you understand that this is a (like Grimm brothers) fairy tale told in the third person by Super Mecha's 2000 years in the future, exactly like Kubrick wanted, ending and all, then you will really enjoy every moment. Being a Speilberg film, nothing is left to chance,everything is on purpose. Its as perfect as i could be while being faithfull to Kubricks wishes(ie: his ending). If you go in expeciting Kubricks direction you will be dissapointed. It has his vision though, and is hauntingly beautiful. When the end finally came i was unable to move from my seat i was so stuned. As i left the theater i felt like crying and for an hour after that i could think of nothing else. It sticks with you to say the least. If  you dont like this film its because you didnt &quot;get it&quot;, or expected something that it was not made to be ie: Kubricks last film. And for those of you who say that it could have ended 4 times? Its a fairy tale, it had to end that way, no option. It must come around full circle.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1RSXP7MB772E3	"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	At times you can tell where Kubrick's dark, reality driven story meets head long with Spielberg's beautiful fantastical direction. But that hardly dampens the magic made as a colaboration of the two. The climax was deeply sorrowful, and meaningful, rather a rarity in emotional pull. Which makes this film so important. The imaginative world is so entertaining to unravel that I could hardly stop thinking about this movie (hours after watching). It is a movie that impacts the viewer; that needs not a point to be understood, as it stands alone as a visual art piece. Sadely this movie is stereotyped as a big budget flop, one of the last in fact for any company, as the film was looked on as slow, even dragging at times. But divided it is, between fanatics, who believe it to be a masterpiece, but equally loud, must be the opposite, who cannot get excited over the subdued syle, and gloomy plot. Science fiction has taken another step with this movie, but sadely, perhaps deepening the gap between fan and opposer. Which is shocking, considering who was involved with the film, perhaps the very men who made the genre what it was at its apex.	4.0	One of the most visually breath taking  films ever.	2005-03-21	3	2	1

Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	With a running time of over 2 and a half hours, AI tests your stamina with long shots centering on the actors faces, especially Osments, or pondering the themes with dark images and voice overs by William Hurt.  I wanted to like this movie, but the pace was too slow and plodding.  To make it worse, Speilberg's 'I've got them in the theater, so I can do what I want' sense of pushing the envelope really went overboard when he continued the movie at the end with an extreme distance future scene.  After we are shown an ending, he decides he wants to tack on another ending.  Elaborating on the themes even more so and stretching our patience with no remorse.  We get the picture Steven, no need to pound it into our heads!  I am a Speilberg fan, don't get me wrong.  And I appreciate him taking on a picture with such moving emotions, not many good.  The Pinochcio parrallels not withstanding, it may have been better if he didn't feel like he could take such liberties.  This is not a kids movie, kids will hate this movie.  Yet it seems to try to appeal to the whole family.  Be warned, this is a very serious journey into lost family and abandonment and should not be considered for family fun entertainment, despite the neat special effects.	2.0	Too slow and way too long	2003-06-18	6	4	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A36010RGREIR42	Jerald F. Brockert	I have been very disappointed with the reviews of this movie until I saw it, and then I understood!! It is a movie that you either love or hate and there seems to be no middle ground. Some have said it is too long, the story line is bad, the special effects are lackluster, and only Osment and Law are good. They are probably right, what do I know. I am a movie buff, but hey, I liked - Gone With The Wind - How The West Was Won - To Kill A Mockingbird and hated Citizen Kane.So for what it is worth here is how it affected me. I was quickly pulled into the story and found it a journey very much like the Wizard of Oz and other quests to find our true identity. In this world of possible cloning of human beings and other life, I found the story plausible, but most of all associated with the overall theme of the piece, which I saw not only to be a quest for identity, but love.To me, the movie presented how much love can move our world and more important can move us as human beings, even if we appear to be robots. There are many portrayed in this movie that lack love. The parents, the boy robots maker, the overall outside world. Also, there is another theme, no less important. Not being loveable because you are different. So as these themes emerged this movie more and more held my attention.Then came homelessness. Few assoicate with that, and of those who watch this movie, I would wager to say, they have never been homeless. Then there is seperation and lonliness and fear, and the overiding desire to be like others so we can be loved in return.People have slept through this movie, and I would imagaine those same people sleep through life. None of the above is really important because we have become too self-sufficient to see a need for each other, to feel the loving touch of another, and to be nurtured by another, and most of all, to return the love we are given. We were all hit September 11th and taken down in a great way by our own technology, as are the people in this story.For a while we banded together and love on the streets, to the homeless, to the lonely became important. Now we are back and it is ok to hate again. Ok, to pull others apart as the robots are pulled apart in this movie.But not all. There are still heros. There are still people who reach out, and there are still those for whom the words - I love you - are the most important words in the world. To me, that is what this movie is about. That is what not only this boy robot wants, but we all do, if we stop to admit it. For awhile we did. For awhile we gave it in great abundance. For this movie, most of these loving people do not show up until 2,000 years after our species have gone.So I cried in this movie, more than any other. I cried for the boy who wanted to be loved, and wanted to give love. I cried for the robots who were created different and brought into a society that only sought to destroy them. I cried for the teddy bear who followed along faithfully and asked nothing, only to stay around, and I cried for a society that sometimes pushes love away, or sadly, never reaches for it at all.But hey, what do I know - my all time favorite movie is - To Kill A Mockinbird - it says a lot about love, a lot about being different and a lot about hatred. I put this movie along side it and hope that one day it gets the recognition it deserves. Tall order, but not an artifical one.Just for the record - also thought the special effects were great. The sound wonderful, the score good, and the DVD picture at times breathtaking.	5.0	Are We Really The Robots	2002-03-18	8	7	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2S4XQX9UFIS3K	Jeremiah Gault	Most of this movie is good.  Some parts are extraordinary.  The most provacative image in the film that I recall is when Gigolo Joe watches the boy fall into the water.  The reflection of the boy on the glass looks like a tear running down Joe's face, which resonated with the film's theme of expressing vs. experiencing emotion quite well.  This film has a lot of things going for it... until the ending.  Speilberg just HAD to ruin his own film by making a long, drawn-out, documentary-style ending.  He should have ended it when the boy fell in the water.  That would have been an interesting, thought-provoking ending.  I like to pretend that the movie ended there.  The pointless and silly stuff that ensues afterward is simply painful and disappointing.As it stands, however, this is one of the most believable and serious science fiction films I have seen in years (I hated Minority Report). Few science fiction films this good exist.	4.0	a mixed bag of a film	2005-04-18	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1PNNR3B9H8GTC	Jeremy Berman	It is impossible to deny that A.I. is one of the most visually innovative Hollywood movies of the last decade. Director Steven Spielberg has invisioned a futaristic society in which the boundaries of color, technology and imagination have been pushed farther than most of us primitive beings could ever imagine. Many of the images linger in the mind even as the plot and characters that gave them purpose fade from memory: the intensely colorful and decadent Rouge City, the submurged and decaying Manhattan, the terrifying and joyously deranged Flesh fair. It's a brilliant and riviting feast for the eyes that won't likely be equalled in the near future.Now ask me I actually enjoyed the movie. Sadly, the answer would only be: sort of. Although Spielberg's script includes many moments of great genius, and the nuanced and restrained performances of Haley Joel Osmet and Jude Law are excellent, the film is ultimately a fractured marriage between two of the cinema's greatest filmmakers: Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. It was Kubrick who first expressed the desire to transform this story of a robotic boy who can love into a film, and Spielberg who picked up the mantle of creation following Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg has obviously tried to be true to Kubrick's distinct style and flair, while also adding his own insights and interpretations to the material. Sometimes this partnership is a success, but all too frequently is causes the movie to waver uncontrollably and confusingly between Spielberg's sentimentality and Kubrick's cold meticulousness. It is the spirit of Kubrick who heartlessly leaves David at the bottom of the ocean staring blankly at a statue of the Blue Fairy, and Spielberg who awkwardly resurrects him for his cloying reunion with his mother. Ultimately, A.I. isn't really a bad film, but one that falls short of the standards both of these great directors have set in their previous works.	3.0	A Fractured Fairytale	2004-02-18	4	1	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3C30B6TC0ZQ1N	Jeremy	I'm a big fan of Spielberg.  I love his sense of story and his sense of wonder that he conveys in a film, yet A.I. just doesn't deliver.  Being an artist, I know that artists will like this film because it really doesn't say anything.  It asks a lot of questions and most people will leave thinking this is a deep film, but it's a really worthless movie with no redeemable qualities except for some of the performances which were at times engaging.  I however was unwilling to go along on this ride with Spielberg and could not enter this world that he created.  People in the theater were actually walking out and some groaned when they realized that the movie was still going to continue (there's several places in the film that seem as if it's ending.)  All in all, if you're a spielberg nut wait for the video.  The lighting is always interesting, but without story, who cares...and come on.  Pinochio has already been done to perfection.

However, you cannot combine the style of each and get a good movie.Spielberg is all about making an emotional movie that you feel attached to (ET, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, etc.) and Kubrick is all about making you question your basic concepts and beliefs.  He doesn't want you to like the characters (Clock Work Orange, Full Metal Jacket, etc.)  The two styles DO NOT mix.  You cannot have a cute cuddly character (Haley Joel Osment) and have him tormented and tortured throughout the movie and have the movie going public like it.Spielberg tried to make ET 2.  Cute cuddly creature that someone falls in love with, have them torn apart by forces beyond their control, and then have an emotional reunion at the end to make everybody feel better.All that, and the movie wouldn't end.  The worst part was when the ""Aliens"" came.  Jeez, couldn't they come up with a better ending than that?"	2.0	Spielberg + Kubrick = A total mess of a movie	2002-02-19	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A376INY8S41G00	"Jeremy York ""-beanish-"""	What a waste of money and time.  As the movie started, I had hopes for it.  The acting and effects were top-notch, and the premise was interesting.  The early part of the movie is a bit predictable but still interesting, and there are some fine moments (both in the plot, and in the cinematics).The first portion has a fair bit of believability - the view of this future world is pretty compelling.  But that rapidly unravels as the film goes into the middle portion, and we see something of the world outside of one family's home.  Various visual elements that are supposed to give us this dark, fairytale gone wrong feel just wind up looking stupid.  Bad guys who are supposed to be creepy, on their glowing beast bikes, looked like Power Rangers to me.This middle portion of the movie is ok, nothing that hasn't been done before, not terribly compelling, and has some good bits (like the gigolo robot character).  Could have been a 3 star movie if they had just stopped at this point.If you must go see this film, do yourself a favor and LEAVE after our hero finds what he has been searching for.  After about two hours, at a point where they could have just rolled the credits, instead we get this horrible load of drawn out, boring, stupid, sentimental tripe.  Great pains were taken to make this tear-jerker ending fit and make sense with the rest of the story, but those efforts fail.  The plot aspect of the end of the movie feels incredibly forced and contrived.  I'm not against a feel-good or emotional movie, but I found this ending portion to be pure schlock, and the only emotional impact for me was anger that I hadn't walked out of the movie.  The special effects at the end are cool, I guess.  Overall, though, the last 30-40 minutes of this way-too-long film destroyed what had been a fair to mediocre experience.	2.0	It's ok if you skip the last half	2001-07-02	1	1	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2L620G787JV9B	jflory81	If this movie had ended 30 or 40 minutes earlier, it would have been a great movie. That being said, it didn't.Without giving away the plot of the movie, it can be broken down into three acts, the third one being totally unneccesary. To me, and my film friends in the theater, it felt like Spielberg was kicking dirt on the grave of Kubrick throughout the third act.Not only that, but this film is marred by scientific impossiblities (no I'm not talking about robots who can love, I can accept that since that's what the movie's based on). The entire third act seems as if it was written and rewritten over and over again. It just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.On the positive side, the first two acts (especially the time in Rouge City) are well-crafted, well acted (Haley Joel Osmont in paticular stands out, especially in the 2nd act), and completely enjoyable. Kubrick's touch on the second act in paticular is obvious.It's too bad Spielburg couldn't resist the typical hollywood ending, because this movie could have been something special. Instead, it's simply maddening.	3.0	So much potential...	2001-06-30	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQUYPDPNXVPCS	"J. F. Rick ""bricoleur, hobbit"""	Basically, Spielberg is not the man and hasn't been for quite a while. Go back to doing E.T. like things. Or, go back to doing Jurassic Park or Jaws like things. This movie has part of those lineages, but also contains the overly melodramatic lineage of movies like Saving Private Ryan. Ugh. Stay with one line/vision for the film. By far, the best line throughout the movie is the Stanley Kubrik line. If you stop the movie when it comes to it's logical, yet depressing, ending, it's a good movie (deserving 4 stars).Haley Joel Osment is amazing. I think he might actually be a robot (or uebermarionette). No kid of his age should be able to act that well.	3.0	Cut the last 30 and you get an extra star	2002-09-03	4	3	1

For a start, where's the problem? The kid is horrible. Haley Joel Osment should be packed up in a sealed crate and left to rust! Who would want the pathetic disturbing guffawing little idiot in their house in the first place?And worst of all, there's a revolting Christian feeling to this movie's lazy morality that will have all intelligent beings vomiting popcorn before the first hour has passed. If God existed, even he (in his 'infinite mercy' - don't laugh) would have struck most of the cast down on the spot. A tragic end to a legendary movie career.	2.0	Kubrick fans mourn	2002-03-13	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AR6HD8RQ0P5NY	J. Hatcher	"Almost everybody agrees that the first half, even the first two-thirds of the film is amazing. But the ending is something that you're going to love or hate. For me, the film was an amazing and inspiring experience. It is a Kubrick film in almost every way, but one that is undeniably executed by Spielberg. Spielberg makes a great tribute to the late filmmaker with ""A.I."", but he also gives the film his own unique charm. This makes for a somewhat warmer picture than one would expect from Kubrick, but not a worse one. Critics who hate Spielberg (and most do), and people who use the term, ""Spielbergesque,"" ""Spielbergian,"" or something similar, will probably not hasten to say that the film is terrible. But this film is indeed quite different from any other film Spielberg has directed and is very intriguing. The premise of ""A.I."" alone is something that is rarely studied in film, so there are countless interpretations that can be (and many more that have yet to be) made about the nature of an artificial being. Spielberg has explored this nature in his own unique style throughout the film, chilling at times and warm at others. Those who argue that the ending is senseless and ruins the film have either never seen a Kubrick film, or are in denial of Kubrick's style. ""2001"" was similarly panned during its release. Overall, the message of the film is something you have to see and judge for yourself. The production quality itself is flawless; the acting is unbelievably good and Osment and Law give remarkable performances. The special effects in the film are unbelievable as well. At times, they are so good that you forget you're actually looking at effects, and not real characters and locations. Though it is not suited for young children, ""A.I."" is definitely one of the best films released this summer."	5.0	A good film - love it or hate it	2001-07-06	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3IH2L4B5VOA59	"J. Houzet ""wozamoya"""	Once in a while a movie comes along that connects with the longings in your soul. A.I. is such a movie. Like some other reviewers here, I was sworn off this movie by friends who had seen it before me and hated it. That aroused my curiosity enough to see it for myself.It blew me away. It succeeded in pleasing me on so many levels: the story of a boy's longing to be loved, his epic adventures, the questions about life - real and artificial, the casting and excellent acting, and the thrilling special effects.I can't believe the vindictiveness against Steven Spielberg I have seen among these reviews. What's your problem, people?! He truly is a master storyteller of the visual medium. So many of his films have become beloved classics, even when the Academy snobs have ignored his work, as with the magnificent Amistad.At the time of A.I.'s release, professional film critics seemed to dwell on the collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick in the making of this movie, as though that defined the film. They said Spielberg's optimism and lighter tone was tempered by Kubrick's cynicism, or the other way around. Granted, I imagine Spielberg honored the late Kubrick's vision, but he himself has not shied away from presenting the world in its ugliness, as with the heart-wrenching Schindler's List.Other than musings about Kubrick and Spielberg's genius, and the long-time sci-fi love affair with robots that think and feel, A.I. offers us other lessons to consider: the treatment of children as possessions to adore or discard as we see fit (the robot David represents all unwanted children); and the longing all of us have to be whole and to be loved.William Hurt's character brings up the question of God at the beginning of the film. He responds to a question about the ethics of creating robots that feel emotion by recalling Genesis: &quot;Why did God create Adam?&quot; he asks. Answering his own question, he says, &quot;To love him,&quot; meaning the love God expected from Adam, and by extension the rationale for creating robots that love us. That's only half-true. God also created Adam because God wanted to love Adam. As selfish humans, David's creator and David's sometime mother failed to return the love they expected from David.Don't look for a typical sappy happy ending here. This film is more Grimm's Fairy Tales than Disney. It's closer to the original Hans Christian Anderson Little Mermaid than the Disney version. It expresses longings that we know will not be fulfilled in this life.	5.0	A heart-breaking fairy tale	2003-01-09	0	0	0

I finally bought the DVD and watched it again.. and I have grown to love it more with each viewing.  I am a big fan of Kulbrick and I wish he lived to finish the movie himself, but his influence is certainly felt especially in the first half of the movie which I found slow-going the first time (kind of like 2001!), but it is the set-up for the rest of the movie and introduces us to the human side of the equation.  The second part is more special-effects as it focuses on the technological side of the equation.  This is not a kids movie since it is quit disturbing.  This is not a movie for the superficial movie-goer who is unwilling or unable to appreciate great art and deep thought in a movie.  This movie has affected me emotionally like few other recent movies...and has drawn me back for several repeat viewings.  Visually it is a masterpiece, John William's score is breathtaking, but it is not a perfect movie...it does seem like two different movies forced into one movie, but I can appreciate the difficulty of making a movie like this. The only part of the movie I did not really enjoy was the Flesh Fair--it was a little too violent and over the top gross for me.  While most people criticize the second part and the ending.. I find them very moving.  The first half has little special effects and focuses on the human family.  The second half is mostly special effects--and very good effects they are, but builds toward a very emotional and sad ending.  The ending chokes me up everytime and I can hardly keep from crying even after several viewings.. but I""m an emotional person. If you have ever felt lonely--you should be moved by the loneliness of the boy robot.  Guess some people just don't get it..  pleaseGive A.I. and try and watch it with an open mind--and heart.I think in time it will be considered a near-masterpiece.  I like it even more than E.T., unfortuanately, A.I. may in fact be a truer vision of our future...this film is actually a more realistic attempt to contemplate the future of the human race but it is not going to be a happy ending."	5.0	Great, Underrated, Misunderstood Masterpiece	2002-04-05	7	6	1

When you set high expectations (early Oscar buzz) about a film and it is so poorly made, so trite, simple, and utterly excruciating to watch, it must not just be set aside as a movie I didn't enjoy, but panned as no movie has ever been panned before.  The watchable and interesting components of this film come in the middle, but they are so clouded by the hyper-exposition ala Bi-Centennial Man (another utterly forgettable robot movie that went on way too long) and the most ridiculous ending of a movie that I've ever had the displeasure of watching, that you forget the important social commentary attempts.  The praise for this movie has been driven mostly by this component.  While there is the beginnings of an interesting social critique, the plotlines and characters (Jude Law) with the most potential don't get enough screen time to save this movie.Just because something is original or never-been-done before, doesn't make it art, or quality picture making, even if the Speilberg name is attached to it.If you're looking to fulfill your artistic movie quotient for 2001, skip this two and a half hour waste of time and rent a good, innovative (and the best and most underappreciated movie of 2001) film in Memento...	1.0	Hands down the worst movie of 2001	2002-04-13	15	6	9

The first two hours, as an independent unit, could probably make one of the finest films of the decade, drawing you in completely (with amazing effects) into a dark and dreamlike world full of both pain and bittersweet humor.  Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment are, of course, fabulous.  With the last half hour, though, it seems that the Kubrick muse abandons Spielberg.  His worst side takes over (the part of him that allowed him to create the &quot;T-rex vs. San Diego&quot; scene in &quot;Lost World, Jurassic Park&quot;) resulting in an ending that compromises the integrity of the entire film and insults the viewer's intelligence.	3.0	Infuriating	2001-06-27	13	5	8
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1OI9O2S4UOB5O	"JL ""J"""	A.I. is a twisted vision of the classic tale of Pinocchio in which, Haley Joel Osment plays an android (David) meant to fill the void of his owners who've given up hope on their son's comatose condition. Along the way, David learns the disturbing truth of who, or what rather, he really is. This film is one of the most important films you will see, not only because it is a visual masterpiece with stand-out performances, but because it deals with powerful societal and moral issues that leave you thinking for days. A.I. is powerful moviemaking thanks to Steven Spielberg, with great insight thanks to Stanley Kubrick, that results in an eerily majestic story. If you are a fan of either of the above directors it is a must. I would highly suggest this to fans of Tim Burton's works as the mergence of Spielberg and Kubrick's effort seem almost similar to films like Edward Scissor Hands.	5.0	A vision of things to come	2001-12-27	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3FGIDFZA4U3O2	"Joan Crawford ""Jon"""	"AI is a film about love. It is sentimental. Why? Because sentiment is beautiful and deep.  This film is a lot deeper than most people understand. It asks questions about society and love, and it doesn't give us answers. It wants us to think. The main character in AI is a robot named David, and at the beginning of the film we think he is only artificial because he seems not to have feelings.  We eventually realize that this robot has ideal qualities of compassion and tenderness that aren't present in any of the people - living or robots - around him.  This leads David in an emotional journey, always looking for love and acceptance and unfortunately never finding it. Does this echo many peoples' lives of unrealized love?  I think it does, and we have unsentimentality to thank for it. We should all learn to love with the tenderness of a child.Because David was a robot created with the ability to love, he was unique compared to all that surrounded him.  Nobody could love him. Because David was created with feelings, in many ways he was a real child. But the tragedy is that we created someone with ideal love in a loveless world. David's quest for that love goes on for thousands of years....as all of the people he loved die.  There is no doubt in my mind...AI is a melodrama in the finest sense of the word. It is one of the best love stories since ""Camille."" It made me cry. Anyone that knows how it feels to love someone who can't love you back will understand and be deeply touched by this magnificent, artistic, beautiful film.  Haley Joel Osment displays a gifted talent for conveying love and emotion...he is a great actor.  Jude Law is memorable and eventually heart-breaking as David's robot friend. AI is a classic, with a timeless message about life and love."	5.0	An Emotional Journey	2002-05-31	6	5	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2U8HTSGBEBVX7	Joanna	I'd just like to start off by saying that I LOVE this movie. It's in my opinion, one of the top 100 best movies of all time.Yes, I know this movie got mixed reviews. You know why? For two reasons; 1)Because people don't get it, and 2)Because it has plot holes and problems.It's really not as complicated as people think it is. There are just some folks among us who don't know their head from a hole in the ground, and that's fine. They can go watch American Pie and leave the good stuff to us.It's SCI-FI! It's not real! Of course there will be plot holes and problems!!! But that's fine, it's not real. It's a fantasy and in SCI-FI anything can happen.That said, I'll get onto what I really thought about this movie. I came into it as a $10 DVD from Cub Foods, it'd be OKAY. For ten bucks, why not? I sat down and immediately was drawn in by the stunning acting but Haley Joel Osment, and to a lesser degree, Jude Law. Even the animatronic bear, Teddy The Super Toy, plays a vital role at some points. Plus he's really cute in a movie filled with dark/harsh futureness, and that's cool. (I actually contemplated sending Steven Spielberg and extra $20 because it was worth the full price.)Every scene just makes you question the humanity of David more and more. Is he meerly a robot(mecha)? OR does he want to become a real boy, and doesn't the fact that he wants to become a boy, make him human enough to be a boy? After all, he did many many unantisipated things, even beyond the boundaries of his programming. This is a great topic for discussion. Could we really love a robot? Yes, I believe so. If it looked and acted as wonderful and David. But is it ethical?In the grand scheme, each scene is so different and poignant with a point to make, and David's journey to find The Blue Fairy is sad and happy simultaniously. I was in tears during the last 45 minutes and during the moving 15 minute epilogue as well.Yes, it could have been cut off after the submergence scene, but I feel the epilogue really was an emotional release that was necessary and beautiful. It's excellent when movies have somewhat happy endings.This is a movie that changed me. It became a part of my emotions and the way I see the world. It's such a vision, it's a shame I (and others) stayed away this long. I'd recommend it to everyone. If you see it, and don't understand it...well, go ask your smartest looking friend. No doubt they could expound on the virtues of this destined and astonishing piece of film history, flop or not!	5.0	Don't Be Scared Because It's &quot;Too Abstract.&quot;	2004-04-11	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3FFOC68BRL6FO	"Joan Saraceno ""Rock Hogan"""	This film has &quot;INDESCRIBABLE&quot; written all over it.  That means I truly cannot tell you in words how personally this movie affected me and how emotional it was.  The acting was at it's utmost superb point.  Haley-Joel Osment is a show stealer and the feeling is tremendous that he gives you.  He makes you believe exactly what the film is trying to do, make a robot who can truly love.  He feels like a robot but at the same time feels real.  It's weird, but it's true and worked out perfectly.  THe skill that went into this acting and directing of Spielberg could never be topped.  Following the storyboards and story by Kubrick, Spielberg wrote his own screenplay that turned out wonderful.The film drew tears from my eyes and was one of the most emotional films I have ever seen.  John Williams score is beautiful and heartwarming and has mixes of fear and mellowness and sadness, truly a wonderful mix.This is another classic example of a film done by Spielberg where the visual effects look tremendously real and are set-up to make you believe they are real sets.  It's all the way he trickily sets up the shots, that's where his perfection comes.The ending to this movie is a mix of eternal happiness for the characters yet sadness for the audience, and it left me in buckets of tears (I mean that truly).  It's a great film and anyone who dares to show their disrespect for it has serious problems.	5.0	INDESCRIBABLE	2002-07-09	3	3	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A192T6S8MGZ7E2	"John A. Reder ""Tactical Neuronics"""	Call me unique but I liked the entire movie. I have been a sci-fi movie and book fan for well over 3 decades and I have been a computer programmer specializing in A.I. and electronics guru for over 20 years not to mention a robot fan and hobbyist. This movie hits dead on the types of issues we will be facing. If we have a problem with stem cell research and cloning how are we going to deal with creating machines that are self aware. Questions like, if you turn it off is it murder? Can a machine that believes in and loves God have a soul? Can we love a machine back if it loves us? We will be facing these questions in the next 20 to 50 years or so and I think this movie starts to scratch the surface. I like the ending because it suggests that even if we as a race are wiped out, our creations may continue on evolving and changing and may even someday look back on us and remember us fondly. Made in the image of the creator sounds strangely familiar! I like movies that make me think and as a techno geek I hate when Hollywood makes unbelievable leaps but in this case I don't see anything that's out of the question as a possible future scenario. For those interested in seeing just how we are coming on these technologies simply do a web search on Sony's AIBO or Honda's ASMOV.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AOTB1671D35HU	John Briginshaw	Spielberg takes a concept from the master sci-fi director of all time (OK, James Cameron has a claim there too but anyway, work with me) and drops the ball while going for the ultimate TD, i.e. the besting of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It is all there, fantastic score, good acting, talking computers, 2.5 hours of screen time, last third to one half of the movie taken up by insane transcendental weirdness, etc.  But Uh-oh, the aforementioned transcendental weirdness is not weird enough or transcendental enough to serve as a payoff and just goes on...my goodness, and on!  The hotel room/Starchild sequence in 2001 - well what was *that* about?  But it sure looked cool - and you were left to your own devices to interpret it as you wished, or just go along for the ride.  Here we have an hour of aliens/robot descendants (who knows?) engaging in so much explication, moralising and unexplained (and somewhat pointless) acts of godlike benevolence that it would seem they are robot descendants of Spielberg himself, or aliens from planet SKG.The cool things: the scenes of an ice age New York are &quot;wow!&quot; and Teddy, reliable companion, eminence grise and sometime savior is mondo cute.  But it's 2.5 hours that feels like 4.  The thing about Kubrick, he knew when to shut up, Spielberg doesn't here - there were two places in the film where he could have cut and run, and it would have improved it substantially (SPOILERS: the two points are...!! when David falls in the water after meeting his &quot;maker&quot;, and when he finally &quot;meets&quot; the Blue Fairy).As for the DVD extras, I have not watched them yet, so cannot comment.  To be honest, once I see the main movie, and it is as much of a turn-off as this one, I am not that interested in seeing how it was made.  Maybe that's just me!	2.0	I have seen A.I., Senator, and it is no  2001	2002-03-18	3	1	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2YU23UXE5PK9W	John D. Pence Jr.	Surely anyone who is a fan of Stanley Kubrick's work, especially &quot;2001,&quot; &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; would expect a dramatically taught, technically fantastic film, ripe with sexual innuendo and psycho-social commentary.  I'm sure the original screenplay that Kubrick never finished would have been his best, and it was probably well on its way.  Then Spielberg got a hold of it.Rumor had it that Kubrick was bouncing his ideas off Spielberg through secret discussions on the subject of translating the short story to a screenplay.  Speilberg's translation of his friend and colleague's vision is successful visually, but lacks the passion, and underlying tension that was Kubrick's signature talent.Spielberg, a wizard at character development, is successful in building plausible, human characteristics into the automatons that grace the screen.  Each model of robot, designed for a specific funtion, has discernable traits.  We feel for David(Haley Joel Osment)'s plight to discover love in return for the emotions he is so graciously programmed to emit.  Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) is a playful, yet culturally aloof sex toy who becomes David's 'Jiminy Cricket' as the film's thin plot degrades into a futuristic Pinocchio/Blade Runner/Wizard of Oz quest through near-future New Jersey.Visually, the film is breathtaking as the audience is introduced at the top of the film to a world where the polar ice caps have melted, forcing upper class humanity to seek refuge in the 'burbs and mountains as their waterlogged metropolises of ages past go suspiciously abandoned.  The film then takes us though David's journey of self-discovery with an adoptive family, soon to become a discarded appliance.  This is where Kubrick's vision is clouded by Spielberg.  In a scene in which Kubrick would have left us questioning our morals as to why we should feel sorry for a machine discarded by the side of the road, Spielberg lays on the schmaltz and we're left with a moment ripped from &quot;E.T.&quot; but without the comfort of knowing that the alien is going home.  Tears are flowing in the seats next to me, yadda yadda yadda.David then befriends Joe as the pair are semi-rescued from a modern-day, droid witch hunt staged as a 21st century circus; a cross between a monster truck rally and a heavy metal concert.  As David persuades Joe to help him find the Blue Fairy, a character from the story Pinnochio (which David literally translates into a how-to for becoming human), the two venture to Rouge City to consult an oracle that Joe is convinced will help little David find his humanity.After a few stunts and special effects, including an eye-candy filled flyby of a submerged Manhattan, David and Joe are back at front steps of the company that made them.  One thing leads to another and David finds himself at the feet of the Blue Fairy; a submerged, ages old (yet pristinely preserved!) theme-park statue at what used to be Coney Island.  David is then frozen for 2,000 years as an Ice Age (surprise!) decends and wipes out the rest of humanity.  But wait!  David is dredged up by aliens who look suspiciously like those from &quot;Close Encounters&quot; and is told he is last and closest surviving relic of human kind.Here's where the story gets REALLY far fetched.  Even with this much of a contrived plot, it seems Spielberg was insistant on honoring Kubrick with a harkening to the end of 2001...  The aliens, content to study David as a goldfish in a bowl, construct his adpoted home from memories and even clone his LONG-dead adoptive mother (memories intact!) from a hair sample that survived sewn inside a mechanical teddy bear for 2,000+ years for one day of love and devotion.  Excuse me Steven, but after making &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; you should know that DNA extracted fron hair is useless for cloning, period!  What we are sold on as a Tin Man's search for unattainable serenity, ends in complete obscurity with a contrived and convenient fairy tale ending.Although I knew I'd have to throw out convention while watching this film, Spielberg should know that the best science fiction is derived from science fact.  There is none in this film.  At best it's a futuristic fairy tale.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you must see &quot;A.I.&quot; in theaters, enjoy the sound, the imagery, the effects and the acting that Speilberg is so effective at wringing from his resources.  If you're interested in witnessing Kubrick's final haunting vision of humanity's last impression on planet Earth, unfortunately, you're stuck with &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot;	2.0	Spielberg Flaws a Sure Kubrick Gem	2001-07-02	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A5QKNOXMXVVJ4	John E. Norman	I just finished watching &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot; for the first time, and, while I usually like to see a movie at least twice before reviewing it, this one is so bad that I don't even know whether I can sit through it again. The story begins in the future (presumably about 100 - 200 years from now) at a time when robots are being made that are so lifelike, it's sometimes hard to tell them apart from real people. A couple loses their son (we are led to believe that he is dead, but this turns out not to be true) and adopts a little boy robot to take his place. The boy robot is programmed to mimic the emotions of a human boy, but it doesn't take long to realize that things aren't working quite as planned. Then, in a total shocker, it turns out that the couple's son isn't dead after all, and he comes home to live with his parents and his robot brother.I don't want to give away the whole story here, so let's just say that the little boy robot ends up, like an electronic Pinocchio, on a quest to become a real boy. The story is dumb, there are plot twists that make no sense at all (staying underwater for 2000 years while praying to the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy is one of them) and the acting performances of the adults are weak. The only consistently good thing about this movie is Haley Joel Osment's performance as the little boy robot. The special effects are good at times, but cheesy at other times.It's a good thing that kid can act, or I would've had to give this a one-star rating.	2.0	What Was Steven Spielberg Thinking About?	2003-11-11	3	1	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AKG5IZ5MS8XN9	John Paul Kinhart	If I were to rate the first Act of A.I., I would have given it 4 stars. This act was the only place in A.I. that Stanley Kubrick had obviously influenced.  If Kubrick had any influence on the rest of the movie then it doesn't show.The Prologue (where William Hurts character is proposing the new form of A.I.) is similar to such prologues from Paths of Glory and The Shining. A scene where no action occurs, but the ideas presented are what draws the viewer into the story line.I thought the first Act was amazing. Kubrick's adult content shows through Speilberg's childish method of filming and scriptwriting. Unfortunately, there wasn't any credibility or coherency for the rest of the film. When Davie reaches &quot;The End of the World&quot;, where does Gigolo Joe, and Teddy go? Then William Hurts character arrives (for no good narrative reason) only to disappear for no reason. Then Gigolo Joe returns. Where the hell has he been?  Was he off exploring for himself? More importantly what was Gigolo Joe's purpose for this film? What's the purpose of having a &quot;love&quot; bot in this film? Couldn't it have been any other type of robot? Speilberg's script offers no answers for these questions. Obviously, Stanley Kubrick wanted a robot that was programmed to love gets attached to a robot that programmed to &quot;love&quot;. This use of the word &quot;love&quot; would create questions like &quot;what is love, co-dependency, lust, and selfishness&quot;. A.I. starts these ideas, but it never finishes them.The end of Act three would have been a good place to end the movie. Instead we had to endure the forth Act.  Most movies don't have a forth act. Coincidentally, 2001: A Space Odyssey does. Was Spielberg trying to achieve the same type of ending as 2001? They are similar in that both movies go on a journey only to come back to a familiar place.  (This is also what Carl Sagan's Contact did) I suppose there is a possibility that a forth act could have worked, but this one didn't. Without going into too much detail, but the ending had no credibility, it dragged on, it was superficial, and it served no narrative purpose other than to give a happy ending. And why do these beings have the capability to bring back the mom for 24 hours, but not more time? Why just 24 hours? Does that make any sense to anyone out there? These super-beings also reminded me of Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park. Teddy says: &quot;I have a piece of Mommy's hair&quot; and the super-being should have said: &quot;BINGO! Instant Mommy DNA!&quot; Perhaps then they could have opened HUMAN PARK and then the movie could have truly dragged on forever torturing us all.Finally, If someone could bring Stanley Kubrick back for 24 hours, would he watch A.I. and be happy?	2.0	If we resurected Stanley Kubrick, would he like it?	2002-03-21	6	2	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ABX7SEE84DMLU	John P Bernat	"Stanley Kubrick fretted and fussed over this project until he died.  Steven Spielberg picks it up (at no small cost) as a tribute to Kubrick, bringing along a lot of his friends (notably John Williams) for the ride.Speilberg implies, in the special features, that being true to Kubrick's creative intentions was almost more important than commercial success.  Well, he was right about at least one of those things, if not both.Myself, I loved this film.  But perhaps for a different reason than most might have.It is, ultimately, a movie about human vanity.  As exemplified by the William Hurt character, our highest aspiration is to use our knowledge and technology to become God.  A godlike power is to create life, and that is what we will do.  Kubrick wanted us to meditate on the sheer vanity behind that aspiration.I don't know about the other parts of the movie, but one scene contains an absolutely brilliant set piece which fuses these elements fantastically.  As AI searches for his mother, he and Joe drive across a phallic bridge into the stylized mouth of a seductive woman in a spermlike car.  And Williams, who usually disguises his frequent theft of classical music themes a little more, blatantly uses a great passage from ""der Rosenkavalier.""  This is a satiric opera which is all about how goofy people can be when they try to manipulate others for their own perceived sense of control.I cannot help but watch this scene and say that Speilberg paid off his pal Kubrick, and with interest.And then, like with ""2001,"" we see where mankind can actually attain this desire for godlike power, this time by creating a non-bio-degradable perfect life form which has what so few humans can attain:  unlimited battery life and endless selflessness.Both of these, together, earn immortality."	4.0	What Fools These Mortals Be	2005-07-03	7	4	3

Teddy also gives off a great performance as a &quot;supertoy.&quot;I waited and waited for the A.I. dvd to be released, and I still have to wait a few more months for this great film to be playing in my dvd player.I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to go on a visual ride with a incredible sad, but happy story.	5.0	A.I.

Is one of my all time favorite films and is noted for beingquite visually spectacular.  Watching on a 1080 back lit led tv and blu Ray player, I was confused at times ..as it seemed that it might not even be a blu Ray transfer....very grainy, lacking the definition, color clarity, intensity and depth that a good transfer should possess.  Also Amazon the reviews posted here Do not pertain to the blu Ray version and that is very misleading!	2.0	Love this movie, but the blu Ray transfer is poor!	2011-06-29	6	5	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ARU5HHCSM5SAQ	Jonathan McKie	The pairing of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg could be considered the cinematic equivalent of Ludwig van Beethoven and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composing a symphony together.For more than thirty years, the late Stanley Kubrick had been planning to bring Brian Aldiss' short story, Super Toys Last All Summer Long, to the screen.Kubrick titled the story A.I., for Artificial Intelligence.In early 2000, after a two year hiatus, Steven Spielberg announced that he would tackle A.I.. Kubrick's widow and bother-in-law, producer Jan Harlan, gave to Spielberg, the ninety-page treatment that Kubrick had written with Ian Watson. Spielberg then set out to write his solo first screenplay since 1977's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind - he had co-written 1982's Poltergeist. By mid 2000, Spielberg was ready to go. He had cast Halley Joel Osment and Jude Law in the lead roles, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt and Sam Robards in supporting. Enlisted the talents of special effects masters Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The outcome is something that words cannot completely define.A.I. begins with a family who's son has been seriously injured. The mother, Monica (O'Connor), believing that her son will one day be able to come home to her, never loses faith. The father, Henry (Robards), is more of a realists. It's due to this circumstance that leads to the company, Cybertronics - where Henry works - selecting Monica and Henry to take part in an experiment, if you will. The company - who specialise in the building of Mechas (androids built for the purpose of serving humans) - have built the first child Mecha. A Mecha with the ability to love. Henry agrees to take the `child' into the family home, but Monica refutes.The `child', David (Osment), takes to his new `family' fairly well. Though his affection is all for Monica and not for Henry.As time goes on, Monica's affection for David grows, and she decides to `imprint' herself on David. By speaking a variety of carefully selected words, David will begin to love. He recognises Monica as his `mummy', and Monica now has her loving `son'.All is soon to change as Monica and Henry's real son miraculously recovers from his injuries.Their real son, Martin, still very frail after his injuries, begins to worry Henry. Believing that David might pose a threat to his son and to his family, suggests that returning him to the company might be in their best interests. But Monica knows that if David is returned to Cybertronics, then he will be destroyed.After David accidentally harms Martin, Monica decides that taking David back is the best option. But her `motherly-love' kicks in.She abandons David in the woods - I must stress that this is one of the films most powerful and emotional scenes. David, believing that his `mummy' will only love him if he becomes a real boy like in the story Pinocchio, vows that he will return a real boy.The second act introduces us to one of the films most colourful characters: Gigolo Joe.Joe is a Love-Mecha (played to perfection be Jude Law), who's purpose is to satisfy humans rather than serve them. He is framed for murder, and then has to leave town.He is exiled to the woods were he meets David. Together, they are hounded by the Flesh Fair. The Flesh Fair is a spectators story, where humans cheer as old Mechas are destroyed. It is difficult to describe. The only way that I could is to say that it is an amalgamation of the Krakow liquidation in Schindler's List and the orgy scene in Eyes Wide Shut. It is at the Flesh Fair that David is discovered by humans, and due to his uniqueness, is allowed to go. With Joe.David tells Joe of his plan to become a real boy. He must find the Blue Fairy, and then his `mummy' will love him.Their journey takes them to Rouge City. A neon-soaked Las Vegas gone mad. Joe suggests that to find the Blue Fairy, they must ask Dr. Know (voiced by Robin Williams). Dr. Know's answers take them to Manhattan. Submerged by the melting of the ice-caps, this is a flawless vision of a drowned utopia. From here, David's journey will take him to the ends of the earth. And to an ending that will baffle, infuriate, and inspire.Like all Stanley Kubrick films, A.I. is filled with coldness. It would have been interesting to have seen Kubrick's version. The character of David for instance, is not real, so how can we invest our emotions in something that is not real? Osment's performance for a start. He is a revelation from start to finish. Giving the kind a performance, that for a child actor, seems almost impossible. Jude Law hold the screen with Osment in a way that none of the other actors can. O'Connor is very affecting, but because all of her scenes involve Osment, it becomes very difficult for her to hold the screen.That said, this is a Spielberg film through and through. From the breathtaking visual effects to the over sentimental ending.A.I. is the finest example to date of using special effects in film. One of the films most stunning effects happen in the first five minuets. Actors run around with their faces halved in two and jaws slashed open. Key moments that must be seen to be believed are David after eating the spinach and the afore-mentioned submerged Manhattan.To round things up; A.I. refuses to be rushed. It takes its time and tells one of the most mesmerising, and original stories to come out of Hollywood in a long time.In many years to come, A.I. will follow in the footsteps of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey: it will become a classic. As of now, it is merely a modern masterpiece.	5.0	The Greatest Film of the Year	2001-10-18	16	13	3

It is in some respects an extension and a repudiation of all Spielberg's done before, and shows a refreshing willinglness to challenge his audience instead of manipulate or coddle them.  One thing's for sure: Spielberg has regained some of the visionary prowess he had shown in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;; apt comparisons will be made to &quot;Things To Come&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;  I urge all of you (as if you needed urging) to see this masterpiece on the big screen.	4.0	A leap forward for both Spielberg and cinema	2001-07-02	1	1	0

AN ARTIFICIAL BOY WHO HAS BEEN PROGRAMED TO LOVE AND FEEL PAIN LIKE A HUMAN CHILD, AND SOON REALIZES THAT HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN BETTER OFF HAD BE NOT BEEN PROGRAMED TO FEEL EMOTION.  MANY REVIEWERS FEEL THAT THE FUTURISTIC RE-TELLING OF PINOCHHIO HAS MABEY WENT JUST A LITTLE TO FAR.  WELL!  IT DOES AND IT DOSEN'T.  FIRST LETS BREAK THE FILM DOWN.  THE STORY IS ABSOLUTE GENIUS.  A LITTLE ROBOT BOY WHO WAS MADE TO FEEL EMOTION AND PAIN, FINDS THAT HOSTILE PEOPLE INCLUDEING HIS ADOPTING MOTHER AND FATHER FEEL MORE HATE THAN LOVE.  WHY WOULD HIS MOTHER AND FATHER BE HOSTILE?  WELL THEIR NATURAL SON RETURNS HOME FROM CRYO-SLEEP, AND SIMPLY PUT, THEIR NATURAL SON, DOSEN'T TAKE TO DAVID (OSMENT) AS THEY HAD HOPED.  SECOND HAVEN'T WE BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH ""BLADE RUNNER"".

MABEY BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT HE IS A ROBOT AND JUST AN INNOCENT IN A EVIL WORLD.  A INNOCENT WHO WANTS TO BE LOVED AND INTURN LOVE AS WELL.

Sadly, we were all disappointed as we watched a movie with very cold characters.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AD9WTAOAFUZA4	"Jose R. Perez ""Jose"""	"I agree that this is one of Spielberg and Kubrick's more original and thought provoking films.  Both directors are genius when it comes to etching memorable one-of-a-kind characters who represent the audience's psyches at one and the same time.  The robotic boy here is chillingly played by Osment, who is brilliant in a role far more complex and varied than his Oscar nominated turn in ""The Sixth Sense.""  In Haley Joel, the director finds his muse, and allows the film's bizarre triangle narrative take its course.  We see the film in part through the child's eye, one of Speilberg's specialities, and like ""Empire of the Sun"" (one of the director's true masterpieces) we are enveloped in his cravings.  Osment makes the character even more human than his truly human counterpart, and his scenes with his mother are gripping.  They can haunt even the hardest soul among us but only because Osment is at the top of his game here.  Any other young actor might have given into the temptation to camp this part up, but like Christian Bale in ""Empire"" Osment uses his eerie man-child gaze and facial affectations to convey all the tenderness and unmitigated desire that makes a child's energy so special.  There are harrowing moments in AI where I had to look away (most likely Kubrick's main plot) but these too add to the plot and move the story along.  Perhaps even more chilling than Osment's singular standout performance is the film's final vision, of an underwater New York City, post-September 11th, but also intact, swallowed by an ocean.  The whole film is a testament to the power of the medium - it rises up and grabs us, forces us to contemplate real recurring themes (here - lost innocence, freedom, and the obvious mother-son dynamic) and never lets go.  To be sure, at times, the movie plods and pokes along - a minstrel show of horrors that are painful to witness but essential to the vision.  Give AI a rent at least and let yourself go with it....it will NOT relax you, but instead transport you somewhere far far away.  See it for Osment, who deserves Oscar notice, but is unlikely to get it (a shame, for he's stunning here!)"	4.0	If You Let It, A.I. will KNOCK YOU OUT	2002-02-04	0	0	0

The acting/music/production are good, but it is just plain a poorly told story.  The movie introduces characters too late in the film to get to know them and leaves too much unexplained.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	Haley Joel Osment gives an excellent performance as a robot. First as a merely advanced unit, and then as one that can truly feel emotion. Jude Law also puts in a very strong performance as a gigolo robot.The time is the future and much of the world was flooded when the ice caps melted. Resources are very low, so robots are popular because they do not consume resources. This explanation should have been left out of the film as the visually show excess after excess.Haley is a robot designed to be a loving young boy. He is tested by a family that has lost a young son to a disease that currently has him frozen awaiting a miracle cure.Slowly Haley wins over the mother to the point that she activates his imprinting routines. Suddenly he is a little boy and not an appliance. Their relationship grows.But suddenly a cure is found and Martin, the original son, returns. He does not like David (Haley). He taunts him and tries to get him in trouble. Because of this, David looks like he might be dangerous. The mother takes David out to the woods and abandons him ala Hansel and Gretel.David learns of the dark underbelly of society, first with the Flesh Fair where robots are destroyed in spectacular ways and later in many various forms. It is at the Fair that he teams up with Joe (Law).Now David becomes obsessed with the idea of the Blue Fairy who made Pinocchio into a real boy. David now has a purpose and Joe will help him.The quest leads to Man-Hattan and his original creator. There is no Blue Fairy. There is no hope. David jumps into the ocean only to be rescued by Joe just after a new hope forms. David believes that the Blue Fairy lives just under the water.David travels underwater to the remains of Coney Island where he gets trapped in front of a statue of the Blue Fairy. He is trapped for 2000 years. He is rescued by future robots who have never seen humans (who made them?). David is a robot who has interacted with humans, therefore he is important to the future robots.Now it really get silly. The new robots offer to resurrect David's mother. He agrees. Then they tell him it is only good for one day. They don't say why she can't be resurrected again. David wants her. She is resurrected, they spend a day together and David goes to sleep and has his first dream (but what of his dream to be a real boy?).I really got the feeling that this film was made because there were some new special effects techniques that Spielberg wanted to test and didn't want to wait for the right story. I never was able to grasp where the story really wanted to go. It seemed to have a very dark path for most of the film with all desires and dreams being squashed.The ending made no real sense and the idea that David would now go one for untold thousands of years more without love was never dealt with or even brought up. I really do not recommend this one for any reason other than the strength of the acting.	2.0	When supperb acting meets sub-standard plot	2003-06-09	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AVMN3EWFHVHKJ	Jo-Ski	For excellent analyses and synopses of this film, please see the so many other wonderful reviews of this film written by Amazon reviewers. I echo the many reviews that commend this film for its intriguing plot, marvelous acting, and awesome special effects, but most of all, for its incredible HEART. Yes, no question that the film has many dark aspects to it, and it's probably a good thing that I saw this film for the first time on TV tonight, rather than at the theatre, because I was moved to tears throughout much of the film. I'm going to buy the DVD through Amazon.In the end, the extraordinary insight that I took away from this film was that the experience of loving and of being loved, EVEN IF FOR JUST FOR ONE DAY--whether it be love between yourself and a beloved parent, child, or relative; a beloved pet; a beloved life partner; or a beloved friend--THAT ONE DAY MAKES YOUR LIFE WORTH LIVING. Most of us are so blessed and lucky with more than that one special day with our beloved ones, but this beautiful film perhaps will make you hark back to a certain illuminated or heightened day you experienced that kind of love in your own life and make you realize all you have to be so thankful for in this life.	4.0	The One Day in Your Life That Makes Your Life Worth Living	2007-07-21	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A19K46GITRI5Y2	Joyce	It is said that good art is that which allows you to experience your own experience.  By that criteria, this film was an excellent work of art for me.  As I sat through the film I went from interest, to becoming engrossed, to thinking it was weird, to feeling deeply sad.  As I reflected on the story, David (the mechanical android) represented for me modern humanity's children, so in a sense all of humanity.  At some juncture, we humans began treating our children as androids, using them to fulfill our own needs, and lost a sense of truly loving them.  David is programmed to love, and his search for love and protection in a harsh world is poignant.  When the vulnerable, misunderstood, long-suffering David becomes violent, I thought of Columbine and the many such events since then.  Though I sometimes find director Spielberg sentimental, I don't agree with many critics about the &#34;soft&#34; ending of A.I.  To me it meant that one day of love, one experience of being truly loved, is remarkably healing, easing the restless place inside a person, and is desperately needed by every human being.	5.0	A moving film	2013-11-14	4	4	0

Parker ""Ricardo Parker"""	"Somehow I missed this movie and it wasn't until a woman I met (who works on robots in a University Research Department in Seattle) recommended it to me after I told her about Bladerunner (another masterpiece Sci-Fi).A.I. immediately became one of my favorite movies. The movie is so rich and packed with deep philosophical questions on topics such as love, dreams, happiness, etc. The acting is phenomenal. It's one of those movies where you would not want to see any character replaced because you fell in love with them and each character became so ""real"". The movie just kept developing and getting better. A.I. is definitely well underrated.A.I. appeals to human emotions in a very special way. I was moved many times throughout this movie. It opens up doors to the reality of life and human nature. Jude Law as Joe and Haley Joel Osment as David (both robots) are unforgettable, and the dialogs they have are powerful. David argues for the innocent side of human nature that chooses to ignore reality and pursue a dream that is a pure fairy tale. Gigolo Joe fires back with a reality check in an effort to win David to his cause, perhaps with the hope have David alongside fighting for their own survival (the survival of robots) against humanity who is trying to destroy the ""artificial beings"".David ends up saying ""goodbye Joe"" with an acting that demonstrates his understanding of what is happening and yet his choice to go pursue his dream which subconsciously he knows cannot be attained. So many of us can relate to this. Perhaps David knows that if he does not pursue his dream he has no reason to go on living. He is not motivated to fight the humans as Joe is because he was programmed to love his mother, so that is what he does. We humans are also programmed to do certain things and follow our dreams, as articulated in a dialog later in the movie by Prof. Hobby, who created David.So David goes on pursuing his dream even though logic demonstrates that he cannot attain it. Or maybe he can? Maybe anything is possible? Maybe the realization of our dreams are not exactly how we imagine it to be? This is a powerful way that carries the movie to the end. David, who is a robot, still functions after 2,000 years have passed and when ""revived"" by the more advanced Robots that survived the ice-age, is still trying to become human or a ""real boy"", so he can win the love of his mother. This finally happens in a brilliant and unexpected way. He gets to spend a day with his mother, just him and her, in scenes that are very moving. This could be interpreted as a dream fabricated by the collective input of all the advanced robots that are present creating this ""matrix world"" based on information that was stored in David's ""mind"" from when he lived in the house with his parents. This day with his mother could be interpreted as a dream, but isn't life itself a dream? I think that ultimately we know that our lives are nothing but a dream, and yet we choose to think that it is real just as David did with his mother, for the pure enjoyment of those rare momemnts. When we realize how precious each moment of our life is, that is when we can truly enjoy each moment. That is when we are awake as opposed to unconscious (a paradox here). This is truly not a movie written for the entertainment of the masses, and perhaps that is why it has not gotten enormous appeal. Many aspects of the movie are unpleasant and hard to swallow, such as Manhattan covered by seawater due to global warming. This is not a typical Hollywood movie with the formula of happy ending that makes everyone feel good at the end.Stanley Kubrick may be gone, but his work still lives. Steven Spielberg is still alive and many of us hope that he will continue to create movies like this that gets the viewer thinking and perhaps transformed, instead of the typical formula that works to entertain the masses and earn money in the box office. Stanley Kubrick may be gogne, but his spirit still lives through his work and the masterpieces he's created. I have yet to wath 2001 Space Odyssey, but other powerful movies such as Dr. Strangelove and even Full Metal Jacket are cult classics. A.I. is another example of the precious gifts we would get if Kubrick were still alive and making movies.I recommend A.I. to anyone who enjoys philosophical topics, anyone who wants to expand his or her mind, anyone who likes to look at human life in the big scheme of things, and what could happen not just in our lifetime but in 2,000 years or more.

Shaw	Just returned from a viewing of Artificial Intelligence and,without any doubt, my High School English Teacher's Mind will be in overdrive half of the night trying to piece together what I see as both a compendium of science fiction themes as well as a clear filmaker's tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick.Loosely metaphoric to the tale of Pinocchio, the movie flies in the face of cliche in order to extend the typical Mary Shelley /Karel Capek message that man does not belong in a godlike mode.  Humans have the ability to fashion many elements, but are not sanctioned to successfully play the human creator.  Professor Hobby (William Hurt), as robotic developer, attempts to create life with an ulterior motive, and it is exactly that selfish purpose which ultimately hurts the character of David (Haley Joe Osment) and those who have become close to him.  Some may see this film as a successful quest for lost feelings.  The more realistic view is a darker one;  there are places where man does not belong.Moreover, this is certainly in line with what appears to be a tribute, by Speilberg, to the most pessimistic of filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick. Originally conceived by Kubrick as a statement about life and what it has become, Speilberg, albeit with a number of tender moments, has taken the handoff and run toward a blacker, more humanly desolate zone -- one which is more in line with Kubrick's bleak view of human reaction.  The filmic techniques and thematic suggestions add to the director's tribute to S.K:  garish backlighting, Fellini-esque facial horror, the scourge of war, and the notion that our evolved, twisted use of sex is, indeed, man's fatal bite of the forbidden fruit.Overall, it's a commendable film.  It is notable in that (for once) astounding special effects take third, strong performances a second, and a thought-provoking storyline a first place in any thinking man's analysis.	4.0	Tribute to a Mystic	2001-07-01	13	13	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AEA0EE6SDAGZ0	Juan Antonio Vega	The film is great, you either hate it or love it. But anyway you are going to end up thinking about the implications of Artificial Intelligence, no matter how old you are. My 8 years-old daughter loved the film and kept thinking about it even days after she watched the film. But if you are looking for just entertainment and special effects, you are going to be disappointed. It is much better if you think about the movie as Art or Poetry. It is Spielberg's interpretation of a great master: Kubrick (no, it's not Pinocchio). Kubrick's films are not easy to watch, they demand viewers to think and use their brains, and Spielberg succeeds achieving precisely that in a way even a child can do it.But the REAL story is at the end of the movie. Hans Moravec's &quot;Mind Children&quot; poses the same idea, the next evolutionary step of humankind will be the creation of robots. They will survive humankind, and they will be our best ambassadors to future (alien?) civilizations. I don't think this is a pessimistic view of humankind, this is a very optimistic view where humankind reinvent itself in a way we can last eternally. And I want to emphasize the REAL part of the story. Just think about it... considering the huge distances we'll need to travel to find an extraterrestrial civilization (in case they do exist), who has a better chance of making contact: Humans or Robots? It's not science fiction, it's the future.	5.0	Spielberg-Kubrick-Moravec	2001-08-17	6	4	2

A lot of people say that they hated it but a lot of Americans are stupid and close-minded. They want everything given to them on a silver platter.

Artificial Intelligence is the story of a robot boy named David who loves his human mother so much that he wants to be turned into a human boy like Pinocchio.  Both Haley Joel Osment (David) and Jude Law (Gigolo Joe) gave excellent performances. It's not their fault that the story was not worth the work that they put into their roles. The other character that I should mention was ""Teddy"" a robot bear who seemed smarter and more compassionate than the humans in the story.

Why didn't it just end with the helicopter at the bottom of the ocean. How long will he last down there, alone, afraid? That would've summed it up nicely, but no, Steve has to put the whip cream on top, add some cherries, and then some caramel sauce, and then some nuts, and then more cherries, and so on.

What I got was a flick with too many different plots all trying to be intertwined. While I didn't find this movie hard to follow at all. I did find it hard to really feel any of the story, since it seemed to be going in so many directions. I also didn't like the slow pace of the movie, maybe worst of all. It was simply too long! It could have ended 45 minutes eairler, had they just cut some of the weird sub-plots out. Haley does a very good job as the robotic boy who wants to be able to feel. An interesting fact I heard about him. All on his own, Haley decided not to blink durring any of his scenes. Because this would make him appear more more like a real robot. It might not seem like anything, but if you think about it, I at least, found that to be quite amazing. What made him think of such a thing? I definitely didn't notice this while I watched it, but I wasn't looking for it either. It might make it worth re-watching just to see this strange, but cool feat. One of the highlights here was without a doubt his robotic teddy bear ""Teddy"" I know it was nothing but a computer generated character, but the way it moved, talked and acted was darn cool. It had me wondering when our world will see such an advanced toy :)Overall I slightly enjoyed the movie, but it just never came together like I had hoped.

My own experience have been opinions that are not so good.Yes, it is long.  Yes, it is (at times) tedious.  It's also a beautiful visual experience, a fairy tale, and a movie that sticks with you.Osment is perfect here-- the odd combination of robotic and human as the role requires.  Jude Law is a hoot-- a character you hate for his seediness but enjoy for his humanity (though he too is a robot).The story is not an uplifting one, but challenges the mind.  In a manner similar to ""Sling Blade"" we see how society's normalcy is often anything but, and the seemingly lesser individuals in society are left to expose its shortcomings in their fates.I suppose a lot of people could draw different lessons and different interpretations from this movie.  I tried not to think about what it was attempting to say too much and instead took it in as a futuristic fairy tale, albeit a dark one.  To this end, it succeeds.  You're haunted by the Osment's character and genuinely desire success for him on his journey.  The ending delivers-- successfully in my opinion-- a somewhat satisfactory conclusion without alienating the audience with one that is too sappy and unreasonable."	3.0	It's a love/hate thing	2003-08-28	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AT558HXUXSQ8W	kamus	"The critics didn't seem to like this one and I'm not sure why: it's an updated re-telling of ""Pinnochio"" and is the fruit of the collaboration between two cinema giants, Kubrick and Spielberg. Both influences are readily apparent and that means there is a lot that's right and wonderful about this film. Perhaps the critics were expecting a massive blockbuster from these two titans, but the truth is, in a way, it's really a ""small"" film- not a combination of ""Star Wars"" and ""2001"" as the critics may have drooled for.Under the glossy surface it's the simple story of a boy searching for his mother's love. Sure he's an android and it's set in a nightmarish hi-tek world but in the end it's just a magical fairy tale. As a movie it works on lot of levels- all the ingredients are there: Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance (actually, all the performances are quite good), amazing sets, costumes, special effects and a haunting score by John Wlliams. There are striking imaginative touches throughout this film and in virtually every production aspect.Some argue that the movie should have ended at an earlier point  than it does (to say more would be to give something away-you'll know what I mean when you see it) and  true, it would probably have been a satisfying if deeply poignant way to end the film, but it would have deprived us of  Speilberg's fascinating coda and the emotional release that we all secretly (or not so secretly) wish for throughout  the film. Is it a little too precious an ending? Maybe, but remember it's *just* a fairy tale. A thought provoking fairy tale, yes but to see it as trying to be much more than that does a disservice to this fine film and to Speilberg, Kubrick and ""Pinnochio"" as well.

Not the run of the mill Sci Fi with huge special effects (such as Phantom Menace); nor is it a pure futuristic adrenaline pumping (such as Blade Runner). It's more like a fairy tale with moral implication; and &quot;hope&quot; as the final word on humanity (such as &quot;there is always hope&quot;...&quot;Hope never dies&quot; and so forth).As is peppered throughout the film and also in reviews - this is a high class Pinocchio. But since this is not a fairy tale the Blue Fairy can't just make our Haley Joel Osment into a real boy....or can she?.... there's always hope.Definitely a number of moral issues come up, and it is very much a thinking film and emotions run high. Knots form in the throat (some women were crying in the theatre).The premise is very simple - a robot is created which is capable to love, but circumstances make it such that it is left like Snow White in the jungle (despite the fact that his &quot;mom&quot; loves him). He (the robot) understands that the reason for him being deserted is that he is not &quot;real.&quot; And thus begins the quest for the Blue Fairy (from the Pinocchio story book his &quot;mom&quot; has read to him) who will make him real, so that his &quot;mom&quot; will love him again.It is definitely a &quot;must see.&quot;	4.0	Thinking man's Sci Fi	2001-11-14	3	3	0

It was that good.For people who watch movies the way I do, A.I. was decked in layer upon layer of dazzling symbolism and meaning. The beauty of this film, though, is that unlike some more intellectually challenging movies, it doesn't lose its entertainment value. No matter what you're in the mood for, A.I can be appreciated on many levels, from the shallow end to the deep.The effects in A.I. are stunning, of course. But the key here is that the visuals never overpower the story, despite the fact that you may lose track of how many times you whisper &quot;wow!&quot; over some intricate visual perspective or special effect. Indeed, some of the scenes you would expect to be visually impressive, are--an underwater view of New York City, for instance. But Spielberg also brings out the dazzling in the everyday.A fairly classic example of Campbell's &quot;Hero's Journey,&quot; don't expect A.I. to be a &quot;feel-good film.&quot; It's as disturbing and tragic as it is tender and thought-provoking. It's an emotional ride, to say the least, and it keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether its outcome will be positive. (Will it be? You'll have to see the film.)Through it all, Haley Joel Osment shines like the brilliant star he is. It's hard to take your eyes off his beautiful, intelligent, expressive face. I can't imagine Osment left out of the 2001 Oscar nominations, and despite what Hollywood brings us in the months ahead, I'll be cheering for him as best actor. I honestly can't see how any performance could top his work in A.I.  He is possessed of a rare gift.See A.I.

So think 2001, or &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;Dr. Strangelove.&quot;Another part of this film, is that the idea has been so, so, so overdone recently--the idea avbout a robot becoming human.  Besides the obvious Pinnochio allusions, you have every episode with Lt. Cmdr. Data on Star Trek.  What do you think the emotion chip was all about?  This Data thing is only a reworking of the Mr. Spock thing. Then you have Bicentennial Man, which is just a 2 1/2 hour version of this same theme.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"This film was a five star science fiction experience for me. The (Full-Screen) DVD box set is an excellent transfer and includes many extras about the making of the movie. The story of Kubrick and his relationship with Spielberg is covered in some depth.The plot was originally discovered by Stanley Kubrick, who in 1984 contacted Steven Spielberg asking him to direct the movie. Although they discussed the story at great length, Spielberg did not actually work on the film until asked to by Kubrick's wife after his death.It might have been Kubrick's greatest film as he worked on the story and details of the plot obsessively for many years. Spielberg attempted to make the film a tribute to Kubrick by reproducing his visual style. It is, for better or worse, a Spielberg film. Personally, I believe the film lost out in certain areas and gained in others. I am glad that after so much of Kubrick's dedicated work the film was brought to the screen by a great film technician who tried to incorporate some of Kubrick's style. If you care about children passionately bring plenty of Kleenex. Also, a great job was done by the entire cast.I find sci-fi movies that deal in a serious way with ""conscious"" computers or autonomous robot developments especially fascinating. I have also been waiting (with considerable disappointment) for the development of AI and a fully autonomous humanoid robot. Although chess master IBM's Big Blue and HONDA's humanoid bipedal robot, ASIMO, have been two noteworthy developments, I have been waiting for at least 50 years and still continue to wait.By the way, for those of you interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), please be advised that Amazon markets a DVD box set which discusses a related subject, entitled CONSCIOUSNESS. Although consciousness and intelligence are, strictly speaking, defined as two different things, they are loosely related when applied to machines.I do have some minor questions though that may seem trivial on the surface, but why would such a well thought out film make obvious omissions like the following?David was an almost perfect duplication of a loving child, but:1) Why did the writers have him incapable of the most simple body functions which have already been provided for in modern ""doll"" technology?2) Why did the writers not have him provided the ability to eat, drink, and eliminate associated waste products?3) Why would Teddy know that ""You will break"" when David did not realize that fact when he ate?4) Why did the writers have David's facial features curl downward and become immobilized when he ate?5) Why did David's immersion in pool water also result in his becomming immobilized? He was fiber optic and would not have short circuited. Even watches are water proof.6) Why did David become so dangerous when he met Dr. Hobbie and his brother under the skin, another David unit?  He became more violent than his actual brother when he met another copy of himself, smashing his robotic brother David, with no regard for anyone but himself. This was a very ugly moment in David's behavior.Were the story consequences of the above decisions necessary for further plot development? I don't think so.I know that these details have nothing to do with the emotions evoked by the film which were wonderful, but I can't understand how such a group of talented writers who worked on the script could let these minor ""errors"" occur."	5.0	A.I. - Excellent Movie!	2008-03-23	0	0	0

The result of their collaboration - and wildly, contrasting world-views - is a mixture of the bizzare and wonderful, the divine and profane, of hope and despair. Throughout the film, these images clash and war with each other taking the viewer along for the ride. The most amazing facet of the film is that the visions of both filmmakers is realized in the course of the story. One never dominates over the other as they share the screen time and continually keep the viewer off-balance. The result is an emotional experience and a bonding to the main character - David - accomplishing the impossible: feeling and empathy for an inanimate machine.	4.0	A.I. and Dichotomy	2001-07-02	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3EEQO8MUXFINX	Kevin Courcey	"Unfortunately, this film was predestined to alienate two groups of theater-goers:  first, hard core Kubrick fans who expected his more dispassionate and harsh view to be represented; and second, those who thought it would be another cutesy Spielberg production that they could take their 10 year olds to, ala E.T.This is an adult movie with adult themes, and Kubrick fans (I count myself in that number) need to remember that Stanley desperately wanted this story told, and realized that Spielberg was the director up to the task.What this movie attempts is a close look at who we are as human beings- what drives us, how we respond to intimacy and love, the extent to which we are driven by our fears, the disposable nature of our relationships, how love can bring incredible happiness and almost unbearable pain.  These are not trivial subjects, nor ones that are necessarily comfortable to examine.  The film succeeds in this exploration primarily due to the flawless, gut-wrenchingly emotional performances of Haley Joel Osment as the mechanical child and Frances O'Connor as his adoptive mother.  The scenes in which these two fine actors appear are riveting.The middle section of the movie has David cast off into the unprotected ""real"" world where mechs are both loved (at least physically) and despised.  It is through this violent and inhuman world he must find his way back home, and he ostensibly emulates his quest based on the Pinocchio story he heard his mother read to him-he believes must become ""a real boy"" in order to reunite with his mother.  While much of this part of the film works well (the Flesh Fair, where robots are destroyed to the howling enjoyment of the crowd is very well done), it is here that the film takes a brief, and unfortunate, turn to the Wizard of Oz for its thematic elements.  Don't get me wrong- I love the Wizard of Oz.  But the parallels are so vivid that I half expected to see a signpost in the woods saying, ""I'd turn back if I were you.""  The trip into Rouge City (Oz), with Gigolo Joe (the nimble scarecrow), to see Dr. Know (the Wizard), is the movie's weakest point.  Rouge City feels too cramped (it was created on a sound stage), and is too glitzy to be believable as a red light district.  One has the feeling that Kubrick would have played it much grittier, more down and dirty with this location.That said, the film rights itself almost immediately, and the remainder of the film has beautiful, haunting images, and a very touching conclusion, as a long lost David is finally found by the only remaining inhabitants of the planet- artificial life forms like himself.  The honesty and respect the cyborgs show toward David is moving, in much the same way the cyborg Data (from Star Trek, TNG) was often used to portray the ideals of human nature more purely than his human counterparts could achieve.The film itself is visually stunning, as one would expect from a Spielberg production.  The set designs and art direction are impeccable (especially the family home which is future oriented but still comfortable and warm, and the partially submerged New York in the later part of the film is beautifully recreated by ILM); the music by John Williams adds emotional depth without being intrusive; and the robot characters are vividly and seamlessly realized.I recommend this film for its visual impact, its willingness to tackle interesting adult themes, and its outstanding performances."	5.0	An impressive, masterful production of a difficult theme	2002-05-02	9	7	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3GHB16692TYKY	Kevin Der	...I&#8217;ve seen the movie, and I thought it was excellent and inspiring, the most ambitious and challenging film ever made. Here are my reasons.The majority of viewers agree that the acting in A.I. was Oscar-rate. Haley Joel Osment&#8217;s performance as David was incredible; the level of complexity and emotion he gives to the robotic character is unparalleled. Jude Law&#8217;s character as Gigolo Joe is likewise well performed. He makes us laugh, but at the same time, adds a sadness because of his position as mentor of David, as well as his eventual and inevitable fate. In short, their acting is one reason that A.I. an incredible film.Next, the combination of Spielberg and Kubrick&#8217;s visions was likewise masterful. Spielberg is supreme when it comes to creating high levels of emotion in conflict, like in Saving Private Ryan, only in A.I. he achieves it with a young child, making all the more powerful. It is all the viewer can do not to reach out and console the suffering David. Kubrick&#8217;s additions take an appropriate turn for the darker side of this story, from David&#8217;s abandonment to the Flesh Fair horrors where the heartless crowd satisfies their sadism by seeing robots tortured and destroyed. Because of Kubrick, the audience is feeling fright and anticipation for a great deal of the film.Spielberg&#8217;s ending has received its share of controversy. Had A.I. concluded a half-hour earlier, it may have seemed appropriate, but many issues would have been unresolved. The theme of immortality, of life and love, would have remained open and unconcluded, without any realization at all. Instead, by ending this film in a unique and unexpected way, Spielberg manages to explore a great deal more about these themes. Throughout the movie, David&#8217;s love for his mother is eternal. It never wavers for one second, and it is this feeling which drives him always. On the other hand, the love others feel for him is never full, but rather, incomplete and tentative. Yet despite the lack of love from others, David maintains his own love. This concept is truly fascinating. By ending the film the way he did, Spielberg confirms that the boy&#8217;s love is eternal, even after countless years, instead of creating speculation as to whether David&#8217;s love is just like everyone else&#8217;s, that it can fade. That is the main idea of the movie, and to ignore it at the end would be artistically incorrect. Secondly, the motif of everlasting life is one which the ending similarly addresses. The mechas are built immortal, designed to last forever; this is so incredibly strange because their creators, humans, are anything but immortal &#8211; David is frightened when he is told his mother will eventually die, whereas he will last forever. Most people wish to live for all time. Yet David&#8217;s only wish is to become a real boy, flesh and blood, so that his mother will love him forever just as he loves her. In exchange, he is willing to become mortal. What an incredible and thought-provoking concept Spielberg presents us! To gain love, must one give up life? And, conversely, to gain immortality, must one give up love?These are deep questions that Spielberg raises for us, hidden within the masterpiece of a film he has made. If only people can see past the surface, they can learn a great deal. Instead of saying &#8216;That doesn&#8217;t look like how I expected or wanted,&#8217; people should look at the film as it was made, and instead of condemning it at first glance just like the rioting crowd at the Flesh Fair, they should try to absorb what Spielberg offers us.	5.0	Incredible and Inspiring Film, Here's Why:	2001-07-07	21	17	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3STFA7AA4G36G	"Kevin Fink ""finkles2000"""	"For those of you expecting a ""cute, sweet"" Speilberg movie, like E.T. or Hook, then buy them.  This is not that type of movie.  The worst thing Dreamworks ever did was market this movie as a story of a little boy robot who dreams of being real.  ""His love is real, but he is not."" Sounds cute, doesn't it?  Well, it's not.I'm sorry to disappoint fans of E.T. and Indiana Jones, but directors grow (shudder!) as persons and in their craft.  A.I. is not an incoherent mess, but a conglomerate of a story, a fable, and a moral lesson.  The story is divided into three distinct sections (any mature, smart audience member will be able to see that): 1)The beginning of David, the ""mecha,"" who is brought into a family to replace the son who is in a coma, 2) the journey of David, after he is thrown out by the family, and his desire to find The Blue Fairy who can turn him into a real boy (he had been read the story by his ""mother""), and 3) the end of David.Speilberg shows us the dark side of the future, and raises interesting moral questions.  If we can create something so life-like, can we become so attached to it that we cannot destroy it?  Is it humane to destroy these ""mechas?""  Where do we stop?  It mirrors the current debate over cloning.  For every person who creates, there must be one who destroys, and Speilberg is not afraid to show this.  This is Speilberg's darkest film to date, but it is also his most moving, in my opinion.  And it is also spotted with Kubrick's influence as well.  It is Speilberg channeling Kubrick channeling Speilberg and it pays off.While the subject matter is not inappropriate for children, it is likely that children (and, from reading some reviews, some adults) will not understand this picture.  This is one of the most intriguing, brave, intelligent, and beautiful films of the year.  The visions of New York City covered by the ocean and ice is particularly chilling.  Brilliant, just brilliant!  And the extras are a perfect companion to the film.  I simply wish A.I. had gotten the credit it deserves."	5.0	Don't belive the negative hype!!!!	2002-05-10	2	2	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3WIOO9L0DNGZ	Kevin Major	This movie, quite simply, is a poor re-telling of Pinocchio, ruined by Spielburg's inability to leave things alone.  There's an obvious break in the story, where it goes from Kubrick to Spielburg, from jagged and interesting, to formulaic and cliche (it occurs once the boy is left in the woods by his mother).  Instead of something truly thought provoking, we're left with a visually stunning (except for the ending that was tacked on), yet utterly hollow film, one that anyone that's ever taken an introductory philosophy or film class could make.	1.0	Merely artificial	2002-04-27	4	1	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A324LH8S4C8U4W	Kevin Nieman	Can we care about a robot boy who desperately tries, in a seemingly futile attempt, to be human? In this reviewer's case, the answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; Haley Joel Osment, the new boy-wonder of the acting trade, is both cute and haunting as we watch him search for the key to his mechanical hopes. Osment plays David, the first &quot;mecha,&quot; or mechanical entity, built to love unconditionally. He goes on an unexpected search for the key to his hopes and desires which takes him into the throes of danger. Along the way, David meets Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Joe is a &quot;love mecha,&quot; a sex machine programmed to please women in a multiplicity of ways. David and Joe embark on a quest for David's happiness, and it takes them through some of the most unique environments put to film. There is a bizarre &quot;anti-mecha&quot; stage show in the film that communicates the kind of arrogance humans feel for their own kind. Later on, we see Rouge City, a cross between Times Square of today, and Times Square of 30 years ago rolled into one. Then, the film takes such a radical turn that spoiling it here would do you a great disservice. Needless to say, with the combined talents of Spielberg and Kubrick, &quot;A.I.&quot; is a masterpiece of cinema, and a triumph of creative artistry.Stanley Kubrick had been trying to get this film made for a few decades. He had actually been waiting for the day when special effects technology advanced to the point where &quot;A.I.&quot; could be filmed realistically and affordably. Unfortunately, time ran out for Stanley, as he passed away the year his final film, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was released in theaters.However, in a rare show of directorial solidarity, long-time colleague and admirer, Steven Spielberg, took it upon himself to film his friend's magnum opus posthumously. What results is a film that neither of the filmmakers could have done alone. Kubrick's films often deal with a gritty and ugly reality, as well as exploring the more baser instincts of the human animal. Spielberg's films often reflect the optimistic nature of humanity, and the presence of &quot;hope&quot; is a frequent theme in many of Steven's films. Though this is a Steven Spielberg film, Kubrick is still ever-present. For example, the character &quot;Gigolo Joe&quot; seems not to be a Spielbergian influence at all. &quot;David&quot; is more like Steven's vision, as he is very much like Elliot in the film &quot;E.T.&quot;It was revealed that Kubrick had wanted Spielberg to direct this film many years ago, but that Steven refused, saying that it was a project too personal for anyone other than Stanley to complete. However, with Kubrick gone from this plain of existence, there is not another soul on the planet that knew enough about Stanley's vision than Steven Spielberg. And I am pleased to say the collaboration is a magical one.	5.0	Heart-Wrenching, Soul-Stirring; &quot;A.I.&quot; Serves Up Epic Ideas.	2001-07-01	4	3	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1WBJZ4DXQCM14	"Kirby L. Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o..."	This movie quite clearly demonstrates the two diametrically opposing views of two very different moviemakers.First Comment: This movie didn't just push the limit for a PG-13.  It broke well through that veil into the realm of &quot;R.&quot;Consider: Stanley Kubrick... Full Metal Jacket (grusome murder/suicide), A Clockwork Orange (raping and beating a woman to death with a huge ceramic penis), etc etc.  Kubrick cannot MAKE a PG-13 film, and this one is NO EXCEPTION.  This movie is NOT suitable for children - no matter how sappy a happy ending was tacked onto it.  This movie was mis-rated.  It should have been rated R for violence, gore, and strong sexual inuendo. Do kids really need to see a gigilo seducing a yound, crying, abused wife into having sex with a machine?  Do kids really need to see a city with a building in the shape of a woman's spread legs, up in the air, with neon-light fishnet stockings, and people entering and leaving through, well, you know...?  Does that sound like a PG-13?  How about &quot;virtual&quot; lap-dances?I'm not suggesting that the world may not one day bee like that, or that it's not like that already in some places.  But that doesn't mean your kids need to see it.Do not take your children to see this movie unless they are comfortable seeing &quot;people&quot; cut in half with chainsaws, shot out of cannons (on fire) into spinning chopper blades where they are sliced to bits and their heads go flying, people getting their faces burned off with acid, people tied to &quot;crosses&quot; and then pulled limb from limb, and listening to gigelos describe what they are going to &quot;do&quot; to some women when they get their hands on them.The robots are left JUST enough &quot;robitica&quot; to make it clear that they are not human, but that doesn't change the fact that someone with a kind, motherly face who has taken a small frightened boy under her care get's pulled away violently, tied to a post and has that face burned off with buckets of nitric acid.A second notion that is being passed around is that the movie &quot;really makes you think&quot; and &quot;raises some good questions about mortality and love.&quot;  Perhaps.  But these questions have all been asked by far greater philosophers and writers in far less of a vulgar way.  You will not find yourself asking any questions that Shakespeare or Nietche or Kant (or Spielberg for that matter) have not already asked of you time and again.The movie starts out as a slow, steady progression of childhood discovery and love, then takes a violent &quot;Mad-Max in the Thunderdome&quot; lurch to the side into a domain that could have been left out of the movie entirely with no impact at all on the main characters lives, or the story, or it's impact.  When it comes back from it's detour (presumably where Spielberg takes over), what's left is more &quot;slow steady progression&quot; towards a bland, not entirely unexpected finish.  The ending was, however, rather unique and every bit as sad as the little boy who by now, you already know, is lost.But the movie does move along, and the visual scenery is quite fascinating (except for the detour-to-gore).  Some points really are made very well.  Like for instance the &quot;robot hunters&quot; who travel around in a huge balloon that looks like a HUGE moon.  The result is a terror implanted in the mind of a boy: a terror of the moon.  Something usually taken as a symbol of beauty becomes a symbol of fear and terror to a small boy.  What kind of people would DO that to a young boy?  But that's the real world.  A normally happy childhood is, for some, a terror.  Who would do that?  Look around you - you probably know some of them.Worth seeing as an adult - kids should go see something else.  Jude Law does a VERY good &quot;Artful Dodger.&quot;	3.0	Long and Stunning	2001-07-24	13	10	3

First of all, the movie lacks feeling. The characters failed at making me feel anything for them and were so predictable it was torturing!!! Haley Joel Osmont tried to come across as pitiful, wanting us to feel sorry for him, but I tell you if there has ever been a character who tried TOO hard, it would be him. There is such thing as subtlety you know and by him overdramatizing as much as he did, made this film impossible for me. I couldn't care less what happened to the little robotic boy! Secondly, there were too many plotholes and prolonged scenes that made this a complete nuisance to watch at all much less at over two hours long! And that ending...well, I won't even go there; I do have some restraint. I can't help but wonder had Kubrick directed, maybe at least the bleakness would've been felt.

People started walking out of the theater after about an hour.  I stayed thinking it would have to get better.  I was wrong.AI starts with an interesting premise but quickly devolves to where it becomes laughable.  Going into a movie made by Kubrick and Spielberg I had very high hopes.  The first chip in those hopes unfortunately came in the first few seconds of the movie where a narrator explains what terrible thing we humans did to the world (AI seems to take place in the near future, perhaps 2300).None of the characters are likable or even interesting, although Gigolo Joe did provide some nice comic relief.  The mom who decides it's a good idea to drop off her ""son"" in the forest to fend for himself.  Come on!  The gratuitous wrestle-mania meets Robo-wars violence was disgraceful.  The hokey Ewok-inspired sidekick teddybear made me go ""pfffttt"" whenever he came on the screen.  The Close Encounters-inspired, all-knowing, benevolent heros at the end were like a 12-year old's school story, ""and then I woke up from a dream..."".  The Star Wars-inspired ""stay on target"" scene was just a blatant [copy cat]and I can't imagine why they bothered.  There's more characters to hate but these ones jump out from my memory.  Add to this the fact that the story is so weak and incongruous that they repeatedly have to introduce Obi-Wan like characters to explain why yet another unbelievable situation is actually plausible.  Uh, that could happen.  Really.  No Really!Even all of this would be forgivable if the actual message of the movie wasn't so awful.  ""Just keep hoping all your problems will go away and they will.""  No need to actually do anything to work toward your goals, overcome any obstacles showing your strong character, or even be subject to those silly rules rational people call the physical laws of the universe -- like gravity.  Just sit down and keep repeating, ""There's no place like home.""  I hate to even reference a wonderful movie like The Wizard of Oz.  AI is no Wizard of Oz.This is a bad movie.  Stephen Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.  At least if it were a Kubrick movie it wouldn't have a silly, cuddly, completely ridiculous ending.

The problem is, there was a natural end for the movie (if you see it you will know what I am talking about) but then it stretches on for another 1/2 hour. In the end you are left thinking, wow, that was a looooong show.  Still there are some interesting ideas here and it is probably much better than most of the summer fair.  It is a great looking show that offers more substance than most summer fare.  I cannot help compare it to the Jodie Foster version of Contact a couple years back.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"Steven Spielberg's misunderstood Sci Fi masterpiece is one of the director's most ambitious projects and one of his most amazing films. Taken from the Brian Aldiss short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"", A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was originally a project for legendary director Stanley Kubrick to direct. Most Sci Fi fans and Kubrick devotees wanted to see Kubrick direct the film, as it is perfectly aligned to his other films, notably 2001: A Space Odyssey.But with Kubrick's passing, the only director on the planet capable of taking on the colossal project was Mr. Spielberg.The elaborated story taken from Aldiss tale is about a robot (Or ""Mecha"") child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is programmed to love. But when his adoptive parents find themselves at a loss of what to do when their real son recovers from a coma, David is abandoned into the world with the supertoy ""Teddy"". David's journey takes him to the violent, nihilistic Flesh Fair where he meets the smooth-talking Gigolo Joe, played brilliantly by Jude Law (Gattaca, Existenz). From there they travel to the futuristic Rouge City, accompanied by the waltz from Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss and begin their epic journey to find the Blue Fairy. John Williams' etheral score for the film is perhaps not as meorable as his most famous work, but it still moves the film forward emotionally.The jarring switches from futuristic suburbia to the mecha-hating world may not sit well with some viewers, and the ending, admittedly is overly-sentimental. But it is a compelling story, and one that's a must-see on the big screen.Despite the combined brilliance of the main actors, Spielberg's masterful direction and touching homages to Kubrick, the film was a commercial failure and critics were apparently put off with the film's sentimentality (Hence the shameful Academy snubs). Whether American audiences found the film too cerebral in comparison to brainless Hollywood rubbish, or the cryptic marketing campaign of posters and trailers backfired or whether people were expecting an E.T-like tale of a heart-warming adventure (And were disappointed), is debatable. But the fact remains it is a brilliant film and a must-have for Spielberg fans.One of the more impressive Spielberg DVDs, this 2 Disc Collector's Edition is lacking a Director's Commentary (Spielberg apparently likes the audience to have their own opinion) and hours of reported deleted scenes, but it makes up for it with the doco on the first disc ""Making A.I"", directed by prolific documentarian Laurent Bouzerau. Included on disc 2 are a series of featurettes with Spielberg talking about developing the vision of A.I. Industrial Light and Magic group on the film's special effects and Stan Winston explains how the robots were created. There's also a featurette on the sound effects and orchestral score for the film, several theatrical trailers and production design photos.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A26RCSP8O50TIJ	"K. Schwarting ""rivkah12"""	By now, most of us are familiar with the plot of &quot;A.I.&quot;--which has been plummeting down the box-office charts since its release a few weeks ago.Haley Joel Osment plays a boy--or, rather a robot that looks exactly like a human boy--who is capable of love after an &quot;imprinting protocol&quot; takes place that allows him to focus his love on particular adults.  He is adopted by the Swintons, who at first are skeptical (their own biological son has been cryogenically frozen, waiting for a cure to his own illness).  It is a tense moment when Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;) does imprint and become his mother, for you know that nothing good can come of it.This is the first third of the movie, and I was with the movie through this section.  Much criticism has been leveled at O'Connor for not being particularly maternal, but I think that the acting and scripting is relatively sound in this section.  In the second third of the movie, the boy/robot is dumped in the woods and forced to fend for himself.  He narrowly avoids torture at a &quot;flesh fair&quot;, where humans take out their aggression toward robots by torturing and &quot;killing&quot; them.  He also meets &quot;Gigolo Joe&quot;, a robot gigolo played with utter conviction and suaveness by Jude Law.  Throughout this section, the boy tries to figure out how to become human so Monica can truly love him and take him back in.About 45 minutes before the end of this 2 1/2 hour movie, the film comes to a good conclusion--the boy/robot finds out that he never actually CAN become human, and his illusions seem shattered.  It is a fitting, Kubrickian ending.And here's where the film goes very wrong--it goes on for yet another 45 minutes, ending with a jarring and false (and very Spielberg) happy ending.THis is an intriguing film in some ways.  There was much to enjoy in the first two sections of it, but the ending brings the rating way down.  Although Spielberg is undeniably talented, I very much doubt that this was the film that Kubrick intended.  If you are not expecting a dark, Kubrickian film, however, you will likely enjoy it more than I did.	3.0	A mishmash of Spielberg and Kubrick	2001-07-16	2	2	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AKK2EBNBV18HF	"""kurt03"""	This movie evokes memories of &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; for me. Not because of the movie itself, but because of the response. You will love this movie and think it brings up profound and important questions, or you will think it is a boring piece of garbage.The movie takes place in the future where andriods are a normal part of daily life, when it is suggested that a robot be built that can love. Twenty months later, David comes along, and is given to a family -whose son is in a coma- for a tryout. They decide to keep him, but after some complications arise, David is separated from his family and begins his quest to become a real boy.The movie then morphs into a kind of &quot;Pinnochio&quot; meets &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. There are some slow passages, but they are forgivable because of the excellence of almost everything else. The acting by Osment is Oscar-worthy, and the rest of the actors, especially Jude Law, are great as well. The direction is, of course, great, as well as the art direction.This is a hybrid of both Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick and it shows, that is the main flaw. It would be great, but these are (were)two vastly different filmmakers. The film is too warm and sentimental for Kubrick, but too detatched and icy for Speilberg, so it never really takes you as far as it wants to. The other problem I had with it was the ending. I won't ruin it for you, but there is a false ending that would have been perfect if they stopped there(you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). It would have been sad, but not depressing, and haunting. But no, the movie goes on for another 20 minutes, although that ending isn't horrible, it goes in the opposite direction as everything that came before it.See this movie, you might think it's great, you might not, but it is definately something that you should expeirience for yourself.	4.0	Despite it's flaws, it shouldn't be missed.

I love Spielberg, too. So, now that Kubrick's long-awaited, final vision is out for all to see, let the games begin!No review is under 1,000 words or less is going to capture the depth and substance of A.I. Of course, I could say something cliche like 'love conquers all' or character development blah blah blah, but I would only be covering half the picture that is A.I. A.I.'s central theme is love. But like any good Kubrick movie, it's about being human and good and evil. And like any good Spielberg movie, it has big name actors, blazin THX, and fantastic special effects.It's easy to see why critics and audiences alike would be baffled and bewildered by the most high-profile colaboration between two of the greatest filmmakers of all time. There's equal dashes and sprinkles of Kubrick and Spielberg that confound A.I. But that didn't mean A.I. scored big, or will go down easy.Like Kubrick's other projects, A.I.'s themes are true of us all, and deserve to be recognized, realized, and discussed. Maybe not now, but sometime in the future, critics and audiences alike will realize what a powerful movie A.I. really is. It's a movie that's sadly overlooked. So it wasn't exactly the smash bang Spielbergian epic audiences were expecting, or the fact that Kubrick wasn't even alive to see its production, or A.I. wasn't the intricet, perfectionist Kubrickian movie critics awaited. But this doesn't mean that A.I. isn't a testament of love, and our own quest for existence and meaning, and above all masterful story as told by the best in the business.	4.0	'A.I.' only slightly flawed, but masterful Kubrick/Spielberg	2001-08-15	5	4	1

Is a world like this possible? This movie presents both in a thoughtful, enjoyable way.This movie touched me in a way that only a few other movies and books ever have.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A4E7GD5DPTAAL	Lawrence Miller	AI begins as science fiction. Decays into sci-fi. Then into fantasy. Steven Spielberg is often considered America's greatest filmmaker but this one should have stayed in his private stash.I've been reading about mature screenwriting with dialogue as subtext for what people really think, as against what they say. AI fails in that regard throughout: all dialogue is surface, &quot;on the nose,&quot; as Hollywood calls it. One-dimensional dialogue. Spielberg, if he read this in someone else's script, would call it amateurish.One criticism I read is that the movie sentimentalizes Stanley Kubrick's concept for it. Yet I find it devoid of emotion. Cold.The effects are exceptional but, perhaps, should remain in the mind of science-fiction readers, rather than be concretized as they are here. As to the title, the parents, the scientists, are not intelligent, nor is the robot. And the actors all do a poor job, Haley Joel Osment, the boy,  being allowed only to stare and display longing.However, if you must see it, the Flesh Fair is a powerful idea.	2.0	Artificial stupidity	2001-07-14	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1L43KWWR05PCS	Lawyeraau	"This is a film that is both entertaining and thought provoking. It raises some questions about concepts and emotions that human beings sometimes take for granted. It is also a spinoff of the fairy tale ""Pinocchio"", with William Hurt as ""Geppetto"" and Haley Joel Osment as the sci-fi version of ""Pinocchio"".Haley Joel Osment, as the mechanical creation, ""David"", who just wants to be a real boy, gives the performance of a lifetime. If he does not get an Oscar for his performance, then I do not know what the standards are. Suffice to say, he is nothing short of sublime in the starring role. He is, without a doubt, one of the best child actors of all time.Jude Law, as ""Gigolo Joe"", a mechanical love machine expressly created for the purpose of servicing the carnal desires of women, gives a riveting performance, as well. While he is great in the role, he is, as is everyone else in the film, totally upstaged by his pint-sized co-star, Haley Joel Osment.The movie takes place sometime in the future, when human look alike robots, nicknamed ""Mechas"", assist humans in their every day lives. They are very realistic, but stop short of feeling or demonstrating real emotion. They are merely mechanical creations, made to service humans, and all are made to adult scale.William Hurt, as a hot shot engineer with Cybertronics, a firm that makes ""Mechas"", decides to improve upon this further, by creating a ""Mecha"" child who will be able to love back, thus filling a market need. Shortly thereafter, ""David"" is created and placed with a family who has a son who is appears to be comatose and terminally ill.Initially, all goes well, and his ""mother"" grows to love David, setting into play a sequence of events that will have impact on the entire family, including David, who loves his ""mother"" unconditionally. When her biological son, Martin, miraculously recovers from his illness and returns home, things at home start to change for David, as issues of territoriality and jealousy arise.Though under pressure from her husband, David's ""mother"" finds herself unable to do what she is contractually mandated to do, should she wish to free herself of David. Instead, she abandons him in the woods with some cautionary, tearful advice. This sets David off on a fairy tale quest that, no matter what the setbacks, will always be singular in scope. He wants to find his mother, whom he loves, and return to the place he perceives to be his home.What happens to David along his singleminded journey is certainly disturbing, and always thought provoking. His quest will expose him to the underbelly of life, and take him on a journey that is the stuff of dreams and, at times, nightmares. It is a story of hope and, at times, profound despair.One thing, however, is certain. It is unlikely that there will be a dry eye in the house. While some may claim that this is merely a manipulative ploy, I say it is movie making at its best, as it compels the audience to emotionally react. At the same time, it raises thought provoking questions. In this day, where the words ""genome"", ""clone"", and ""stem cell"" are part of one's everyday vocabulary, maybe we should be giving this film some considerable thought.All in all, this is quality movie making at its best. With spectacular, first class, special effects, and superlative acting, it makes for a movie viewing experience that should not be missed. While the film may be a little uneven in parts, this may be due to the joining of two very divergent, and diametrically opposed, styles, that of Spielberg, who still looks at the world with childlike wonder and rose colored glasses, and that of the late Stanley Kubrick, who had a darker vision and more cynical take on life. Nonetheless, in years to come, I have little doubt that this film will be classified as a masterpiece."	5.0	AN ASTONISHING AND DISTURBING FILM...	2004-08-14	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2J0WX87P521VA	Leah Chester	Well, what to say about this movie. Hmmm. Generally I'm not a real harsh critic but this one confused me. It's too Spielburgian to be pulled off the way Kubrick intended and too Kubrickian to attain the emotional empathy common to Speilburg.  So it's just odd and demented. Above all, too long. The movie is emotionally twisted in that it is so freaky and unnatural yet because of Speilburg's direction almost forces the audience to have feelings for the characters. It gives a dark feeling to those who watch it because they are not sure what it is they are suppossed to be feeling. May I just say that Manhatten under water was the saddest thing I've ever seen? Sad in that I love New York, please God let that never happen. This movie could've worked if it was directed by the late Kubrick, not to say it's all Speilburg's fault. I think that had it been directed by Kubrick it would've been acceptable because during the scenes that were way out there the audience could always remind themselves that, well, it's Kubrick, what do you expect? But Speiburg's influence is is too much there to be plausable; especially at the end. Was I the only one left going, &quot;What was that?&quot; I just sat in my seat puzzled. Teddy by far is the best character in the movie. Jude Law is awesome as always. I'm starting to gain a new found respect for the boys of Natural Nylon. It's...alright; not a movie I'd see twice. It almost has an element of Frankenstein to it in that you feel contorted emotions for inannimte things.  In the case that that is what Kubrick was going for...kudos to Speilburg for pulling it off. Although, somehow, I feel that Kubrick would've taken the pimps and &quot;love droids&quot; of the film and run all the way with it, rather than play so much on the Pinnochian &quot;I'm a real boy!&quot;	2.0	A.I.---Absolutely Implausable	2001-07-27	1	1	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3IQQJPGZ2RDN7	Learner	[Contains slight spoilers.] First of all, this is not a movie for kids. It is too deep and the underlying themes are for adults.Second, this is an odd production, because it was worked on by both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Spielberg took over the project when Kubrik died. I was excited when I heard a Kubrick movie was coming out that wasn't a strong R, but then I was disappointed to see what Spielberg did to it. Spielberg spoiled the movie wherever he touched it. Kubrick's and Spielberg's styles are like oil and water - they don't mix. Kubrick created a deep, original movie with great sci-fi elements. But then Spielberg added in some of his worst characteristics as a director - goofy cartoons, a sappy ending, etc. (Sort of like `Spartacus' meets `Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.)Having said all that, I still recommend you see this movie at least once - just try to ignore the Spielberg elements. If you stop watching after the scene near the end when the kid is talking to the statue of a woman (you'll know what I mean when you see it) it will be a better and more profound experience.This was a very thought-provoking movie for me. How do we really view others around us? Would we treat them any differently if they were (perfectly created) robots? What does it mean to be human?I also skipped over the robot torture scene in the middle of the movie. It was too disturbing, and I didn't want to watch it.	4.0	A Spoiled Masterpiece	2004-12-09	6	2	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3VYDLL7WN5ZCM	Lee	A.I. is the latest offering from Steven Spielberg, and it is without a doubt one of his best. There are few directors able to offer huge blockbuster movies that actually have artistic value and are truly worth the price of admission; Spielberg is undoubtedly the master of this, as he proves with yet another box office smash that is intelligent, thought-provoking and beautiful from start to finish.The film portrays a dystopian future where robots have been perfected that are indistinguishable from humans. The focus is on a child robot, the first one to be created, and his wish to become real. The heart of the story is basically a modern version of Pinnochio, which is heavily acknowledged in the film itself, although it goes beyond that. Many, many shades deeper than your average popcorn entertainment, A.I. will leave you thinking about it for days, whether you love it or hate it. And it's one of those films that is impossible to appreciate in one sitting; I imagine there would still be fresh layers and themes to understand even beyond the fourth viewing.The lead actors give masterful performances; Haley Joel Osment has given fine performances before, but here he simply blows you away with the depth of his performance; one sincerely hopes we will get another collaboration between him and Spielberg in the future. Jude Law works great as a gigolo robot, and in Spielberg tradition the other main roles are filled by less 'showy' names but still work perfectly.One of the first things you may notice is that the robots (or &quot;mecha&quot; as they are referred to in the film) don't blink the entire way through the film, which warrants an extra level of respect for the actors in those roles as that must have been tough. Look very carefully though and you will see one slip-up by Haley Joel Osment...The effects are truly superb the entire way through the film, and not once are they overly showy or pretentious. The 'supertoy' teddy, while a great effect and much needed comic relief, was obviously thrown in to appease the kids, who will probably not enjoy this one too much since the whole film is very dark and deep. I heard one kid as I left the theater saying: &quot;that ..., I thought it was gonna be like the Terminator&quot;.This film isn't perfect, however. Occasionally you feel slightly manipulated, and there are some forgivable plot contrivances. There is one thing I found totally unforgivable though, and that is the science behind the film. You see, these robots seem to have no power source. Imagine how much power it would take to run a fully functioning human robot... A lot. Consider that the huge battery in a laptop computer will be dead after about 6 hours. The robots in this film never need to recharge, refuel or do anything because they can simply run forever magically. They can run in sunlight, without sunlight, underwater, and at any temperature, and not a single second in the film was devoted to explaining this. While this may be forgivable in a film that is pure fanstasy, in A.I. is it not because A.I. is a film rooted in its realism, in the fact that this is all possible someday, maybe even probable. If you can muster the enormous amount of suspension of disbelief required to get past this fact, then it won't be a problem, but for those with scientific backgrounds this may prove a big turn-off. Duracell missed a huge product placement opportunity there...Running at 140+ minutes, A.I. is probably just slightly longer than it needed to be. The ending (which is great, but truly depressing and not very believable) comes out of nowhere and is more like an epilogue.John William's musical score is superb; it fits the film perfectly yet not once does it become distracting. It's really the icing on the cake, and what sweet icing it is.No matter what your views on the subject matter of the film are, it's truly worth seeing, if only for the great conversations it will spark. Some will find it depressing to the point it upsets them, but for the rest of us who 'get it', it will prove to be a rewarding experience, and a film you need to see at least twice to appreciate. A great piece of work, provided you can see through the minor annoyances to the heart of the film.	5.0	The year's best movie so far...	2001-07-04	9	8	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UJUVPDP4XF3B	"Lesley M. Schultz ""msthoth"""	"This movie will make you feel REALLY REALLY BAD.  It's a combination of the most wrenching aspects of Frankenstein [in the creation and subsequent utter abandonment of a ""living"" creature who loves], Pinocchio [dangerous quest for something that doesn't really exist] and Close Encounters [nice aliens to offset cruel, destructive, petty and mean-spirited humans].  Haley Joel Osment is a pleasure to watch, a fine young actor, and if his character turns out to be the last ""living"" and active remnant of a dead human civilization, we could do worse than to have it be he.  At the same time, the way his character is treated and the way the story's world is make one positively glad that no human survives to taint the universe.  Kubrick tends to showcase the negative in the human creature, and he does it here through ""mecha's"" who are present at every level of society, primarily as toys and servants or slaves, and their position in it.  They are throw-aways, exacberating the human need to trod underfoot some segment of its population to make itself feel powerful and safe.  Spielberg was chosen, as I guess, to take over Kubrick's project because he likes to showcase the things human beings like about themselves, the more admirable characteristics.  However, he routinely does it through contrasting types, playing the flawed against the godlike or turning the marginally corrupt into examples of courage and dignity.  On the face of it, this collaboration should have worked.  I think it doesn't because our present civilization has serious and lingering doubts about its worthiness to survive and even its capacity to do so.  Making a film like this makes those doubts and fears more tangible than we would like in something from Spielberg.  And he creates an ending where David the artificial boy finally gets the love he craves from his mother [for one day] and falls asleep forever with her in her bed, feels like a cheat.  After telling us a horrid truth about ourselves, Spielberg sends us home with pretty lie.  We aren't that dumb; we know some things can't be whitewashed by nice aliens with honkey-dorey technology. To try to do this is to excise the only good thing this film had to offer: truth about the human condition. The film was very thoughtful, but I wouldn't want to retread the thought-path again anytime soon."	2.0	Without Redeeming Characteristics, Awful Story	2002-12-04	12	7	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AD3694G8KB67M	Leslie Spring	The combined creative forces of Kubrick and Spielberg work in A.I. to tug the viewer in opposite directions, with an end result that is not unlike the buzz from a strong Irish Coffee.  And like said Irish Coffee, after seeing A.I., I walked out of the theater like a wide-awake drunk, my mind racing from the stimulation of Kubrick's dark, heady ideas, yet I was simultaniously reeling from the impact of Spielberg's deft manipulation of my emotions.It is this constant tension, this tearing of cinematic conventions and deliberate stretch beyond any one genre that lies at the core of the viewer's love-it-or-hate-it response to this movie.  Another key factor is the way that A.I. forces the viewer to participate in the film.  I had to actively pay attention for a change!  For example, there was a scientific aside toward the end of the film that discussed quantum physics as applied to the nature of consciousness.  I simply could not BELIEVE that this had made it into a mainstream film without having to be watered down or over-explained for the masses.Also, beyond the obvious fairy-tale metaphors in A.I., there were many more subtle metaphors and uses of allegory that, again, required me to think for myself.  What a concept.About the acting: If there were any justice in Hollywood, Osment would already have a couple of Oscars on his shelf, but they'll never give a kid the nod, because those egotistical narcissists absolutely can't stand it that on his worst day, little Haley Joel can act circles around most of these scenery chewing el-ronners, and this movie is no exception.  Hey, you with the throbbing cheek muscles.  And you with the blank-stare-as-acting method.  Yeah, you know who I'm talkin' about.But I digress.  Anyway, the moment Osment's &quot;David&quot; character is given the last code word to activate his love for his adoptive mother, I nearly gasped out loud at Osment's facial transformation.  Wow.  I also want to say that Jude Law was fantastic as Gigolo Joe.  He managed to portray sleazy and endearing at the same time, which is no mean feat.As for the negative there was very little, but can we call for a moratorium on the Robin Williams shticky cameos?  I like ol' short-n-fuzzy as much as the next guy, but his fast-talking pseudo-impersonations are getting stale, and are far too recognizable to be dropped into a serious piece like A.I.  It was jarring to suddenly hear the Genie from &quot;Aladdin&quot; in full manic force, and in the SoCal vernacular, he &quot;harshed my buzz, big time.&quot;Overall, I gave this film 5 out of 5 because, although there are some less than perfect moments, it is a fantastic film in every sense of the word, and it will leave the intelligent viewer with something to think about for years to come.	5.0	A.I.'s Sweet Symmetry	2001-12-27	2	2	0

Things become rather complicated when the young boy regains consciousness...The cast does a good job in their respective roles though its Haley Joel Osment that steals the show.The similarities with Pinocchio are evident and the film focuses on human relations, hope and inner strength, as well as love, devotion and integrity.Very serious and very slow at times it does not aim so much to entertain as to stimulate one's mind and emotions.Recommended for Haley Joel Osment (who is really great) fans and for those with a taste for depression in the extreme.	3.0	Pinocchio meets Blade Runner indeed...	2007-05-13	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3MLO4GAD2O9DL	"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy"""	The problem with this film is that it does not seem to know what it is--i.e., exactly what to do or where to go.  The beginning is very promising--a couple in the near future whose young son is quite ill adopts a robot son to replace him, fearing their own child may not make it.The initial scenes of the robot boy, played by Haley Joel Osment in another great performance, are awe-inspiring, showing him trying to adapt to his new family.  And the scenes immediately following, after the real boy has recovered and returns home to find the interloper, are equally compelling.  If the film had developed the complexity of relationships between these four--the wife, the husband, the real boy, and the robot boy--it might have been a really intriguing movie.  There is much to be said and gained by delving into the subtleties of relationships, especially when there is man and intelligent machine duality involved.  This could have been the definitive film--up to this point--on this subject.But instead of doing this, Spielberg decided that he needed to make this a silly adventure film.  The level of intelligence on display descends rapidly after the robot boy is thrown out of the family and meets up with another older robot, a playboy type played by Jude Law. While Law himself turns in a good performance as well, the story by now has veered very far from what could have been a real masterpiece--and then continues to take wild twists and turns that left this viewer, at least, scratching his head and wondering what had happened to the Spielberg of Close Encounters and E.T., among others.The sledgehammer?  Better to have phrased that, The Pinocchio Sledgehammer.  Spielberg decided that he needed to turn this into a Pinocchio story and so has the Osment character, with his Law sidekick, visit a computer &quot;seer&quot; named Dr. Know whose cartoon face looks suspiciously like a cross between Albert Einstein and Gepetto.  In addition to which, the tale of Pinocchio is brought up a few times, just to make sure the audience KNOWS that this IS, after all, a Pinocchio story.Throw in a trip into the far future, the slaughter of domestic robots by anti-machine lowlifes, a visit to a benevolent robot creator (sympathetically played by William Hurt), and various other sidetrips, all designed to wow us and &quot;pull us in&quot; to the story of our much beset-upon hero, and you have a melange that ultimately cancels out whatever interest might have been initially generated.The whole is decidedly less than the sum of its parts here; one definitely gets the feeling that Spielberg himself could have done with a shot of artificial intelligence to make the film he should have made.	2.0	All over the place...and a sledgehammer	2001-09-29	11	5	6
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AGIF8F2DHCKS6	'Lily'	"Note: this film review is for people who have already seen 'AI' as it does contain some spoilers.It was 11:30 pm the other night and I couldn't sleep, so I decided to start a film we had rented.  After watching it I really couldn't sleep!I started 'AI' expecting a sort of entertaining robot film but instead received a story that has kept me thinking for days now.  I already knew the basic elements to the plot - robot child in a harsh world - but that was about it.  There are already plenty of plot reviews on here telling the entire story so I will not go into all those details.  This review is basically to expound on what I got out of this film and to state what precisely I found the ending to be.Many people's reviews either loved or hated this film basically because of the ending.  It was surprising how many said to leave before the last half-hour of the film.  I must say here that I have never seen '2001: Space Odyssey' or any Stanley Kubrick films, but if the film had ended where I originally thought it would (in underwater Manhatten, where Kubrick apparently intended) then I would have been terribly upset.  But I'll discuss the ending some more later on.To begin, I was immediately drawn into the film and did not find it to lag or be 'slow'.  In fact, I rather lost track of time and completely immersed myself in the story.  The first quarter/third of the film simply was quite powerful and the forest scene was one of the most harrowing things I'd ever seen.  I really did not have any problems with Henry and Martin disliking David or that Monica was the only person David referred to by the intimate name of 'Mommy'.  Henry and Martin basically viewed David as a 'toy', as shown by Martin's words (""Oh, you're the new supertoy now.  Can you fly?  Walk on the ceiling?  Do super-cool stuff?"") and Henry's actions (i.e. shaking David as if he can't be hurt).  In fact, I got the impression that Henry only 'got' David because he disliked to see his wife so upset.  So he presented Monica with a new 'supertoy' and that's a reason why he can't understand why Monica would like David (after the hair incident.)  And, to me the reason that Monica would 'dump' David was basically because she was more worried about Martin.  Which, unfortunately makes sense.  She's just recovered her son who's been in a coma for a few years, then he nearly drowns thanks to this robot-kid, and she's not going to lose Martin again.  But, she also shows a great deal of concern for David - after all, she could have taken him back to the lab, but didn't.The disc we had rented had some scratches on it so I basically missed the last half of the Flesh Fair segment.  Too bad - it seemed important.The parts after the Flesh Fair (Rouge City to the ending) really changed for me and I felt as though I was watching a completely different film.  It switched from sci-fi to fairy tale and that threw me off guard completely.As stated earlier, if the film had ended underwater, I would have been completely upset.  As the way it did end, I was able to 'enjoy' it a bit more, although it was still disturbing.  More spoilers follow.  The ending could have been the most beautiful thing in the world or the saddest thing ever created.  The idea I derived is something I have not yet run across in any other reviews.  To me, David does achieve his 'Pinocchio' dream at the end.  Waiting 2000 years was not the point.  Bringing back 'Mommy' was not the point.  The point was that for the first time, Mommy can tell David 'I love you and have always loved you,' before David cries and (for the first time in the film and his life) sleeps.  A robot cannot sleep - David says so earlier ('No, I can't sleep.  But I can lay very still and not make a sound.')  So, to me, David does become 'real' - this is so tragic in the sense that finally, after millennia, he has acheived his greatest happiness and now there is no one to share it with.  Or, it could be the most beautiful ending, for now he is real and can achieve death - something he couldn't do earlier.  As the narrator says in the ending, ""And now David could go to where dreams were made.""  So, in a sense, this fairy tale really did get the 'happily-ever-after' ending.  David and Mommy, together forever by themselves with no Henry and no Martin to worry about.The four stars (as opposed to five) are because of the scenes I felt were completely unnecessary; i.e. red-light visual of Rouge City and some of the sleazier parts.  Yes, the world is a dark and unfriendly place in the film, but I think that's pretty obvious from the way people behave in a family unit.  If a family cannot have control, then it follows that the world will be unable to control itself.And, I know everyone else has said this, but Haley Joel Osment's acting was incredible.  Jude Law as Joe was an interesting sidekick, and I felt got the most powerful line to say ('I am, I was.')  Teddy was pretty cool at first, until I realized how creepy it would be if toys really did come to life.Lastly, I found the theme of the film to basically be 'what is the worth of this?'.  How easy is it for someone (or some couple) to become bored, or depressed, and use an escapist method (in this case, David) until something happens (in this case, Martin) where they no longer need or care for the product?  The reason that the film left me feeling hollow and cold inside is that it showed how quickly things lost their value.  Henry and Monica and Martin used David until he wasn't worthwhile (or until he was 'too dangerous') and then abondoned him to the world.  Ultimately, they're the ones who missed out on all the love David had to offer eternally and unconditionally."	4.0	the most disturbing thing I've ever seen...	2005-10-17	10	9	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	This movie, was amazing, in my eyes. Its quite simple why too, I'm a VERY emotional person and this movie had so much emotion, very complex emotions. It was amazing. It just amazes me how anyone can capture such an emotional complex role which was and is &quot;David&quot;. But Haley Jole Osment Did. Its funny cause you wouldn't think a child could capture that raw and complex emotion, he does, and it just leaves me in awe. Actually I think very few actors could successfully do this role including adults, in think an adult would do worse.I think the true reason why most people don't like this movie is due to the fact that they may not grasp let alone understand the emotionas in this movie, the emotions are the foundation. They don't understand David's need for love, he was created to love and be loved in return, but he could not have it no matter how much he tried to keep it and get it, so he tries to become a real boy. It just is bringing me to tears right now, its so sad yet so true. Being turned away from the one thing you need and want the most from one person. Its truely terrible, BTW I'm 17yrs.I think everything in this story fits perfectly, the pinochio storyline is perfect for its emotional foundation. But it is SO MUCH MORE then a science fiction take on Pinochio. I wish everyone could appeciate this, but there is good chance you wont, and it makes me sad. You may think the movies to long, but I think its perfect, instead of leaving you hanging it let's you know everything. And that makes it worth watching, and as someone else said; its best if you can watch it without being interupted, so you can think about it, because this is defienetely a thinking movie. So if you hate using your emotions and brains, forget it. This is a movie I think few can truely appreciate, most teens will find it boring(though I am one I love it)and even the majority of adults wont understand it. I know because I know both adults and teens that have seen it.So if you're willing to explore your emotions open up your mind and think a little, I think you will enjoy this movie alot. Otherwise, well I'm sorry for you. Either way it'll still be the most emotionally intense movie to date. And my favorite, for this is the kind of thing I've searched for for a long time.God Bless ~Amy	5.0	This is the kind of movie you'll either love or hate....Why?	2002-03-09	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A5U1H8GRHYH5C	"Lisa ""ishmaela"""	This film is definitely not for everyone, and I believe one of the reasons for it being panned so voraciously leads back to poor marketing choices. What the public was given in the ads and trailers led people to believe that this was going to be one of Spielberg's heartwarming &quot;kiddie movies&quot; and/or a Hollywood Blockbuster. Honestly, when I went to see it in the theaters, that's what I was expecting, too. In my case, however, I was pleasantly surprised. But for someone who wouldn't find this type of film their normal cup of tea, the surprise probably would be unpleasant, and people do tend to react to disappointment in a more negative manner. If those people had known what to expect going in, they could have made a more informed decision on whether or not to see this film, causing fewer disappointments, and, I believe, fewer completely negative reviews.As I said, I was pleasantly surprised, because while I certainly don't mind being &quot;entertained,&quot; as most people were expecting of this film, I much prefer to be challenged to think, and this film definitely does that. Yes, it's slow-paced, but if you're the kind of person who gets all tingly with delight at the thought of reading a good long novel, that fact won't put you off a bit. No, it doesn't offer easy answers to the questions it raises, but these are questions there are no easy answers for. And yes, it does seem strange to have the cold cynicism of Kubrick cross-pollenated with the warm sentimentality of Spielberg, but even stranger, it works. The resulting hybrid manages to be pessimistic without being jaded, heartbreaking without being schmaltzy.Haley Joel Osment is astonishing. If he turns in performances like this at his young age, it's amazing to think what he'll be able to do in coming years. And Jude Law's performance is equally as good. Both give performances that allow the audience to identify and sympathize with their characters, while at the same time never letting them forget that those characters aren't &quot;real.&quot; I concur with other reviewers who feel that these two actors were short-changed at Oscar time.The film raises many, many questions, questions that, as I said, are not easily answered. Ultimately, it's about what it means to be human.	5.0	Not for kids; not for those with short attention spans	2002-05-11	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3PQW7C2ANX9TC	"Lisa Y ""lisa-yack"""	The main reason I give this movie 5 stars is because the movie touched me in a way I didn't think it could. Is it possible to &quot;love&quot; a robot? Yes. If you are one of the many who shed  tears at the end of this movie then you will know what I'm talking about. I foud this movie to be extremely intriguing and it raised some very important moral issues that our world is just now starting to get into. Should robots be programmed to have a human heart and soul? Or even more important, should robots even be programmed to look and act like humans at all? After watching this movie my answer is a firm no. The tagline reads &quot;His love is real, but he is not&quot; but who is to judge what is real and what isn't anyway? The movie suggests that only humans are real. However, if the definition of &quot;real&quot; is something that you can see, touch, identify with and love then the character of David is most certainly real. The only problem is, there is no beating heart in his chest, just a computer chip. When you toy with evolution and attempt to create a &quot;perfect&quot; human replica something is bound to go wrong. In this case I think the problem was that David was far too real for people to come to terms with. I never held any doubt during the movie that his &quot;mother&quot; Monica loved him. It was living with loving a robot that bothered her. Her tortured expressions and actions during the scene in the woods confirmed all of this and raised an even larger moral issue; If a robot genuinley loves you, how can you just toss it away? You cant, which is why I think the movie should have stuck to its original storyline having Monica become an alcoholic. David was after all her son. She programmed him, took care of him, and most of all, loved him. Although her emotions in the woods seemed genuine, could a mother really abandon her own child, robot or human, and just simply forget about him? More detail was needed to complete her character and I felt the need to know how on earh she could have been so cold and yet so loving at the same time. Although the ending &quot;attempts&quot; to explain, it leaves you walking out of the theater wondering not only &quot;What if?&quot; but &quot;When....&quot;	5.0	Thought Provoking And Intriguing	2001-07-02	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1D8BC9UD8LTHJ	Little Me	I don't really need a robot Pinocchio parody to understand or explore human nature. Childhood attachment and imprinting were undoubtedly apparent to most people long before the development of enlightened civilizations with colleges full of social scientists. More specifically, William Hurt's character, Professor Hobby, is poorly drawn. He seems almost robotic himself like his android creations. I also thought that the family dynamics between David (the android), his new parents, and their biological son, Martin, are not played out very well. The abandonment in the forest was meant to be... what exactly... a tear jerker, a case of mixed emotions, or just clunky plot development. Although necessary for the storyline, it comes off as fairly abrupt and rather stiff. Then there's the Flesh Fair, a backlash against androids. It's basically an evangelical demolition variety show for rednecks. This part of the film was probably intended to drive home some of our innate humanity, but it comes off as too contrived and somewhat hokey. The first part of the movie is important because it sets up the second part, but I didn't think it was very good (2 or 3 stars). The philosophical aspects and subtle pairings of real life and its artificial imitations are just ok.The movie really gets going with the trip to Rouge City and subsequently Manhattan. (The movie was released in June 2001, so the Twin Towers are still standing.) David, the robot boy, really is on Pinocchio's quest to be a real boy so that he can receive the genuine love of his adoptive mother. He's accompanied along his journey by Teddy, the supertoy, and Gigolo Joe, a rather savvy android played by Jude Law (there's some 5 star stuff here). First the robot fellowship finds Professor Hobby, David's creator, in his well maintained facility above a partially submerged Manhattan. Here the movie also reveals the unfortunate circumstances behind the creation of David the mecha. Then, just like Pinocchio, David actually finds the Blue Fairy. She's beautiful, but not quite as helpful as he would like. This could have been the end of the movie, but there's another chapter. It's set in the future after the extinction of human beings. A narrator provides the background information, and the story slows down with the arrival of alien anthropologists. In part, they fulfill David's quest, relieve his pain, and, at least for one day, make him abundantly happy. 2,000 years is a long time to be without your mom.	3.0	Supertoys Last All Summer Long	2010-04-22	1	0	1

And speaking of missing, did anybody else notice that a police amphibicopter can be hijacked and flown away by anyone who just feels like climbing in -- like, whoops, they neglected to program an i.d. check or automatic power shutdown into that machine. It's strange that catastrophic global warming results in the ocean FREEZING solid...and then the advanced robots magically know to excavate through billions of tons of ice in southern Brooklyn, expending unknown gigawatts of energy to locate David (even though he has no tracking system installed).I can enjoy a fantasy narrative, but here the director/writer wants it both ways: the film commences portraying the scientific method and peer review and normal cause-and-effect; but whenever these become inconvenient to Spielberg and his story, out the window they go. It degrades the viewer when logic is blatantly ignored if it is deemed inconvenient.

I am fascinated by the possibilities for humans and our future.  Japan has always embraced robots as benefactors of humankind, but American entertainment always portrays robots as sinister and a mistake.A.I. puts the blame on the humans, who are abusing the &quot;mecha,&quot; humanized robots, that they have created.  Although the premise is worthy, A.I. leaches all hope out of the viewer and replaces it with utter bleakness.  The scene of the toy teddy bear lumbering after his abandoned robot boy master (Haley Joel Osment) in the dark forest is almost as unbearable as the endless scene of the same boy robot's open, staring eyes as he has been trapped at the bottom of the ocean for many years.  The scenes of innocent Mecha being systematically destroyed for human entertainment, including a gentle nanny robot, are a kind of robot Schindler's List.The film is too long. Jude Law gives the best performance as a robot gigolo who befriends the boy.  The special effects are flawless, but in this case they just serve to make your depression more realistic.  A.I. fails in its mission to be thought-provoking, which is very unfortunate, because this could have been a masterpiece.	1.0	Artificial Movie!	2004-06-15	15	8	7
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3013MHSQS4Y8Y	lobohombreriera	"This movie is probably more famous for the controversy that unleashed that for its own artistic merits. Originally a project by the late Stanley Kubrick, it was passed to Steven Spielberg, who pretty much managed to pull off one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. However, he had to pay the price: being haunted by Kubrick's ghost.A robotic version of ""Pinochio"", ""AI"" is not, however, your usual Spielberg flick. If you're looking for the emotional, tear-inducing ending that characterizes pretty much every movie that Steven has ever made, then this is not the right place. ""AI"" is a serious, deep, science fiction film that unravels the quest of a robot child called David, who is abandoned by the mother he was programmed to love. Influenced by Goldoni's tale, he begins a journey in search of the mythical Blue Fairy, the only one who can turn him into a human being. In the end, he will have to face the horror that comes along with the discovery of the soul, and the confrontation with the dilemma of an artificial being that was taught to be unique.Filled with excellent performances and top-notch special effects, ""AI"" can satisfy both Spielberg and Kubrick fans alike (believe me, I am both). At almost 2 1/2 hours, it may seem a little bit long for impatient viewers, but it's worth it. This DVD edition is also it's natural home, with an excellent video transfer that gives the movie a crisp, detailed picture quality. The sound is also very good, with complete surround that gives an extra boost to one of John William's best scores so far! Thank God they didn't forget the Spanish subtitles this time! The second disc contains the special features, that include theatrical trailers, several mini-documentaries of the whole acting, directing, scoring and designing process, bios and filmographies and many sketckes and storyboards. The only thing missing, though, is an audio commentary. Too bad.Anyway, forget about controversies and see for yourself.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1DYCCTUONW16Q	"Louis J.M ""Louis J.M"""	A.I. offers the dubious premise that only robots are capable of real love. I don't know that Stanley Kubrick would necessarily have disagreed (he was pretty misanthropic himself), but I don't think he would have appreciated Spielberg turning the story he'd developed as a film into a 2 1&#8260;2 hour live action remake of Disney's Pinocchio. The film is simply about a robot boy who searches for the Blue Fairy (I'm not kidding!) to turn him into a real boy so his human mother will love him.He's even got a robot Teddy Bear sidekick as a Jiminy Cricket enema.The film doesn't begin that way, however. The first section of the film is devoted to exploring how a robot boy programmed to love would fit in with a human family. When the family's real son is released from a cryogenic chamber and rejoins the family, serious problems develop. These issues should have formed the core of the film, but it never deals with the implications of the fact that the robot boy, because of flaws in his programming, comes to represent a very real physical danger to the human family. Instead, the film takes a left turn into cartoon fairy tale nonsense when the boy begins his quest for the Blue Fairy and it just gets more and more ridiculous as it progresses. Granted, there's a huge audience who will be taken in by Haley Joel Osment's performance and find themselves identifying with this robot boy searching for love. (He's onscreen for nearly every scene.)  He's a very good actor, but I couldn't identify with his robot character. The human parents are not very admirable characters and their real son is presented as a jealous brat, so the audience is manipulated into siding with the robot boy, even when he inadvertently almost kills the real son. The film seems to support the notion that humans are generally morally inferior to robots.I'm a human being and I object to the anti-human sentiments that underscore the entire film. There's a scene where humans attend a live show; a Flesh Fair, where robots are destroyed for the entertainment of cheering masses, clearly modeled on redneck Monster Rally type events. It's not presented with any context, so we don't know the social circumstances that fuel such events, but it's clear Spielberg wants us to look down on this kind of thing because of the cruelty meted out to robots.The question for me is how I would react in a future where humans felt threatened by robots. If the film had explored these issues and actually bothered to air legitimate anti-robot arguments, it would have been a much more interesting film to me. Instead, the film diverts at that point and focuses exclusively on the robot boy and his adventures, mostly with another robot, played by Jude Law, in an increasingly overblown, cartoonish future landscape (reminiscent of lots of other movies, but closest in tone to the theme park production design of Never-Never Land in Spielberg's HOOK). This could have been a good, serious science fiction movie, one of the rare examples of real sci-fi from Hollywood. Instead, it's just the latest manifestation of Spielberg's fixation with Disney.A.I. is a MOVIE, not a reflection of reality, and it is a mediocre film based on a 32-year-old story, no less. Aspects of the film are certainly interesting (I particularly liked the Bladerunner-esque mech sequences), but the movie as a whole simply didn't mesh. It seems like four films in one, with insufficient segueways. And with Spielberg doing Kubrick, the dialogue is excessively stilted and the direction emotionally distant (a technique which sometimes works, but at many points in this film simply annoyed me).Just my opinion: Catch it on video. And don't even think of making the mistake of thinking that it contains any new ideas.- Louis	2.0	Not Spielberg's Best Work	2001-07-06	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2XYK28EF1GWVQ	"Louis T. Underwood ""Lou Underwood"""	A.I. is not about robots.  It is about the near universal cruelty and selfishness of humans.  Specifically, their complete and utter inability to truly love another being without getting something in return.  The humans in this film create the illusion of love for themselves, only to dispose of it when they no longer need it.  Sound like anybody you might know?  Sound like everybody you might know?What better way to get this message across than through the narrative device of robots.  Specifically, a robot who is programmed to love and therefore in posession of the purest love there is -- he doesn't love in order to get something in return; he loves because he actually loves.In terms of robots having emotions -- aren't humans merely flesh machines which are programmed to react to stimulus?  We fool ourselves into thinking our behavior is somehow ultra-complex and more than animal.  We are kidding ourselves.  The only thing that sets us apart from other creatures is that WE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.  But we keep hurting each other anyway.  Over and over and over and over and over again.In short, A.I. is a very dark movie.  And the first chapter is easily the darkest.  There are moments here that truly moved me to tears.  Although the rest of the film is indeed excellent, there are several uneven moments to beware of (basically the typical Spielbergisms -- you'll know 'em when you see 'em).  However uneven certain segments may be, the overall excellence of the film makes up for it.That being said, I can only imagine what A.I. would have been if Kubrick made it.  Although he saw it as a fairy tale more suited to Speilbergs' taste, this ain't no E.T.  Not by a longshot.  In short, this should have been Kubricks movie, but Spielberg does an admirable job despite himself.  I was truly surprised that Spielberg could do it.  I almost wonder if he understood what Kubrick was trying to say?Anyway, there is much more to say, but, you should decide for yourselves.  I highly reccomend this film.

Where you live is monitored; what you eat is engineered; and the person serving you is not a person at all. It's artificial. Gardening, housekeeping, companionship -- there is a robot for every need. Except love.Much of this movie is dark. At one point, a hopelessly depressed David leaps from the top of a skyscraper. And it grows unnervingly frustrating, especially as Spielberg's script tries to reach a conclusion that always seems just beyond reach. Spielberg wants a happy ending filled with hope. The ending? An anticlimax, but hopelessly touching. I felt tears streaming down my cheeks, and I don't cry easily.Hayley Joel Osment is simply out of the world. Such talent for acting is rare, and for a child to deliver with such emotional intensity is rarer.Go see this film.

They didn't refer to the Blue Fairy too much because that's what the story was about. He wanted to become real and had heard the story so he thought the blue fairy was real. It was a beautiful movie that had me and my friends upset for weeks. This film was not recognised as much as it should have been, the trailers did it no justice and were misleading.

The aliens that everyone was complaining about at the end were advanced robots. Good for you Stephen, one day people will appreciate this movie.	5.0	AI The best movie	2003-04-09	1	0	1

If we take out the surplus of the movie we are left with a young boy who will always stay young and was made to love his mother until the end of time but cannot compete with her husband's love for their own son.A very endearing beautiful story, a bit lengthy but beautiful nevertheless.	4.0	I see Kubrick but feel Spielberg	2002-09-10	1	0	1

Two robots (who resemble humans in every way) go on an adventure to discover who they are. I must admit I am shocked at the hate this film gets. It's only rated 3.5 stars on Amazon. The film and extras are good but not great in this release. Every single extra from the 2-Disc Widescreen DVD and Japanese BD release seems to be included (~95 minutes) but exclusive content is not offered on this release. While the bonuses were good for DVD it would be nice to get an extensive documentary or a director's commentary as the longest featurette is only 15 minutes long.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"I loved this movie. It may be not as magnificent as other Spielberg and Kubrick works, but it is still a great moment of cinema. I watched it with a great emotion and I was afraid for the little hero (or rather two little heroes - let's not forget Teddy...) from the beginning to the end. It made me cry twice, no matter how much I tried not to. It really reached deep into my heart as no other movie managed to do in years... So, there is no other possibility - five stars.I agree however that AI is clearly a patchwork of ideas rather than one project. It is because this story was worked in all successively by four very talented but very different men. It began as a short story (""Supertoys last all summer"") by Brian Aldiss, a great name of British SF, known mostly for his magnificent ""Hothouse"" novel. As most of SF writers from 60s and 70s Aldiss was very pesimistic and his writings are usually rather sad and gloomy. His mark is clearly visible in the movie.The short story was rewritten in a scenario by another great name of SF, Ian Watson, who of course left his own personal inprint. The person who had the idea of making a movie about a modern SF version of ""Pinocchio"" was the great Stanley Kubrick. He never realised it however and when he died, according to his last will, the project went to Steven Spielberg.Spielberg inherited a very sad, depressing and dark tale of suffering and despair and he simply couldn't realise it like it was. He changed the story, mainly removing the ""horrible bad ending"" and replaced it with a kinder ""not so happy end"" which so many reviewers didn't like. Well, me for one I think he was right because ending AI differently would give a movie that only a really bad person (and by saying this I really mean ""a sadistic sociopath"") could like...You probably already know what this story is about - a robot child, who was programmed to love his foster parents and who wants just to be their child, nothing else... but even that little will prove to be too much to ask... No other spoilers. Haley Joel Osment gives here a performance as brilliant as the one he gave in ""Sixth sense"". Jude Law and William Hurt are good in second roles. A great ""star"" of this movie is Teddy, a little teddy-bear robot, once a very expensive and cool toy, now obsolescent and falling in pieces... The scenes in which he is fixing himself with a needle and some yarn will probably touch the coldest hearts.This is NOT a movie for children! I strongly warn you against watching it with them, unless they are at least 12. Some of the scenes are very disturbing (like the execution of ""strays"", robots which were abandoned or chased away by the owners) and even after the little Spielberg touch, this movie is still terribly sad....All in all, I believe you should watch this movie, at least once - you will not regret it. And you can also use ""A.I."" as a medical test - if the final scene doesn't have any effect on you, you should see a doctor..."	5.0	Success has many fathers.... and this great movie had four!	2012-04-02	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1KMTBJTK7YRL8	"M. Acosta ""yfandes1"""	This movie really can only work if you take a good long look at yourself and your emotions and the way you experience and act on them, and then see the film.  Because I truly don't think that this is a film to get if you just want to be entertained.  Teddy (the robot's talking stuffed-bear) and the special effects aside, it REALLY isn't an entertaining movie...But it raises interesting questions about love.  What is it?  What creates it?  It really is only a feeling, you know?  Why is it more genuine in us than in that robot? Just think... if something feels love, how can it NOT be considered alive?  What is really the difference between a robot and a human at that point?  They're just made of different systems...So if you're willing to get a little philosophical, I'd reccomend this film for sure.And just to answer to a few of the major complaints I've seen-- yes I agree, this movie was TOO long!  But I thought that the last bit was really good if you're the least bit empathetic with this kid who has wanted his mother for so long...And as for the &quot;aliens&quot; in the end-- I was under the impression that they were highly HIGHLY advanced A.Is!  I think that makes it a WAY more interesting ending than if it's just some creatures who zoom in from nowhere.  No... I think the OH SO superior human race couldn't survive on the earth at somepoint, and the A.Is could and did.  Make sense?	4.0	An interesting mix of emotions...	2002-05-15	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"I overall liked this film, at least the first half, although Spielberg seems to lose his way in the second half of the movie, which bears little if any relation to the first part. So although I think it's still worth seeing, there are some problems with it.First, a little background. I read the Newsweek article about this film before I saw it, so I was aware that Kubrick had worked on it for 15 years before handing the whole project over to Spielberg. Given the contrasts and differences between the two directors, I was interested to see what the final film would be like. And the film ends up being an uneasy mix of the two director's visions.First, the good news. You'll probably be entertained, if nothing else, by this film. The special effects are worth seeing. The two main leads, Osment and Law, do an excellent job in their respective roles. The story line has its touching moments, but takes some weird twists and turns, especially at the end, although if you're a Kubrick fan, or a sci-fi fan, you may find the last part the most entertaining.Osment does a fine job with the little boy's part. The robo-stud Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, is a nice touch, and Law also does a fine job with this part too. The role had some good development to it (unlike some of the other characters) but could have used even more. Still, his part was a nice touch, and Law is completely convincing in the role.William Hurt's dialog seems a little forced in his main speech where he's explaining what's happened to Osment after Osment has found his way back, but it's okay. Hurt is always good even if the movie he's in is an overall dog.And now the bad news. The first one-third of the film works well, as we're introduced to the family and the artificial boy, played by Osment, who makes his appearance and becomes part of the family. After that the film takes a distinctly dark turn when the family's biological son wakes up from his coma, as his relationship to Osment becomes more and more disturbed. Eventually the mother abandons Osment rather than return him to the company to have him destroyed, and the rest of the movie is about Osment's trying to find his way back.However, the film really loses itself at this point, in the middle third. The ""Flesh Fair"" carnival scene, where humans destroy the cast-away robots, or mecha's, as they're called, on-stage, wouldn't even work well in a B sci-fi movie, and it works even less well here, in what would have been an otherwise acceptable, although not great, movie.However to mention the only good thing about the scene, the crowd gets pissed off at the ringmaster who is about to destroy Osment (because Osment is so life-like that they don't believe he's a mecha) and starts pelting him with garbage. At that point the crowd of onlookers riots and allows Osment and Law to escape.The last third of the movie is in some ways the most interesting, but is also the weirdest, as there's not much to connect it to the rest of the movie, as Osment becomes frozen in the sea ice in his copter after escaping the Flesh Fair and is discovered 2000 years later, barely functioning, but basically still ""alive.""His rescuers are an advanced race of robots who have outlived humanity (not too surprising, considering the current state of humanity and the world), which is long dead. Like archaeologists, they are trying to reconstuct man and his civilization, and Osment is the greatest discovery they've made yet about mankind, since his memories are still intact, and he is the only person they've ever seen, artificial or not, that ever knew a real human being. They also look like the gracile aliens we've come to recognize, only these look even more like Giacometti statues they're so slender and thin.Anyway, the last third is pretty far out stuff, and although interesting, as I said, it's really almost a separate movie, although I nice mood piece, perhaps a high tech mood piece, if you will. But it seems pretty clear that by this point Spielberg had pretty much lost his way by this point as far as trying to bring the story to an even remotely meaningful or sensible ending.That having been said, I still enjoyed it, and if you watch it not expecting too much and simply wishing to be reasonably entertained for your oney, it's not a bad way to spend a Sat. or Sun. afternoon."	3.0	Good bit with some problems	2001-07-05	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AWWY3JYKYJIOS	MagicSinglez	"A.I. Artificial Intelligence was originally a project - a long time project - of director Stanley Kubrick (Dr Strangelove, Eyes Wide Shut). Kubrick died before the project had progressed too far. I knew this movie was dedicated to Kubrick but the movie was just so very good I spent little time trying to discover any hidden meaning. I was thinking, 'this is the best movie I've ever seen'. Spielberg and crew do a wonderful job here.Haley Joel Osmet plays 'David' an 11 year old boy who is actually an advanced robot. David is an experimental design equipped to learn and feel. David is adopted into the family of Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards). They have an older son Martin (Jake Thomas) who isn't always kind to his new brother.The message isn't very subtle. . . Over and over and over, and over, David cries, ""Please make me a real boy"".In the end David is hugged by his mother Monica and lies down with her, the narrator saying, ""for one day. . . there was no Martin. . . no Henry. . . no doctor Hobby. . .""

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"I believe there's a reason that reviews of AI are so confusing ... and often diametrically opposed.  AI, after all, is the result of a fusion of two directors' views of a single story; in this case, those directors could not be more different. So the sense that the story moves in different directions at different levels probably isn't just an optical or narrative illusion.Some dwell on a darker, ostensibly ""Kubrickian"" interpretation, probing for some trenchant, perhaps cynical theme to offset what appears to be a 20-minute final&eacute; of ""Spielbergian"" syrup.  The contortions they take to sell this notion are byzantine and seemingly at odds with Spielberg's carefully crafted, gooey finish.  To them, the end cannot be taken at face value and must be, itself, part of a larger fairy tale that advanced mechas (robots, to the rest of us) tell baby mechas, and that the sweetness of the ending (Pinocchio turns ""real"") must be a mocking tribute to the fantasies we tell our own children. That last piece -- the ""mocking tribute"" -- is the biggest stretch for me.Others, who generally dislike the movie, hone in on the juxtaposition (or, better yet, outright clash) between the first two acts (that end with David at the bottom of a flooded New York staring at a Coney Island-style blue fairy), and the warm and touching denouement in which the advanced ""mechas"" rescue David and, as technological blue fairies, grant his final wish: not just to spend a day with his ""mother"" (an ""orga,"" as opposed to a ""mecha""), but to have her love him.  Indeed, in a replica home built from David's memories, his saviors appear and speak to him through an image of the blue fairy ... telling him what they can, and cannot, do to help him achieve his dream.  (Fortuitously, a lock of his mother's hair has been saved from which she might be cloned and returned to him.)  And so he spends a last day with a cloned version of his mother, who -- away from the influence of her ""real"" (orga) son -- has time enough to realize that she loves David, and finally says so. (How does the clone even remember him?  We're given some explanation about memories being contained in space-time, although it's pretty confusing and sounds, well, hokey.) Taken at face value, the story wraps up like a rich berry pie steaming on the sill of an open window on God's little half-acre.We can debate, I suppose, about whose take is right.  Certainly, Kubrick never saw a lick of this film, in draft of otherwise. And although Kubrick did, in fact, sketch the outlines of Act 3, there is little support for the view that the final 20 minutes of A.I. reflects Kubrick's intentions and tone. It simply doesn't feel like Kubrick, so the case for such a statement needs to be much stronger than I've heard. Perhaps getting a look at Kubrick's fabled 80-page treatment might help, but, for reasons unknown, it remains hidden (much like any director's commentary--Spielberg doesn't believe in them). Spielberg himself has studiously resisted disclosing how much of the end product was his and how much was Kubrick's, saying only that they had a common vision (with the subtext being that their views were so close perhaps as to be indistinguishable). I don't buy that. Spielberg and Kubrick were not on the same intellectual level:  Spielberg is no Kubrick, either in sophistication or vision.As for my two cents, Act 3 looks and feels like the now familiar Spielbergian cop-out.  On the surface, it plays like a commercial for fabric softener ... all aglow, with munificent and stylish Close Encounters-like robots (sometimes mistaken for aliens), and filled with tenderness and maudlin dialogue. It feels as if Spielberg couldn't live with Haley Joel Osment stuck at the bottom of the ocean staring, for eternity, at a false idol. (Many of us, cynics perhaps, thought that was the perfect ending: a priceless metaphor for our own, human infatuation with with artificial deities.)To be sure, the subject matter is rich, and intriguing references and anologies are peppered throughout the film.  Hinted, but never effectively explored, is notion of man's hubris, his becoming (at least in his own mind) a diety (recall Professor Hobby's line--when confronted about whether humans will be able to return the love of a robo-boy--about God having created Adam and Eve, in the first instance, to worship him). Similarly, the notion of man as god in the mythos of the machine swims in the AI stew but isn't well-explored. Compelling also, in a tragic way, is the advanced mechas' idea that humans hold the answer to the meaning of life. Finally, there is an elegance to the idea that we have endowed our creations with our own foibles, frailties, and insecurities ... first in David searching for the blue fairy (God) and ending with the advanced mechas telling the story of a  robot (God's son?) who came to their world to ""save"" them and, in the process, became ""real.""  Meaty stuff.  Too bad the film simply doesn't live up to the challenge.In other words, AI is a well-intentioned film with lots of substance and even more potential. But it is so uneven and indecisive as to never really work at anything the way a masterful film should.  That is its greatest tragedy."	3.0	Oh, what a movie it could have been!	2005-07-04	9	5	4

In terms ofsubstance and emotional intensity, A.I. does indeedsurpass his admittedly entertaining debut. Many ofhis films since Jaws have struck me as veryheavy-handed. Here, his technical proficiency is atlast matched by content.It is a unique, thought-provoking film that is very engaging while at the same time slightly disturbing. He has even managed toimbue the film with an interesting Kubrick flavor, and I think Mr. Kubrick would have been pleased with the finished product. The Williams score adds quite a bit, as usual, and the acting is first rate. Master Osment is perfect,and Jude Law is, I think, actually a machine. Amust-see, unforgettable film.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3DT5X9I5IAEBL	man_invisible	"As far as models of the future on celluloid go, I can safely say nobody has topped 1971's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" directed with finesse and brilliance by the late Stanley Kubrick.  That film depicted a run-down world losing any glimmer of hope through a minimum of means--a few brightly-colored murals and wigs here and there, several futuristic-looking props, nothing overly drastic.  As a result, that subtletly gave the film's plot a chance to take hold, creating apocalyptic ideas and situations that were more terrifying than any CGI-created world that's come since.Which brings me to ""A.I.,"" Steven Spielberg's attempt to capture what would have been Kubrick's last project, had he lived.  The film takes place in the future, where realistic robots are constructed to assist mankind.  We're introduced to David (played by ""The Sixth Sense""'s Haley Joel Osment, here in another good role), a cheerful tyke who's adopted by a mother and father whose son is in the hospital.  He is a perfect yet somewhat creepy model of a child who yearns to love his mother like a real boy would.  After an incident where the real son nearly drowns, though, David is dropped in the woods and embarks on an adventure through robot hell.  His comrade is a bear named Teddy, and eventually he enlists the services of a streetwise android gigolo (Jude Law) in an attempt to find ""The Blue Fairy"" (who, according to the Pinnochio tale, can transform a fake boy into a real one).For a film done with such competence and conviction, ""A.I."" comes across as a lopsided experience.  In the first half hour(David interacting w/his adopted family), not enough time is spent on relationships, especially with the mother, who plays too key a role in the film.  She goes through the default motions of being frightened by the child, then warming up to him (a rather abrupt and inexplicable transition, as presented here). I didn't find much of it convincing, which doesn't help in the last segment, the other weak link of ""A.I.""  I agree with the previous reviewer who said the movie should have ended with David (SPOILER) trapped underwater--no matter how inconclusive it felt, that would have been the best place to roll the credits.  Instead, Spielberg indulges in another half hour of special effects (including groan-inducing CGI aliens) and family-values shtick, defused by the fact that the character he re-introduces is so underdeveloped.Other than that, everything that's sandwiched in between is fantasic and dazzling.  I usually abhor films that resort to lazy computer graphics & blue-screens to convey futuristic worlds (i.e.--""The Matrix""), but in ""A.I."" Spielberg carefully balances astounding images, characters, and an ambitious script very well.  Osment and Law are an unlikely duo with chemistry to spare, and their talents shine here.A gripping story and good performances are ""A.I.""'s main attraction.  Spielberg does well, even though he tends to overindulge in his excesses of family values and overblown effects, but ultimately this film will not have you questioning our future in the way ""A Clockwork Orange"" did.&lt;P..."	3.0	Kubrickian darkness clashes with Spielbergian family values	2001-07-10	8	5	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	In reading more about the movie afetr having seen it last weekend, I realized this was actually a Stanley Kubrick project initially, which he could not complete because of his death in 1999. This explains why the movie has two entirely different moods.The first half of the movie is VERY Kubrick, with attention to detail, outstanding acting (indeed Haley Joel Osment's acting continues to be superb throughout the rest of the movie), but past the first half, and actually more towards the end, it seems like a Spielberg movie. I will not ruin the mystery surrounding the movie, but believe me: when you leave the theater what I'm saying will become more apparent.Additionally, at several points throughout the movie, it seemed as if Spielberg (for this I BLAME him) had created a pastiche out several previous movies: some Bladerunner, some Brazil, some Close Encounters, some Mad Max, some Contact -not necessarily in that order. And all of this would seem acceptable, given that all of them were superb movies. The problem is, however, that when the movie is over, you ask yourself: &quot;What on earth did Spielber want to convey here?&quot;In terms of cinematography, as a piece of art, I'd give it a five (it's impeccable), but the script is absolutely weird, and toward the end, becomes actually bad. And since a script is part of the movie as a piece of art, that's where I'm taking off 1.5 stars.Go see it however. Who knows? You might actually love it. But if you think you'll find a Kubrick-like movie, you'll be dissapointed.	3.0	3 and a half - not a Kubrick, not the best Spielberg movie!	2001-07-07	13	8	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A26RB62D7AF596	"Manuel Zamora ""marzman"""	"I finally watched A.I. the other night. It was good, it was bad, and it was ugly, all at the same time.First the good: Visually, this is one of the most fully realized sci-fi movies in a long time, from the retro-future Swinton house, to the post-apocalyptic landscape of the submerged New York. The robots and the &uuml;ber-robots at the end were all beautifully designed. John Williams score was appropriately ethereal and ""small,"" instead of the usually ""big"" sound he's done for other Spielberg movies. The acting went from excellent to so-so. The usually wooden William Hurt was excellent in his brief appearance as the arrogant robotics expert Dr. Hobby. I wish he had been much more central to the story. Haley Joel Osment was astonishing. I don't think anyone could have pulled off the transformation from robotic child, to near-human feeling robot with such confidence and aplomb. Jude Law was also just a revelation as Gigolo Joe, and quite possibly the most sympathetic character in the whole movie, apart from the animatronic ""supertoy"" Teddy, who really stole the movie, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the cast, from David's ""adoptive"" mother and father, to the real kids, to the collection of stereotypes at the ""Flesh Fair,"" are just cardboard characters there to service the plot. Which leads me to...The bad: Actually, there is no plot, only a series of barely related events. A.I. purports to be the story of a robotic child, a ""mecha,"" named David who has been given the ability to love. He is ""adopted"" by a couple whose real son is cryogenically frozen. After some initial hesitation, the mother, Monica, decides to take the risk, and imprints herself on David, activating his ""love"" program. Of course, the real son miraculously recovers from his ailment, and things take a bad turn for robot David. An accident at a poolside birthday party causes the family to see David as a threat, and Mom abandons David in the woods, rather than see him destroyed.At first glance, it looks as though we are being treated to a modern-day retelling of the classic legend of the ""changeling."" A changeling is a fairy child that is substituted for a human child by the fairy folk, and who eventually returns to them. But this is far too sophisticated and ""obscure"" for director Steven Spielberg, who instead trots out his own personal obsession, the Pinocchio story, literally! David overhears his ""mommy"" reading Pinocchio to her real son. So when he finds himself abandoned in the woods, David's literal-minded robot brain decides that if he is to win back his ""mommy's"" love, he must find the Blue Fairy of the story and ask her to make him a real boy. David's quest to find the Blue Fairy occupies the rest of the movie. In the end, David does find the Blue Fairy, which now leads us to...The ugly, facile ending, in which Spielberg lays on his patented treacle with a trowel. 2000 years pass after David is trapped underwater in what should have been the movie's more poignant and believeable ending. He is found by highly advanced ""super-robots"" that are the sole surviving life-forms on earth after what looks like a second Ice Age has wiped out organic life. David's obsessive wish to win his mother's love is fulfilled, in a deux ex machina of cheap, overdone sentimentality. But then, that is Mr. Spielberg's stock in trade.So, to sum up: This is a beautiful, well photographed, well scored movie, with some truly astonishing special effects and set design. But the story and plot are 15 years too late. Only a little of Stanley Kubrick's and Ian Watson's dark and cynical outline remain, and are eventually overwhelmed by Steven Spielberg's saccharine mentality."	2.0	Beautiful but Deeply Flawed	2002-06-20	9	6	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL	Marcel Lee	"Intelligence? Not so much. This movie, which lasts for about two and a half hours, is stupid most of the time. That starts at the initial premise, the creation of a robot child; a mecha; designed to ""love"". It's a loaded term that is never clearly defined, but, judging by the behavior of the boy, it apparently has to do with romantic obsession. The fact that it's his adoptive ""mommy"" he feels that way toward gives the story an incestous underlining. The ending, in which the two spend the day together and gaze into each other's eyes to dreamy orchestral music, gets downright pedophilic. I was waiting for them to start having sex right then and there.But their creepy relationship and the things that happen around it during the first third of the movie is the best part. It leads to a genuinely despondent abandonment scene, one of the few times in which puppet-master Steven Spielberg's heartstringing actually works. From there, the tone changes from psychological drama to action adventure; the boy, his toy bear and an expendable mecha-man must find their way to The Blue Fairy before being killed by the evil humans; back to a different kind of psychological drama. It's that last third, in which Steven Spielberg goes for an extended epilogue, that comes across as meandering and pretentious.If Artificial Intelligence is supposed to represent some big important metaphor or make its audience ponder deep philosophical questions, the effort is lost on me. My questions have more to do with the logic of the plot. How, for instance, can the boy survive for years under water if he breaks when he tries to eat a few spoonfuls of spinach? Why do the ""parents"" even bother to sit him at the family dinner table with a plate of food if he can't eat? Why was the child programmed to love only the mother and not the father? They're petty arguments, I know, but asking them is more fun and engaging than anything this new-age Pinocchio has to offer.marcellee.com"	2.0	2 of 5	2012-12-20	8	1	7

I didn't want to see the film when it first came out, well, because I was maybe bored with Spielberg and his creatures. I dont know, I really couldn't say why I didn't want to see the film I just didn't want to see it. Although I am fascinated with Spielberg.After seeing A.I, it's safe for me to say I felt depressed and probably would never have wanted to see it again. But I bought it because I got so attached to Monica  and I hated how David lost her and then found her again only to lose her once more. HOW SAD!!!You almost get the feeling that he never truly found his mommy. That she remained lost forever and all that he had was a memory of her. You almost get the feeling that the last words she truly told him was ""I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world.""How truly sad the world is."	4.0	"""I'm Sorry I didn't tell you about the World"""	2002-11-22	5	3	2

I felt manipulated, and I couldn hardly wait to get out of the theater.  Masterpiece?  I don't get it.  The most interesting character is ""Snuggle the Fabric Softener Bear."" And one more thing -- I think most people would agree that if a child is lost and friendless, what should he do?  Why, hang out with a male hustler, of course.  Kubrick was a genius.  Spielberg is brilliant.  (And the story is fascinating.)

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1YJLKWUNPMI22	Maria-Rosa de Hacia	I enjoyed this one more when I viewed it the second time. As a fan of both Spielberg's and Kubrick's works (particularly Close Encounters by the former), I also agree about the &quot;hybrid&quot; feel it exhibits. The story is somewhat forgettable, but there are more interesting overtones.  While cringing at the thought of &quot;global warming&quot; and the leftish political vision displayed front-and-center, I nonetheless enjoyed the more human aspects of the film.The film's central question in my mind is: what is &quot;real&quot; and what is artificial? (Similar to Cervantes' asking what is real and what is imaginary.)  Like the woman at the beginning of the film who asks,&quot;but will we love a robot?&quot; to the snot-nosed kids at the swimming pool (including Martin) who talk about how &quot;real&quot; they are (the &quot;mecha&quot; vs &quot;orga&quot; us-and-them sensibilty, also the point of the hideous &quot;Flesh Fair&quot; later on), to the ending, with its suspended vision of an idyllic moment of mother and child you wish could last forever.  There are times when I want to take my own mother (who almost died over the weekend - thankfully she's better now) or daughter and just have that kind of quiet time with either one of them. The notion of it almost brought this viewer to tears.  David is very &quot;real&quot;, but not in the way Mom and Dad were hoping - so they callously kick him to the curb.  Clearly he brought them face-to-face with a view of themselves that was more than a little spooky. The mirror can be a frightening place, and David's monkey-see, monkey-do antics illustrated it beautifully.The futuristic aspects are also thought-provoking. What I found more ironic is the realization that Kubrick made 2001, A Space Odyssey in 1968, and now here's another film made in 2001 with a similar forward look.  Of course, we aren't flying to the moon like tourists yet, and no computer is quite like Hal, but some of his vision did come true.  Here, in AI, we get another vision - one which is very forboding.  Why is the future always portrayed as being totalitarian (needing a license to have a child, as if this was current-day China)?  Even in throwaway films like Rollerball this was the case.  Is it because many film-makers think humans are incapable of running their own lives and will make a mess of things?  The rub is that even those more &quot;enlightened&quot; types that give the orders are ultimately flawed as well - witness the mess they make of things.For those that want action, I'd say skip this one.  But if thought-provoking film-making is your bent, it's worth the time. Castwise, I particularly enjoyed Frances O'Connor's anguished mother figure, which struck the perfect balance between softness and the horror of &quot;adopting&quot; a robot son.  I'll also add my voice to the chorus praising Jude Law's robot Gigolo Joe - but acting is not the point of this film. This is a story, sometimes not too well-told, but I won't easily forget it.	4.0	An interesting counterpoint to 2001	2002-04-03	2	1	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A30HL64AJ5XSZA	"Marius Liesdek ""lieserd"""	I got the Artificial Intelligence blu ray as part of some Warner Bros Blu Ray Deal in the Netherlands (region 2).I've watched this blu ray and I compared several scenes with the dvd version. I can say that the differences are barely visible. The transfer of this blu ray has some noticeable noise that makes the movie look older than it is. Compared to the dvd there is a little bit more detail and everything including colours looks a little bit brighter. The sound of the blu ray (DTS HD Master audio) was definitely a bigger improvement, especially the orchestral parts of the soundtrack seemed to come more alive (e.g. the road to rouge city where the Rosenkavalier waltz fuses with the original soundtrack).There are several extras but all are old and with SD quality. I believe most of them were also on the original dvd, it included: ''Creating A.I., Designing A.I., trailers, storyboards, Music of A.I.'', etc. These documentaries are snippets of 8-15 min. There was no commentary track sadly.In short, if you want the best version of A.I. then you should buy it, but this is not the blu ray the movie deserved, so don't expect this to be an example of a glorious HD presentation.All in all: 4 stars for the movie, 3 stars for the blu ray.	4.0	A.I. blu ray review, Dutch, region 2 (it's a mediocre blu ray)	2011-01-13	9	8	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AX1HMOBNTTV3F	Mariusz Moryl	A Kubrick movie that should have been left untouched by Spielberg. Some things are better left unfinished, so they can acquire the cult status, instead of being turned into a pop culture nonsense. Yeah, the idea was interesting, but it's rendition was extremely cheesy. The characters were not convincing (albeit Jude Law's acted out his part very well), I could not connect emotionally with any of them, especially the little robot boy. The story has been done before with an adult robot - an AI android devoted to his 'family'... sounds familiar? Isaac Asimov's 'Bicentennial Man'. But this time they made the robot into a little boy, so we can let our parental instincts kick in, feel sorry and maybe shed some tears. Only it simply does not work. Most probably Spielberg's intention was to create a 21st century version of Pinocchio, but in that case I don't understand the unnecessary visual brutality of the circus show (I certainly would not want my son to watch that part). And I was very surprised to see that a director who usually plays so much attention to the details, in 'A.I.' asks us to suspend our disbelief ad infinitum. Consider this: the robot boy suffers great damage after 'eating' a few mouthfuls of spinach, yet he remains perfectly intact after falling into the swimming pool and, later in the movie, into the ocean. And when he his search of blue fairy took him to underwater Coney Island I groaned and left the theater (this happened to me only once before in 30 odd years).  I only wished I left earlier.	1.0	AI - Intelligence Lost	2001-07-19	4	2	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A129YBX5BVNW2	"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry"""	"I remember the highly respected Empire magazine giving a big spread to ""A.I. - Artificial Intelligence"" when it was first released in 2001 and duly awarding it their coveted 5-star rating. It was a movie of vision they said - and at the time - I thought they were right. But my oh my - how time and a new format can change things...Re-watching ""A.I."" on BLU RAY in 2011 is a painful and frustrating experience - not just because the film hasn't dated at all well - but mostly because for a very large part of the movie the print on this reissue is awful...Why is the case? Anyone who's purchased ""Minority Report"" and especially ""Saving Private Ryan"" on BLU RAY will know of the 'saturation' technique Spielberg uses sometimes to get a certain look - a gritty, slightly smoked effect. Visually this means that the picture is full of shading and speckles - and 50 to 70% of ""A.I."" is inflicted with this technique too. And while this may have been ok on DVD (hidden even), the heightening of BLU RAY has made many scenes unwatchable as far as I'm concerned.Instead of making the picture better - the BLU RAY has only accentuated the speckles and haze and made things worse. At times it feels like you're looking at a badly transferred video and not a state-of-the-art Sci-Fi film. Combine this with Haley Joel Osment's now irritating performance as the childlike Mecca David who wants his mother's love back (Francis O'Connor) and goes ceaselessly searching for a character in Pinocchio (dialogue above), the terrible circus-cum-torture scenes in the middle section with Brendan Gleeson looking like he's going to break into laughter at any minute and the dreadful sappy ending with Ben Kingsley's saccharine voiceover - and the whole thing reeks of scripted mess and confused vision. Some sympathy has to go to Spielberg who inherited Stanley Kubrick's story and had to viably bring his `baby' to the screen - but whatever your feelings towards the outcome, it is NOT going to be enhanced by this reissue.Don't get me wrong - there are sequences that look good - even great - entering the futuristic city at night in the car through the huge heads with open mouths - flying out to Manhattan with the pleasure robot Gigalo Joe (Jude Law) in the flying/amphibious Police car - the discussion William Hurt has at the beginning with his students about making a robot that 'loves' for real - but these are few and far between. As most of the film takes place in the Swinton home (David's parents) and the headquarters of Cybertronics (the company that makes robots for all sorts of tasks), there seems to be no escaping the washed-out look of the film. The extras are good (the 2DVD set) but if the movie's unwatchable - then what's the point.I liked ""A.I."" then and still think it has its very definite moments to this day - but let's be blunt about this - I just spent good money on a BLU RAY reissue of a film that is available on the DVD format for a pittance - and its not better - its worse - and absolutely not worth owning.It is of course a matter of personal taste and choice, but it has to be said - even if you're a rabid fan of ""A.I."" - I'd say hire it first to see what it actually looks like 'before' forking out any money on it.BLU RAY Credits:VIDEO: 1080p High Definition 1.85:1AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio; English 6.1 Dolby Digital, Castilian Spanish 5.1 EX, French 5.1 EX, German 5.1 EX, Italian 5.1 EX Dolby Surround; Brazilian Portuguese 2.0SUBTITLES: English, Brazilian Portuguese, Castilian Spanish, Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish, German, Italian, Latin Spanish, Norwegian and SwedishBONUS Material:Documentary on bringing A.I. to the screenInterviews with Steven Spielberg, Haley Joel Osment and Jude LawBehind-The-Scenes featurette on the making of A.I.Interview with Sound Designer Gary Rydstrom at Skywalker RanchVisit to Stan Winston Studios with early ""Teddy"" footageInterviews with Lucasfilm's ILM special effects groupTrailers, Storyboards, drawings and hundreds of photosPlus other unnamed features"	2.0	"""...Are You 'The Blue Fairy'?

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3N2R9PM5EAUDB	Mark Beale	I'm not a Spielberg fan. I find most of his technique stolen from better directors. A.I., however, is well worth seeing, if you can forget about your notions and expectations and simply let the movie unfold.This is Stanley Kubrick as filtered through Spielberg, and very diluted, but it still manages to work, often in spite of Spielberg (the fact that Kubrick would have made a far superior film is utterly moot). I was spellbound as David (Haley Joel Osment) faded away, pleading to the sadly lifeless blue fairy statue. I don't remember ever feeling such sympathy for an on-screen character, and what happened next was pure Kubrick, very reminiscent of 2001.Kubrick had planned to use an actual robot for David. He knew that the movie would probably take a long time to film (Kubrick's well known for that), and a child actor would age too much during production. Spielberg was able to crank out principal shooting much faster than Kubrick would have done.In the end, this isn't what many of us hoped for, but the film that emerges is a rich, entertaining and moving meditation on what makes us human.Thumbs very much up.

In it Osment--as a robot boy--is symbolic of children who are &quot;different&quot;.  Whether they have physical, mental, or educational problems, they do not meet parental expectations.  David (played by Osment) is an unconditionally loving, innocent child, but is unable to be what his parents want (in this case, human).  The moral of the story is, though people dream of loving, empathetic children, when some are blessed with them, not only do they not appreciate it, they do not recognize it.	5.0	A Movie with a Message	2002-01-02	3	2	1

Casting a dark, brooding and a baleful eye upon humanity, Kubrick was a master moralist, depicting humanities excesses and the horrible extremes to which they could lead. While this movie has Kubrick undertones, it is after all billed as a combination of both Spielberg and Kubrick, the film quickly descends into a sugary, ET-ish drive to go home. Please do not desecrate Kubrick's reputation by listing this as his movie or claiming that this movie went over the audiences heads.

There was a sense of hopelessness that never let up, and this picture showed a bleak and dismal future for humanity.What was &quot;David&quot; supposed to do for eternity after his &quot;mom&quot; was briefly re-cloned and then died again??  Why was the scene of the earth frozen solid needed to finish the movie???Why should we have been exposed to the gory scene with acid drenched robots, as well as robots torn limb from limb???Why would a TV man have his young daughter at the Flesh Fair??The movie could have ended bleakly enough with David and teddy trapped in the hover copter, but no, we had to darken the movie further by seeing all of humanity dead and frozen for 2,000 years or more.I guess that maybe I expected too much.Despite the poor plot and ultra depressing story, I still have to give a hearty bravo to Haley Joel Osment, and a decent bravo to Jude Law.  Also, John Williams creates a nice but subtle soundtrack.Sadly, this is one Spielberg DVD that will NOT go into my library.	2.0	Very depressing	2001-07-29	4	2	2

How cruel then to program this being to love and seek love in return from one other, Monica.  Longing for love is particularly poignant in a child.  The power of science fiction to prolong this longing over a couple millennia shows David's extreme sincerity of his longing.  I thought it particularly sad that David was able to accept the love of a facsimile of Monica (admittedly a very close facsimile) which I as a human did not find as cathartic.Although the story at times came across as contrived, the movie works on the strength of the performance of Haley Joel Osment as David.  It also benefits from an unusually strong supporting cast, which included William Hurt and in particular, Jude Law.The science fiction is in the vein of Asimov's I,Robot stories.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1Z5IF9HIMDTFZ	Martin	This movie just confirmed my ideas and raised new questions about us as a race (humans). Will we ever be ready for an AI that is as human as we are or &quot;more&quot;.I think not! Not for many thousands of years.The problems will start when AI will be used for our benifit, and that is ok as long as the tasks are simple and the AI is at a very basic level. But what will we be able to demand from an AI when the level of ineligence is equal to ours or higher, when it starts to ask questions or when it starts to question how things are? To be honest, when ever I think of AI I think of slave labour. And mark my words, when our technology alows us to build a machine the likes of the one in the movie we are in big trouble!Personally I think AI, if created as a superior &quot;being&quot; to the humans, will be the next generation of &quot;humans&quot;. Thins might sound very sience fiction and far fetched but this is what I predict for the future.AI won't be an evolution of the &quot;homo-sapiens&quot;, but a race, created by the homo-sapiens to carry with them the thoughts and ideas and hopefully everything else that makes humans what they are after were gone as a race.This won't be by our choice, but it will be the end result. It will be a truly mechanical &quot;human&quot; with out many of the limitations of an organic human, obvously.The pinnacle of our evolution will probalby never be reached before we manage to kill our selves due to the lack of respect for our own lives and the lives of others, which is why I think things will turn out the way i described.I know I left out ALOT, but hopefully most of You reading this review can fill in the blanks and make some sence out of it! =)The future is not ours, but the things we create can last for ever and keep the memory of us alive! Maybe in the distant future we will be refered to as &quot;the elders&quot; who created the people of the future, and thus, making us immortal in THEIR history books.This must sound like alot of preaching, but look me up in a dosen lifetimes and tell me I was wrong! Personally I think I'm right on target! =)Anyway, as for the movie I stronlgly recommend it! It's with out doubt the best movie i've seen in a long time. They could have tied up some of the loose ends, and maybe made the movie 3-4h longer! Thats what I would have done. =)I think that sometimes films, books and other forms of media can give us a glimpse into the future and show us some of the things that are to come. Just think of all the scientists who are wathing the same movies and reading the same books as you are, and then in the future when they make their mark and invent someting after being inspired by a movie they saw 30 years earlier. Who knows (except for me), this movie might just describe a scenario which is just around the corner from where we are today!If anyone feels they would like to discuss this further plz drop me a line on m_montana@yahoo.comPS.

Conceptually Kubrick presents questions like &quot;What is it that makes a human conciousnous?&quot; and &quot;What difference is their between love and adoration.&quot;  These conceptual questions could never be presented by Kubrick for this film (as many times as he tried).  The Project was missing one ingredient.Spielburg and his time tested genius for showmanship new the angle.  He presents the film from the view of a child.  He shoots a film in which he actually seeks to define, Love, Life and humanity.

Because of ""Joes"" profession, the viewer is subjected to graphic sexual talk that is not needed in the movie (Why does Joe have to be a prostitute of all things?) and children should not be exposed to. ""Rouge City"" was such an embarassment with it's sexual businesses and buildings , that it was here that I finally gave up and sent my children permanently out of the room. Previously, I had sent them out during ""Joe's business.""Just as well since as Catholic's, my children (and any one actually) didn't need to see the Virgin Mary made fun of with a church called ""Our Lady's Immaculate Heart"" and didn't need to hear about how people inside grovel, and how after they exit the chapel they become Joe's best clients.Spielberg isn't just anti-Catholic though, he uses the vehicle of this pedantic movie to make fun of the pro-life movement by calling ""The Flesh Fair"", a horific spectacle that harkens back to the Roman Colliseum's blood sports, ""Pro - Life."" The camera stays on this sign long enough that any viewer with brain cells would realize that a point was being made.I gave this movie one star, not because it deserves it, but because the Amazon rating system doesn't allow negative star ratings.What a shame.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A10OKQI758WQ1Z	matt foster	The first two (of three) acts of this film weave spielberg character intimacy with kubrick atmosphere and settings. The result is fantastic, wherein a warm (but not yet overbearing) tale of adopting parents adjusting to their artificial boy yields to a nightmarish world of andriod exploitation and slaughter as the boy is cast out of his adopted role into the &quot;real world.&quot; The second act especially, wherein we meet jude law's charismatic yet appropriately limited artificial personality effectively recalls both the environment and the strongest theme (the definition of sentience or empathic sentience) of blade runner. I was impressed with the intensity and ferocity of the andriod mistreatment at the hands of the &quot;flesh fair;&quot; I had not expected such a visceral treatment from spielberg. And with osment's superb performance we continually question whether the lead character truly demands our sympathy, as his tendency to fall into dialogue loops in critical situations reminds the audience of his manufactured origin.My only gripe is with the third act, which sells out both the believability and the recurring theme of survival of only the machines in the coming climate apocalypse. WARNING--SPOILER: Osment should have been left unfound, or found by _machine explorers_, not flesh (or &quot;energy&quot;) beings with a subserviant infatuation with the species responsible for devastating the earth's surface and obliterating itself. Further, the most plausible means for establishing direct (1-way) communication with a civilization somewhere else in the universe would be through machine explorers that did not require sustainable biomass for the required millions of years for interstellar travel.--again one of spielberg's underlying themes was the survivability of the android form!!A second (less substantive) gripe is the choice of Ministry as the flesh fair musical performers. My personal preferrence would have placed Ogre and cEvin's (skinny puppy) Doomsday performance upon the stage instead...	4.0	terrific, spoiled by a spielberg ending	2001-06-30	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ACDAZLCO51400	Matt	When A.I. first hit the big screen i was extremely excited. For starters the teaming of haley joel osment and steven spielberg is master filmmaking even though the process hasn't even begun. Next you add in someone like Jude Law and you have a surefire blockbuster...or not. You see this movie is very much a Steven Spielberg movie, only he would come up as lines as 'i love you mommy' or 'do you love me?' and when you are paying respects to a man with a mind of sheer brillance (Stanley Kubrick) and you add the Steven Spielberg (who has a mind of brillance but in his own manner) you get a very odd film. Now don't get me wrong, i was please with the $8.50 i payed at night for this film, thought it was worth every penny. There are parts in the movie that are brilliant, say the flooded New York City and why young David (haley Joel Osment) goes there was just the right touch for this film. But then you have scenes like the &quot;flesh fair' now i thought these scenes were extremely creative in the direction and acting abilities, the only thing i didnt like much was the music blaring (which is a band that Stanley Kubrick himself told Steven to somehow use in the film) the band being Ministry. But although this may have been a point in the film where the band would most likely fit in all it really did for me was give me a headache so i couldnt actually enjoy the flesh fair scenes which were pure Kubrickian in his dark style. Changing gears a little you have David (played beautifully by one of my favorite actors, Haley Joel Osment) and you feel for just about every little thing he does, whether it being the &quot;i want to be special, unique&quot; line to the most innocent of them 'i love you mommy' everything he does makes you want this movie to be 2 hours of him just doing his stuff. Thats another part of the film i didnt like...the length. Running at about 150 minutes you begin to wonder, when will this movie end? But to express everything that you really want to i guess you have to have a movie that clocks in at a long amount of time. The ending of the film makes you wonder about human race and what it means to be prejudice and uncaring, as for in the end of the film there are no humans left, there are alien forms (truely in the creative mind of Stanley Kubrick) and David has survived (i will not tell you how as to that might ruin the film for you). David then asks the aliens to see his 'mother' (played wonderfully by Frances O'Connor). The scene is portrayed in the sense that the viewer wants to be happy for David but you can't help think, why would David go back to this women after she dumps him off in the forest for things he hasn't even done? So when my brother and i walked out of the theater my brother said 'i dont really know if that was a good movie.' and to tell you the truth, neither do i...	3.0	It's a film that makes you say 'was this a good film?'	2001-08-02	5	4	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ATAO29B319O3F	"Matthew A. Brown ""Matt"""	This is the latest long movie that somehow escaped the editing room.  The story actually moves along at a decent pace, but the last 30 minutes of the movie is dragged out with Haley Joel Osment pursuing a goal which I couldn't have cared less about.  Not to mention the fact that a narrator steps in during this last half hour to start explaining things to the audience which, I guess Hollywood believes, can't figure things out for themselves.  The movies raises some good philosophical and ethical questions about Artificial Intelligence and mankind in general, but deals with it in a bleak and unimaginative way.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1KHURTNA4LNS8	Matthew A.	Now I realize that this film is not going to be to everyones taste. I suppose that it will fall under the category of &quot;Cult Film&quot;, yet in my opinion, &quot;A.I.  Artificial Intelligence&quot; is one of the greatest science fiction films of the last ten years. In time it may very well be placed within the top twenty greatest Science Fiction films ever.If you want something that is thoughtful, imaginative, daring and unique for a film. This film  is a MUST SEE!Its a shame that the public wasn1t very receptive to this film last Summer, because they missed out on one of the better ones from 2001. Why? For a great many reasons. I wont go into more discussion over the fact that &quot;A.I.&quot; was the posthumous collaboration between Spielberg  and Kubrick. A lot of space has already been written  covering this fact.Many complained about the ending and the disjointed structure  of &quot;A.I.&quot;, yet if you give the film a chance and pay attention from the first frame, the film  does tie together and make sense. Frankly, the ending is one of the things that make it so strong. The film itself ties in well with Kubricks sensibility of Mode Shifting, in this respect &quot;A.I.&quot; is similar to &quot;2001&quot;.The films look at the mysticism of Fairy Tales is something that Kubrick must have wanted to address. &quot;A.I.&quot; is a parable about many issues, from parenthood and paternal instincts, to Religion, to hatred of people or things we don1t understand, to ecological issues, To questions about scientific ethics,  Above all, &quot;A.I.&quot; is about the simplest of all things, its message, its warning is be very careful, take care of the families that you create. It does have a challenging undercurrent of ideas, moments that are disturbing throughout viewing the film. From the Flesh Fair sequence, to Rouge City, to the underwater New York skyline  and the Excavation site ending.Jude Law and Francis O Connor do a wonderful job, yet it1s Haley Joel Osment who carries this film with an Astounding performance. I have been a fan of his since &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, yet he outdoes himself in the role of David. The rest of the cast fills out the film nicely, William Hurt, Sam Robards, Brendan Gleason, Jake Thomas, as well as voiceover cameos by Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and Chris Rock. Technically the film is nearly flawless, with a great production design, Januez Kaminsky1s cinemaphotography, some great robot designs by Stan Winston, including Teddy. The visual effects by I.L.M. are seamless and probably, in my opinion, some of the best work by George Lucas' company in awhile. No offense to Star Wars fans, but the effects in &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; pales in comparison to &quot;A.I.&quot;. John Williams score is one of the highlights of the film and one of his best since &quot;Close Encounters&quot;.The films ambition is something that isnt seen enough, it isnt much of a surprise that it had such a polarizing reaction with the viewing public last summer. The film was Kubricks concept, with Spielberg as its interpreter. After all, most of Stanley Kubricks films polarized the public upon their first theatrical release. Many still dont understand &quot;2001:A Space Odyssey.&quot;I should mention the DVD does a great job with the layout and progression of the documentary features. My only mild complaint is the omission of a director commentary.Can anyone really say that last summer1s remake of &quot;Planet Of The Apes&quot; will be something that will still be talked about, remembered and seen, twenty years from now?Can anyone really say that this years Oscar nominee &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; will be remembered in twenty years?  (No offense intended to Apes fans or fans of Ron Howards film.) I'm not really sure about that, Perhaps, Perhaps not. Yet I think &quot;A.I.&quot; will only grow in statue over time. That it will age better over time than its contemporaries. Much in the same way that Terry Gilliam1s &quot;Brazil&quot; or Ridley Scott1s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; are now seen in a very different light.&quot;A.I.&quot; is better with each successive viewing, get this film!	4.0	Spielberg's unforgetable film.	2002-03-09	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2B6VI9MQI0WKI	Matthew Gladney	'A.I.' is a wonderful movie. I say wonderful, as it contains fine acting and a thought-provoking, sometimes emotional plot line, which is carefully and masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg. The director rarely fails to deliver (we won't discuss 'The Lost World' here), and with this opus and semi-tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick, he succeeds in bringing us an epic picture with heart.The film takes place in the future, when the Earth has been mis-used by humans to the point that polar ice caps have melted, and things aren't as good as they could be. The story basically takes us through events as though it were a three act play, and in the first act, we are treated to family life in this futuristic vision (which seems to not be too affected by such a natural disaster as melted polar ice caps).The family in question has a son who is ill with something (we're not quite sure what), and appears to be in a coma. The prognosis is not good. The mom and dad are given the chance to have a &quot;new boy&quot;, of sorts, when a company which manufactures mechas (very real-acting humanoid androids) makes one in the form of a little boy named David. What makes David so unique, is that he is the first mecha made who can feel emotions, or at least *simulate* feelings emotions.The family takes him in, and the mom soon becomes attached to David. David professes child-like love for the mother, and they are happy. Things go well for awhile, until the *real* son awakens, recovers, and goes home. He and David clash, and eventually the mom dumps David in the woods, with only a friendly robotic teddy bear (named Teddy, aptly enough) for company.That is the first act, and set-up for 'A.I.' David and Teddy go forth on their journey to discover what the real world is actually like. David believes he can be made a real boy if he finds the blue fairy. His &quot;mother&quot; had read Pinocchio to him before she left him for dust, and the blue fairy worked wonders for *him* - so why shouldn't she be able to do the same for David?The people, other mechas, and intense situations which David and Teddy encounter on their quest are interesting, and many times sad and frightening. The brilliant images and scenery are exciting to watch. Spielberg's deft hand is sharply prominent with the visuals painted before you on the screen, and the story-line is never for a moment dull. Interesting questions are raised about artificial life, and its merits and detriments. Though you feel for many of the mechas, at times you are also creeped out by them. Is this their failing or ours?Whether or not David fulfills his dreams and becomes a real boy or not, I won't reveal here. All I will say is that the ending to the second act is poignant, and could very well have been a suitable, if rather sad, ending to the film. Instead (and I can see where this would have been a tough decision), the movie continues on into a third act, which is a little uneven in its approach. I honestly didn't see some elements of it coming, and felt as though they were a little awkward. Parts of it brought a tear to my eye, but it also left me feeling a tad skeptical. It is a decent ending to the film, but one which raises the most questions.What is it about the unconditional love from a parent that drives us so? We seem to somehow need it, crave it, feel comforted by it, in order to exist somewhat peaceably. Without it, we are not completely happy, estranged, drifting even. This, to me, is the main thrust of 'A.I.'All David wants is to be a real boy so that his human mother will love and accept him. Can any of us really quarrel with that simple wish?	4.0	Mecha in Three Acts	2001-07-17	5	4	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	&#65533;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&#65533; has a unique history. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick originally conceived the project, perhaps as a companion piece to his 1969 masterwork, &#65533;2001: A Space Odyssey&#65533;. He struggled with the movie&#65533;s concept for years before deciding to collaborate on it with Steven Spielberg, who wound up on his own after Kubrick&#65533;s death in 2000. The result is a hybrid, a homage to Kubrick, one of the coolest, most intellectual filmmakers of all times, by one of the biggest icons of American pop culture. The results were not pleasing to most audiences. It had a smash opening weekend last summer, and then was promptly abandoned for easier to understand &#65533;eye candy&#65533; fare.The movie takes place in three acts. In the first one we find ourselves somewhere in the future. Global warming has caused sea levels to rise. Many coastal cities, including New York, are under water. Rich nations like America have compensated and thrived. Enormous strides have been made in artificial intelligence. Technology has developed robots that look and act like human beings. One day Dr. Hobby [William Heard], head of a corporation that makes these machines, sets out to develop the ultimate product, a boy that can actually love. Once a prototype is developed, a couple whose only child has been hospitalized for years with a rare disease is chosen to test the robot child named David [Joel Haley Osment]. After awhile the mother, Monica [Francis O&#65533;Connor] decides to keep David and says to him the seven words that unlock his &#65533;love&#65533; program. And love her he does; in fact, he is irrevocably bonded to her. All is wonderful until the real son miraculously recovers and returns home.The second act covers a period when, for good reason, David is separated from the family and is alone in the world. During this time, he meets other robots and learns from them some terrible truths about the world. No matter how real they look and act, robots are not human and are thus disposable. Many people have a fear and loathing for them, feelings, I suspect, that are perfectly natural. The third act takes place 2,000 years further into the future. I will not give away the ending.Osment gives an incredible performance as David, even more amazing because he has to carry the entire movie. I don&#65533;t know how he did it, but he made David truly seem an almost, but not quite, real boy by giving him a very subtle mechanical quality. Forget the fact that Osment is just a kid. He&#65533;s one of the great actors of our times. Also wonderful are Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, robot love machine and David&#65533;s savior in act two, and O&#65533;Connor as Monica.&#65533;A.I.&#65533; is a flawed masterpiece. As such, many people will be too irritated by the flaws to appreciate its virtues. The story is linear, but each act has its own tone, pace, look and story. They are united primarily by David&#65533;s belief that somehow he can become a real boy and make Monica love him forever and ever. The structure forces the audience to shift gears twice, something many people don&#65533;t like doing when watching a movie. Ironically, this says a great deal about how we ourselves have been programmed.On the surface, this is a typical Hollywood big budget movie. It is filled with lavish sets and special effects. None of this does much to hide the fact that this is a thinking man&#65533;s movie. Spielberg can not resist his natural tendency to warm the story up, something the coldly calculating Kubrick would never have done. I believe his style helps the movie a great deal because, otherwise, it would be all too dark. The complexity of the subject matter remains as great no matter what approach is taken. It brings up what is real and what isn&#65533;t, how we project our emotions on an object and what might happen if an object were capable of projecting them back at us. Ultimately, for all his nearly perfect imitation of a human being and for all his abilities to feel and express emotions, David is a machine. Knowing this makes us uncomfortable. We don&#65533;t know how we are supposed to feel about him.Many critics also dismissed &#65533;A.I.&#65533; for various reasons. One complaint was the use of a children&#65533;s story, &#65533;Pinocchio&#65533;, as the one that inspires and motivates David. To me, its use is most appropriate. It reminds us that the idea to play God and to create life is nothing new. It indirectly references the Disney animated movie, and what could be a better example of how we project our emotions on something that is entirely an artificial creation?Fifteen years ago, both critics and the public, had a similar reaction to Spielberg&#65533;s &#65533;Empire of the Sun&#65533;, which is now considered a classic in many circles. I have a feeling &#65533;A.I.&#65533;&#65533;s time will also come. Movies that challenge us have become increasingly rare in the last decade. If you are as appalled by this trend as I am, then I highly recommend &#65533;A.I.&#65533; to you. You will be challenged, I promise.	5.0	Should Stand the Test of Time	2002-03-09	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2JOELPDZIQR7D	Matthew Parks	There are some interesting ideas and images in this movie, but Spielberg is not really able to successfully merge (except maybe in the last scene) Kubrick's original antihumanistic concept with Spielberg's own habitual championing of America middle-class values. As a result, it's a little too dark to be a kids' movie, and a little too suburban fairy tale to be a movie for adults. The result is an overly-long, over-budget hodge-podge.

I wish this was not so because I really wanted to stop watching this movie after a half hour.  Now I'm a pretty big Kubrick and Spielburg fan. But this movie made me feel like I was dying slowly.The story has an interesting premise to it.  But the cinematography and acting is so disturbing that after awhile the movie just becomes painful to watch.  The movie really feels like two movies in one and the point in which the directing duties changed from Kubrick to Spielburg are so obvious.  The camera angles and special effects change as if someone had just snapped their fingers.I major complaint is that the movie is just sooooo long. I don't know why Spielburg kept running with the plot but it just keeps going. The entire end of the movie is completely unnecessary and really contrasts with the main body of the story.  Just drags on with no end in sight.If you want a very different movie to watch or something that gives you the creeps, then by all means, give AI a shot. But if you're like me, and I consider myself to have wide variety of tastes, you're going to kick yourself for spending the time to watch the movie, unless you're not like me and you just turn it off.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ASDX2TSSGLY7F	"Matthew Williams ""willhomes"""	"Perhaps the hallmark of a culturally important movie is its ability to inspire serious debate. On this basis,'AI' succeeds entirely. It is nothing less than the best film of director Steven Spielberg's career, the one that will be appreciated by generations of film enthusiasts.The debate about this movie (on [Amazon.com] at least) appears to be about the morality of its technological premise. The fact is that experiments in creating intelligent machines have been going on for years. Anyone who has used a computer may understand this. For that matter man has been attempting to create a better version of himself for hundreds of years. The notion that we may one day create ""lifelike"" robots is not so far-fetched. Indeed it seems to be a mere matter of time before we see creatures such as David. After all, if the human mind is capable of dreaming of such a creation (and dreams are central to David's quest in AI) then to some degree mechas already exist. What is such a movie as AI than the realization of a vision of artificiality no different than organic man himself, sometimes even more so? You can see this in David's need to make himself as human, a quest that reminds one of philosophers such as Descartes, who famously stated 'I think, therefore I am."" In David's case it could be put as ""I love, I dream, therefore I am.""This is course a central conceit of the movie. In other words, what is the moral bargain we take upon ourselves in the quest to create? What are our obligations to intelligent machines? It's clear that David's mother is the vehicle through which we see this struggle. The enormous emotional strain put upon her is the example of how difficult it shall be to uphold this repsonsibility of acting as gods. Forget whether or not David is a real boy. To his mother he is: he is needy, loving, and imperfect. And if David is capable of those traits, and seeks like many to be loved and find his place in the world, then he must be human.So what is the point of this anyway? Nothing less than the paradox of existence, really. It may seem hard to believe, but in fulfilling Kubrick's vision of the future, Spielberg has come upon what it means be be alive, to exist, to have been. That is why the last 20 or so minutes of 'AI,' criticized as they have been, are crucial to understanding the intentions of the filmakers.  For it is not just our understanding of life, but what those decisions will lead to for future generations. The advanced robots who find David are humanity's very sons and daughters. They never would have existed without David, but ultimately they belong to man, the next step of ""human"" advancement, if that is what they can be called. Remember, it has been said that man cannot really understand God. Likewise, man cannot really understand what man creates. It is left to the future to determine the results of how we acted while alive. In this regard, creating robots who can love and reach out to others is not such a bad idea, after all. There are far worse gifts we could leave for the future.Still not convinced? Watch it again and remember what happens to David when the day with his mother ends. He lies beside her, closes his eyes, and sleeps. But he can't sleep, since he's not human, right? Wrong. The cruelty of Kubrick's premise has come to bear out. The fate of humans, i.e. our foreknowledge of death, has been passed on to mechas; death has been our great gift to them, in return for the desire to love, and it's the ultimate form of self-consciousness. 'AI' is entrancing, mind-shaking and terrifying in its contemplation of life and mortality. Thankfully, however, the experience of living has not been without purpose."	5.0	"""To sleep, perchance to dream."""	2002-12-05	9	6	3

I think I expected more whimsy (like the classic E.T.).  Perhaps the misleading marketing of A.I. led me down the wrong road.After viewing the film a second time on DVD, I have a completely different reaction.  I absolutely love A.I. and consider it one of Spielberg's best.  (I loved EMPIRE OF THE SUN too ...)So why the big difference between viewings? One reason is that A.I. is a dense film - you can't catch all the different layers of story and theme on the first viewing.  Spielberg has created a modern fable that, like most classic fairy tales, has a dark side.  The Grimm Brothers' tales had some macabre elements.  The best Disney films are scary and pyschological as well.Emotionally, I was very moved by A.I.  Spielberg has told a tale that confronts some basic human existential questions: how long does love last?  When will our parents die?  And, most importantly, what is the nature of love?  David, the ""artificial intelligence"", is a robotic boy.  He exists to fill the emotional void for a childless couple.  However, what do the couple owe him in return for his love?  What is their responsibility?  Can they return him to the manufacturing plant?Can you love a machine?A.I. is a fascinating film with incredible special effects.

I was enthralled by the story, special effects, and acting, and I though Spielberg had balls to make this one (was not a ""Safe"" bet).I will say though that this film shouldn't be seen by young children (my son was 9 when we saw it at the movies)...this is an emotionally ripping film for young kids...I wasn't expecting the amount of intense emotion, and my son was in tears for a lot of the film (we had to wait five minutes after the movie for him to stop crying).

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3MEN4EWCCMRZU	"""may924"""	The first time I saw the previews for A.I. and the posters, I thought that this was just a glorified version of the movie, &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot; - a movie about a boy robot who proves to be much more than wires and metal. However, A.I. surpassed my initial thoughts by its thought-provoking plot, great effects and talented cast.I would not recommend this film to everyone I know. This film would not appeal to dullards and simpletons who prefer movies where everything is explained to them, where the storyline/details are spoon-fed to their audience. This movie caters to filmgoers who have intelligence as well as imagination. Sometimes, you need to &quot;read between the lines&quot; to see what's really going on.I can see how the ending might seem short, and there are definitely as many Speilberg characteristics as well as Kuberick ones in this film. But, do not let your biases for the two taint your views of the movie...I give A.I. 5 stars for its lush visual effects, storyline and acting. Kuberick would have been proud!	5.0	A.I. - surprisingly excellent!	2001-07-05	4	2	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	APOUYO1BEPK22	"M. B Cole ""Kegrun"""	"Sometime in the future, Monica and Henry Swinton have a child who becomes very ill and close to death. With hopes looking bleak, Henry tries his best to make his wife Monica happy by buying her a robot. Not any kind of robot though, but a child robot. This robot is the first of it's kind. It's the first robot to ever have the emotion of love. While nothing can replace her son, she is at first shocked and mad that Henry would do such a thing. But she accepts this robot. This human-like boy. This David. Before the robot can love though, you have to say some secret words that are programmed into its' database. As she becomes more and more used to David, she decides to finally say the secret words to him. And in just seconds, David loves her. David does everything he can for his mommy so she will love him also. And then sometime later, Monica and Henry's real son, Martin, comes home. The affection and love that the family once had for David, slowly is shifted to Martin. As time goes by, David starves for the attention again for his mother and will do anything for it, even the mean things that Martin makes him do. When things become to get out of hand the family decides to get rid of David. As David's world begins to crash around him, he seeks out the blue fairy that his mom used to read about to him. The fairy that could turn a wooden boy into a real boy. Because if he becomes a real boy, then his mommy will love him.What a sad and great movie. Haley Joel Osment is so good at playing this robot boy it's unbelievable. When Monica is dropping David off in the woods like a dog, I had to turn to stone because I didn't want to shed a tear in front of my friend. Honestly the way I think of David is a dog sort of. They might not have the understanding like a human, but they still have feelings. And seeing her drop him off like a dog and telling him to stay while he's crying and screaming for her and how much he loves her and how he's sorry for whatever he did... well it was just heart breaking actually. Sometimes I feel so bad for David that I have to say to myself, ""Self, He's JUST a robot."" But when he was made, he was given all the emotions that he is almost alive. When Monica tells him the password to love, it was some really good acting on Haley's part. Seeing his sort of weird robot smile face go into a face of getting flowed over with the emotion of love was really good. The first time he's hurt, and he freaks out, and seeks protection, you almost feel it with him with the intensity and shock on his face. I love this part of the movie so much.As others say, the movie feels like there are 3 acts, and it really does. After David is dropped off into the woods, act 2 begins and A.I. takes a total different feel. David begins his search for his blue fairy and comes across Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and many other fascinating and scary places. While David goes through these ordeals, the whole time I'm thinking to myself, ""Dang, and all he wants to do is make his mom happy and be loved by her, and now he has to go through all this pain, for nothing"". To me, I kind of wished the movie had stopped at the end of act 2. The whole movie made me feel so sad and lost for this little robot boy, so why not end it there. Then act 3 begins, and while it still makes me sad, it takes away from the more powerful emotions that I had for David. I really don't even want to get into the ending, because, well, it's the ending and I don't want to ruin it (that is if you are one of the few that still haven't seen this movie).In the end, while I keep saying this movie is sad, it's very entertaining in many ways. There are some funny moments, so it's not always gloomy. But yes, it is pretty hard to watch unless you can really detach yourself from David. I for one couldn't. Like I said though, I didn't consider him as a real boy, but more like a pet. I could never just drop my pet off in the woods like Monica did with David. Especially after his begging and pleading. So yeah, definitely give this movie a shot if you haven't seen it yet.P.S. God I want a robotic teddy bear like Teddy."	4.0	I Heart You Mommy.	2009-04-28	4	4	0

What I got was a complete waste of over two hours. While A.I. is visually interesting, the uber-depressing plot rambles here and there with no solid direction. I think this must have been a &quot;movie by committee&quot; where everyone involved threw in their ideas on what the characters should do and no one bothered to say &quot;No, that is silly&quot; or &quot;no that will make this movie even longer&quot;. I was even underwhelmed by the usually fantastic music by John Williams. I think this is the first time I ever saw a movie with music by John where I wasn't enthralled with the score and couldn't walk away humming the main theme.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3ENN25NFADE1X	MBrian	"The thing that I find spectacular about this movie is the directing, and the acting between Haley and Law. The reason why this movie is a combination of Spielberg and Kubrick is it's humor and it's message about the dark and stupid side of the human race. I'll tell you some parts about the movie that make me feel this way. Remember that scene with Jude Law when he's dancing around and the scene when he tells this woman ""Once you have a Meca inside of you, you will never want a real man again"". Or the scene when his mom is about to die and Haley starts to cry. Steven is showing us that Haley has become human again after 2,000 years because Mecas can't cry. And if Haley's become human that means he's the one human left alive because the Human race was destroyed. Spielberg loves the Human race unlike Kubrick. This particular scene is a Spielberg idea.Now here's the Darkside of the movie. Remember little evil Martin and the evil dad who wanted to get rid of Haley, or when Law told Haley that the world changed and made everything worse starting with Manhattan, or when Mecas where being hunted and destroyed by Humans, and the aliens roamed a frozen Earth; all this was Kubrick's brilliant idea for the Human race.I don't want to offend, but anyone who thinks or says that those aliens in the movie were evolved Mecas are just plain ignorant. Spielberg tells you what they are (aliens) right there in a scene when one of the aliens actually tells Haley where, why, and what's, their purpose for coming to Earth.This is one of the best classical movies ever made in the 21st century and in the last 50 years. And it's not as sad an ending as you might think. I know people may not get it, but what's not to get. The message is right there in front of you. Spielberg and Kubrick are telling us to slow down on our evolvement because if we create a being using Artificial Intelligence then maybe it will think bad thoughts and may become like a dictator and start a revolution against us, or maybe the Human race will become enraged and start a Meca Holocaust like in the Movie.

Buisman	HJ Osment got an Academy Award nomination for the 6th Sense but he should have gotten an Oscar for his role as the robotchild David in Artificial Intelligence. He is simply brilliant as a robot that always has to be nice and in the end starts looking for a way to become human. Frankenstein, Pinocchio, the Asimov robot novels and Data from Star Trek are all perfect predecessors. His acting becomes even better when he meets a newer version of himself.The story is not new, it is just a modern version of Pinocchio. It also has some sociological comments. In the scene during the robot-rodeo he (and gigolo Robot Jude Law) are almost destroyed but the audience doesn't want a child, even a robot, to die. Somehow no one is expected to kill their own childhood, the dreams have to stay alive, even the dreams of a robot.See it and be amazed	5.0	Brilliant Osment, Good Story	2004-01-06	3	3	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A10Y596I3SL84S	"M Darrow ""therekloose"""	For what I am about to say about this movie, you would think I'd have given it a lower rating, but the saving grace is actually that much of my disapointment stems from reviews I'd read for the movie saying  that Spielberg had taken a darker tone than in other films (rather than the film itself.  The film asks for suspension of disbelief and I gladly gave it, expecting that the premise concept would be used for exploration of more complicated themes.  But many of the complications go unexplored and the film degenerates immediately into a sentimental fable that's too dark for children.  I'm not going to give away any details but I'd say my major problem is that you would think (at least I did) that the problem with the creation of a robot boy capable of &quot;love&quot; would have to do with how the robot understands love and how they act on it.  The aspect the film decides to set up (early) and come back to is whether the machine would be loved back.  So this shifts the focus of examination from the machine to the humans, who actually disappear in the film, even leavign this more simplistic theme unexplored.  On the whole, the robot boy is portrayed as a perfectly created innocent while the critics, telling tales of 'Spielberg's darkest and most thought provoking film' and a film that 'is not at all E.T. despite a purposely similar title', had me looking forward to a complicated story.  Keep this in mind when you see the film:  If it really isn't just somewhat sappy fable that goes on twenty minutes too long, WHY WITH THE TEDDY BEAR?????	3.0	Warm &amp; Fuzzy but little else	2001-06-30	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"Although never actually said in the movie, this is basically an updated, modernised, robot-ised version of Pinocchio. A Disney movie that was never among my favourites when I was young and still thought Disney movies were the bees knees. Straight away, I see the similarities between this and Pinocchio, just by watching the two trailers - which did nothing to make me WANT to watch the movie, even though I was going to anyway. (They were `teaser' trailers - which didn't really show you very much!) However, knowing that Stan Winston was involved in the special effects did encourage me.The film's two big stars are Haley Joel Osment, who is still in his Sixth Sense little cutie role, and Jude Law, who looks very strange in this. Very plastic, but intentionally so. To begin with, Haley's character, David, was so annoying; I wanted to slap him. And then I wanted to slap his `brother' Martin even more. Both very annoying sounding and looking children. But if you're the kind of person (like me) who can't stand the annoying little brats, then don't worry. Martin doesn't appear that much in the movie, and I really grew to like David after a while - although it took until he was left at the bottom of the swimming pool, and then made to survive for himself. I was nearly in tears at those bits, and couldn't understand why his `mommy' left him outside in the big, bad world to fend for himself. She, after all, was the one who `activated' him, to make him love her or something like that. And she couldn't put him back to the company who made him, as he'd get destroyed. The whole section where she tries to leave him in the middle of god-knows-where, is very heartwrenching, as David desperately clings to her. David seems to do a lot of ""clinging"" in this movie, whether it's following the mother around, trying to protect himself, or attaching himself to Jude Law, which provides a hilarious line from Jude: ""Well, it's certainly my good fortune running into you!""Jude Law isn't one of my favourite actors, and seems to appear more in the press than in relatively good movies. He was great in this though, whether it was playing a robot that would give women lots of ""pleasure"", or the connection he had with David. Despite not wanting to be taken where David was going, he couldn't get David to let go of his hand, and they ended up becoming the most unlikely friends. Even ""Gigolo Joe"" helped David in the end. I thought his `story' was never resolved, although it's most likely he ended up in a flesh fair. So not fair.I found this film to be rather jumpy, and it jumped almost abruptly, skipping periods of time. I was left unsatisfied at the end of the movie, although I'm glad that the relationship between David and his `mommy' was resolved at the end. It's a very sad ending.This movie had big similarities to Bicentennial Man, and also The Wizard Of Oz - the whole going to see Doctor Know, to find the Blue Fairy, is similar to going to find the ""wonderful wizard of oz"". And obviously, Pinocchio. There's even some parallels with Blade Runner where the robots are ostracised.The star of this movie? In my opinion, it isn't Jude Law or even the adorable (yet bratty to begin with) Haley Joel Osment. Instead, it's the absolutely gorgeous, the number one Supertoy, Teddy! (I want one!!) I thought he was adorable, and was the star of this movie. I can't tell you how many times I watched the scene where Martin &amp; David are trying to get Teddy to come to one of them. And as soon as he sees the mother, he's off shouting ""Mommy! Mommy!"" It's also so cute how he runs. Or when he get separated from David at the flesh fair, he keeps asking ""Where's David? Can you help me find David? Are you taking me to David?"" Or when that device is scanning him at the flesh fair and he puts on this little growly face! Awww! The end scene featuring him, is the saddest ever. What happened to him?I'm not sure what to think of this movie. I enjoyed it, but I found myself not being able to understand what was going on a lot of the time. It's not a film I would watch again, and it's also an incredibly long film, feels a lot longer than the 2 hours 20 minutes it actually is.And my final thought for this review is: ""Mommy! Mommy!"""	3.0	&quot;I'm a real live boy!&quot;	2004-05-21	4	3	1

So starts his journey to find a blue fairy (fairy tale) which he never finds, to become human.

To anyone who read Brian Aldiss' original story it is painfully clear this film is an attempt to explain the riddles and complex philosophical questions raised in the original story rather than to simply tell a story. The transition between Kubrick's film/vision and Spielberg's film/vision is entirely obvious. It's almost as though there are two films in one. The second part of the film, after the mechanical boy is abandoned in the woods by his ""mother"", attempts to explain the first part by paralleling the story with the mythical story of Pinocchio. This attempt, in my opinion, is the fundamental flaw of this movie. It somehow transformed a film with depth into a 2-dimensional circus of sights and sounds, a road movie that ends up at the bottom of the ocean, a conglomeration of Spielberg's usual schtick. This movie subverted itself with it's own imagery. If you don't believe me, read Brian Aldiss' original short story.

Yes, it is a &quot;think movie&quot; and does not come across to me as a kiddie film, at all.It deals with morals, ethics, and of course unconditional love.  &quot;A.I.&quot; is like Pinocchio, except with a much more mature twist and entangling story. It does run around 2 and half hours, so if you want to absorb the film I would do it when you could really sit down and watch it without interruption.Another element I enjoyed about &quot;A.I.&quot; is the mixture of Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick. I don't know how to explain it, but the movie plays as if they both were in the directing chair. As if they compromised with every scene. You can definitely feel the Kubrick-essence of the film.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	Guaranteed, the sight of the wonderful Haley Joel Osment begging his mommy not to leave him in the forest is one of the most tearjerking moments in recent film history.  It is in these first 40 minutes or so that the heart of this movie is established.  Osment, Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor deliver impeccable performances that put the viewer in their clutches.  However, once the movie leaves this behind and ventures out into David's search for the Blue Fairy, we get a combination of so many classics like Star Wars, Blade Runner, etc., that the movie starts to lose its heart.  Jude Law is fine as Gigolo Joe, but he is so plasticized that he never connects.  William Hurt as the inventor of the boy robot comes across as some kind of warped Gepetto who doesn't even love his creation.The special effects are flawless and Spielberg's ET sense of wonder abounds.  Doesn't the space balloon remind you of the moon in ET?  The movie becomes a special effects festival thereafter, and even when David gets his wish of one day with his mother, she is so vacuous and sterile you wonder what the joy is.I'm certainly in awe of the technical superiority of this film, but still felt a little empty when it was over.	4.0	PINOCCHIO REVISITED	2004-06-17	3	2	1

It's wonderfully emotional when you get down to the basic story of a child's need for the love of his mother to feel complete, regardless of his design (human or not).What I didn't like, and what still separates Kubrick from Spielberg, was the typically repetitive way in which Spielberg always feels that he needs to explain everything to the (stupid) audience along the way.  Kubrick does not need to explain, we get it.  And if we don't, it makes for good discussion or the need to watch again.Perfect example is how David clearly calls Monica ""Monica"" before reading the seven words, then calling her ""Mommy"" afterwards.  That's totally unnecessary.  Or the way Jigolo Joe holds his finger up for us all to see the blood coming from his customer.  Or the irrational change of attitude from Henry regarding his excitement of bringing David home to his later resentment of the ""robot"" when the mother takes to him (wasn't that his intention?).  Or the assumption that if a programmed robot can love, then it can hate (how?  it's programmed to love).There are umpteen examples of this.  Steven just needs to give his audience a little more credit, and think things through a little better as to not just push the story along in a convenient manner so we can get to its conclusion.  He did add alot of Kubrick elements and true Kubrick fans will know what they are.Overall, a great film, although you have to take interest in the subject matter to appreciate it.  I don't think the general (stupid) audiences, who just want horror and blood these days, want to take the time to appreciate what Steven has done here."	4.0	typical spielberg, not a kubrick movie	2009-10-06	3	1	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A26UZ7UQWAHAVJ	Michael Hatzenbuehler	Stephen Spielberg would have done better with a willingness to make a longer movie out of A.I. Artificial Intelligence.  There was so much more that could have been done with this fine idea for a film.  This is somewhat out of the normal genre for a Spielberg film, being the byproduct of a Stanley Kubrick idea.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kubrick passed away before much collaboration between him and Mr. Spielberg could take place.Haley Joel Osment is, in keeping with his abilities, wonderfully convincing in this role.  His acting is so innocent and pure that it is difficult to believe that the boy in the movie and the boy that is playing him are really separate.  The supporting work performed by Jude Law is outstanding and provides a much needed comic aspect to the film.  Most of the other supporting acting is forgettable, with small parts being assigned to relative unknowns.Special effects and set design is engaging.  Makeup and costume is believable.  The soundtrack is superb, as John Williams lends his considerable talent to this film.  Cinematography and directoral styling is clean, typical of a Spielberg product.  The one area of needed improvement would be in film flow.  There are a number of scenes that could use more material, more dialogue.  It feels as though there was too much film that got left on the editing booth floor.In the end, this &quot;Pinocchio&quot; story is entertaining and evokes emotion in many of the most jaded viewers.  Recommended for fans of fairy tale stories.	4.0	Some missing elements	2004-04-26	2	0	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3O8XFP3N8UP4H	Michael	It received mixed reviews when first released in 2001 but I think that A.I. is Steven Spielberg's most unique film. After the passing of Stanley Kubrick, who had been developing the project since the early 1980s, Spielberg taking on the task of bringing it to the screen may have made some skeptical but he delivers a film that is powerful and at times challenging. Many critics pointed out that the ending that appears in the film isn't Kubrick's but Spielberg says otherwise. Either way, it's an ending that I prefer and I don't think it's completely understood. It's not a happy ending as much as it is bittersweet. Taking place millions of years in the future where the human race is extinct and super meccas rule the world where they provide an illusion of David's dream of becoming a real boy and receiving the love from his mother for only one day. It's more emotionally honest than anything else and leaves the audience on a tragic but hopeful note. Combining Kubrick's mystery and questioning with Spielberg's heartfelt sentimentality, it's a haunting experience that left me deeply moved for hours after viewing it.	5.0	Steven Spielberg's most unique film.	2014-03-21	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	I was greatly disappointed by &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,&quot; the science fiction spectacle from director Steven Spielberg. In the film, a robot boy named David (played by Haley Joel Osment) embarks across a futuristic earth in a quest to attain humanity--think of him as a sort of high-tech Pinocchio. Unfortunately, neither Osment's sympathetic performance nor some stunning visual effects can save the film from a terribly flawed script.Many of the sequences in &quot;A.I.&quot; (most notably the &quot;Flesh Fair&quot;) have a stagy, forced feel to them. And the film has many other flaws. The actors who play David's human family give annoying, whiny performances; with such an obnoxious family, one wonders why David wants to be human at all. The voiceover narration in the film seems like a clumsy crutch for the messed-up script.And then there's the film's final sequence. I don't want to give anything away, but I found the final leg of David's quest to be ridiculous.There are many good points to &quot;A.I.&quot;: the performances of Osment and co-star Jude Law, as well as the frequently amazing visuals. But ultimately the film raises issues about love, technology, and consciousness which it fails to address in a satisfying way. Frankly, the issues raised in the film have been handled better in many episodes of the syndicated TV series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; in which actor Brent Spiner had the regular role of the android Data. Despite its flaws, however, I think that &quot;A.I.&quot; is worth seeing.	3.0	A disappointing exploration of a fascinating topic	2001-08-12	5	2	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AE9O506V6FLLT	Michael McDaid	Artificial Intelligence is an interesting journey of a boy named David(Haley Joel Osment) as he tries so hard to be a real boy. And it's a film of journey as we watch him try to get back to his mom.David is a product of Dr. Hobby(William Heard) who decides that they must create a robot that can love. They have shown that they can create robots who can feel pain, but none have had the ability to love anyone. And one of the interesting questions is asked in the movie by one of the students he is talking to, &quot;What if the human doesn't love the robot back?&quot; Which is the problem that Dr. Hobby doesn't really touch upon. Monica is given David(the prototype) from her husband, since their son is terminally sick. Monica at first is not to happy with this gift, and fears it. After time though she starts to play with it and talk with it. She finally decides to program it to love. David then bonds to his mom. But then her son gets better. After he comes home the son makes David do bad things, and David messes up a couple of times. They then separate David from his family. And this is where the journey starts as David just wants to find the Blue Fairy to become a real boy so his mom will love him. The Blue Fairy is from Pinnochio and he thinks she is real. This journey is the best part of the movie though at times a little long at times. The movie is great and it has a lot of Pinnochio elements to it. And Spielberg does a good job of making Kubrick's vision live.The DVD contains many featurettes, some trailers, and behind the scences looks.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A21EZ3M5XP4A6O	Michael Paulsen	I have to wonder how this movie would have been treated by the late Stanley Kubrick -- it was to be his next project after EYES WIDE SHUT. Instead, A.I. was approached by the unquestionably talented Steven Spielberg. Unfortunately, the movie plays out like a strange fairy tale dream, including yet another -- and entirely overused -- reference to Pinocchio (recall CE3K?).  (How many times did they need to refer to the &quot;Blue Fairy&quot;?)Overall, A.I. is all a bit too unsatifying and downright bizarre -- you'll know what I mean when you see the final 30 minutes, which will have you scratching your head. I got the feeling that this sequence was almost added as an afterthought.Spielberg's fascination (dare I say obsession?) with the innocence and wonder of childhood is admirable, but only the first hour involving the family comes off as having any depth and warmth ... in fact, you almost forget that you're watching a futuristic sci-fi movie. The remainder of the film is chilly, surreal and somewhat cheesy sci-fi (e.g., the annoying &quot;Flesh Fair&quot; [a monster truck rally for the late 21st century? And we still got rednecks!], the ridiculous &quot;Dr. Know&quot; scene). There's definitely a lot of retread of BLADE RUNNER throughout. None of the side characters are well developed with the exception of Teddy, the mechanical teddy bear! Even Jude Law's &quot;mecha&quot; character seems out of place and almost unnecessary. There's never any real bonding between him and David after escaping the Flesh Fair. After peering into the lives of mecha David's family, we are swept away to Act II where things, quite frankly, take a turn for the worse. The storytelling is cold and distant (perhaps intentionally), and in the end, even the warmth, emotions and sentimentality seem artificial.	3.0	Strange, touching (at times) but ultimately disappointing	2002-05-24	6	3	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A28GUL66KVW04J	Michael P.	The morality of this movie is spelled out in the beginning of this movie; therefore, I don't think that's the main plot (or the question) of this extraordinarily &quot;crafted&quot; movie.  The real question, I believe, here is what makes us human.  Not only David (Haley Osment) was made to love his parents as any other &quot;real&quot; children but also to persue his own dreams which in this case is a fairytale.  But aren't most our dreams like that -- especially our childhood dreams?  In this sense, David got his wish, even if it was only for a day.  Perhaps he continued to &quot;dream&quot; at the end with his mother on his side.The first question, &quot;can a human love a robot,&quot; is then answered with Monica, David's mother, saying, &quot;I have always loved you,&quot; at the end.This movie is remarkably inspirational and is a very good portrayal of humanity.  If you are after SCI-FI action movies, however, this is not for you.	5.0	&quot;Steven Spielberg's A.I. Is Extraordinary&quot;	2004-02-14	5	4	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A24NTFR73UE2XB	Michael Pierce	This movie is truly amazing.  A astonishing sight to look at, a wonderful story told.  This is a challenging film.  Most people who like straight forward films fed to them, without any thinking probably won't care for this one.  A lot of people thought it went on too long, and the first time I saw it I felt the same.  But after viewing it again, I realized it was done the right way.  I mean, COME ON, it's a film from STEVEN SPIELBERG from a project orginally started by STANLEY KUBRICK.  That alone makes it worth the price of admission.  If you surrender your self to the cinematic beauty of this underrated film, then you'll find something truly wonderous.	5.0	Brilliant	2002-03-12	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1RKJS2JA5VD0Z	Michael Toland	If a brilliant filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick couldn't figure out what do with the Brian Aldiss short story from which this film is adapted, a talented commercial hack like Steven Spielberg doesn't stand a chance. It's as if Spielberg couldn't bear to throw out any of his old friend's ideas, regardless of whether they fit into the story or not. Thus the film takes several bizarre turns; it's really three different films crammed together into one tiny space. Intriguing characters like Professor Hobby are introduced only to never be fully developed; the same with what should have been thought-provoking issues of man vs. machine and the true nature of love.But this is a Spielberg film we're talking about, and Spielberg never let narrative flow or logic get in the way of a cool shot or clever line, so the story quickly becomes irreparably muddled. Plus it's quite obvious he (and probably Kubrick) had no idea how to end the film, so we get a bizarre and unsettlingly Oedipal sequence at the end that seems to have wandered in from another film entirely. There are several good scenes, especially in the first hour, but they don't fit together into a coherent whole. The acting is excellent across the board but if the characters have no real reason to be present it doesn't matter how good a job the actor does - Jude Law is very good as Gigolo Joe, but his part could have been cut without any loss to the plot, and the talking Teddy bear is nothing more than a plot contrivance.It's as if Spielberg took every idea Kubrick had for this film and threw them up on the screen without working out the fine details. It's stunning visually but ultimately frustrating for its wasted potential. It doesn't follow its own internal logic. If you insist on seeing it, don't think too hard about what you're seeing or you'll start grinding your teeth.	2.0	Don't believe the hype	2001-07-02	1	1	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2R9J5LULVKF6T	Michael T. Rognlien	On one hand, A.I. is a beautifully shot movie, with excellent cinemetography, great use of technology and special effects, and a high caliber of acting on behalf of all of the main characters.On the other hand, I walked out of the movie wondering what exactly the point of all of it was?  The plot and details behind the movie were kept secret for so long that the main thing that drew me to the film was the fact that it was a posthumous collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrik, both excellent filmmakers in their own right.But the movie failed on one major point for me (and for the 3 friends who joined me) - I didn't really care about any of the characters because they were not developed.The limited previews for the movie indicated that it was about a mechanical boy who was built to love, but of all the things involved in the story of the movie, there was no love (and hardly any affection) at all.I felt misdirected as to the purpose of the movie from its limited advertising and reviews, so I suppose I felt let down when it failed to meet my expectations.  The ending was way too long and drawn out (we actually started to get up at one point in the film when we thought it was over) and by the time it really did end, the movie had lost me and I no longer cared about the resolution of the story.It'd be a nice rental, I suppose, but only when you're in the mood to see a visually impressive but an overall dark and very disturbing movie about the search for love and acceptance in the postmodern world.	3.0	Not quite sure what to think..	2001-07-05	5	4	1

Artificial Intelligence"" (2001)I think we all know that carrying on Stanley Kubrick's dream idea is going to be a challenge.... Fortunately Speilberg pulls off a great directing job, but I just get the feeling that Kubrick would not be very happy with this movie.Lets start with the bad things. The whole script and story is like ""Pinocchio 2: And No, It's Not By Disney! It's by Steven Speilberg! ...Let's see why, shall we? Haley Joel Osment plays a robot that wants to be a real boy! There is actually a blue fairy in this film. I actually heard a few people sighing every time Haley muttered ""I wish I was a real boy."" Steven, we've seen this story don't before, and much better!... The Flesh Fair was so incredibly ...[stupid] that I found myself having to grab onto the chair without rolling into the aisles with laughter. Rouge City, meant to be like a robot's version of Las Vegas, is really horrid to look at. The people and things Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and David (Osment) encounter in this nicely designed but blindly bright and entirely unbelievable are really just dumb. Especially that professor that pops out of a computer. Does the script actually try to be this stupid?The thing that most audiences have complained about with A.I. Artificial Intelligence is the ending. I couldn't agree more with those who walked out with frustrated looks on their face. The whole concept of the ending is empty and dumb, I found it very hard to take seriously. The movie finishes on a very anti-climatic note and I couldn't thought up 20 better places where the movie could've finished.Luckily, there are some good points that save A.I. Artificial Intelligence from being completely and utterly disastrous. The acting is spectacular. Haley Joel Osment is actually better in this movie than he was in The Sixth Sense. He deserves a Best Actor trophy this year. Frances O'Connor, who grows on me more with each movie, gives a career-best as the confused and bewildered mother. O'Connor is amazing subtle and sympathetic in this movie and all the great parts of the movie have her in it. I was disappointed with Jude Law's performance. Although he was a very good robot, his character was boring and his performance didn't provide any real screen presence or interest.The visuals and makeup in this movie are better than any robot movie I have ever seen. Rogue City does look terribly stupid and that is where the visuals go wrong, but throughout the rest of the movie the effects were quite stunning. The makeup on the robots was very original and detailed....  As much as I really wanted to like A.I. Artificial Intelligence, to me it came off as one of the stupidest films of the year, with some sequences that just make you think - ""Mr. Kubrick, Sir...was this really your idea?""MY GRADE: C-"	2.0	Pinocchio 2...	2002-04-08	2	0	2

The clear and colorful photography is captured perfectly on this disk, and it looks as great on the smaller screen as it does on the big screen.I liked this film a lot better the second time around. The first time I saw it I felt bored and annoyed with some of the sequences. The ""Flesh Fair"" sequence in particular was quite weak. I also disliked the obvious ""real kid dislikes the fake kid"" bit, and the ""we have to get rid of the fake kid for the better good of the family"" stuff. Although it is essential to the plot, it just seemed a bit too manufactured for me.On the positive side, it is a thoughtful picture that is an interesting take on humanity's attitudes, prejudice, and the universal need for love. Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment are fantastic as individuals and as a team. Their chemistry is great. Visually, as I mentioned before, the film is a winner. It just looks absolutely beautiful. The sets, costumes, digital landscapes, and so forth are top-notch.I guess it shouldn't have suprised me that critics and audiences in general bashed this film, in an era where a great picture like ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" is not appreciated.

Is it ""hard"" sci-fi, like ""Blade Runner?"" Is it Spielbergian fantasy like ""E.T.?"" Or is it, at its heart, ""Pinocchio?""The result is as mired in identity crisis as something like Disney's ""The Black Cauldron"" -- technically excellent, but ultimately unaffecting and confusing.Despite Spielberg pulling every heart-tugging scene out of his bag of tricks, and some infectiously sweet performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, we can't totally bond with the characters because we can't identify with the movie as a whole.It's not terrible. It's certainly watchable, at points it's likeable and Spielberg is always good at evoking an emotional response from his audience.But on the whole, it's somewhat like what would have resulted if someone had asked ""Charlie Brown"" creator Charles Schulz to finish a Monet.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3M1NNDD95HR0R	Mike Smith	Stanley Kubrick had something to do with this story, and Steven Spielberg was very involved in making the film, so you know it's going to be interesting.  Haley Joel Osment plays a highly advanced robot looking to receive love and so goes on a quest to become real so his human mother will love him.  He believes that the blue fairy from popular children's literature actually exists, and can transform him.  Along the way he teams up with Jude Law's character, also a highly advanced (a lover model) robot, and Teddy, a stuffed bear supertoy that can see, hear, walk, and talk.  Rather than tell you what happens every step of the way, let me just say that this movie is brilliant, and tugs at your heartstrings in a big way.  I cried, saw it again, and cried again.  It helps if you are a Sci-Fi fan, but if you are not, you will probably still enjoy it.  The ending is quite unexpected, but goes extremely well with the movie.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	"A clumsy prologue sets the tone for the entire film.  William Hurt, addressing what first appears to be a classroom but turns out to be a boardroom, identifies the need for a ""mecha"" (for mechanical, as opposed to organic) boy capable of true love.  His speech, and the Ben Kingsley narration that precedes it, is the clumsiest bit of exposition I've heard in a long time.  There is nothing poetic or interesting in his words; it is just information.  The remainder of the movie falls into much the same trap.The first act follows a mecha child, David, as he learns to understand his new ""orga"" family.  Haley Joel Osment (as David) does wonders with these scenes, playing them rather creepily.  Can you name another child actor who can construct a character as thoughtfully or as skillfully as him?  He is consistent and solid throughout the whole thing, bringing a sense of realism (even in fantastic situations) to everything he does.  That being said, the rest of the act is a mishmash of Kubrickian and Spielbergian, a mix that doesn't go down smoothly.  Kubrick peddled analytical coldness, whereas Spielberg peddles fairy tales.  One style would tend to cancel the other out, and that's just what happens here.  Spielberg does a fine job emulating Kubrick's languid pacing (a trait that always bored me in Kubrick's own work), but he drowns it all in his trademark beatific lighting.  I also felt very conscious of Spielberg's shot selection, consistently framing Osment in very telling ways (one notable shot had him seemingly wearing the kitchen light fixture as a halo).  Spielberg is usually more subtle and confident in his shots.  Here, I felt like he was trying to slam them down my throat.  Or maybe trying to prove something to the late Mr. Kubrick.The second act introduces Jude Law as the lover mecha Gigolo Joe.  Law is usually a fascinating actor to watch, whether it's for his talent or his physical beauty.  He uses both to great effect here.  Although the character is underwritten and is used as nothing more than a crude plot device, Law injects some much-needed energy and a sense of fun into the film.Spielberg actually lets loose in these sections concocting three stunning visual sequences.  The first involves decimated mechas roaming a scrap heap for spare parts, only to be hunted down by envoys from the Flesh Fare looking for sacrifices.  There's one stunning shot of a moon rising over the horizon.  Ominously as it turns out, in a neat renunciation of Spielberg's most famous ""E.T."" shot.  The second sequence is the Flesh Fare itself.  It has rightly been called one of the darkest sequences Spielberg has ever put on film.  Too bad this section was not explored more.  The third sequence involves a trip to Rouge City, kind of a futuristic red-light district.  It's like Vegas, only tackier (if you can believe that).  There are some stunning pieces of sexually suggestive architecture that make you forget for a moment that you're watching a Spielberg film.The final act is misguided, let alone unwelcome.  On the former note, and as many have said before, it is a typical Spielberg ending.  He appears unwilling (or unable) to end the movie on a down note, and thus pushes the deux es machinas panic button.  On the latter note, he's already given us a serviceable enough ending, one that truly cements the nature (and futility) of David's quest to become a real boy (which reminds me: We get that this is an update of the Pinocchio story, Steve; you don't have to keep reminding us ad infinitum).  It would have been a truly sad and perfect ending to a movie that desperately needed one.  Unfortunately, it went on for another half-hour, making me more angry and bored by the minute.  Even though the visual imagery in this section is breathtaking and poetic, it truly stomps all over whatever good faith the rest of the narrative has built up.Other than Osment and Law, none of the rest of the cast does anything to interesting.  Frances O'Connor, who is essentially the third lead, spends too much time in a melancholy and emotional coma.  She is such an ignorant character you wonder why David was so desperate to return to her.  A supertoy Teddy bear (named Teddy, natch) has some inspired moments, just not enough.  And there's a voiceover cameo by Robin Williams that does little to enhance the movie, other than allowing you to remember how funny he was as the Genie in ""Aladdin"".Spielberg has made an ambitious but messy movie that will surely appeal to those in his audience content with superficial and unanswered questions.  Those hoping for a little more from his talents will surely be displeased.  Not to mention bored."	2.0	A.I.: Artist's Identity-Crisis	2002-02-20	4	2	2

The film also does a good job of showing the robot boy's quest to be a ""real"" human and shows how in our technlogical age we have cruel contempt for this race of robots and discard them the way we dump our computers every three years or so. Since we wouldn't care for the boy robot or the other film's robots unless they existed, at least on some level, as human, we must ask if the robots are sympathetic and humanized sufficiently in the script. I say yes. The film succeeds at making the robot race credible as a metaphor for the way we treat the misfits, the underclass, and all those helpless people we exploit at our own convenience.So why only three stars? Because after 100 minutes of gripping drama, the film descends into a 45 minute sermon on the human race's moral failings. The script keeps clubbing us over the head with a pompous sanctimonious voice over, spoken in a pretentious British accent, that goes on and on about the human race's ""failed experiment.""For two better films about the moral struggles we face with technlogy, I recommend  Gattaca and Brazil."	3.0	Good Ideas but Ending Too Long	2005-04-16	4	2	2

Pinocchio, I know. But it is the sci-fi side to that story with a really dark theme to it.Along for the ride is Jude Law, who plays Gigolo Joe, and Teddy- David's (Osment) mechanical robot teddy bear.Steven Spielberg's version of Stanley Kubrick's 1984 plot idea, turned out to be a fascinating motion picture, in my eyes.  The one mistake Spielberg made in this film, was the end, which isn't too shabby, but makes you think too hard, as an inevitable destiny of mechas control the world two-thousand years from now.  I know the end is bad, but not terrible.  I thought, when David was able to spend his last day with his mother in the year 5000 A.D. or so, that was a real impact to the story.  The women will really cry for Haley Joel Osment's tear jerking, Best Actor worthy performance as the mistook young robot who is basically in search for the love returned from someone else, that he was built to give to everyone.Steven Spielberg, again triumphs as a director.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3RNV9JA553B17	MJV & The Movies	4 1/2 stars is what I give this film.SPIELBERG's latest creation since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, A.I., the new science fiction version of Pinocchio, will raise eyebrows, drop a few mouths wide open, get you on the edge of your seat, and make the tears fall from your eyes, then you get to the last twenty five minutes and your brain freezes in &quot;HUH&quot;???In A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, young robot David, the new prototype of the future, the young robo-boy programmed to love (Haley Joel Osment) becomes a new member of the family after a father who's son is in a coma, brings him home one day to his wife. Of course his wife brings the typical question &quot;How can you replace your own son?&quot;, and then eventually the boy awakens from his coma, and David and the kid don't get along with each other. Or at least, the boy doesn't get along with David. So after some dangerous happenings, David is left in the wilderness with his robotic Teddy, and joins forces with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and they go in search of the BLUE FAIRY, the one who will turn David into a real boy so his mommy will love him again.MY REVIEW:&quot;This movie is obviously the number one questioned movie of the summer, being it had a great story and great acting, it was heading towards the goal of being the best movie of the summer, possibly the year, and then there's this ending that just says- &quot;What are you thinking Spielberg? What kind of ending was that?!!!&quot; Through the first two hours though, the film is very positive and &quot;touchy&quot;. Haley Osment's performance is great, Gigolo Joe's character is good as well, but somewhat different from what you'd expect. But basically, this new version of Pinocchio heads in the right direction but makes a sharp turn down &quot;Whoa! What the heck happened? What is this?&quot; avenue. Basically everything pans out perfectly until the end. Osment's performance is Oscar Worthy, and this film is Oscar worthy, if only they made a quick remake of the end. But, I'm not saying the movie is bad, it is very good, it's just a one-of-a-kind film that raises questions a lot, and still will ten years from now when the new generation comes along and sees this movie. So check this film out for being that &quot;one-in-a-million-film&quot; because it is good, just be warned that the ending, which we all know is odd-spoken.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1CZEOJEMYKQ09	M. maqsood	This movie shook me to the core. For days, even weeks, I was totally traumatized by the ending. A lot of people talk about how the film's about the love between a mother and son, or robot and human, but to me the allegory can apply to any love. The message I took home from the ending was traumatingly painful. If you have ever experienced unrequited love, and if you carry this burden with you everyday, only then will you really appreciate what David is going through. I have never felt more despair, depression, bleakness and hopelessness in my life than after watching this movie. But the premise, however cruel, rings absolutely true: you can love someone who doesn't return the feeling, and move heaven and earth to get them to love you back, but in the end the only place your deepest desire will come true is in your dreams.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1E15WYG9C47X1	"""mobby_uk"""	One thing I would like to comment on, is the fact that this film was touted as being the project that Stanley Kubrick wanted to make before his death. And after watching AI, I would safely say that with Speilberg it turned out to be less 2001 and more ET and Pinnochio,less thought provoking masterpiece as I suspect it would have turned out to be from a genuis like Kubrick, and more sentimental dribble that a very talented director like Speilberg finds himself trapped in lately.Is Speilberg overrated? I don't think so, for films like  Duel,Jaws and Colour Purple(in my opinion his best film to date and a cinematic masterpiece) demonstrates a very able and talented artist, yet he seems to have lost it lately.Haley Joel Osment as the robot kid with human emotions is one of the best child actors around today, and delivers his role flawlessly. Jude Law is also one of the best Brit exports today, an actor with immense capabilites..Yet what I have problems with is the script which seems to be lost between sentimentality and epic scale science fiction. The marriage of these two is very delicate and the right balance should have been found, given the subject matter, which alas was not found here.Speilberg's direction seems uneven, the first half being the more coherent, the second a bit lost.Yet the DVD itself is of top quality and full of extras to satisfy any digital afficiando.A disappointing film on all counts, and a lost opportunity to film and understand Kubrick's vision, by a director that I know can make much better movies, if only he sheds the excessive sentimentality that has become a staple of his moveimaking of late.	2.0	Lost Opportunity	2003-04-19	1	0	1

But when that child surprisingly revives, David is no longer wanted! David, and his only companion, an adorable robot Teddy Bear who is basically the Jiminy Cricket character of the picture, are abandoned by the ""mother"" they had come to love. David becomes obsessed with the story of Pinocchio, and the idea that if he finds the Blue Fairy of the story, she can make him into a real boy. He then embarks on a quest to do just that, with no discerning between fairytale and reality. In his search he experiences  things quite similar to those Pinocchio experienced in his adventures, only in A.I. they are giving a much darker, downright sadder interpretation.The film moves rather slowly, and it is pretty darn depressing most of the time, but it is nonetheless fascinating to behold! The ending is possibly supposed to be happy, bittersweet more likely, but overall one might find it rather disturbing. I would not call this a film for kids, but definitely everyone who is old enough to handle the dark concepts should experience it. That's exactly what it is, an experience.

Some trustworthy friends said &quot;It is amazing&quot; others said &quot;it was awful&quot;...so I decided to check it out for myself. I like Steven Spielbergs work, I love Haley Joel Osments talent for characterizing each person he plays, and Jude Laws special flair. I sat down wondering whether this would be a dark &quot;flesh fair&quot; for 2 and 1/2 hours, or a lighter yet introspective comedy. It was a delightful combination of both. It had periods of Kubrick's serious, dark light shed upon the human race, combined with Spielbergs joy of storytelling. Though it isn't without flaws (a few false endings), it was overall a job very well done.Haley Joel Osment's performance was not only touching and amazing, but it also had the depth and quality that you would expect from Kevin Spacey or Tom Hanks. He incorporated his youthful innocence with the darkness of the world surrounding him. His performance deserves and Oscar nod, if not a standing ovation. Jude Law once again showed his amazing talent to morph into whatever character he is assigned. He changed his identity and even looks just by acting. The two of the combined make a dramatic powerhouse which is so natural that you don't notice what a wonderful job these two actors are doing until after.AI was truly a one-of-a-kind movie. It was very hard to distinguish what the rating should have been. PG seems to young, and R seems to old, yet PG-13 seems somehow wrong. It has a depth to it that puts it out of place. I think it is as appropriate as it could be. A thinker, not doubt, but a classic in its own time.	5.0	Unique, Special.	2001-07-06	2	2	0

Kubricks vision and Spielbergs directing did not seem to merge as well as I had hoped giving 2 different visions of the same story, which basically lead to sections of the film that didn't fit with what had gone before. The saving grace of this muddled yet moving film was the central performance by Osment, who was absolutely amazing as David, showing love, comfusion and pain so easily for such a young actor it was scary.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A35W8YODBDETHR	Mr. Gavin	Starts okay but ultimately ghastly.The early scenes are the best. I loved the edgy atmosphere between roboboy David and his 'real life' brother. The robot gets jealous and starts trying to do his brother in. And one truly memorable scene, where David answers the phone, and transmits the message, live, through his own body. Eek! At that point, I thought it would turn out fine, and my female companion forecast lots of blubbing to come.Also I have to stick up for Frances O'Connor who I thought gave a commendable performance as the torn mother, and alone amongst the cast showed some restraint. However through bad editing we miss any rationale for why or how she bonds with the thing - one second she's icing him out, the next she's suddenly reading out the imprint code to make him permanent. Did I miss something?You know the moment, the very second it goes wrong, with a graunching, sickening lurch. David starts quoting the Pinnocchio fable as opposed to living and moving within it, the grand facade crumples in a heap, and never recovers. Maybe you should tattoo it on my forehead, just in case I didn't get it. After that it just goes from bad to worse.The Flesh Fair is on the verge of acid-bathing him, when the mong-like rent-an-extra audience do a miraculous 360 about turn and rise up to rescue him - hurling what appear to be small bean bags at the ringmaster. Ouch, ouch, he says - don't hit me. The worst crowd scene I have ever witnessed on film.Jude Law appears and disappears for no apparent reason. There is no interaction or journey of learning between the two escapees - they just string along together without insight or incident as the story limps from one place to another.And the pinnocchio allegory gets ever more irritating until you start to wonder whether it wouldn't actually be more fun to indulge in a little light woodwork.Finally - the multiple endings, each one worse than the last. Truly the whiff of desperate script conferences is in the air. Umm, what next. We're stuck. Okay - fast forward a coupla thousand years. Okay - the world turns to ice. Like it. And some aliens come. And they rescue him from the bottom of the sea. The end! No - let's do some more. Let's bring his mum back to life. The end! No let's kill her again. etc.......All accompanied by an astonshingly bad voiceover, in the worst English accent I've heard since Dick Van Dyke - presumably to lend some bogus air of poshness.They should have left him gawping up from the bottom of the sea. This would be a reasonable ending but Spielberg has to lever in a happy end.If Blade Runner was the Ben and Jerry's of dystopian sci-fi robots-who-yearn-to-be-real flicks, and Gattaca was the enjoyable own-label Sainsbury's version, then AI ranks as a 1973 Lyons Maid rectangular brick on a soggy wafer.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0	Mr G Bowden	&quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; has caused a lot strenuous frissions from Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg aficionados, most of them wanting to wash the film off of their idols' filmographies. The truth is, both filmmakers are guilty of the charms/trials (whatever you prefer) that &quot;A.I.&quot; serves its audience. Kubrick's influence is evident in the dark sexual undertones of the story's settings and locations as well as the head-scratchingness of the film's ending. Spielberg, meanwhile, meshes his artistic and commercial qualities, and bears most resemblence to &quot;Empire Of The Sun&quot; than any of his other films.The film's screenwriting and directing credits rightfully belong to Spielberg though, as in spite of Kubrick's name on the credits, &quot;A.I.&quot; is like many of Spielberg's blockbusters in its unashamed sentimentality. Not since &quot;An American Tail&quot;, possibly the evillest animated motion picture ever (and it was made by Spielberg!), has a diminutive child been placed in so much hazard and peril as Haley Joel Osment's David. However, Spielberg intelligently comments on the human condition with David's character in how humans treat and percieve him; is it right to treat a luxury item as bad as David's 'brother' does or should we even care about David's situation? Spielberg shows us what it is to love and also what makes us 'human', and whether emotions count us as being human or simply being. These questions, which many critics dismissed as pointless, are at the crux of the film, but it works best as a fairytale, which is certainly where it ends.Acting wise, if the role of David was given to an actor of questionable capability the whole project would fall flat on its face. Thankfully, Osment is every inch the pro and carries a two-and-a-half hour film incredibly well, and an Oscar nomination isn't unforseeable in my mind. The rest of the cast serve their roles well, particularly Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, who exudes cocky exhuberance and attractiveness even whilst looking like a like-size 1950s sci-fi action figure. And, yes, the teddy bear steals every scene the adorable little mite's in.Spielberg doesn't forget that he's making this film with Kubrick's fans in mind as well as his own, and imbues the film with many stylistic riffs from Kubrick films, including long, sustained steadicam shots and some sophisticated camera movements. I'd just like to finish with reference to where the film ends; I cried all of the way through the 'ending' and thought it was beautifully executed. True it's long and it's also true that Spielberg relies too much on voiceover to explain the story (though obviously not enough if critics misconstrued the ending as having 'aliens' in it!), but what remains is a stunningly told film. And it blows away every other film that was released this summer!	5.0	A Wonderful Film!	2001-12-02	31	28	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"This collaboration between Stephen Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick must be one of the more eagerly anticipated movies of recent years. It brings together the vision of two cinematic geniuses; Kubrick, a Director intent on examining the human psyche and Speilberg, a master of modern American cinema, who instinctively seems to know what his audience wants. Apparently good friends until Kubrick's death a couple of years back, this was a project they had been discussing filming for the previous ten years but is it any good? And has Spielberg succeeded in blending the seemingly poles apart vision of Kubrick with his own cinematic style? The answer is mostly yes and partly no.AI is a sentimental romantic sci-fi odyssey and it's also one of the saddest films in years. In an overpopulated world where the polar ice caps have melted, births are rationed to one per couple. When parents Monica and Henry Swinton's (Frances O'Connor & Sam Robards) son is apparently lost in an endless coma they are selected for the `adoption' of David (Hayley Joel Osment) an experimental `mecha' (robot) child. Initially David's prospective mother is freaked out by the idea but whilst still grieving for her apparently lost son, she soon becomes attached to David and takes the option of permanently encoding his circuits so that he will forever be tied to his mother. Everything seems to be going swimmingly only for the son Martin (Jake Thomas) to unexpectedly awake from his coma, which leads to David becoming a victim of his new brother's cruelty, his parents fears and now surplus to their requirements. Dumped into the wilderness with his super-toy Teddy, he goes on the run with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robo-rent-boy also on the lam after being framed for the hotel-room murder of one of his clients. David begins a Pinocchio type voyage of discovery in the hope of becoming a real boy and being reunited with his mother.Personally, I thought this was an excellent film and I have been quite shocked and surprised at some of the very harshly critical reviews I've read in the UK's broadsheet newspapers. A.I. may not perfect by any means but I found it to be an extremely thought provoking, moving and in turns incredibly beautiful and incredibly sad film. Whilst visually very much a Spielberg movie both visually (comparisons can be drawn in style to both Close Encounters and ET) and narratively (he unusually takes a screenplay credit), the Kubrick influences are clearly in evidence in the somewhat cold and sterile beginning and the intellectualised Pinocchio themed (what is the essence of humanity) backdrop of the movie. It's a movie about love that is at times in a very Kubrickian manner, cold to the touch.The CGI in this movie is nothing short of excellent and must have had ILM working overtime. Among the robots or `mechas' on show here are men and women with seamless half faces, eyeless sockets and heads that split open to show the androids inner workings. Also one of the most exciting and best things about the movie was Teddy, who was not just David's friend but also formed the true moral centre of the film. The effects were tremendous and if ever they can really invent such a toy, everybody will want one. Contrary to one review I read about the child acting being ""some of the sickliest ever filmed"" I think that Hayley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) was once again superb and I do not believe I have ever seen a more talented child actor. I'm also a big fan of Jude Law but one of my few criticisms of the film would have to be aimed at his character Gigolo Joe. Whilst I don't feel that there was anything wrong with Jude's acting, I did find Gigolo Joe at times irritating, such as when he tweaks his head to create his own supposedly romantic (but in actuality mood killing) music soundtrack. It could also be argued that much of Spielberg's vision of the future was contradictory and dated with three wheeled cars, overpopulated cities, a drowned New York but leafy countrysides but to be honest that is probably nit-picking.It would also be fair to say that A.I. has an overlong ending, with a bit of a tagged on feel, which is a little too saccharine sweet (a Spielberg weakness). However, coming so soon after September 11th the final sequence set in a future New York city flooded by melted ice-caps, with the Manhattan skyline reduced to bungalows in the sea and the Statue of Liberty's hand poking up through the waves was incredibly pertinent, incredibly moving and incredibly surreal. It was almost as if Spielberg had somehow foreseen some incredible tragedy and this was his portrayal of Manhattan in a vale of tears.Whilst not Spielberg's best work, it's certainly not that far off and maybe if Kubrick had been around to oversee production we would have had a masterpiece. Although, what Spielberg has given us is a movie which is disturbing, perplexing and incredibly sad. If you're not moved then you haven't got a heart."	4.0	TEDDY WANTED!!!	2002-02-13	18	12	6

The special effects were outstanding.  Add Spielberg's direction and Kubrick's concept and you have an idea of how visually delightful this film is.2 - Meaning which must be thought about.  Unlike most films, this has underline messages which isn't thrown in your face or handed to you on a silver platter.

It enables me to turn it on in my mind any time I wish to any part of it.  You think about values.  A whole lot.You develop compassion for what does not even exist.  You learn to wonder about whether or not........ any of this.And discrimination of this kind.If you have read any of the history of the English Royalty - specifically, the Plantaganets -  you will never again be horrified at what anyone does to anyone.  This includes the native Americans way back when people came and took their land from them;  what the Chinese or the Japanese cruelties were;  the Germans.  The Russians in the Cold War.  And on and on,So, how come I mention these things in reference to this movie?  What is wrong with human beings that they have to hate and feel threatened.  There!  That's it!  Somebody wants to be leader.  Somebody wants a leader to latch onto.  And here we see the same thing...Fear...THEY might take over...then where will we be??????????//Wow!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1XU7TMK6XVIYW	Nathan Schultz	I think people have terribly misunderstood this film.  This is not a film meant to be totally realistic. Watch it from start to finish, it's a fairy tale, it's a modern Pinocchio.  The audience who wants something based totally in reality need not watch this movie.  A.I. is a fairy tale at heart.  At the same time it is a dark and disturbing fairy tale that tried to point at our society and say &quot;look what can become of us.&quot;  It's a fairy tale with a point and worth a good look.A.I. is wondefully made and acted from start to finish.  Sit down and enjoy this story of the journey to be loved, which in a way is what everyone wants.  Steven Spielberg boldly took this movie and came out with a masterpiece.  He created a dark but beautiful film well made from acting to the photography.  Everything about A.I. is first rate.  Set aside the realism of current movies and watch a fairy tale; be drawn into a futuristic world where anything can happen.	5.0	So Misunderstood	2002-03-09	3	2	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1GTHUO4BOBWCR	Neildo	As a big Kubrick fan, I was excited to see this movie.  The first third of the movie was really well done (probably because it was the most Kubrikesque).  The emotional complexity was really intriguing.  Here you have an artificially created child who seems to exhibit human emotion, so you want to like him, yet he's just not quite human enough to really love.  Haley Joel Osment exhibits dynamic acting ability as the deadpan meta boy.  Very impressive.After setting up a great premise, the movie takes a ridiculous ride that refuses to end.  The focus shifts from an intriguing, intellectual film, to a futuristic chase movie.  This I found to be quite boring.  And just when you think the movie is about to end, it keeps going with a new weird twist, each more ludicrous than the previous.  And of course it ends with the classic Spielberg ending where all the loose ends are tied up a little too nicely.My analysis: the first hour is good Kubrick cinema, the last 90 minutes are Spielberg's hopeless attempts to imitate Kubrick.  Fans of this movie like it because they think it is so intellectual, but really only the first part is.  Anyone who has seen a good &quot;intellectual&quot; film would know this film does not belong in that category.  A.I. is not worth the time, you'd be much better off watching Blade Runner or Kubrick's 2001 Space Odessey.	2.0	Kubrick is rolling in his grave	2002-08-09	5	2	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A20ZFWGBY4REFX	"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan"""	It's like this, &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; is based on the 1969 short story, &quot;Super-Toys Last All Summer Long&quot; by Brian Aldiss. &quot;A.I.&quot; somewhat bears its similarities to &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) and was also a long-gestating project of legendary director Stanley Kubrick (&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;). Unfortunately, Kubrick died after his last project &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was filmed and he passed it along to his friend, director Steven Spielberg (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;). &quot;A.I.&quot; was, to me, a very challenging film for Spielberg and also, it was very enjoyable to watch if you look at it very carefully and not worrying about how long the film is, etc. The film's special effects and dazzling scenery was simply amazing, and its cast was very impressive. The film takes place in a future when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities, causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. Haley Joel Osment, one of the best young actors today, plays David, the first &quot;mecha&quot;, or robot of the future, designed to experience unconditional love. David is the &quot;son&quot; of grief-stricken Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), and her husband Henry (Sam Robards), an employee of the company that built the boy. David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son Martin, but when Martin recovers, David is abandoned and sets out to become &quot;a real boy&quot; worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way, he is befriended and mentored by a streetwise pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a talking &quot;super toy&quot; bear named &quot;Teddy&quot; by his side. David's adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style &quot;Flesh Fair&quot;, where mechas are destroyed for the amusement of humans by its leader, Lord Johnson-Johnson (Brendan Gleeson); Rouge City, where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and a submerged New York City, where David's creator, Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) reveals the secrets of the boy's creation. In closing, I just have to say that I've been waiting a very long time to see &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and that I thought it was a remarkable film to watch. I have to give a lot of credit to Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and Frances O'Connor for their outstanding performances, especially the character of &quot;Teddy&quot;, who has the most interesting part of this film. I now own the DVD of &quot;A.I.&quot;, with lots of features including behind-the-scenes featurettes, early &quot;Teddy&quot; footage, and much, much more! Like I said, this is the most questionable film of Spielberg's career that you should not ignore the film's accomplishments, but watch and learn from it.P.S. One more thing that I have to ask: &quot;Is this the Steven Spielberg who gave us &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;...or is he a mecha too?&quot;	5.0	The most questionable film of Steven Spielberg's career.	2002-03-07	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AB0H4BWB96B28	nick	This is another outstanding film from director Steven Spielberg. In certain parts of the movie, you can sense Kubrick's version of the movie.  Spielberg adds his own elements to the film.  Some people criticize it for being depressing.  Forrest Gump was depressing and everybody loved that.  The futuristic setting made the movie much more interesting than I expected the movie to be.  I also compliment Spielberg for using more animatronically created robots than just a CG image for most of the film.  It makes the movie a lot more believable.  Haley Joel Osmont and Jude Law played their roles equally great.  Do yourself a favor and go see this movie!	4.0	great movie!	2001-07-13	3	2	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2DYCXFXUU32MG	Nicki Alexander	I began watching this DVD with low expectations.  I had heard negative reviews and typically don't go in for movies with a fantasy-based or sci fi premise.I was caught completely off-guard by this movie.  About 1/4 of the way through I was complaining about how intense it was, 1/2 way through I couldn't look away from the screen and by the end, I was weeping and contemplately how otherwordly the love felt for a mother can be.It's been a very long time since I've watched a movie that touched me so deeply and I watch DVDs at least 3-4 times weekly. This is a very eccentric and very personally-experienced film.  Unlike nothing else I've ever seen.  It not only suspends disbelief, it obliterates it and sucks you into the experience of the central character in an almost uncomfortably seductive way.If you can remember what loving your mother was like as a child, I cannot imagine you would not be affected by this film.	4.0	Motherlove--It's like nothing else!	2005-11-29	9	7	2

It's a fake boy on a quest to become a real boy.  Along the way he meets his Jiminy Cricket (a robotic male prostitute played by Jude Law) who agrees to help him in his quest.  Some very patient viewers might see the wonderfully hidden underlying themes that relate to our own society and the philisophical nature of simply 'being'.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A37EWN5SS67OOA	Nimrod	I loved this movie. The actors are great, and the plot is amazing. What I liked the most about this movie is its critisism of the human soceity: Its racism and its fear and hate to anything that might be better than the avarage person.I think this movie is giving a thinking metrial about many relevant subjects that are on the limit between science and science-fiction, especially clonning.My personal conclusion from the movie was that maybe the human kind is not yet ready to play God. We are too close to the animal to have the right of playing God, and until we overcome the primitive part of racism and hatared, we shouldn't try and create intelligent life that might suffer from being here.Anyway, it seems that the original ending was too hard for the viewers, so they pasted a &quot;Happy Ending&quot;. My suggestion, if you really want to get the full meaning of the movie, stop it about 15 mins before the actual ending (Before the Aliens come, you'll see whatI mean.).	5.0	Robots that tells us about ourselves	2002-07-29	1	0	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFV2OJ7YZGVPF	"Noppadon Kamol ""Noppadon Kamol"""	The story of AI Artificial Intelligence starts when our technology has become good enough to create human-like robots that can think, feel, and live with humans almost like real humans. David is the first robot who is a child and, above all, who can 'love'.The film features a very interesting blend of sub-plots that gets me to both 'think' and 'feel' about technology and humanity. If a robot child really loves his mom, can his mom loves him back as much as he was a real boy? When robots live and work in our society just like humans, how should we treat them? The film shows both the good and the dark sides of humans and robots, who are also created by humans.Not only the story is absorbing, the acting makes it feels very real. Given his performance in the Sixth Sense and in this movie, Osment is the best young actor I've ever known. His acting as child robot gets me feel like David's almost a real child, but not quite. Other actors also did a good job in this movie.The scenes from the future are well taken-care of. You will see living environments that are somewhat more advanced that where we are now, but not so much that it's unlikely to happen.There are certainly a few questions about the story and some of the sub-plots don't fit together that well. But these are minor weaknesses relative to the way the whole story goes.Overall, this is a movie to watch, even if you don't care much about technology. While the technology is certainly interesting, the sentimental and humanity aspects of the story are even more attractive. You'll come out with something to remember and think about, even a long while after the movie ends.	5.0	Life, Love, Living, and questions.	2001-06-30	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AZ3LC4E6AF7NK	Northwest Thinker	AI is truly an amazing film.  Many critics and viewers see the film as a take off on Pinocchio, but there is much more than that.  The film delivers a sad but realistic view of the human race.  It discovers what it means to be human, and shows how a robot like Haley Joel Osment can be more &quot;human&quot; than real people.  Rouge City is also a view on the human race...mainly criticizing our values and morals.  This is definitely not a movie for young children.  Be prepared to think...if you are not good at interpreting scenes or figuring out themes, than this movie is not for you.  If you take the time to think why Spielberg inserted particular scenes and why the plot unfolds as it does, then you will be in for a treat.	5.0	An Amazing Film if You Realize Its Message	2001-07-17	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3F1TGEKJ86WKR	N. W. Clayton	The quality of the picture and the sound on the DVD is high.  The movie itself is destined to become a Sci Fi classic.  In my opinion, the musical score is John Williams' best work, except for Star Wars.  Stanley Kubrick, who had started work on this project many years earlier only to realize that computer animation at the time hadn't yet caught up to his vision of the film, resurrected it in the late 1990s with the intention of producing the movie and having Steven Spielberg direct.  Shortly after the two men began their collaberation, Kubrick died.  Spielgerg's final product has the feel of a Kubrick film, with a few Spielberg touches.  I think Stanley would have been very happy with it.	5.0	A Kubrick-Spielberg Gem Worth Owngin	2003-01-18	4	1	3

Nor is it a &quot;feel good&quot; movie. And it is definitely not a children's movie.What it is, is a modern fable or fairy tale- and the fairy tales of old were not written for children- they told deep primal or tribal truths. This tale tells a deep truth about our modern tribe- namely that modern man is no bloody good. The robots are portrayed as decent, innocent beings. The aliens are portrayed as decent, compassionate, and wise. However, not one human in the film comes across as a sympathetic character. Even &quot;mommy&quot; ends up betraying and abandoning the main character &quot;David.&quot; Humans use and exploit and brutalize. In fact, when humans finally become extinct by the end of the film you accept it as a very good thing....You can also see this film as parable about how mankind has traditionally treated animals, or children, or workers, or the poor. Whenever it has been possible to betray trust and behave abominably, mankind has always sank to the task. Why should we believe that we would treat intelligent machines any better than we have traditionally treated each other?	5.0	Mechas A+, Aliens A+, Humans D-	2004-06-28	3	2	1

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ASZBNS68A7OA9	"ohnjayjdp ""ohnjayjdp"""	The entire focus of A.I. was on the minimization of the differences between humans and this astonishing race of artificial beings to which our race gives birth.  From beginning to end, this film shows how the next generation of dominant beings evolve from the humanrace to the superior artificial intelligence. We see the beginnings of this through David, who, thoughout the movie, is trying to determine how to become human.  The ending is bittersweet because, although he believes that he has approached his goal, the dominant race on earth is no longer human.  It is a race of evolved A.I.s.  Yes, that's right -- they were artificial beings, NOT E.T.After hearing / reading feedback from so many, it is clear to me that a large number of people missed this entirely.  Read the following CLOSELY: the beings at the end of the movie were NOT aliens, E.T., or whatever extraterrestrial lifeforms the slow-to-grasp think they were.  The human race had moved on, become extinct, dropped in number due to the earth's climate (or something else), and the superior artificial lifeforms had evolved over 2000 years to become the dominant species on the planet.How can so many seemingly intelligent people have missed this?

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	If Steven Spielberg were an ice-dancer, then A.I. was the triple-salco, pike and tuck with extra twirly-whirly bit. If he were a diver, then it was the often-talked about, seldom seen five-out-of-five-for-bravery three-twist tuck and swan dive.If Speilberg were Evel Knievel, then A.I. was the Grand Canyon.The stakes were high - if he made it, his fame would spread throughout the kingdom, and for years to come, people would speak his name is hushed tones of reverence.  Like they did about Orson Welles.But if he failed ... Well, the cost of failure was too cataclysmic to bear thinking about.Alas, the skater ended on his backside; the diver clipped the back of his head on the springboard and re-entered horizontally and with an earsplitting rifle crack of flesh on unforgiving water; and as we watched, poor Evel dwindled Wylie Coyote-like into an undiscernable speck in the yawning chasm.We grimace, look away and hope he is too far for the awful sound to travel.A.I. misses its target in the most spectacular fashion. Spielberg certainly tips his hat on the way down: We have the flooded planet of Waterworld; the post apocalyptic outlaw scavengers of Mad Max; the fallen vice city of Blade-runner; weird hyper-advanced beings from Close Encounters; the familiar home recreated by the unseen alien being from the weird part at the end of 2001; and a partly submerged Statue of Liberty from (the original) Planet of the Apes. But no Rosebud!For all this, and probably because of it, the film has no real thread: the serial scenes are almost completely disjoined; held together only by the most tenuous thread of the Pinocchio storyline, a device which is almost too Spielberg to be believed.Then finally, just when it seems that the story might be getting somewhere, the narrative is literally suspended - frozen in ice for two millenia, if you please - only to be rescured by bunch of suspect bipedal higher beings (Robots? Aliens? Is there any difference?) who sit the robot boy down and calmly explain the point of the movie and outline its denouement to him.This is considerate, I guess - two hours into such a maddeningly disjointed experience, you may be grateful for someone to explain, in a nutshell, what on earth is going on - but for me it was cop-out cinematography of the worst order, as if Spielberg the ice-skater knew he couldn't do the triple salco by himself and in lieu of performing it sat down and talked you through what he would have done if he could.The result is a film which doesn't say much at all. It doesn't really get to grips with the dilemma of Artificial Intelligence (the one observation Spielberg does make he does explicitly, five minutes into the film, when a student wryly observes &quot;it's not whether they can love, but whether we can love them back&quot;) - instead, Spielberg spends most of his energy pursuing the theme of unrequited filial love, which just isn't interesting enough to sustain any film, let alone one as long and prone to random changes in direction as this.Many of the characters are superfluous including, for my money, the father, the son (at any rate when he revived from his coma - the poor lad was a more interesting precence when in a vegetative state!) and even cyber-gigolo Jude Law. In fact, the entire sex-bot subplot could have been jettisoned for the net gain of a more manageable viewing time and one less red-herring.The final anomaly was that the one person in the film who made it to the end and managed to act sensibly throughout was the robot teddy-bear. Maybe this was the point, actually.Anyhow, any film that can warrant this much verbiage from me can't be all bad, but fundamentally it misses its mark.Down in the valley below, can I hear the faintest, muted thud?	3.0	A failure - but WHAT a failure...	2001-09-28	3	1	2

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A37I377QOTELM1	Optimus Prime	"Despite its evident weaknesses and a very poor box office showing, I actually liked A.I. for its core themes, if not for its overall presentation. True, artificial intelligence is an extremely overplayed phenomenon in movies and television, but somehow this movie makes a worthwhile departure from the norm.By the credits, it's clear Stanley Kubrick's original dark, foreboding and pessimistic vision of technology is squashed by Spielberg's more enlightening and hopeful cry for moral responsibility. This movie feels like a tale of two minds; Kubrick's deep symbolism and cynicism of technology with Spielberg's wishy-washy feel-goodiness are like water and oil, so I really felt the ending didn't do justice to the great beginning. But personal whims aside, the only glaring weakness is that fact this movie was directed by two film geniuses, both who stand on polar ends of a spectrum.The DVD features are quite plentiful, and I found most of them to be true to the overall feel of the two-disc set. There are some very insightful featurettes that explore the technical aspects of CGI (ILM) as well as two satisfactory interviews with the two stars, Osment and Jude Law. There's quite a bit of behind-the-scenes footage that isn't the typical ""PR blitz."" Those interested in the fine technical merits of this film, how Teddy's anatomic movement was simulated, and secrets behind the cinematography will find the supplementary disc to be very enlightening. The feature film, however, I leave to your own discretion. It's a rude balance between opposing minds that seems more artificial than intelligent."	4.0	The DVD presentation is superb; feature film not up to par	2002-03-25	2	2	0

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2Z0ETPIP2Y075	Orionfarms	"After reading many positive reviews of AI from presumably legitimate sources including The Washington Post and Entertainment Weekly...I will say that the special effects and acting in this movie are excellent, but they are woefully unable to save the movie from its horrifically arrogant and boring plotline, and Spielberg's blatant attempt at emotional manipulation. Spielberg continually underestimates his audience's ability to understand the plot and to experience emotion based on a suggestion. For example, William Hurt's character is given exceptional lengthy, monotonous speeches in a demeaning attempt to ""explain"" to the audience what is happening. As for the movie's arrogance, it ends with the sentiment that humans are this wonderful, admirable, perfect species, even though most of the humans portrayed in the film are selfish, unforgiving creatures incapable of love or understanding..."	1.0	A boring and arrogant attempt at emotional manipulation...	2002-03-15	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	"The two best things about A.I is Jude Law's performance as an android and the robot carnival scene - everything else appears to have jumped out from a Disney film and certainly that is reiterated more than ever in the underwater scene. The underwater scene is a major turning point in this film because the major theme has been Science Fiction through and through but then quickly becomes little more than a (dis)enchanting fable. One could almost imagine Minority Report suddenly turning into Cinderella or Jack and the Beanstalk. A.I does just that.A.I has one big problem. Speilberg has tried to make a film that works for all age groups but in the end this is a way too dark for kids in parts and a way too childish for adults to enjoy. Teenagers, in the middle, will be bored to death. So where does it stand? At times A.I is a pseudo-intellectual experience with big lashings of fantasy and reality that do not mix well. It has many metaphysical statements to make but these are marred by too many bleak moments that seem to nullify it all. The end sequence alone is almost testimony to A.I's meaningless. A.I goes nowhere ultimately.A.I has Kubrick all over the first half of it. You can even see that Speilberg has retained his cinematic approach and design style. Just prop A.I up against the likes of A Clockwork Orange or The Shining and you will see it. However A.I certainly feels like an incomplete project and it is as if Speilberg does not understand how Kubrick wanted to finish it. I doubt if Kubrick knew either by the looks of things.A.I is probably the broadest time-spanning film ever made. The concept of moving from modern day to distant future to an age of the Earth future is incredible. The protagonist in this story outlives everybody and everything, but finally the closing statement on that matter is simply void of anything nutritious except that he ""got to see the future and some fancy looking aliens"". The aliens even expound on their own meaning of life and it does not really seem that entirely scientific, but more imaginative if anything. It is actually a pretty unwelcoming finale to hear. It kind of feels like Speilberg has just taken a dump on you to top off his grim robot-boy yarn.All in all and when everything is said and done this is just a picture that has some moments but these moments do not make a picture. The film LOOKS amazing and the cinematography/special effects are on flying form with dashings of livid imagination but the vast majority of it remains dull, plotless, pointless and somewhat painful. I certainly felt like I was ripped-off here a bit and for me A.I was a thoroughly massive disappointment considering the talent that was supposed to behind this Juggernaut that fans had been eager to see based on the hype for what... 20 years? That is nearly as long as the Star Wars Prequel.Nah.This film does not even come remotely close to touching on that kind of hype. This is a bad film. A bad piece of science-fiction with nothing to say that is worth your time, patients or money. This is a big letdown - No, strike that! - This is a big upsetting experience. I was expecting A.I!! - (say that again all you have been following this build-up all these years....) And THIS is A.I????? THIS IS THE GREAT A.I??????????AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.BAD. BAD.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A35TN5YGURE6IV	"""oxzo"""	"In Short:Pros:1: Solid and unique storyline revolves around social elements with good beginning and end and no prolonged dull moments.2: Appeal beyond strict special effects wizardry and sci-fi aspects.3: Excellent special effects and futuristic society depiction (this movie does depict the World Trade Center Twin Towers existing far in the future).4: A mixture of humor and serious cinema makes for a well rounded cinematic experience.5: When it comes to PG-13 movies many modern movies are much closer to R than to PG.  This movie is closer to a genuine PG-13 with scenes wholly appropriate to children without explanation while others will possibly provoke a family conversation about relationships, fairness, and parent/child love & loss.Cons:Nothing significant in my opinion.One of the central elements of this movie is the question of what constitutes life?  Given the ever increasing pace at which computer and other sciences are advancing some of the issues that are broached in this film may well come up in many peoples lifetimes.  Sure it's not likely to be exactly as depicted but quite frankly I don't write it off completely.I think this movie is a classic and I recommend it.This is the story of a synthetic boy built by a future multinational as an alternative to having real children.  The world is a different place in the future with global warming having significantly melted the icecaps and flooded the coastal areas and radiation causing a rise in disease and infertility.  Androids are nothing new to this future society in fact they are cheaper than human beings and have largely replaced them as domestic servants and workers.  Most humans are forced to live on meager stipends while an elite develops the technology that drives the world economy such as androids.As a test subject the company building this new revolutionary product offers it to an employee's family with a son suffering from an illness for which there is no cure (he is in stasis pending a cure at the movie's start).  While at first reluctant and even spooked the grieving mother eventually takes the synthetic child in to her home.  The process involves imprinting the face of the mother on the boys artificial consciousness and is irreversible, once done the boy will love the mother and treat her as his mother for eternity.  The boy never grows never changes he just loves his mommy in perpetuity.Then a partial cure is found for the biological child and he is released from the futuristic hospital although still not 100% and aided by technology.  Initially they keep both boys but the biological one begins to be cruel to the artificial child immediately.  At the ""real"" boys birthday party his friends all seem to have picked up on his attitude toward his artificial sibling as being little better than a fancy talking teddy bear toy which he also owns and is cruel to (and he is the artificial child's best friend).  One of the children at the party decides to cut the android to see what he does and triggers a terror reflex with both the real child and synthetic sibling going into the pool and sinking like a stone because the terrorized robot is clinging hysterically to the real boy.This is the turning point in the movie because the mother decides to get rid of the robot boy and drives him into the woods and abandons him there.  Remember that the boy is fixated on his mother figure and so begins a never-ending quest to become a real boy Pinocchio fashion.  His love of his mother is absolute and does not diminish or waver despite being thrown away.The synthetic child quickly falls into an underground world where discarded robots are hunted down for parts and destroyed by angry economically displaced humans who are generally hostile and cruel to synthetics.  He begins his odyssey to become ""real"" with his trusty talking teddy bear at his side and the aid of a lover boy android in black synthetic leather.  The comparison between the boy and the gigolo drives home that the boy is supposed to be very special because people have a hard time telling he is in fact synthetic (the robot haters throw rotting vegetables at the man who wants to destroy him because he is crying and terrified in one scene).  Joe Gigolo leaves little doubt as to what he is however and he is pretty amusing.It's an unusual movie really and the closest comparison I can think of is Bicentennial Man but I like this one better.  It may be because it's a story about a child that never grows up and never stops loving.  That is what is really the central aspect of his Artificial Intelligence is the love of his mother figure and the desire to win redemption in her eyes.I recommend it for parents who would like to see a touching story and I recommend it for sci-fi fans as it is a unique movie and storyline and very different from most movies.  It might be harder for younger children to understand everything but they just might surprise you too so I would say it is a movie for families."	5.0	What Constitutes Life - Could You Love A Baby Robot?	2002-08-15	6	3	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ACM8X21VP4UBK	"""packdawg"""	Story of a little boy who isn't.  &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is the book he relates to best.  Odd imagery some of it based on famous paintings.  The usual fascinating Spielberg lighting.  Direction of Jude Law and HJ as un-humans very unique.  Story line bizarro, hard to relate to unless you have an armageddon type spirituality.  Some of the hackneyed Spielberg images keep wandering in - in another director's picture you would call them kudos or refs, but how does a director give a nod to himself?  Worth seeing for the acting and curiosity but a disappointment.  Not because it is not &quot;typical Spielberg&quot; (whatever that means whenyou have ET at one end and Holocaust at the other) but because the entertainment value is purely visual.  Tries to tweak the emotions but fails because it is manipulative rather than essential.	3.0	Just Plain Weird	2001-06-29	1	0	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFTQNEHB3TCAY	Pat Kelly	I'm a big fan of &quot;failed&quot; Speilberg movies. I thought &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was brilliant. That &quot;Always&quot; was a great romance film. That &quot;1941&quot; was hilarious. So mixed reviews of AI didn't put me off.Nonetheless, this film left me cold. The biggest problem for me was that the main character was a robot, and no matter how Speilberg tried to frame the audience's sympathies, I couldn't emotionally connect. To me, Osment's character had more in common with a mixmaster than with a human.Speilberg's homages to Kubrick also got in the way more than once. Particularly in the last third of the film where the music, structure and direction were clearly meant to invoke the final 20 minutes of 2001: A Space Oddysey.Two more off-putting elements: Robin William's completely dissonant cartoon/Einstein voicing of &quot;Dr. Know&quot; attempting to add comedy to a scene which should have been played much straighter. And a third act that is, well, out of this world. (I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say the plot twist belongs to an entirely different genre of sci-fi.)That being said, Osment's performance is remarkable. (He never blinks in the entire film.) And the special effects, particularly the &quot;Super Toy&quot; teddy bear, are eye-popping.&quot;AI&quot; is Speilberg's &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, but you'd be better served by his &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (&quot;Hook&quot;) if your in the mood for a fairy tale. Or &quot;1941&quot; if you want to see a Ferris wheel collapse.	2.0	Curiously unaffecting	2002-03-11	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A23D8ZZ60GTS3G	Patrice A. Williams	I really enjoyed this movie. It was unique in that it portrayed a young man-made robotic boy's, (played by Haley Joel Osment) love for a cold, insensitive, selfish woman whom he called mother. This woman scarcely even noticed him, and was only trying to fulfill some selfish desire, and once she got him reared him as some sort of pet in which she occassionally found funny and odd. Upon receiving him as a gift from her husband, she was warned that she should never used the words &quot;I love you&quot; to the man-made robotic boy without sincerely meaning her words. Because once the man-made robotic boy heard those words, he was forever emotionally tied to her. It appeared as though her adoption of the man-made robotic boy into her home was merely out of selfishness.  She later assumed the role as &quot;mother&quot; and was met with the same unconditional love that she eventually gave.  She had a son who was in a coma. At the beginning of the movie, the diagnosis for his improvement was grim.  This lead to the implementation of the man-made robotic boy. The movie never gave many specifics as to what was actually wrong with the biological child. However, as soon as he began to come out of his comatose state, the mother nearly rejected the man-made robotic child over her own.The real child assumed his rightful place as the apple of his parent's eye, and apparently all was to be well; yet the competiveness of the man-made robotic boy was sad and heart-breaking. It was annoying to see the real boy lavished with love and security. While the other child assumed a position that was almost non-existent.The climax of the movie was when the mother convinced the man-made boy to go with her for a ride. She drove him several miles away from the home and abandoned him in a wooded area. It was difficult to watch the struggle that existed between mother and son.  The boy kept pleading for his mother not to leave him. And eventually she jumped in her car and  sped off leaving him like a hurt, sad, and grief-stricken.  After running after the woman, who undoubtedly told him that she loved him. He was left alone with a broken-heart, and many questions as to why his mother who loved him so dearly would just leave him. His journey for the life that he once knew began when he encountered another man-made robot,( played by Jude Law). The man-made boy remembers a childhood story that mentions a blue fairy that granted the wish of a puppet who wanted to be a real boy. He believes that by finding the blue fairy that he would reunite with his mother. He felt that by finding the blue fairy his wish of having the motherly love that we all craved could eventually be satiated.This movie literally broke my heart. I cried because it was so moving and so real. A lot of people wanted this man-made boy to get over his emotions for his mother. They wanted him to assume his natural identity as a robotic being. The boy only wanted what he deemed as his -- a mother's love. The story was so ironic and the ending even more baffling than its beginning. It was if for several hundred years the man-made boy remained under sea, praying to a statue of a blue fairy that he would establish a relationship with his mother again. It is sad . . . The ending is beautiful, light, and magical. Anyone who has a heart would find it moving and warm.Though this  movie to me had lots of potential, apparently several people did not agree because it performed poorly at the box office.  Nevertheless, I am not other people, I am me, and to me this movie was sentimental, sweet, and amazingly good.	4.0	This movie is sentimental, sweet, and amazingly good	2002-03-22	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2RG88FJRTFCGR	Patrick Darms	It was supposed to be Stanley Kubrick's lifetime achievement, his masterwork.  Steven Spielberg took over after the legendary director died in 1999.  &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a visually stunning but somehow tasteless film.The story is basically a futuristic Pinnochio.  The film follows David (Haley Joel Osment) a robot programmed to give and receive love.  After his human family abandons him, David sets out to discover who he really is.  He meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law),a fellow robot, and they travel to the &quot;end of the earth&quot;--actually a flooded Manhattan--where David will hopefully find out his meaning in life.The film is heaven to the eyes, as I stated earlier, but it lacks something.  Director Spielberg does a marlvelous job, but the ending it too warm-hearted to be considered good.  The score by John Williams and the special effects are excellent.In all, &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; is worth buying.  It's an interesting look into the possible future, and certainly its story will dazzle children and adults alike.	3.0	Stanley Kubrick's vision comes to life	2002-10-01	3	0	3

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2QDBUFFD0BXVA	Patrick Kerwin	This movie has many mixed reviews from different audiences. But truly, it is an insult to call A.I. a remake of pinnochio, that obvious comparison was used to emphasize the story, not to be a basis. This movie was more than amazing, it captures you and sweeps you away on an emotional rollercoaster. This scenematic masterpiece(completly in my opinion of course) epitomizes the true essence of Love. It was a 'Looking Glass' for all of humanity. A.I. shows us what it is to be human, our incredible emotions, our deepest fears. Stanley Kubric had a wonderful way of throwing the most shocking images in your face just for his own amusement, and many people loved him for that. Going into the theater, their high expectations of that led them to unfairly judge this movie. Spielberg as a director,has a way of touching your heart and tantalizing your imagination. In my person opinion, they make a wonderful team !  Although I must admit, I was looking for, &quot;In loving memory of Stanley&quot; at the end, but sadly did not see it. Besides that, this movie shows us all the intense power of love, how it drives us all, and how it leads us to our utter madness. You see its a simple formula, the more love you feel, the more pain you experience when it doesnt go as planned. The character 'David', although artificial, was a shining example of this. Which was evidence enough that his love was real. The controversy over this is that anything non-human(or religously:not made in gods image,or by his own hand) is incapable of love or other basic emotions. I think Kubric played his part in throwing that twist in our faces, showing us how self-absorbed, and full of pride we can be at times. As for the ending, well yes it was unexpected, but if you understood it, it worked out perfectly. I have to admit, the alien thing threw me for a loop, but still its the message that counts. One: Life is fleeting and impermanent, and things aren't always going to go as planned. Two: Love,the most powerful force, flows through all of creation. and Three: The most important lesson that most people lost in the ending. Love is eternal, space and time have no hold on it. In the end, David got what he wanted, and he dreamed, proving to all of us, that he was real, and his love so powerful and equally real, that it surpassed all of time, and even our life, on our planet. Go see A.I., look at it in this light and I promise you will enjoy it.	5.0	Artificial Love	2001-10-13	2	2	0

Kubrick lovers will certainly like this movie, but honestly Kubrick was a voice from the 70s, and this is a different era. What we find in this movie is long drawn out sequences to no where, in which the pain of enduring is never satisfied.  I appreciate the questions which are asked, but this movie takes a direction which is simply not helpful to our era.  This is not nearly as intellectually stimulating as some may convey, having more the appearance of philosophic thought without necessarily having depth.  Thirty years ago, this may have been a more important movie.  We have moved on though philosophically in our questions and ability to answer.  The story, though promising, descends into utter silliness by the end, and is not at all entertaining, while the philosophy is so dated as to be equally comical.

Humans designing and making robots to replace humans...a family falls (on purpose or no) in love with the robot. In Bicentennial Man, the robot (played by Williams) is made to slave for the family (cook, clean, etc) but he wants to be real and be taken in by the family and society like a real human, not just a maid. In A.I., same thing, but the robot (played by Haley Joel Osment) is made to &quot;love&quot; and be loved by, in particular, the mother (who cannot seem to recover or move on from her real boy child, who is in coma).Even though I gave it a 3, I do recommend the movie.	3.0	I liked it BUT...	2001-07-28	1	0	1

It is different from the other american sci-fi movies, which have a lot of horror mixed in them. ""A.I."" didn't horrify me (unlike ""Event Horizon"", for example, which is a mixture of sci-fi and horror). The main character (David) is a polite, although weird, robotic child. He is cute, but his laughter is sudden and strange and frightening.The story begins in the house of the family which bought David. The problem is that David does some things that are potentially dangerous (comes at midnight to his mother's bed with a scissor in hand; almost drowns a real child). That is why he is abandoned by the mother, in a dark forest. And he almost gets destroyed in a Flesh Fair. It is a show where robotic humanoids are being destroyed, for the enjoyment of the people. If you have seen ""The running man"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Flesh Fair is very similar. There he meets Gigolo Joe - a robotic lover, whose character may be appealing to adults.The end of the movie is pessimistic, as it is just another apocalyptic prediction that life on earth will cease to exist in the future. The end is not about intelligence at all, but rather it feels like a fairytale about a child that lost his mommie.I liked the special effects - the images of semi-human, semi-robotic faces are dazzling. But the movie's storyline didn't seem too deep for me. Perhaps the movie is more intriguing for small children.  Here are some memorable lines from the movie: ""Keep me safe"", ""I am special, I am unique, I am David!"", ""Please make me a real boy"". It is sad, that the idea of a female robotic girl is not developed - only some boxes with a shadow of a girl and the name ""Darlene"" are briefly visible. I wish the ""mecha"" (mechanical) people were shown as something more than weird, clanky pieces of metal junk.Overall, this movie is more about family sentiments and emotions, rather than ""intelligence""."	4.0	Acceptable to watch, but too childish	2005-06-23	8	1	7

For being a 1989 movie, it is noit listed in amazon, but you can find it it in IMDb.I had the opportunity to see AI in an airplane going from Sao Paulo to Caracas. It is not the best place to see a movie, and it was probably an edited version for airlines. However, I believe it was more than enough.I usually love any kind of film, and it is very rare that I do not like one. I do love films made by Stanley Kubrick, specially 2001 Space Odyssey; Barry Lindon; and Eyes Wide Shut. I also love films made by Steven Spielberg, specially ET.However, Artificial Intelligence is neither a Stanley Kubrick film nor a Spielberg film. It actually is a very bad mixture.For me, the main problem is the actual story. Photography and Acting was good. But the story was filled with unnecessary episodes. The story does not need a complicated gigolo robot, or extraterrestrial beings, or the people's movement against ""mecha"". They are all irrelevant aspects to the main story, but use up must of the film time. No value added there ...The film is actually totally depressing and very un-Spielberg at that. But the film is also very un-Kubrick as caracters and situations are not developed at all, and the story actually ends, there is nothing left to the imagination as Kubrick usually did.

One was good, one was OK and the 3rd was dark, cold and brooding.  Don't read any further if don't want it spoiled.  It seemed like Speilberg had his way on the 1st part of the film that introduced and showed the acceptance of the robot boy by the family.  The 2nd third of the film where he had to find his own way in a dark world was more Stanley Kubrick and, the last 3rd of the film reminded me of the end of 2001.  The movie could have been ended successfully about 30 minutes earlier as it seemed to really drag at the end.  Although I like science fiction and feel this movie does make you think a little about enjoying every minute of life, it was too dark and too long.  I came away feeling a little empty for spending the 2 and 1/2 hours in the theatre.	3.0	A.I. Is 3 Films in One	2001-07-01	0	0	0

And I'm sure most of the peoplehaven't understood it yet, for sure! Even the critics, they haven't understood the meaning, very profound meaning of this movie, and what it is?I'll tell you all, We have only one life to live, so live it as if thisday were the last one of your lives. Look for your parents and say tothem how much you love them. Say to your mother, I love you. Say to your father, I love you. You don't know, you may don't have the opportunity to say when you finally decide to, and it may be too much late.The final minutes when the aliens brought his mother back are so intense, he and his much desired and beloved mother, so he lives each moment as it was the last one.Hale Joel Osment work was superb, I liked Jude law's as well.I saw in some review one saying that this film has a weak script, pleasedon't say that! The words in this film are ""the right ones"" in ""the right time"", and the environment and the visual in this case talks more than a million words sometimes.I think it's not a five stars film, but it deserves four with absolute no doubt."	4.0	"""MOVING"".

The story had so much potential and the oh so acclaimed Steven Spielberg can't come up with more than a lame and boring mixture of &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. I dare state that Stanley Kubrick would not have been pleased with this result.All of Kubrick's (and Spielberg's, too) other productions are masterpieces compared to this horrible puppet show.This film is boring, too long, and embarrassingly bad.

Either you haven't seen it and are trying to decide if you should, or you have seen it and want to see what other people think about it.If you haven't seen it, I'd say, ""Do.""  While this film did have some weaker points, it is overall a very noble effort.  This movie is not entirely a happy-go-lucky movie.  There were parts that quite literally left me with a chilled feeling.  But suffice it to say that you will not leave the theater feeling empty and depressed.  I won't say you'll like it; I won't say you won't.  But if you're seeking advice, then I say go see it.If you like Haley Joel Osment, as I do, then *definitely* go see it.  I think that Haley Joel Osment is one of the better actors around right now, and in this movie, he does an excellent job of being a human portraying a robot who's trying to act human.  He is one of a very short list of famous people I would thoroughly enjoy meeting in real life.  [Ergo, if you can arrange it, I would be eternally gratefulFor those who have seen the movie, here's what I think.  *SPOILER ALERT BELOW*  [Sorry,but I can't review the movie if I'm not allowed to talk about it!  I *did* warn people.]  Overall, the movie was a success.  As I said earlier, though, it did have its weak points.  For instance, the tension between Monica and David might have been much better, and more realistic, if it was stronger.  There were only a few brief incidents, and then suddenly Monica decides she is tired of David and gets rid of him.  Not realistic.  Also, I thought that the ending was rather odd.  I can't personally think of a better way to end it, but everything after Manhattan had a somewhat surrealistic feel to it, to me.  Not to say I disapprove of the way it was ended.  In fact, I particularly enjoyed that chilled feeling I got as I watched David sit at the bottom of the sea, entombed by the Ferris wheel, as the voice explained how he would sit there for 2000 years.  I enjoyed the chilled feeling, but I'm very glad the movie didn't end right there.  However, these are only the movie's shortcomings.  The rest of the movie was, in my opinion, extremely well done and enjoyable.  The technical aspects were all correct; the emotions were, overall, well portrayed; and the plot was enjoyable and somewhat unpredictable--a welcome change.  David's interactions with the other boys, including Martin, were very real.  Overall, I liked this movie, and wouldn't mind seeing it a second time."	4.0	A review that will make sense of it for everyone	2001-06-29	8	5	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A9ZTK2EYA5V7E	Peter Hansen	My wife and I walked out of this movie angry. While the visuals and the acting were exceptionally good, the lost opportunities to explore the morality of AI and the suffocating Spielberg schmaltz ruined what could been a great film.Had the movie ended under the water, it would have been more interesting and thought provoking. Instead, Spielberg has to tack on a happy ending that just doesn't make any sense. Where did humanity go? And just where, exactly, did the friendly aliens come from? And more important, why should they give damn?I'm angry because it seems that Hollywood just can't seem to make a decent science fiction film anymore. I'm angry that the name of one of the few directors who managed to make a good SF film was used to sell this maudlin, confused pice of junk. I'm angry that Spielberg seems to think that we *enjoy* having our emotions manipulated in every movie he makes. In &quot;Private Ryan&quot;, it didn't bother me. There was meaning an purpose attached to the emotions, but it AI, I just felt jerked around.So, if you liked ET (friendly aliens who befriend a little boy) or &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (friendly aliens who befriend a little boy) then you'll probably like AI (friendly...).

Artificial Inteligence&quot; in June when it first came out and I walked out of the theatre thinking that I had just seen a masterpiece of modern day cinema. I also thought it was going to take a lot to beat this film for best of the year in my opinion, and now it is almost the end of September and I have not seen a single film so far this year that has been better. I have seen the film twice and I actually got more out of it the second time I saw it. This is definitely a film you have to see more than once just so you can fully realize the scope of the film and all the ideas that it brings up about our future and our society. I felt so mnany emotions while watching this film that it is hard to list them all. I felt sadened, exhilarated,  touched and frustrated all at once. The film is very unsettling to watch and it is a film that can not be easily forgotten. That is what I admired most about&quot;A.I.&quot;. It makes you feel real emotions for the characters, especailly David, played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, and Gigalo Joe, played by Jude Law who really is remarkable and perfectly cast as this character and it isn't afraid to make you feel disturbed because it is supposed to. It is supposed to put an imprint in your mind so you don't forget. I strongly admired Steven Spielberg's direction on this film. He is one of the best, if not the best, directors in the business today and he really made it seem as if Stanley Kuybrick was with him the whole time he shot this because I would say about ninety percent of this film seems like it was done by Stanley himself. The look and feel of the film are very dark for a usual Spielberg film, but it wasn't supposed to be a regular Spielberg film, it was supposed to a Stanley Kubrick/Steven Spielberg film and that is exactly what it turned out to be and it is pure brilliance. I think &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; is, so far, the year's best film and quite possibly one of the best I have ever seen and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great filmmaking.	5.0	&quot;A.I.&quot;  is a filmmaking triumph	2001-09-21	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2J4KRT5GRVNDU	Pierre Trufaut	You really should go see A.I., and then leave when it ACTUALLY ends.  This won't be when the credits roll, but about a half an hour earlier.  The first two hours of A.I. are not perfect, but they are extraordinary, and truly captivating.  As I watched the abandoned robot boy's quest to find the blue fairy, I thought this could be one of Spielberg's best.  It's still entertainment for the masses, but of the highest caliber.  These two hours are wrapped up in a poetic, beautiful climactic scene under the ocean.  It may not be the most accessible ending, but it really felt right.  With an ending like this, I was a bit baffled that this movie got some negative reviews, but then I heard the narrator(which it didn't really need)say &quot;2000 years later.&quot;  At this point the theater should have invested in red warning lights, because Steven Spielberg nearly sabotages 2 hours of wonder with a half an hour of fluff dressed like a Kubrick ending.  This &quot;new&quot; ending tries to pay homage to the ending of 2001, while simultaneously doing everything 2001 knew not to do.  Have you ever wondered what 2001's ending would be like with a narrator to explain everything to you?  GO SEE A.I. Do you want to be shown the mysterious life forces (perhaps in obvious CG) that were purposely never shown in 2001? GO SEE A.I.  Would you just love to see an enigmatic, silent ending re-edited so that it is completely obvious and very chatty? GUESS WHAT? GO SEE A.I. [...]  You really should go see the first two hours of A.I. and leave before it self-destructs.  I promise you that you will miss nothing, and will leave believing you just saw a fantastic movie.  You are not going to listen to me though.  You'll have to watch it all, and then be mad that the movie you liked turned on you. It's not your fault though.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AL730ECH0R7L7	"P. J. Garcia ""olvidadero"""	Last Friday &quot;AI: Artificial Intelligence&quot; was premiered in my country, Spain. The movie, as it happened in the States, has lead to some controversy here, people went out of the theaters yawning and complaining about the end of the movie. As for critics, they worship the movie as the masterpiece of its creator, Spielberg. As far as I am concerned, this is the only movie I've gone to see twice to the theater. That sums up everything, but anyway I will put forward some reasons why I remained bewildered and deeply touched during the course of the film.This is a work you cannot watch and forget, this is a movie to think over a lot of existencial, philosophical and sentimental issues...I will not write about my own thoughts. However, there is an infinite number of details not to lose sight of. For instance, that scene where Monica (Frances O'Connor) prepares some coffee and David (Haley Joel Osment, not a great child actor, but an overwhelming mature actor) observes her amazed showing this way his deep interest in knowing and discovering everything that sorrounds him.But we cannot forget this is a highly crude movie, but disguised. Apparently, it is an enjoyable fairy tale inspired in Carlo Collodi's Pinochio. But this story is harsh, devastating at times (see the scene in which Monica abandons David in the forest, the crudest moment in a film in a very long time) but above all deeply moving. It is at this point where we notice the influence of Kubrick, where the movie gets obscure, almost nightmarish. I felt inside David's mechanical soul from the moment he starts his search for the blue fairy, an unachievable aim, an impossible dream that showed me what sadness really is. The odyssey of David is fascinating, astonishing, Spielberg demonstrates here that he is a real dream maker, that every crazy idea that goes around his head is possible inside his movies.Jude Law makes an excellent and coreographic performance, he is indeed one of the best new actors landed in Holywood. Needless to say that John Williams' score to the movie is his best compendium of musical dreams to date. This movie would not be the masterpiece it is without the hand of this master. All these ingredients as well as the twisted but emotional end, probably the most controversial part of the film due to the wild approach conceived by both Spielberg and Kubrick's minds, makes this movie one of the most unforgettable cinematographical works of all times. Wether you liked the movie or not, I am sure that it will not make you think: &quot;it makes no difference to me&quot;.

Also a strange but very real and scary thought of us creating robots which outlive the human race.Anyways, this is an excellent movie, the visual FX are stunning, I especially loved the last 20 minutes of the film, a typical Cubrick feeling but with the Spielberg touch.

Neeley	"Roger Ebert mentioned in his review that there appeared to be two endings to this film.The first ""ending"" happening about 1/2 hour before the film's actual end.If the movie had ended at that point (With the lead character deciding to futilely wait for the Blue Fairy on the ocean's floor) it would have been a much bleaker film.But this 'first' ending seems to better fit the major theme the film was developing up to that point.That theme being:Despite the lead character's intelligence he could not see beyond his 'programming'.The character doggedly clung-on to his highly unrealistic beliefs and dreams to the point that they were going to destroy him.All he had to do was 'let-go' of these silly beliefs/dreams and he could lead a wonderful life. (This is, in essence, what the William Hurt character told him.)Many parallels can be drawn between this character's dilemma and what is going on in our world today (e.g. Religious fanatics willing to be suicide bombers.)**** mild spoiler below ****But the film's actual ending involved futuristic alien-like androids creating a fake world in which the lead character's fantasies could come true, so that this character could 'die' in peace.In other words, these 'aliens' determined that there was no use in trying to change the lead character's mind and that the humane thing to do would be to let him die believing in a lie.I have read that this ending was actually Kubrick's idea, but I some how doubt that Kubrick would have portrayed it as such a wonderful and joyous event, as Spielberg has."	3.0	The film should have ended 30 minutes sooner	2006-12-30	6	1	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2CT2KU6H3CW2V	pnotley@hotmail.com	"""A.I."" was considered one of the biggest movie disappointments of the last year.  This strikes me as slightly odd, since it is a much better movie than ""Moulin Rouge,"" and it even made more money.  Moreover, it is a much more beautiful film.  But certainly the plot does not sound promising.  A robot designed to look like a child, played by an actor one could accuse of being excessively cute, is programmed to love his human ""mother"".  After being heartlessly abandoned by her, he goes through an overly long search and is confronted with many examples of the cruelty of humanity.  In the end he briefly meets her and is reconciled with her in an ending my brother and other people thought was sentimental beyond belief.  No, this does not sound promising, and since we all know that Spielberg is a fundamentally manipulative and derivative film-maker, surely he could not say something truly thoughtful.  Especially since he was working on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, a man infamous for his special style of facile misanthropy.I disagree.  First off, there's Joel Haley Osment, whose performance is excellent.  Even the most rigorous and unsentimental of critics, the Village Voice's J. Hoberman, who was not enthusiastic about the movie, thought that Osment gave the best leading performance of the last year.  And Osment is giving a performance of something that is unique in Spielberg's work.  He is playing someone who is NOT human.  Most of the literary depiction of robots or aliens fail to truly imagine what that is like.  Star Trek is the best (and worst) example of this, since the aliens, or robots like Data or Seven of Nine, end up like humans.  Moreover, they end up like very American humans, the world of white suburbia, with American confidence, an American sense of the possibilities of life, with American consumerism, and an American religiosity.  Osment, by contrast, is ""off,"" his love may be real, but it is programmed, it is never spontaneous.Given David's lack of humanity, one can therefore imagine why Frances O'Connor would be originally cold to him, why she would warm to him as a substitute for her real son, and why she would eventually break with him when her real son miraculously revived.  It has been objected that David is unconvicing in contrast to Gigolo Joe, who is able to convince women to sleep with him.  But Gigolo Joe is little more than a congenial sex aid, an evolutionary step up of the chatterbox vending machines on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but ultimately no more.  David is trying to love someone, something infinitely more difficult.But surely, one might object, it is unfair to portray the humans in this movie as heartless and cruel, since after all in the real world there are no real robots to show their malice towards.  And there is no doubt that misanthropy has been a problem in Kubrick's work.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" is a failure because Kubrick so relentlessly stacks the deck in Alex's favor.  And the human characters in ""2001"" are not so much what it is like to be actually dehumanized as empty zombies, facile abstractions of vacuity.But there is another side to it.  As Stuart Klawans pointed out, whose film-maker's emotional effects depend on mechanical manipulation than Spielberg himself?  If David's love is not convicing, has it ever been so in Spielberg's movies? There is an element of self-criticism in this movie, which is not entirely conscious.  As Jonathan Rosenbaum says, this is a movie that is so dialectical it is schizophrenic.  Consider the infamous ending.  Why should the mechas who find David and momentarily resurrect his mother announce their admiration for humans, consider how we have conducted themselves in the movie?  But consider Jim Ridley's words:  ""To become human, the ending says, is to commit desperately selfish and solipsistic acts, to expect technology to satisfy one's emotional needs, to play God just to preserve the illusion of normalcy.""  And that, unfortunately, and as Spielberg knows too well, is not facile misanthropy.  The reconciliation is sentimental, but it is also unreal, and only temporary."	4.0	Surprisingly original	2002-04-28	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ANDQXU2NQ5S8T	pork savant	I had a lot of mixed feelings about this movie. I went into it knowing that there was some sort of Pinocchio connection, but I wasn't sure how it would play into the movie. Then I &quot;experienced&quot; the movie, enjoying, as many others seem to have, the first 2 hours as a visual, technical, and conceptual feast and feeling dissatisfied with the last half hour or so and what I considered to be a kooky and overblown ending.But it wasn't until I got home after the movie, and, intrigued by the Pinocchio connection, reread the traditional fairy tale penned by Italian journalist Carlos Collodi and refamiliarized myself with its more famous Disney incarnations. And that's when I discovered that this movie really shines at what it's trying to do, which is to retell Pinocchio in the context of a robot boy.I believe a lot of people who see this movie don't understand that Pinocchio isn't just a recurring theme in A.I., Pinocchio IS A.I. I'm not just talking about the &quot;struggling to be a real boy&quot; bit, I'm talking about how the entire plot of A.I. and the ordeals that David (Osment) goes through closely mirror what happens to Pinocchio in the fairy tale. This fact especially gets lost because of the way the movie has been marketed: contrary to what it may seem, this movie is NOT about robots, it's NOT about the future, and it's NOT about class struggle, although these are all (deliciously interesting but unfulfilled) concepts that are introduced in the course of the movie.Rather, it IS the story of Pinocchio, who gets waylaid by evil intentioned characters, is sold to and escapes from an evil puppetteer who destroys puppets, guided by his friend and moral advisor, banished to an island of sin, and whose only purpose throughout is to find his Blue Fairy &quot;mother&quot;, who resurrects him when he dies and has the true power to make him a real boy. All of which happen, not so coincidentally, to David in A.I.From the more obvious analogies between Geppetto and William Hurt's inventor character, and Jiminy Cricket and Teddy the bear, to the more subtle ones like Terra Magica as &quot;Manhattan&quot;, Coachman's Pleasure Island as Rouge City, and Pinocchio's death and resurrection by the Blue Fairy (they are advanced robots, NOT aliens), absolutely everything in this movie is crafted to reflect actual plot events in Pinocchio. Looking at this movie from that perspective, it's much easier to really see what a bold and daring leap it is and to fully appreciate the input of both directors: Spielberg because he can do a fairy tale movie like no other, and Kubrick for his dark edge and wit.Although my reacquaintance with Pinocchio helped me see the brilliance in this movie in retrospect, I have to admit that I wasn't pleased as punch when I got up from my seat. The set designs were a thrill, and the acting by Osment and Jude Law is absolutely first rate. The movie hummed along in near perfection for the first 2 hours until the Manhattan scene caused an implosion. The ending may have worked in the original fairy tale, but it was too contrived and overblown and a bad fit for the overall tone and pacing of the movie, and should have been reworked. With all the creative firepower behind the film, surely there could have been a better way to either realize Pinocchio's fairy tale-like ending or simply scrap it altogether and come up with something less awkward. It's worth noting that I only became aware of the 140+ minute running time when I started to realize that the movie's rhythym had been broken.This is not a popcorn movie, don't go see it if you're looking for a movie where you can leave your brain at the door, because chances are you're not gonna like it. It's a high concept and slightly flawed creation that demands a fair knowledge of the source material and more than one viewing to fully absorb its significance. In this regard, A.I. might be a little bit more &quot;work&quot; than other movies in this summer's slate, but it is infinitely more rewarding.	4.0	Read Pinocchio again and see if you don't like AI better	2001-07-07	9	8	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2KV0F8YNDPQYV	"""pradagirl328"""	This movie was terrific-the cinematography, the acting, the way the director/s imagined the future.  Haley Joel Osmet did a great job of being robot child David, who just wants his &quot;mommy&quot; Monica to love him, and is sure that if he becomes real, she'll love him then.  He'll probably be nominated for another Oscar.  A favorite character of mine was Jude Law's Joe, a suave gigolo robot.  He provided some relief from the sometimes harsh futureworld and desperate emotions and scenes.  The reason why I gave this 4 stars is that it was a little on the nerve-wracking side (gah! i hate seeing NYC under water in movies!), also with the harsh treatment of &quot;Mechas&quot; (robots) by the &quot;Orgas&quot; (organic, humans).  It just didn't get me to transcend to deeper thoughts.  I mean, no doubt this isn't a thought-provoking movie-because it is. You'll be thinking about it for days afterward, and maybe want to see it again, like I did.  But I guess the movie wasn't exactly clear enough on what it wanted to portray-like did it want to show that we should never build these &quot;mechas&quot;, or SHOULD we build them, or whether humans will ever stop rejecting the unfamiliar, or whether people will ever open their minds? It was a little hazy.  But I think everyone should definitely see it, so people will think, even a little bit, about Artificial Intelligence, and what the consequences are. (But I'm warning you now, if you don't like Stanley Kubrick movies, you probably won't like this one, even though it's Spielberg's too.)

There's nothing artificial about it...just pure intelligence.  A film made for Sci-Fi enthusiasts, this project establishes a new genre of Science Fiction.  It takes you completely away from reality.  That may turn some viewers off, but when I pay my fee to see Spielberg and/or Kubrick, I want to be wisked away from the real world.  This film does that and much, much more.  It is gripping, heart-wrenching, futuristic and a masterpice of visual hypnotism.  I can see where the young at heart would not recommend this film to family and friends, but if you were one of the first to see Kubrick's &quot;2001 A Space Odyssey&quot; and Spielberg's &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (like me), you can expect a combination of both films.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQGISDG8KML8W	"Quaker Annie ""reader"""	To enjoy this movie, the viewer must release his or her analytical mind for a moment, and see the film as what it is -- a fairy tale. In fact, the narrator tells this much like a Once Upon a Time story, although one of the future.In this fairy tale story of the future, humans (&quot;orgas&quot;) are accustomed to human looking robots (&quot;mechas&quot;) who can perform many functions without be bogged down with much of the bother of human servants (physical pain/discomfort or emotions of any kind). Some people are against this, since robots replace the work of humans, and seem to be taking over..as one mecha says (something like) &quot;they made too many of us, too smart.&quot;A robot child, David, has been created which will expand the somewhat limited market and increase sales, while testing the line between orga and mecha. David will be able to fulfill the needs of childless couples (there are many in this future, since very few are approved to reproduce). David is &quot;adopted&quot; into a test family, where a couple's only child, Martin, is in the process of dying.Martin suddenly and inexplicably gets better, returns home and David is moved from surrogate son to fancy plaything, much like Martin's old teddy bear, Teddy.Eventually David is removed from the home because the father  fears he will hurt Martin. Rather than trying to readjust or update the now unneeded mecha, David is taken to the woods by his beloved mother, and left there to fend for himself. He decides to hunt for the Blue Fairy from Pinnochio, believing she will make him a real boy, and his mother will then love him.Unfortunately, his first night in the woods he's captured by a group who runs a Flesh Fair. Humans who hate robots are entertained by watching the destruction of run down robots who have been discarded by their original owners, but have managed to patch themselves together, (much like Roman days events when Christians went against lions, or current television shows -- perhaps a combination of Wrestling and remote control toys destroying each other).David barely escapes with the help of Teddy (the toy Martin gave him) and Gigolo Joe, a mecha designed to please women. Gigolo Joe and David continue to search for the Blue Fairy, which leads them full circle and back to the place where David's creator lives -- a destroyed New York City. David finally finds the Blue Fairy in a submerged Coney Island display of Pinnochio, a real world land of make-believe and fantasy.There really is a fairy tale ending, though not necessarily the one we'd want or expect. A good movie -- the acting is excellent, the cinematography and special effects are wonderful, the music appropriate.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3CIQ59BTO8LNS	"R. Coleman ""Doc Coleman"""	Many people have blasted AI, saying that Spielberg bastardized Stanley Kubrick's vision.  I can only guess that these people never watched the movie, much less looked at any of the documentation provided on the DVD.Brian Aldiss had the vision for the story.  Kubrick took that vision and expanded it to fit the big screen.  But Kubrick knew that he couldn't do it himself.  So he turned to the one man he knew could make his expanded vision a reality: Steven Spielberg.  The Pinoccio images were welded onto the story by Kubrick, but Spielberg managed to make them work.The great thing about AI is that it tells different stories at a variety of levels.  Most obvious is David's quest to be loved.  Mistakenly, he believes that he can only be loved if he is &quot;real&quot;.  Then there is Gigalo Joe, who joins David in order to prolong his existance.  Joe just wants to fulfill his function: making women happy.  But when he teams up with David, he becomes subltey aware of the end of his own existance, and the need to make a mark of the universe so that when he is gone, he will not necessarily be forgotten.  And then there is Teddy, a simple toy who develops emotions all his own, although no one seems to notice.Some would prefer to have ended the movie with David trapped beneath the ocean, making the movie a Tragedy.  Many have blasted the &quot;happy ending&quot; wherein David finds a moment of fullfilment before his dissolution.  What they really find displeasing about this ending is the bleak view of the future of Humanity.  A tragic ending is so much more palatable if the viewer can imagine humanity continuing on.  Yet AI denies us this.  Humanity's future is bleak, short, and terminal.  Robots continue on, but Humanity is gone.  And once gone, nothing can bring us back.  A brave ending in these days of Hollywood happy endings and open ends for sequels.	4.0	The Movie that Kubrick wanted	2002-03-18	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1LDIMQISH07WK	Rebecca	Despite many professional film critics and some movie goers' reviews, this film was truly outstanding and enjoyable. I, for one, am a big fan of both young actor, Haley Joel Osment and director, Steven Spielberg. So seeing A.I. was double the enjoyment! This is the kind of film which the Academy is probably looking into as a Best Picture nomination...I wouldn't be too surprised, either if it did happen! This film is about a young robot named David. He cannot feel. He cannot love. But he can learn a lot - fast and well. The whole film is about what the character of David goes through when he tries to &quot;fit in&quot; and find a place in the world. It was simply moving and touching and Osment always leaves me satisfyed with his performances. Judd Law and William Hurt are also excellent in this film, as well as the rest of the cast. Like I said before this film was very enjoyable and don't listen to those reviews - they are probably by people who don't have any good taste in movies as is!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2L7WYA5OENV03	Reticuli	AI is more of an art film throughout than most of Spielberg's fare, and as such automatically goes up a notch in my opinion. The cinematography and lighting is absolutely gorgeous, as is the art production. Models are used instead of CGI in many of the shots involving vehicles and nearby structures. Computer graphics still tend to look odd (sorry Episode 1), so this is a welcome technique. Visually, the film definitely deserves to be seen in a theater, from film stock, with a tightly focused projector to let you see even the textures of the whites of their eyes.At the beginning, the dialog between husband and wife is a bit misplaced and the acting somewhat undeveloped. However, this is partially corrected further into the film. Most of Spielberg's script becomes masterful, and the dialog poetically delightful. The film's themes bring up some profound and important ethical dilemmas. Most of the plot development is excellent. However, there's an obviously forced and contrived &quot;stacking of the deck&quot; that occurs with Dr. Know that leads the AI David back to his creator. Also, the explanation for the limitations behind the final scenes with the mother falls far short of suspending disbelief. This isn't the worst of it, though.Right when you think the film is going to end with a supremely poignant half-gainer, the film oddly keeps going. Then, with a slightly contrived series of events (travel-by-school-of-fishes and a later falling of a Farris wheel) there is still yet another chance to end AI with supreme poignancy in front of the Blue Fairy, gazing eternally. But again, this is passed up. As far as I'm concerned, at this point the film has already been through 3 complete acts. Spielberg, however, heads off into an extraneous and unnecessary 4th act. While I appreciate the unflinching philosophical futurism this 4th act entails, it is out of place here. I can only surmise that this was a tentative idea of Kubrick's that Spielberg felt sentimentally obligated to include at the end. The directors of some art films tend to get preoccupied with the symbolic metaphors they weave throughout their scripts, and may lose touch with the ebb and flow of their film towards the climax. They sometimes carry one of these threads (in this case the Pinocchio theme) to an absolute conclusion, at the expense of the ending. Film endings are extremely difficult to execute sometimes, so maybe I'm being too hard on this film. In my opinion, though, AI falls slightly short of 4 Stars.	3.0	Worth Seeing, But Not Quite 4 Stars	2001-06-30	0	0	0

For me, the scenes in Rouge City were most impressive, sets, etc., and the appearace of Jude Law, the perfect oily snake-droid with a bit of heart. I guess the basic idea while watching this film is to let your mind go with the flow and see where it takes you.I can't remember seeing the actress Frances O'Connor, who plays the kid's &quot;mother&quot; but she's absolutely wonderful. I agree with Mr. McDonald, that young Mr. Osment deserves an Oscar nomination, but, to me, William Hurt has become detatched from his characters in recent years, and seems the same here. Jude Law is terrific!The sweetness of &quot;E.T.&quot; is noticeable, but the grimness of &quot;Clockwork Orange' is apparent, more than a bit of futility but so many loads of hope and happiness that you can't help be a bit moved.

He is a child actor who appears in almost every scene of the film and who holds the whole thing together, against the odds. I say against the odds because despite the big budget (or perhaps because of it) A.I. is seriously uneven. To start we are in a world of quiet, eerie designer-future cool. David, the artificial boy is delivered to his family and an air of understated menace prevails. We know its all going to go horribly wrong, but when and how? Just when we think we know what sort of movie this is it jumps to a kind of violent technopunk scene, completely out of kilter with what has gone before. Next we are introduced to Gigolo Joe in a scene so jarring I thought I was suddenly watching a different movie entirely. By now I was getting used to all this jumping about, so the ending (2000 years in the future!) is almost no surprise.Each scene on its own is great, each actor does a great job, but overall, AI is a hotchpotch that barely hangs together. Shame really. Having said all that, do take the time to see this movie. It's the kind of grand project that the dvd extras can really do justice to.

Here is one persons opinion, and if you don't want the end spoiled for you don't read on. The end of the movie, was utterly perfect, it brought home the whole meaning of what it means to be human. David had been seeking the whole movie to be human, or to be seen as ""human"" by the one person he loved, and considered his mother. When she admits to him at the end, before she falls asleep that she does ""love him"", it makes his entire journey worthwhile. I too was wondering where the movie was going with the undersea adventure, and the alien post script, but think of the aliens at the end of A.I. as the nicer version of the aliens in ""Dark City"". They sought to find out what it means to be human, and they found it in love. How many of us when we love someone wouldn't like to spend a day with them without any of the distractions of the world, and be there complete focus. Anyone who has lost a loved one, or watched someone change dramatically, can relate to the ending of this film, as being memorable.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1UVN37B1NH7C	Richard Brooks	"Clearly, the majority of the viewers who composed these negative reviews went into the movie expecting Spielberg. However, what they received was something alltogether different and something that they may never see again: a monumental motion picture collaboration by two of the industry's titans that, as unsettling as it is, DEMANDS that the viewer THINK about what they've seen. I question whether the average movie goer had experienced much Kubrick before Tom & Nicole made him a household word; naturally they were shocked at what the film turned out to be.However, what is most annoying and disturbing is how the movie was thrown off as a ""failed experiment"" by so many people. I didn't see the film on its theatrical run, so I snapped it up as soon as I could. Yes, the effects and art direction are astounding and yes, the score is a nice departure from the usual Williams/Spielberg soundtrack; in fact there are a great many things to admire in this movie. But, the single most astonishing thing about the film is that IT IS ALIVE. It breathes, it cries, it cackles, it soars and is, in the end, one of the most satisfying movie experiences I can remember. I won't bore you by revealing plot points by way of a synopsis. That won't make you go out and rent or buy this movie anyway. If you truly love the work of these two directors, you owe it to yourself and to them to see it. The film ""pushed my buttons"" in ways I did not think were possible; it has become clear to me that many of the people who saw it have no buttons to push."	5.0	Monumental!	2002-03-09	3	1	2

Speilberg obviously followed suit.  I found myself using the FF button more and more.  The really cool effects (sunken city, future race) didn't show up until the last 20 minutes.  The plot is unoriginal, the acting uninspired, the action uneventful, and overall it's a bore.  It's eye-candy with SOME interesting points.  The only part I thought was worth it was the evolution of the Mecha.  Even that got stolen from Asimov and Anime''.	3.0	Interesting but SLOW. Cool SFX	2002-03-16	2	2	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2VO6P7GE1D1BL	"Richard Gordley ""Techno Musician"""	Bruno Bettelheim, in his book &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot; indicates that those who grow up without exposure to (and to a certain extent participation in) fairy tales will lack something in their development as human beings. Joseph Campbell sets forth the same message in his &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;.  I believe that critics of &quot;AI&quot; who lambast Spielberg for the tone of the movie, and in particular those who decry the last 25 minutes have lost the ability to experience a sense of wonder.  A sad commentary on the tenor of our times.On the contrary, Spielberg is to be applauded for taking what Kubrick handed him, maintaining Kubrick's characteristic rawness, and yet splicing it to an ending which, if not exactly &quot;happily ever after&quot;, lets the child in us relax and believe that everything will always turn out ok.The acting and technical achievement have been highly praised elsewhere, and not without reason.  This is one of Spielberg's greatest achievements in the area of effects without the &quot;effects for effects sake&quot; aura of films like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.  Haley Joel Osment's acting is stunning.  At times you have to remind yourself that what you are looking at is an actor and not a machine and yet he handles the difficult final scene with just the right emphasis. Jude Law as Gigolo Joe leaves us wishing his part had been bigger.Agreed, the film is not for everyone, only for those whose breath comes a little quicker and whose attention is captured when they hear the words &quot;once upon a time&quot;.	5.0	A Beautiful Fairy Tale, but not for the cynical	2003-03-10	9	4	5

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UDDE8FTLTYBE	Richard Melkowits	"This film is unlike any other.  Rarely has there been a film that began so masterfully both technically and artistically, only to decompose into an amalgam of illogical writing and seriously flawed cinematography.  Despite this criticism, the acting in this film is first-rate, particularly by William Hurt and Haley Joel Osment.  There are concerns over some of the casting decisions made for the voice-only actors as well as concerns with the dialog for some of the characters in the second act (although the actors did a splendid job portraying the characters - several characters simply seemed out of place in this film).  To get a better idea of what was going on in this film, it is necessary to look at the three acts individually.Act One:Again, this act is nothing short of sublime.  The ebb and flow of tension created by both the narrative and editing is masterfully achieved.  The extent of unease that the audience feels is rarely established in other films and is only occasionally reached by some of Kubrick's own films.  Numerous questions are raised in the first act, and it is clear that Steven Spielberg is making a film that does not intend to insult the viewer's intelligence.  The composition of each shot is flawless as well as thoughtfully edited.  The musical score is quiet and is incorporated into all of the scenes logically without being pedantic.  Although the use of CGI often detracts from films when it is not judiciously included, (needless to say, this misuse occurs quite frequently in other pictures), the use of CGI in this act, although not always necessary, is subtle and is not at all out of place.  The only objection is the choice for the voice of Teddy.  He sounds too grandfatherly.  Even the choice for the voice of the Hal 9000 computer in 2001, for example, was too emotional sounding although it was less of a departure from ideal than is the voice of Teddy.Act Two:Unfortunately, despite everything that has been achieved up until this point, the first evidence of the unraveling cinematic technique becomes apparent.  The first problem is the character Gigolo Joe.  Jude Law is magnificent as this character, however, the personality and behavior of the character does not fit the tone of the rest of the film.  Simply put, he is too goofy and does not behave in a likely manner.  In addition, the character does not move the plot forward at all from his introduction to his inexplicable disappearance.  Gigolo Joe is as important to this film as the ""lime in the coconut"" song is to the film Practical Magic.The next issue is that the pace of the film begins to go haywire (not unlike the whole of Practical Magic).  It doesn't make sense for a film whose first 45 minutes is serious cinema to turn into an ADD festival.  The composition of shots goes into George ""Throw-everything-possible-into-the-frame-so-the-new-Star-Wars-trilogy-becomes-a-hit"" Lucas mode.  The CGI is excessive, and the score gets too raucous, which raises an interesting question:What happened to the music from Der Rosenkavalier?  This music was dramatically recomposed.  Often this is done to fit the music into a time constraint or to add something that the original is lacking when it is necessary.  Although the recomposed music has a good beat and is easy to dance to, it is not apparent why the recomposition is necessary.  In fact, the score for the second act is way off base, and would have worked better even if the Der Rosenkavalier music in its original from (though edited for length, obviously) was the only music used throughout the entire act.One final point, when a well-known actor plays a major role in a film, it is often effective because there is enough material presented by that actor to wash away associations with other roles that the actor has played in previous films.  However, when a well-known actor plays a cameo in a film, the effect is not only comedic, but also parodistic.  Robin Williams' and Chris Rock's cameos are comedic, and that was probably the intention.  However, the side effect, which was either not intended, or worse, foolishly intended, was that of parody, e.g., F. Abraham Murray's appearance in Last Action Hero.  Of course, Last Action Hero is a parody, so in that film, F. Abraham Murray's role makes sense.Act Three:The director had to make a choice of what to do tie up the film.  Luckily, the second act improved after the arrival to the underwater Manhattan.  The film would have been partially saved if it had ended after the protagonist arrived in Coney Island as the plot was already fairly tied up.  However, the epilogue, which became another act, destroyed the integrity of the work.The various illogical plot elements of this act will not even be mentioned here.  The biggest problem was the flash forward into a sequence that looks to have been made by a different group of filmmakers altogether.  In fact, while first watching the video, the question of whether or not the main feature had been recorded over some other longer ""direct to video"" feature that hadn't been completely recorded over arose.  Alas, because there are no movies titled Ice Pirates: This Time it's Personal or Close Encounters of the Sixth Kind, this sequence really was intended to be part of Artificial Intelligence.  It does not improve the incredulity of this act that Ben Kingley's voice is distinctive and highly recognizable.  Finally, the use of narration is awkward as the beginning of the film has no narration nor does the rest of film.  Best to either use narration consistently, or use none at all.In conclusion, this film was disappointing since it had so many elements of classic films, but the departures in the second act and the failure to conclude with a short logical epilogue irrevocably compromises the overall structure of the work."	3.0	Superb 1st act&#65533; then, filmmakers fall asleep at the wheel.	2002-11-12	5	3	2

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2I6K8EHEQUZYC	"""richill101"""	A.I. began in the true Kubrick style of a dark and sinister scenario but as the the film progressed it slowly became boring, wishy-washy more like a dull children's fairy tale. Although you felt sorry for the androids you didn't feel that sorry for them due to Stephen Spielberg's style of directing (which made the film even worse). One film Spielberg should not have directed was this one. Jude Law was fantastic as was the rest of the cast, it was just a shame the film was badly directed by a man I thought was capable of directing fantastic films. The ending was dire, boring, painful to watch and extremely un-flattering towards the man-genious that is Stanley Kubrick....	2.0	A.I. - Kubrick would roll over in his grave!!!	2001-11-11	7	3	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AFIHZGX5DMIXS	Rich P	This movie is way too long.  Just about every scene contains somewhere between 5 &amp; 25% of the material that could have been edited out without the story or the symbolism suffering.  David is left in the bottom of the pool while his &quot;brother&quot; is rescued.  And he's left there.  And he's left there.  We get what you're saying Stephen, get on with the next point!I thought the movie was coming to end, glanced at my watch and discovered I still had a half hour to go.  My thought was &quot;what can they do now?  Essentially what Spielberg did was then stuck another half hour quasi-sequal movie on the end that was just just as laborous as the first two hours.My wife picked this movie out for her birthday.  She can pretty much sit through any dreck.  The credits started rolling and as everyone is standing up my wife says &quot;that was way too long.&quot; A half hour later she's still shaking her head.This movie was based on a short story.

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A23WMZ5I10Q2WI	Rick	What would happen if someone hired both Speilberg and Kubrick to direct a movie, and told them to fight it out over the scenes? --This movie would happen. A three-hour, very bad, re-make of Pinocchio. Sometimes, Speilberg gets so close to imitating Kubrick, it's scary, other times he's miles away, in this  discombobulated hybryd of the two directors. Speilberg has obviously studied Kubrick, and in the scenes which most resemble Kubrick's work, it's as almost as if Kubrick had gone as far as to story board the movie out, and as if his former cinematographer had been hired on. Such as in the decent into the city to search for the blue fairy (not joking). -Recreating a scene from A Clockwork Orange, only a much more darker, nightmarish version Kubrick would have been pleased.  However, just as Speilberg has finishes setting up this impressive scene, he drops the Kubrick style completel, and falls into his own.  The trouble with this, is that the two styles don't work together.  Kubrick was a depressed genuis, and Speilberg ultimately wants to make small children giggle. --As in this scene, after he realizes he's gone too deep over to Kubrick, Speilberg suddenly thorws in a cartoon scene (not kidding) -with a childish comic bit of an animated Einstein, voiced by the ever annoying Robin Williams.  At last, it is things such as this which will make fans of both Speilberg, and Kubrick give a heavy sigh-- of pain. Nothing rings real here, and we're left feeling only confused and frustrated.  Mis this one for sure, there are no signs of intelligence to be found in this film.  Better luck next time.	2.0	Artificial intelligence&#65533;Artificial movie	2001-08-16	5	2	3

Its slowly paced giving you more time to think over the moral implacations of having a robot child which is too human to be ignored and too robotic to be loved as a son.It is very much a film of three parts, the first section takes place mainly in Davids new home after he is adopted, the secound section takes place mainly in and around Rouge City where David seaches for the blue fairy. Sadly the third section of the film (which has a very difrent solarized look) isn't as good as the other two, after the cold drama of the last to sections this segment comes across as pure mush - it's not that bad, its just out of place.The movie's photography is amazingly good, as are Haley Joel Osment and Jude laws Performances.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2M66S05KKNSWC	"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby"""	This film is at its heart a retelling of the Frankenstein story. It's about people who create life because they can, without regard to the feelings of the creation. When the creators change their minds about what they have done, the creation is abandoned to an emotional limbo. The message is hard to miss, but just in case, a minor character spells it out at the beginning of the film.Not only is the didacticism annoying, but haven't we seen this plot before in a very bad TV show called Small Wonder?Even worse, this film starts out as hardcore science fiction, then about three-quarters of the way through, jarringly switches to a fairy tale. It's like having your roller coaster car suddenly stop in the middle of a downhill turn, and become &quot;It's a small world after all.&quot; Both are legitimate approaches to storytelling, but they don't work cobbled together like this.However, Haley Joel Osment, a fabulously talented child actor, manages to remain in character even when this dastardly switch is pulled on him. The film is watchable aside from all its problems because of this boy. That's a lot of responsibilty for someone not even out of elementary school, and he deserves absolutely all the praise heaped on him.So whether or not I can recommend this film depends on what a reader is looking for. If you will be satisfied watching a kid pull off a beautiful performance most adults couldn't manage under the circumstances, by all means see it. If you're looking for science fiction, forget it. If you want pandering to your emotions, as in E.T., see the film. If you want to see Stanley Kubrick at his best, again, don't bother.	3.0	Frankenstein Revisited	2003-11-03	13	9	4

Their creator describes the model as a 'sensory toy'. He proposes they build a robot who can love. He wants to build a child robot based on neural networks who'd fulfill the dreams of the world's childless couples--and of course, increase the company's bottom line as well.The moral question is--if a robot could love a human, what responsibility would the person have to the robot?After 5 years, the Swintons still mourn the tragic loss of their son. Henry Swinton (Sam Roberts), who works for Cybertronics, is approved for the first trial of the child-Mecha. David (Haley Joel Osment) comes home as a 'surprise' for Monica (Frances O'Connor). Henry's had to sign a pretty extensive release to obtain David for the family.  There are no takebacks--if they don't want David, he will be destroyed.Initially, this is not a pleasant surprise for the grieving mother. David's untrained adoration is creepy at best. He follows her everywhere, his programming forcing a bond she does not feel.Soon Henry, who spends little or no time with the child, sees David as a 'toy' and Monica, who has allowed the Mecha child to call her 'Mommy,' sees him as a 'gift.'Then a miracle happens, Martin Swinton (Jake Thomas) is returned to the family.Sibling rivalry, with all the stew of competition, comes into play--and of course, David doesn't fit into his human family.  Monica abandons him in the country like an unloved puppy and David quests to find how to become a 'real boy.'""AI"" explores what makes a person human--and frankly 'human' is not so pretty in this case. This future world has created gigolos to pander to women's fantasies, Flesh Faires (A Celebration of Life) which are the equivalent of 'bread and circuses' in this world--and a great way to dispose of outmoded Mechas.""AI"" is long to have been borne out of a short story (Brian Aldiss' ""Supertoys last all Summer Long"").  At 1:45, there are portions that really drag.  Still, it's an excellent vehicle for Haley Joel Osment, who really impressed me in ""Pay it Forward.""

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A361LE16VBQDP8	Robert Bezimienny	If you share my, and countless others', admiration for Stanley Kubrick's remarkable body of work, you might also be lured into viewing this film, if only to sate a justifiable curiosity.  However, this film has virtually nothing to do with Kubrick and everything to do with Spielberg, which is to say everything to do with cloying sentimentality, a simplistic and immature take on morality, and nothing to do with a serious investigation of the human condition.*I'm afraid I found nothing redeeming about this film.  It would be in a way better if it were billed as Pinocchio 2, but even then it would be a poor sequel.  The emotional world of all the adult characters is ugly.  Without the aid of the hyperbolic musical score and manipulative cinematography it would be difficult to know whether Spielberg was aiming to represent anything resembling real love.  The love depicted here is not worthy of even a robot.  Also, as is virtually invariably the case in Hollywood movies, sex is represented in a very negative and competitive way - there is nothing celebratory or joyous here.  I also found the performances of Osmond and Law less than interesting, although the blame should be laid squarely at the self-satisfied feet of the director.*If you have only seen Kubrick's more celebrated later work, 2001 and the films thereafter, then I'd beg you not to tarnish your impression of him by viewing AI, but rather seek out his earlier masterpieces, Paths of Glory, Lolita, Spartacus, and the unfortunately all too relevant Dr.Strangelove.	1.0	Even robots should not watch this...	2003-10-18	15	8	7

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE would have probably been a great Kubrick film had the great Stanley Kubrick lived to direct it, but in the fanciful and no less masterful hands of the great Steven Spielberg, it comes alive in a way that no other director would have been able to accomplish so well. Spielberg took Kubrick's vision and ran with it; the result is a melding of directorial genius from both sides: the technical brilliance of Stanley Kubrick fused with the dramatic brilliance of Steven Spielberg.Haley Joel Osment, perhaps the most gifted young actor working today, stars as David, the first &quot;mecha&quot; boy to be built, and put up for adoption, so to speak. He is the proud creation of Professor Allen Hobby (a majestic William Hurt), and soon enters the lives of young parents Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor), who are grieving over their seemingly terminally ill son, Martin (Jake Thomas). Although the introductory phase begins rather awkwardly for Monica, as she tries teach David what not to do (such as follow her around everywhere), things actually go well--that is, until the young (and apparently quite mischievous) Martin miraculously recovers, and comes back home to find this puzzling cyber-boy who wants only to be his friend. However, Martin has other things in mind, and upsetting the delicate balance of attention that exists in the home is one of them. Things progress from here, and the story takes off in unexpected new directions, involving a &quot;Pleasure Mecha&quot; named Gigolo Joe (quirkily played by an unusually effervescent Jude Law) who is inadvertently thrust into the responsibility of guiding David to the next step he must take in his journey.I will not expound on this story any further; besides, this film is not simply about what happens. It's more about feeling and emotional balance, not an easy theme for a story dealing with a cyborg as the central character. It's also about the journey of life, and what it means for one whom, biologically speaking, has no life. In this way it differs from an earlier film about a robot boy, called D.A.R.Y.L. That film also told an interesting story; however, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (whose rather cumbersome title should have been left at AI, which was its original working title) does not unfold from a person's point of view.Do not expect a lot of action when you see this film, as it explores various philosophical concepts that transcend what it actually shows on the screen. What you can expect is a film that is both futuristic and lyrical in nature, has a story to tell, and is completely enrapturing in its ability to blend it all into an original mix that dares to make you think and wonder.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ALPYOWQ4UZUYL	Robert Larson	&quot;A.I&quot;, which now ranks as my favorite Stanley Kubrick film, is quite a movie.  Although, you must prepare yourself for its entirety in order to fully appreciate and enjoy all it has to offer.  Many people have mocked Steven Spielberg for adding his &quot;family-friendly&quot; and &quot;sentimental touches&quot; to an otherwise DARK Stanley Kubrick film, but considering it IS a collaboration between the two directors, it is appropriate that Spielberg added his own touches.Even though there were it's slow points, in the end, you still make it out OK.  With it's 2 hours and 23 minutes running time, there's points in &quot;A.I.&quot; which seem to be boring; but after seeing the whole film, it makes sense altogether.  As with the moving &quot;American Beauty&quot;, after you have seen the whole movie, you most absorb for a while to fully understand what the movie is as a whole.  It is the same with &quot;A.I.&quot;.  The people who mocked Spielberg's &quot;unnecessary&quot; added touches just needed to let the movie settle a little longer before they gave their reviews of this excellent movie.  Altogether, a dark and moving Kubrick film which forces you to consider the value of human life vs. the advancement of science.	5.0	Thought Provoking Masterpiece	2001-07-14	5	4	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"This movie is baffling, because it does some things about as well as an be done in a film, while just [stinking] horribly at other times.Let's do the good first. Haley Joel Osment is just extraordinary. Is he the best child actor of all time? He certainly is a leading candidate. Margaret O'Brien was certainly as good in the 1940s, and perhaps better. But I can think of no other boys who were as good as he has been. His performance is utterly convincing, and deeply nuanced. The script demands that he evolve and grow during the course of the film, and he does so marvelously. There is no question that he carries this movie on his back.Jude Law is fine in his role, though he has been much better in other films. I absolutely adore Frances O'Connor (MANSFIELD PARK, BEDAZZLED, and in this springs THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, as Gwendolyn Fairfax opposite Colin Firth's Jack Worthing), and she does a good job in playing an emotionally conflicted character. Visually, the film is way too dark. I could have stood a little more light, but overall the film is convincing visually. I especially liked the scenes shot in a submerged NYC, though it is poignant now seeing the imagined ruins of the World Trade Center, which met a far more apocalyptic ruin than was imagined in the movie.Unfortunately, the minuses equal or perhaps even outweigh the bad. One of Spielberg's greatest vices as a director is his emotional manipulativeness. All directors, of course, try to engage the emotions of the viewers, but Spielberg pulls out every trick in the book. His efforts are sometimes just a bit too heavy-handed and way too transparent.A more serious problem is that the script is just awful. While there are many nice moments, the overall story is poorly constructed, and one doesn't get a sense that the story as a whole is one that is especially worth telling. The central premise is a good one, but I think the film would have been stronger if they had jettisoned the Pinocchio themes and struck out on its own. The first half of the film, as ""David"" is trying to fit into his new home is extremely interesting. The second half is more or less irritating. And I think most viewers will feel that the ending is not very satisfying. David finds love and happiness, but the script and Spielberg have to resort to the most incredible artifice to achieve this.So, despite some very good elements, overall this is not a terribly strong film."	3.0	Odd blend of the utterly superb and the downright wretched	2002-03-09	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AUUSREO6EJX0L	Robert P. Rosetta	I saw this movie when it first came out and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  From the first opening scene I realized a New Jerseyan must have had to play a key role in it's making.1) It shows more of what NJ is like - hi-tech companies and wooded and winding country roads with houses tucked into the woods.  Unlike what most people get to see which is the area around Newark Airport and the northern sections of the NJ Turnpike.2) Philadelpia has become a city of sex and sin and has been renamed Rouge City.3) The ice caps have melted. Manhattan is underwater, but New Jersey is unaffected by the rise in water.  I also believe the Statue of Liberty is still standing proud - since it's actually in New Jersey waters.Being a proud New Jerseyan - I'll forgive the impossibility of New Jersey  being above water while New York is under water because of the melting ice caps.The imagery of the movie was incredible.  The storyline was little different than what I was expecting from the trailer, but I still really enjoyed it.Hopefully when the DVD comes out - it'll have a lot of extras on it, especilly a full length commentary and behind the scenes look.	5.0	Had to be influenced by a fellow New Jerseyan	2001-10-18	1	1	0

Yes, the movie has an amazing storyline.  The acting is superb.  The effects are top notch.  The whole premise is really unique.  UNTIL THE END.  Good lord, I had the same reaction here as I got when I watched &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.  The story was built up so well and was so incredibly unique, with its dark storyline and everything, just to arrive to a cheesy ending.  Maybe I'm just being nit-picky, but not every movie has to finish all wrapped up with a little bow on top.  Life is not perfect, and thus, not every film has to end as such.  This movie would have been PERFECT if it only ended 5 or 10 minutes sooner (those who saw it know exactly what I'm talking about).  It would have been a more melancholy ending, but at least it would have been more realistic, and certainly more interesting.  The best way I can describe it is saying that it had a very &quot;hokey, contrived, and sappy&quot; ending.  It felt forced and out of place.  Darn shame, too.  Everything else about the film was sooooo good.	3.0	Its great....until...	2001-07-03	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2YGVSTELYMSS5	Robin C. Smith	AI I found to be a strangely depressing film, which attempts to graft on a happy ending to something that is manifestly not happy at all. This is the story of an android created to love who is thrown out by his human &quot;mother&quot; and thereafter seeks to refind the love he has lost by both refinding his mother and by becoming a real boy, so as to be worthy of her love. The film started off well and at the beginning at least was intriguing. The effects and the look of the film are excellent and it has very high production values. The end is bizarre and I think unbelievable. However, I can see why it is there: without it, this film would be a painfully depressing experience to watch. However, the rather ridiculous ending does not work and you still feel that the film is unremittingly sad. I am slightly amused by people suggesting that all the good bits of the film are Kubrick's and the bad bits of the film are Spielberg's - is there actually any evidence that this is the case? I think this film in Kubrick's hands could not have been much different. Kubrick did some great films - but not all of them are classics. Maybe Kubrick himself thought the film ultimately would be unsatisfactory? This is a vision of the future where technology has been a &quot;success&quot;, even if society is not. The energy problem has been solved and the people who are around have marvelous things if they are favored. In this sense the film is really not new and is akin to Bladerunner, Alien, Star Wars and all the rest. Curiously unsatisfactory, and I think one can understand precisely why it flopped - the film's gloomy story, with its strange &quot;let out&quot; ending dooms it from long term acceptance as a great, or even a good film.	3.0	Interesting in parts, but ultimately unsatisfactory	2002-04-12	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A38G0SVG2Y7GBK	Robin Hanson	The movie looked very pretty at times, and was entertaining enough not to be boring.  But what I really want from science fiction, this movie delivered: it was thought-provoking.Sure, there were some conceptual flaws.  Robots did not seem to need a power source, ever, and while they worked just fine underwater, a little spinach in their mouth could seriously hurt them.  And global warming supposedly raised sea levels far beyond anything plausible.The one thing the movie does very well was what it was apparently trying to do, it makes us care deeply and emotionally about a single robot.  I suppose its similar to the way Spielberg's E.T. made many people care about aliens for the first time.For me, this is also what was most thought-provoking, and saddening. You see, the movie portrays people as very morally shallow.  A stadium of people gleefully massacre robots, robots who could not do what they did without having complex internal lives, great knowledge, a will to live, and at least some rudimentary understanding of and use of emotions.  And yet that same audience is horrified at the prospect of killing something that looks like a boy crying.  This boy robot is will murder another similar robot, and almost kills a human boy, But all that really matters, to the people on screen and I suspect most of the audience in the theatre, is that this one robot knows how to pout and cry like a little human boy. The essence of moral worth is the feeling of strong emotions.During most of the movie it looks like it is going to be a tragedy of human hubris gone terribly wrong.  But at the end we find a more positive scenario.  But then they invoke some silly mysticism to shy away from the natural really positive scenario. It should have been easy to create a robot mother who loves him as much as he loves her, and let them both live forever. Instead, they create a mother that can only last a day, at which point they both die.  What a crying shame.	5.0	Thought-provoking, pretty, and moderately entertaining	2001-06-29	7	4	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1BRXLFWILNICE	Robin McDonald	I count myself among the many enthusiastic fans of this movie. I have since read hundreds and perhaps thousands of reviews now in attempt to understand why this film is so hits so strongly with some and misses so badly with others. There seems to be no personality type that distiguishes those who dig it from those who don't.  Entertainment Weekly offered some background on the story development that explain a little about why there might be this disparate reaction.  A.I. was a challenge to edit. When shooting was completed the film clocked in at four hours. David and Monica spend a lot more time bonding than what you see in the final film.  People who like the film seem to be able to readily infer the bond in the relationship without the additional exposition. The rest have difficulty making sense of this and feel the film abandons interesting opportunities for family dynamics. After more than ten years of discussion with Kubrick, Spielberg states it was important for him to stay focused on the four major set pieces that were the core of Kubricks vision for the film. The Switzer household, the Flesh Fair, Rouge City, and the frozen afterworld inhabited by advanced mechas. As described by the lead effects supervisor, Kubrick liked to establish environments and then abruptly pull people out of them. You see this most clearly in 2001: A Space Oddysey.  Kubrick wanted this method to be the storytelling method for A.I. as well.  People seeing the film find this a stimulating way to explore ideas. Others find it makes the story seem disjointed. You should view the film with the idea that it is going to be episodic rather than linear. It is more concerned with exploring ideas than maintaining a perfectly threaded storyline.  Mentally prepare yourself for this and you are less likely to become impatient looking for a quick wrap up in the last segment.  Jude Law prefered not to make any statement of his own opinion on the extensive cuts to some of his better scenes but stated he admired Steven Spielberg's choice to focus in on the David story. He eliminated whatever did not move that central story along.  As good of a film as I think it is, I don't see any point in going to a film you may hate.  I have some suggestions that may help decide if you are a good candidate to like or dislike A.I.People who passionately feel Spielberg is a hack over-rated director but are thinking of seeing this film anyway because of its strong Stanley Kubrick overtones seem the least likely to enjoy this film.  People who have been passionately awaiting this film for the last nine years also tend to be disappointed due to their personal expectations of what it would be like.Fans of Spielberg films such as E.T., Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List who appreciate his ablity to convey personal human moments that champion esteemable virtues like nobility and heroism will not find much to cuddle up to in this film. It more connects with the human experience of digging to find scraps of virtue in the rubble, rather than finding it on display. There are unrelieved moments of mental cruelty to David that one may wish were left unexplored. Humans in the film view the mecha as tools to perform a purpose. The film explores people who feel dehumanized by machines that have taken over their roles as lovers, workers and do things they used to do. There are none of the cute or warm moments that characterize many Spielberg films.  If you are intolerant of long films, you should probably stay away from A.I. While it is only two and a quarter hours, it has a measured pace and there are stretches without much dialog that are left open to observe the moment. Visually, there seems to be no real argument that A.I. is a treat for the eyes. And Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law turn in fascinating and commited performances. David's supertoy &quot;Teddy&quot; is sited as the best character in the movie. This is intended as either a compliment or a veiled insult depending on who is reviewing the film. There is no way to know who will like or dislike this film. My wish is that you would see A.I. and enjoy it. Those who still decide to go after reading my suggestions and other comments,understanding the history and structure of the film will, I hope, have a better chance of appreciating it. Something in your personality will ultimately determine if you leap easily over the hurdles that blocked others from really enjoying A.I. and come home with a great experience. However I also hope others knowing a few things about themselves and the film will steer clear of it and avoid a bad night out at the movies. Good luck.	5.0	Amazing on so many levels	2001-06-29	9	8	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3H9JSM1SUTE4O	Robin Simmons	In &quot;A.I.&quot; Steven Spielberg attempts to channel Stanley Kubrick, but the connection is bad.  What makes this  cutting edge cinematic achievement all the more frustrating is the central, sad, notion that at a far distant time, humans and human love is a lost, totally alien concept.  Kubrick was among the greatest of filmmakers.  His unique visions, made with engineering-like precision, were often subjectively cool, cynical, ironic, journies of discovery or dissolution.  Speilberg's like a master forger whose work exceeds the original.  But the two directors' personal proclivities do not mix well in this odd tale about a spiritually cold future.  The two disc set has new featurettes on all the primary creative and technical elements.  But all the bonus material does not make up for the one missing thing that screams for an answer:  What is Kubrick's contribution and what did Spielberg bring to Brian Aldiss's story &quot;Super-toys Last All Summer Long&quot;?  This would be a great DVD if Speilberg had deigned to speak to the masses of devotees that gather before the cold light of plasma and cathode ray altars seeking transcendence.	2.0	SPIELBERG CHANNELS KUBRICK -- BAD CONNECTION	2002-02-28	3	0	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AINY9YQ0YSM2Z	robulus	The first one hour and fifty minutes of this movie are brilliant, and evocative of Kubrick's bleak social commentary softened with Spielberg optimism. Many reviewers find the movie chops excessively but I thought the change of pace worked well, after a fairly slow start.A.I. explores the moral dilemma of creating beings with human capacities in a complex and intelligent way, it is a thought provoking film. The special effects are dazzling and the vision of the future is realised beautifully.But there is a big problem. At around one hour and fifty minutes the film ends. It ends clearly. It ends with what is called a tragic ending. Don't be frightened folks, the ancient Greeks used to have these all the time, and European directors are known to produce them still. So why is it seemingly impossible for Hollywood? After the film ends it surprises us by continuing. It keeps going for a half hour of the biggest cop out I have ever seen, and there is no doubt in my mind that this is all Spielberg. Its pretty to look at, but the sweetness is all saccharin.	3.0	This movie finished at around 1 hour 50 minutes	2003-02-02	9	9	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A134FLH2KNA0JU	Roger McEvilly (the guilty bystander)	"This movie gets mixed reviews, and it's interesting to ponder why. To some it is just sentimental fluff, to others a deep and absorbing critique of what makes us what we are. The parallels to the Pinocchio story in the film are obvious, but rather than desribe the whole, there was one particular scene I thought worth highlighting.First, some background. The plot is mostly about a ""child"" robot (David), searching for his lost mother. At one point, he finds a statue of a blue fairy under the sea, and he thinks, from a long lost fable, that it will make him a ""real boy"" and take him to his mother, so he begins to 'pray' to it-ala the Virgin Mary. At this point a huge structure gently falls on his undersea craft, and traps him there. His talking teddy bear says, ""We are in a cage"".To me this scene is very poignant, and delightfully, but sadly contrived. Whilst the child is in this state, he is indeed trapped in a dreamworld, in which his mind cannot perceive reality. The parallel to some religious states can't be missed. For two thousand years, he sits there and prays, until awoken by futuristic beings. The important thing here, is not that he prays to a statue, or dreams, or hopes, but that he is trapped there and can't get out. *He has come to the point where he can no longer break free from his dream*.In the context of the movie, as Jude Law says as 'Gigolo Joe', ""to wish for something which isn't there"", is peculiar to us, as opposed to the robots, but which perhaps defines us, and the film. The desire to ""dream"" gives us so much hope, so much happiness, and so much love, but paradoxically also causes so much misery. We are trapped in this conflict.The subtext of the film-the search to be in ""the place where dreams are born"", perhaps lies at the crux of human consciousness, and it is that we can be trapped by such a desire ""for that which isn't there""... ""in a cage"", which, paradoxically, causes so much happiness and so much human misery. This is what the robots in the film ultimately desire, but which in the end, in the film, seperates us from computers-artificial intelligence, or paradoxically perhaps, sugests we are ultimately just the same. See it for yourself and decide.The movie is very melancholy and deeper than most people would like.Something to think about."	5.0	"""We are in a cage"""	2002-02-19	6	5	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"****1/2 ""Isn't that why God created Adam in the first place?  So He would have somebody who would love Him?""These words, or words similar to them, form the fade out for the opening sequence of Steven Spielberg's provocative new film ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" based on a short story by Brian Aldiss entitled ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long.""  The speaker of these words is Professor Allen Hobby who has just announced to a roomful of astonished colleagues that he has managed to construct a robot capable of feeling true love.  Thus begins Spielberg's fable of a young ""boy""'s search for that which we humans hold so dear.Certainly, Hobby's statement has the ring of truth about it.  Why, after all, do we choose to become parents?  Is it strictly a decision driven by purely altruistic motives or does a part of us crave having another individual who will lavish affection and devotion upon us unconditionally?  (This may be to a large extent why we own and raise pets as well).  Something in our basic human nature needs the affirmation we get when others love us.  But what happens when, as in the future world depicted in this film, the earth's resources have become so strained that having real children made of flesh and blood only beings the species closer to the edge of extinction?  Who will be there to love us then?  Thus, we have the perfect setup for the creation of artificial life capable of returning that love we so desperately need to feel.Like most science fiction films that deal with the moral complexities raised by a technology that seems to be outpacing mankind's ability to cope with it, ""A.I."" could be read as a cautionary tale.  But it is really something much deeper than that.  It is an exploration of what love truly is, particularly that special kind of love that occurs only between a parent (or, more specifically, a mother) and a child.  I imagine that this film will strike deep chords within those members of the audience who have felt somehow deprived of the love either of a parent or a child.  As such, the film has almost therapeutic value.  So many movies toss the idea of ""love"" around so casually that it is something of a revelation to see a film that actually makes it the subject upon which its entire being is based.Haley Joel Osment plays David, the prototype model of the ""love"" child.  David finds himself adopted by the Swinton family, partly as a ""replacement"" for their real child who lies dying in a hospital.  Monica is at first reluctant to activate David's love mechanism, but eventually she does, yet when her own child makes a miraculous recovery, she somehow finds herself holding back from committing her love completely to David.  David thus becomes obsessed with winning his mother's love, an obsession that takes him on an odyssey with another robot, a gigolo named Joe (Jude Law), and an animated toy bear.  Inspired by the story ""Pinocchio,"" David goes on a journey in search of the Blue Fairy, whom he naively believes will be able to magically change him into a real boy, thereby allowing his mother to love him fully and completely.  Some there are who see parallels between this film and other Spielberg works such as ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters"" (not to mention Kubrick's ""2001"" in the final act) and there are certainly echoes of those films to be found scattered throughout.  But in many ways, though the film works as a conscious reenactment of the ""Pinocchio"" story, it really seems like a futuristic version of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" with a collection of misfits journeying to find the only force capable of making them whole and complete.Because this film was originally begun by the late Stanley Kubrick, one can feel his presence hovering over the project, particularly in the austere, almost antiseptic, tone and pacing.  Yet, with the heavy emphasis on the love theme, Spielberg is able to bring his own unique warmth to the proceedings as well.  It turns out to be an effective blending of styles, with the latter keeping the film from becoming too cold and clinical and the former keeping it from becoming too gooey and sentimental.  There is a horrific scene in the middle of the film in which we see many of these lifelike robots destroyed in a large scale arena ""Flesh Fest"" that seems to be a futuristic alternative to the gladiatorial contests and public executions that have served to satisfy humanity's bloodlust throughout its long, ignoble history.  Only now, the people can rationalize the sadism away by telling themselves that these victims are not ""real.""Much has been made by critics of the film of the seeming disjointedness of the movie's structure, about how it seems to break off into separate pieces and about how it seems to suffer from too many climaxes and false endings.  I disagree.  I was with the story all the way through to the end, pulled along by the sheer audacious vision and imagination that inform the film.  For instance, our trio's trip to an abandoned and flooded New York City (caused by the melting of the polar ice caps as a result of global warming) is a stylistic triumph.  The art direction in this sequence is simply phenomenal.  Yet, for all its technical perfections, ""A.I."" never loses sight of its goal, which is to chronicle this one child's search for the greatest of all human needs - love.The acting on the part of the entire cast is superb, but special note must, of course, be made of Haley Joel Osment.  This riveting co-star of ""The Sixth Sense"" delivers a performance so filled with wonder, feeling and emotion that we never doubt for a second that he is indeed an individual capable of both giving and eliciting love on the deepest level.  This extraordinary young actor creates an indelible impression in the viewer's heart and mind.  So does Frances O'Connor as the ""mother"" struggling between wanting to give her complete love to this unique presence in her life and sensing that there is something not quite real or right about it all.Most directors working with this material would probably have had the child running amuck and causing havoc for all those presumptuous people who dared to play God and create ""life.""  In short, in less capable hands, ""A.I."" could easily have degenerated into yet another sci-fi horror story.  Instead, Spielberg, ever the maturing artist, has seen fit to provide us with that rarest of cinematic creatures - a summer film that challenges the mind and opens up new possibilities of what films can do and be."	4.0	a truly provocative film	2001-07-09	5	4	1

Much like 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, this movie is touched everywhere by Stanley Kubrick's brilliant hands; it is profoundly engaging, and hits horrifyingly close to home.  Set in a not-too-distant future, and without giving anything away, the movie begins as a couple decides to adopt the first robotic child programmed to love.  As a synopsis for all that follows, this in itself poses more questions that either Spielberg or Kubrick are prepared to answer.  The bottom line is this: the movie will infect your mind, and you will walk away from the theatre unable to shake the images, the emotional power, and the characters from your head.  Do not expect another summer blockbuster -- this movie is devoid of pure sensationalism, though it does feature two outrageously effective performances in Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, and some of the most imaginative, realistic special effects you've ever seen.  Do not bring young children; even teens will be disturbed by the big questions this movie asks.  Like Kubrick's best films, this movie is a transporting work of science fiction that nearly begs to be seen more than once.  It is an entertainment, but one of the highest order: if you let yourself go there, you are transformed by the experience of seeing it, and some things may never look the same again.	5.0	CLASSIC OF OUR TIME	2001-06-30	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A17CWVYSKAQJ5A	RP Webster	"Any science fiction that abstains from the perfunctory space battles and photon death rays deserves the stamp of ""remarkable.""  The films ""Gattaca"" and ""Bladerunner,"" and the novel ""Dhalgren"" are examples of such daring outside the genre conventions, whilst still delving deep into the human condition.  But no sci-fi movie I've seen to date measures the profundity of ""AI"".  It took fifteen years in the planning from one of the most disturbing minds of the twentieth century (Stanley Kubrick), and throughout its two hour, twenty minute run, it provides a mixture of eye candy (astounding special effects) and a sphinx-like musings over what it really means to be human: to live and to die; to give and receive love.In part, the movie seems to be asking, ""Are we nothing more than circuits ourselves?""  Does David's mother really love him, or does she only love what he does for her.  It is not a question, as stated in the beginning of a movie, of whether humans can ever truly love ""mecha"", but whether love (in the spiritual sense we've known it since time inmemorial) even exists at all.As for our existence, from the opening scenes we get a clear idea that this is Kubrick's (not Spielberg's) world that we are entering.  The world is dying because of our own improvidence.  This is what I especially loved about ""AI"": unlike in the vision of the ""Star Trek"" series and movies, human beings have not miraculously forgotten how to hate, how to betray, how to murder, how to destroy.  All our vices and evils still exist a hundred thirty years in the future as they have existed since the dawn of civilization.  It may be a bit mysanthropic to say that because our flaws are so fundamental, we can never hope to escape them.  But in an age where people think they can solve problems by flying planes into buildings or blasting a whole country to pieces, it seems terrifyingly true.That, however, is the most definite statement made in ""AI.""  The rest is left for the mind to puzzle over.  And this is a commendable thing, and it is a worthy homage Spielberg pays to Kubrick in not spoon-feeding the audience.I understand that this dark aspect (and the out there ending) earned plenty of ire from several reviewers.  But given our track record here on Earth so far, I find it hard to argue against the film's bleaker sensibilities, and the ending seems particularly appropriate.The combination of Spielberg's directing and Kubrick's vision have created a masterpiece.  Spielberg's occasional tendencies toward jejune spectacle is left out, as is some of Kubrick's more devastating existentialism.  All actors give marvelous performances, but none more so than Haley Joel Osment, who must simultaneously hold in his emotions and convey the desperation of a machine who wants to feel.  Not easy.This movie will probably always weigh on my consciousness.  And if you're one who likes to be challenged rather than be merely predictably entertained, ""AI"" constitutes must-see cinema.  If I could, I would give it ten stars."	5.0	Remarkably Troubling	2002-03-19	12	11	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1JUYF5D6TFFHB	"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya"""	A.I. was released in 2001. That pivotal year would see the disaster of 9/11 and a world headed for war. It was all the more appropriate for a film of this calibre to fill the silver screen. On DVD, the movie looks better than ever and is loaded with extra features, including photo galleries, behind the scene looks on the making of the film and director Steven Spielberg's commentary. The movie was based on the Brian Aldiss short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;. The late Stanely Kubrick wanted to direct this film years ago but he died after production of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in 1999. It was up to Spielberg to write the screenplay and direct the movie himself. Echoes of Empire Of The Sun and even E.T. are evident in some of the film's more sentimental and poignant moments when it is most human. Hayley Joel Osment plays David, a robotic child custom made to feel as close to a human boy as possible. Henry and Monica, his adopted parents, have nearly lost their son Martin to an accident. Henry decides to replace their son with the robot David. But when Martin returns home alive and well, sibling rivalry ensues. Martin, deeply jealous of David, makes it possible for Monica to turn against him. Monica, though she really loves David, is forced to leave him alone in the woods with his robotic teddy bear Teddy. Many of these scenes are full of moments that make you feel. We sympathize with poor David and his situation. He wants Monica, who he feels is his mother, to love him and accept him as her human child. We hate Martin for being such a scheming and villainous little snot. The scene in the pool party where they leave David inside the pool is pretty effective. The movie begins to become more about the search for personal happiness and meaning when David, inspired by the fairy tale Pinnochio (which is a parallel to this Pinocchio in the future type of story i.e. Robot boy wants to be a real boy) sets out to find the Blue Fairy who can make it possible for him to be a real boy and grant his wish.Jude Law plays Joe, a robotic male prostitute, who ends up helping David in his quest to find the Blue Fairy. Guest star voices include Chris Rock (in a brief scene in the Flesh Fair as he is loaded into a cannon)and Robin Williams as Dr. Know, the computer system who knows everything about everything and points the way to David to &quot;the end of the world where the lions weep&quot;.Here is a New York City that has been flooded when the polar ice caps melted a la Day After Tomorrow. In the great building where the mecha and all other robots are made, David discovers he is not a real boy, there are other Davids and loses all hope. He commits suicide and throws himself into the ocean. But Joe helps him out when he puts him inside the helicopter so that he may one day be saved in the future. This is exactly what happens when thousands of years later, the world has ended and frozen up. Aliens from other worlds visit the planet and defreeze David. He is the only thing left of the human world that is good and innocent. They tap into his memories and grant his wish. Monica will love him and accept him as a her child and they will spend time together for one long day. Then they both fall asleep into non-existence. A classic film. Bittersweet, tragic, about innocence, the eternal mother-child bond, about hope and the best things about humanity, as well as the worst. It is a movie that is both dark and light. The moving musical score helps the serious film that should have won an Oscar. It is more than a special effects Scienci Fiction story. It is one of the best movies of 2001 and even of all time. Oh and anyone who does'nt cry at the end of the movie is not human.	5.0	Kubrick And Spielberg Create A Poignant Masterpiece	2004-06-27	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3O8YT41TDXL0B	"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend"""	This has to be the worst movie ever made, and certainly the worst movie I've ever seen. This is the kind of movie that will make one want to throwselves into an open grave; it's really that bad. It's been nearly two years since I went to see it on a hot, rainy day, and I still regret those 2+ agonizing hours of my life I wasted sitting there watching this. One thing that I can say about this movie without hesitation is that it could very well change your view on life; I don't care how you think about life-this movie will darken your view of life as a whole definitely a little if not a lot. In it, you see Haley Joel Osment trying to find his &quot;mother&quot; and a way to turn into a &quot;real boy&quot;. MAKE ME A REAL BOY! Near the end, you'll be screaming at the top of your lungs, &quot;Make him a real boy already!&quot; One thing must be said though, Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were excellent in this picture, and certainly robbed at the Oscars. That still doesn't make up for AI as a movie. Throughout the darkness, disgustingness, and greyness of this horribly depressing film, the only thing that will keep you watching is the hope of a happy ending. THERE IS NO HAPPY ENDING! I wish I'd listened to the reviews I read in the newspaper. For once, the critics really were right about something.	1.0	Could Make the Unstable Turn Suicidal	2002-12-22	25	12	13
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AU0U1KHU4JSDF	Russell Haney	I really enjoyed A.I..  I liked things about this movie very much.  I especially liked Osment's portrayal of David, the robot who yearns to become a real boy.  He brings much charisma and believability to the role.  The problem I had with A.I. was that it never fully grabbed me.  Oh, it certainly grabbed my attention, just not my heartstrings.  I never felt for David the way I should have.  I don't know if it was the pacing of the movie, the script, or the lackluster score, but in the end, it fell flat.  Despite these problems, I do recommend this movie.  It is fun to watch.  But if you want to see a better &quot;robot yearns to become human&quot; movie, buy or rent Bicentennial Man (1999), starring Robin Williams.  Though it is also flawed, it is much better and shares similar themes.  Sometimes I'll judge movies based on weather or not I'll buy the DVD when it's released, and I must say that I eagerly look forward to adding A.I to my collection.  Just one more thing; kudos to Teddy, David's robotic teddy bear.  I thought he rocked!	3.0	Good, but not Bicentenniel Man	2001-07-03	0	0	0

Often his films are a little too much on the slick side, or as a neighbor kid used to say, ""There's a whole lot of Hollywood in that movie."" A.I. is no different. It walks a line between being bleak and warm, between taking risks and falling back into convention. Parts of it had me in awe and played my emotions, while other parts had me shaking my head in disappointment and irritation.But for all its flaws, there is much to appreciate and think about in this modern take on ""Pinocchio"". David, the robot boy who is programmed to ""love"" want to be real so that his ""mother"" will love him. But what is ""real""? And what is ""love""? Can a machine created by a human be real or even love? Can it be human? Is it alive? What is our responsibility to such a creature? Should we even be dabbling in such things?As maddening and uneven as it can sometimes be (especially the ending), I still highly recommend it."	4.0	At the same time a great and frustrating film	2006-05-03	2	1	1

Everyone must agree that Haley Joel Osment deserves an Academy Award for his amazing acting ability. In this film, it really shines. The movie is often dreary and depressing, but always full of emotion. The ending, I think, is great.....Many people didn't like the ending because they were confused, something Kubrick is probably grinning in his coffin about. Kubrick's ending is almost exactly what was featured here. In Kubrick's vision, the boy must watch his mother die because her life can't be sustained, almost identical to the actual version. The ""aliens"" were not aliens, they were advanced robots, 2,000 generations of robots later. The ending wasn't a saccarine happy-fest as many of Speilberg's movies are.

Felton	"Just for curiosity I'd like to read the short story by Brian Aldiss that ""AI"" is based on, but from what I've read about the story, there is little resemblence. In any event I want to pan this terrible movie while the effect is fresh in my mind. I saw it today and it took me a  while to recover. It might take a while to find the story.This review is for those who haven't seen the movie, so I'll try not to give too much of the story away. I have liked every one of  S. Spielberg's movies except ""Jurassic Park,"" but this is an incredible embarrassment coming from a director involved in great movies like ""ET,"" ""Schindler's List,"" and many others.The first part of the movie is about a company trying to create a robot that is just like a human, particularly in that it can genuinely love. A couple whose child is in a coma gets the first prototype, and this part works well, I felt, depicting the drama of a mother bonding with her ""child."" When their ""real"" child miraculously recovers and returns home, the movie starts to fall apart, and it is all downhill from there.The views of the future are not realistic, in my opinion. To the point in the past few years I have started to believe that the negative futures depicted in much science fiction, as in P. K. Dick, Aldiss, and others, is simply not going to happen. Whether or not the AI aspect of this movie is accurate or not (I don't know) is really quite irrelevant, because the dark scenes from the middle of the movie to the end are insipid,  drawn out, and each scene, almost always disjointed from prior scenes,  demands far more suspension of disbelief than I was willing to allow. Bluntly stated, the movie just gets worse and worse. As one example, imagine  a robot with a grossly exaggerated Oedipus complex who waits 2000 years  to re-unite with his ""Mother!""I am glad I read some of the other reviews for some balance. Jude  Law was good, as was Teddy the bear (very good effects work), only the  bear was used over and over to fill in plot gaps, to the point of absurdity..."	1.0	Viewer beware, beware	2001-07-28	8	4	4

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AGN303HR6OOXB	Sam Lucas	"While this film has many polarizing aspects that people will either love or hate, the most commonly sited criticism is that Spielberg ruined Kubricks vision by inserting an overly sentimental ending.  The truth is, Kubrick was responsible for the majority of the films script, especially the beginning and end.  Most of what Spielberg wrote was the middle, and very dark, portion of the film.No matter who wrote it, however, the ending is not simply a happy ending.  In fact, even a little thought reveals that it is probably the darkest ending Spielberg has ever directed.  The audience isn't supposed to feel happy that David is reunited with his mother, who suddenly loves him.  The ending is intentionally very artificial, and the ""love"" Monica demonstrates toward David rings hollow.I interpret it as Monica being simply a creation of the advanced mechas that rescued David.  Like David, the new Monica is simply an artificial creation meant to fulfill his need for love.  The lesson of this film is not a hopeful one.  It is meand to raise doubts in our minds as to whether love is anything more than a chemical reaction that can be replicated by computers.  The final image of David laying beside his now dead mother may seem happy on the surface because of the narration and warm sunset, but it is actually a dark and fitting conclusion to this underrated masterpiece about love and what it means to be human."	5.0	Misinformed criticism	2005-06-18	7	5	2

There's the issue of what is love, who/what can love, what role technology has/will have in society, the legal/moral obligations to technology, the legal/moral obligations that technology brings to society, the impact of humans on the environment, and so on. It's definitely not a movie for kids or for those hoping to have a jolly good time with people blown off, big explosions, bare breasts, etc.. (your usual summer fare).  It's the thinker's movie.  This movie will make you think. If you notice the actors who portray the &quot;mechas&quot; (robots), they never blink.  Towards the end, the movie seemed to drag on a little bit.  You felt it was coming to a close, but there would be something else... then again, coming to a close, but alas, something else. Of the movies that are out this summer for the masses (I'm not talking about the art house movies; I'm talking about what's available at the local cineplex), this is probably the best one so far.	5.0	Great themes.. a bit long in parts	2001-07-02	1	1	0

When the movie came out people seems to think and expect too much from the movie. I think people and the critic had already set the movie on such high standards before it came out the theater since it was directed by Steven Speilberge, so when it was something they did not expect it dissapointed everyone. We should all be going to the movie with open mind and an imagination of posibilities of what future would be. This is a MOVIE! that's all it is. You have to admire the beauty of creating the picture, acting and posibilities for imaginations and not take it personally specially STOP EXPECTING TOO MUCH! When I went in to see A.I. I could not wait for it come out on the video and buy it. I have come to admire the special effects, the acting of William Hurt and Joel Osment this kid is one good actor. I like the idea in the future that all mankind will extincso other life form can evolve, the evolution process in this planet happends all the time. With this movie I can imagine future evolutions and beauty in changes. This movie made think with all the technology we have now, how far will our capabilities as humans will go in the future?

Cohen	What I liked specifically about this movie was the fact that it brought into question what rights we as humans should have over Artificial Intelligence once we've created it.  Once it has been activated, it is now a thinking, decision-making thing not really so different from ourselves.  Our own brains, after all, are just organic computers of a sort - organic intelligence.  Add in actual emotions (fear, love, etc.) and now how are these Mecha so different from ourselves?Once created, are these A.I. Mecha still toys that we can enslave, torture, humiliate, and use them to realize our own fantasies?  Do we have the right to abandon or scrap them when we find them no longer useful or amusing?A.I. does a good job of making you ask yourself these questions.  In the end if you don't ask yourself &quot;if it looks human, thinks like a human, and has emotions like a human does it really matter if it has been manufactured?&quot; I would be surprised.Overall the film's special effects were amazing, the plotline acceptable and the ending somewhat disconcerting.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1SJMPOW1DPCAJ	scotbot	"Your enjoyment of this film will probably rely on two things: A) What preconceptions about the film you have and B) How you interpret the epilogue like ending.If you are expecting a pulse pounding, relentless action film or a happy-go-lucky feel good adventure you will be disappointed. Likewise, if you are expecting the film to kick up hitherto un-addressed questions and answer them with solid clarity, you will be disappointed.  As others here have wisely stated, this is neither a typical Spielberg or Kubrick film.  It is an interesting, if slightly flawed, mixture of the two.The film's endings(s) are what seem to encourage the most debate, though. Many have complained that the film should have ended a half hour or so earlier than it did, or that the film does not resolve clearly.  Admittedly, there is a point in the film where it could have ended and still been enjoyable... leaving us with a dark resolution and a few questions.  Instead, we are offered an epilogue of sorts that attempts to clarify little David's (Pinocchio's) true nature. The sequence has a tender, touching sentiment to it that implies a ""Spielbergian"", facile cop-out on what could have been a more distressing statement.  But was this really the ""happy-ending"" that everybody seems to think destroyed the integrity of the film? Personally, I think many viewers got a little too emotionally attached to the little robot boy and as a result completely missed the point. Without spoiling it, I would say what I saw was a disturbing sequence of calculated and intentional storytelling made even more ironic by Spielberg's well-known knack for tugging at our heartstrings.  Basically, I am saying that I do not perceive this to be the happy ending that so many others seem to believe it is (whether they liked it or not). You must see it to and judge for yourself, though.The acting is good and the FX are great... so no worries there. DVD is the perfect format for this well produced and moody fantasy. You may want to rent this film first and decide for yourself whether you like it enough to buy it or not. However, one thing is clear. As long as you are an aware viewer, this film will challenge, question and engage you, and you will form ideas and opinions about what you are viewing.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2ZPG269VFZGVV	Scott Slotterbeck	Finally got around seeing this science fiction film that posits a world of man...and machine.Although the film goes on longer than it had to, this Spielberg/Kubrick effort is simply wonderous in its tale of how an uneasy humanity confronts ever-increasingly human-like robots.  Throughout the film one can sense the approach-avoidance emotions that the actors have with the machines that take over more and more of our lives.  The machines clean our houses, make our products, and even satisfy our more elementary needs.  And, perhaps, they begin to do all of this too well.  Could it be that humans have manufactured their own replacements?  And that unease only deepens when mechanical children enter the picture.  Can one love a robot?  Can one love back?The plot has been relayed in depth here, so I won't repeat it, but suffice it to say that the plot is solid, makes sense in the confines of the film, and doesn't strike too many false notes.  I did think the film was going to end several times before it finally did.This is a good film to buy, because one's appreciation of the film will only deepen upon repeated viewings.And I can't say enough about the special effects, nor Jude Law's performance.  It's frightening and heart-warming at the same time. And Haley Joel Osment is as good here as in 'The Sixth Sense'; the perfectly lovable, er, robot.Highly recommended.	5.0	Wonderous Special Effects -  And a Dark Tale	2004-06-01	6	5	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3FWHXSZSTKFIU	Scott Woods	A few things you need to know before you even consider seeing this movie:1) It's long, 2 1/2 hours.2) It's got 2 directors, essentially: Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick.3) It's PG-13.  Don't let the trailers fool you into thinking it's light fare.4) It's VERY high-minded fantasy, at least for awhile.This film is loaded with incredible stuff, but with just as many problems as rewards.  It's a story set in the future, when great parts of the world have been submerged due to global warming and the remaining parts are technologically advanced utopias or wasteful burgs.  In the midst of this, mankind has enacted laws to limit the number of children people can have, so a robotics company creates a prototype 'bot of a child, in hopes of creating a machine that can be taught to love.This prototype is offered to a couple who's son is in a coma, with interesting things happening between the mother and the &quot;boy&quot;, but problems arise when the real son comes out of the coma and the mother is forced to rid her house of the 'bot (without letting him be destroyed).  David (Haley Joe Osment, the 'bot boy) begins a search for The Blue Fairy, a mythological figure in Pinocchio he heard about in a bedtime tale that he hopes can turn him into a real live boy so that he can go back to live with the family he has come to love.Throw in a robot prostitute, a spookily-animated teddy bear and a fair in which robots are mangled for the amusement of humans, and things start to get really dark really quick, but this is good.  It's good edge to an otherwise fantastical tale that's easy to mess up if left to its own devices.However, I'm totally torn on this flick.  On one hand, I find it absolutely amazing, especially the parts of the story and scenery that obviously come from Stanley Kubrick's original screenplay notes and ideas.  Unfortunately, Spielberg puts his &quot;Aww Shucks&quot; touches on it to soften some of the otherwise poignant and creepy blows that Kubrick intended, and we are left with a film with multiple personality disorder in some passages.  I can live with this since the acting is SO incredibly good, the effects astounding, and the writing strong, if not terribly consistent, but it hurts to know when a film's gone too far and missed the chance to not only be good, but great.My biggest issue with this film comes from the fact that this flick is easily 30 minutes too long.  There' s at least a half dozen places after the first 2 hours when the film could have been stopped and been a poignant classic instead of something that Spielberg doesn't seem able to wind down.  Kubrick has ALWAYS had problems with his endings (&quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;2001&quot; and a host of otherwise good films up until the last 5 minutes or so), but this one takes the cake, and I'm not sure who to blame.  I think some of the ideas in the end were obviously Kubrick's (see it and you'll know too, but I don't want to spoil it...them...whatever), but some of the ending(s) were decidedly pumped up by Spielberg's need to give us happy endings.  Kubrick was not weighted down with this flaw.  The story you got from Kubrick was the story there was, happy or sad.  Even his happy endings were a bit morbid.  Trust Spielberg to put 100 watt bulbs in 60 watt fixtures.My suggestion: watch it and walk out of the theater (or stop the video) when David is on top of the building. When you see it (and I think you should, depsite the problems with it), you'll know what I mean.  At that point, had the film been stopped, it would have been a masterpiece.  Leave the rest of it for future fast-forwarding or something.  TRUST me on this.	4.0	Almost great but...	2001-12-10	11	7	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1NRHJW5X9COX	Scrivener	Unhappy combination of Speilberg's fuzzy-wuzzies and Kubrick's chilly-willies.  Your tolerance of this movie will depend on how much you can stand watching a boy pining for his mother.  It started off pretty good, actually:  a lot of ethical questions about artifical intelligence will remind you of the cloning debate; the very essence of parenting is examined, as in What Do We Really Want From Our Children?  I sat in the theater excited, thinking, Wow, this is going to be a great movie.  But after the first 50 minutes, the adorable robot  (Haley Joel Osment)  embarks on a quest to become a real boy, and the movie starts getting weird.  I won't spoil any of it for you, but I think you'll agree with me that each set-up becomes more preposterous than the last.  Eventually, the movie becomes a bloated bore.  The cumulative impression  *A.I.*  had on me was that I wish either Speilberg or Kubrick had written AND directed it individually -- Steven's crowd-pleasing sentimentality certainly doesn't mesh well with Stanley's brow-beating.  I'm thinking Speilberg would've trimmed the artsy chaff and made a satisfyingly simple quest picture; or Kubrick would've realized a vision nearly as colossal as his masterpiece, *2001*  (which this new movie resembles, somewhat).  All in all, a disappointment; but what else is new?  This continues to be a terrible year at the movies.	2.0	Mommy!  Mommy!	2001-06-30	12	6	6

Mcgrath ""kierianeleison"""	"The first twenty minutes of this movie made me wonder why the reviews had been so horrible when it came out. Then I saw the next two hours.Argh...There are certain elements put forth by Plato thousands of years ago about how good plays (and by extension, movies) should be structured. A.I. broke most of these rules.1.) ""No character or action is superfluous."" In A.I. wonderful interesting intriguing characters are introduced then immediately removed form the movie. Why offer David a nannybot then have her distroyed at a flesh fair? What happened to the scientist who tried to buy David out of slavery? Why did David's creator finally meet him, give him hope for a new family only to NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN WITHOUT EXPLANATION AS TO WHERE HE WENT?!?!??! Why show David repeat ""Please make me a real boy"" about a billion times in four interminable minutes (it was like the end of ""Poltergeist III"" after that girl died and the director had to do something to cover up her obvious not-coming-to-work-ever-again so charatcers ran around for 20 minutes yelling ""Carol Ann!"" without ANY other dialogue!)??2.) ""Brevity of time and place."" Whereas in a quest there hero can roam about for some time and finally get to his destination, a 2000 year jump forward in time in the last twenty minues was unnecessary and added more confusion to an already murky plot.3.) ""Reasonably assume the audience knows something and can infer the rest."" What the heck happened to the humans and why was there an Ice Age? How did the supermachines evolve? Why was it necessary to radically alter the entire world in order to have a happy ending?  Why not have a sad ending?4.) ""All conflicts must be resolved."" Whatever happened to Joe? He was charged with murder we assume but whatever became of that? I guess the impending Ice Age made follow-through unnecessary. Shouldn't David have had the chance to confront his family (particularly his jealous brother) with the knowledge he gained from his quest? I mean, that is the point, ins't it? A hero learns something mere mortals don't, then return to make life better for norms.  The leftover brotherly angst was more distressing than anything.5.) ""Unity of plot."" Yeah, there were like three different stories going on here, and I think I like the cynical, existentially burdened one better than the over-the-top, deus-ex-machina, We're-a-superior-being-so-step-back-enjoy-the-light-show-while-we-solve-everything, Speilberg-esque ending (Don't get me wrong: it worked in ET and Close Encounters and even in The Color Purple after a fashion, but not here).Darn.

It only proves that Kubrik(sp?) was not a genius, just lucky. The only saving grace is Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law. They are excellent! Haley Joel should be nominated for an Oscar for his perfromance. Sadly, not even a great perfromance can overcome such a bad script. The film begins well, but after about 45 minutes, meanders all over the place with no direction, making us wish we were robots so we could not feel the pain of watching it finally grind to a boring non-sensical ending.	1.0	A.I. or &quot;How I converted 2  hours of time into total agony&quot;.	2001-07-06	10	6	4
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2S9TVFGPC8YPO	Serge A. Vecher	A.I. is one of those experiences that knocks off balance. Depending on how one falls will be the feeling for this piece of art. In my party emotions ranged from non-stop tears to hysterical laughter, major confusion, and a whole bucket of others. Spielberg is a great director; there is no need to praise Kubrick -- his fame is well deserved. However, when the former implements the vision of the latter -- strange things happen -- their ways are so, almost bipolarly, different. As if it was not enough, the topics to explore do not allow for easy multiple-selection choice of experience (like it, hate it, good, bad) so widely present in the modern culture. The nature of life, social acceptance, religion, technology, reality, above all love. Some thoughts are so provokingly hard that the pain is physical. The mother abandoning the &quot;meca-child&quot; because she has long forgotten how to love (no wonder her &quot;real&quot; child is so cold and mean), the brutality of &quot;human beings&quot; towards each other, the world they came from (the community of Earth - its future is so convincingly real), and their own &quot;children&quot; turned slaves and tortured entertainment for beer and cocaine-intoxicated masses. There remains one hope among &quot;human beings&quot; -- the creator of meca-race, but soon we find out that he is just a frustrated father whose quest to return the loved one [son died of unknown cause] culminated in inventing &quot;packaged love.&quot; No hope for the human race, as said one alien, the robot boy is the only true representation of humanity. As for the actor, who played him, I am seriously concerned with the mental health of the poor boy. This role (brilliantly played) coupled with the one in &quot;Sixth sense&quot; is just too much. Jude Law delivered interesting performance, but his character was strange and just out of place. I found there were many parts of the movie like that: David smashing &quot;another&quot; David into pieces, the scene by the which had a Freudian scent to it.However, in the midst of this confusion stands out one true and real character, a Buddha of a 'supertoy' -- THE TEDDY BEAR - whom I loved very much. In the view of the subject, the Academy should award him the Oscar. This would be a minor award for what he did on the screen.Well, stop reading the reviews and go see it. Just accept the thing &quot;as is&quot; and it will be worth it, whatever the outcome.Flawed but still precious. And TEDDY BEAR is the best.	4.0	Spielberg + Kubrick = Not your regular kind of entertainment	2001-07-02	0	0	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1TFS1N6ZKUS11	Shira Katz	"When I started watching A.I. I was completely engaged in the first hour of the film. It starts out with a great idea, with good pacing and very interesting graphics. The idea of a robot boy and a mother who can't love him because he is not real is interesting enough. It was also interesting to see the dilemma of the husband who tries to please his wife with the creation of the boy, and the company that builds the prototypes. However, the robot gets into trouble, and this is where the movie starts to lose its credibility. If a robot can be programmed to love, how come it can't be programmed to not be violent? This is not explained. This could have been a great movie if there was more information about the robots and the company that creates the robots, in addition to more character development. However, the story plot of the mother and child is totally abandoned about an hour into the movie. I kept wondering when we would see the mother again, eager to see what had happened to her and her family. But the film spins in a completely different direction, where bizarre events occur, with images of robots that can self-assemble from a dump of metal, and it is not explained why they were dumped there or how they have the ability to assemble themselves. The film starts to look like a mixture of Close Encounters and 2001 Space Odyssey, and the scenes drag on too long.  The rest of the film has interesting visuals, some hilarious one-liners from the robot-boy's teddy bear and new gigolo friend, but suffers from a lack of character development, lack of explanation of ideas that look cool but just don't make any sense and drag on for too long, in addition to dialogue predictability. Most annoyingly, the biggest yawner was hearing the robot-boy&#8217;s dialogue, which consisted of three phrases that were repeated incessantly. These consisted of one of three lines:  either ""I want my mommy""; ""I want to be a real boy""; or "" I want to meet the blue fairy"". .... What I enjoyed the most about this film is the ethics of man creating a robot that can be programmed to look like and act like a human  (ie, they can save us money because they do not need to eat) , because it made me think about the potential of the ethics of our inventions. It also made me think about how we treat animals, since we have power and control over them."	3.0	Starts great but loses credibility	2001-07-15	2	2	0

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3AIIBXOIZ3J2O	"Shorty ""jillshari"""	Well, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I went to see this movie, but I won't be seeing it again anytime soon.  After the movie ended, I thought that maybe I just didn't get it and that it had some deep hidden meaning that I didn't understand.  But, after discussion with others who have seen this movie, I really haven't been able to reach that deep meaning.Haley Joel Osment was terrific as always.  The futuristic scenery and cars were interesting also.  I thought that this movie dragged on and on and could have ended many times.  I was at first intrigued by the beginning of the story where the humans make a young boy robot with human emotions and the ability to love.  He is given to a family whose son is in a cryogenetics lab frozen for an unknown reason, but soon he is unthawed and is brought back into the home.  There were so many unexplained things that really made me see it as inconsistent.  This part of the movie could have comprised the entire thing if certain questions had been explored more.After this part, we see all kinds of mecas (machines) and a particular disturbing scene to me where they are rounded up to torture and destroy.If I was forced to write something that could bring this movie some greater sense of purpose or meaning, it would probably be that by the end he was a real boy because he had not only learned to love, but been loved in return and had all human emotions through his journey.  Unfortunately, I was not sympathetic to any of the characters created in this movie, so I really did not understand the reviewers who stated that people cried.  (although my brother told me he cried through the entire movie and it was the saddest thing he had ever seen...I'll have to ask him why cause I didn't understand)Anyways, if you want an uplifting movie, this isn't it.  If you want to laugh, this isn't it.  If you want to be entertained, I don't think this is it.  If you are not into sci-fi, please stay away.

It shows us how cold, robotic and unemotional humans can be, serving only their own desires. It's about love and about humanity. The robot humans have more intelligence, survival instincts, common sense and compassion. Haley Joel Osment is absolutely outstandingly brilliant as the robot child and Jude Law is fabulous as Gigilo Joe. Each of the 3 sections of the movie creates deep emotional response. It causes us to question ourselves on many levels. When the credits roll, you find yourself in silence, crying, speechless, wondering 'What was that?'. This movie is a must see, and if you hate it or just don't get it, you need to seriously ask yourself what it is reflecting within yourself that upsets you so!	5.0	A Brilliant Disturbing Masterpiece.	2013-04-07	3	3	0

A more complete waste of time and money would be hard to find.As for the supposed excellent acting job by Osment, I have to ask: Am I really the only one to notice he has one squinchy little face he makes to show his emotions? How does that qualify as good acting? (Don't get me wrong - he's a cute enough kid, but so what?)Steven Spielberg should have made up his mind what vision he wanted  - his or Kubrick's. He bounced from dark to perky &amp; back again without any apparent rhyme or reason.Someone here also seems to have a very serious Oedipal complex. I don't know how else you can explain the First-Date-with-Mommy scene.Finally, I don't see that there's really a big question here. We've had dolls on the market for years who could cry for their mommies. We've had talking fur balls. We have computer programs that show a certain inate  &quot;intelligence&quot; We don't't think they are really like us do we? Maybe I missed someting, but I never saw anything particularly sentient about this boy.Looking like a human &amp; talking like a human aren't proof of feeling like a human.

Cried at several intervals (usually don't -everyone says that, I know).  Ended on a very thought-provoking twist.  I immediately started the movie over to watch once again.  Watched it the next night.  Returned it; promptly bought it.  All the while never imagined it would generate such split reviews from 'the people'.I've been to many review sites:  IMDb.com, the Guardian reviews, the user comments from Amazon; and so on.  One thing I've noticed is that people either passionately loved this movies or passionately hated it -with very little in between.  I think the master design of the director was to cause an affect, knowing full well that it would strike a chord with all; positive, as well as, negative.  I think to some its just not within them to relate to the circumstance Kubrick and Spielberg conjurred -so they say they hated it.  At the same time, those who can stretch their imagination and feelings to envelope a robotic child programmed with the ability to love; these are the ones that will just LOVE this film.Direction was superb toward very talented -gifted- actors:  Haley J.

Give it a little time and watch it again. If you still don't like it, then to each his or her own. There is a transition that is a BIT rough at first.I do wonder what this might have been if Kubrick gave it his more austere, less emotional approach to this story. But what we do have is Spielberg's heart on his sleeve story telling. And Spielberg's emotional, sometimes sentimental touch does at times rub me the wrong way. For example, I did not really care for all that sentimentality in ""Saving Private Ryan."" In the end, it felt a bit artificial...But I think Spielberg's emotional touch allows him to effectively and beautifully tell this story of what a robot with human intelligence would search for. Adding emotion to a story about a robot is just possibly what it needed.And a bit about the ending/rough transition (small spoiler). Yes, the 2nd ending was initially difficult for me as well, but now I find that very 2nd ending incredibly heartfelt and perhaps the best part of the movie."	5.0	misunderstood	2011-04-17	6	4	2

Though the acting, score, effects, lighting &amp; photography and the basic underlying story are fantastic, the story drags, and (as so many others have commented in much more detail) the mishmash of Kubrickian and Spielbergian sensibilities doesn't play well.  The Azimov-based Bicentennial Man (which came out earlier and is less visually amazing - and was probably launched to compete with and pre-empt A.I., which took much longer to make), shares A.I.'s sappiness in parts, and is not as convincing in its effects or the acting of the central, robot character, yet somehow manages to tell almost the same story, in its most meaningful parts, much more effectively.  A.I. suffers from far too much &quot;wonder&quot; (heartstring-pulling fairy tale hooey plays really well in a movie like Edward Scissorhands, but just plain fails, dismally, in a non-comedy sci fi film that is intending to make a serious point.)  In the end, neither A.I. nor Bicentennial Man make any point we didn't already understand intuitively, yet somehow they both make you understand the nature of &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;personhood&quot; a little better all the same, and both are worth at least one viewing.  I cannot give A.I. a one- or two-star rating, for all its flaws, for that reason and because the effects, design and art direction are so very, very well done (in some cases breaking entirely new ground).PS: The odd thing about Bicentennial Man is that, although it is a &quot;dramedy&quot;, with a lot of comedic elements (some of them clearly intended for the child audience, with the overall theme of the film being much more mature), the humans, especially the central family, in A.I. are much less real-seeming and believable than those in B.M.  A.I.'s organic people seem cut-out and one-dimensional; despite the length of the film and its themes of defining humanity and discovery of self, only the two non-organic main characters (played impeccably by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law) show any real character development (mostly in the former).PPS: The A.I. DVD edition does have many nice extras (that you'll actually watch - no full script texts or silent &quot;interactive&quot; sequences of boring stills you have to flip through, but lots of behind-the-scenes featurettes on various aspects of the film.)	3.0	Bicentennial Man tells the same story better	2002-06-21	3	1	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AMGGZCWY3VNZC	S. Morales	"Don't let the simple minds of mainstream viewers deter you from thinking that this is absolutely one magnificently beautiful film. It's definitly on my top 5 list of greatest movies ever.First off, let's get something straight, Steven Spielberg directed this film, NOT Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick only first conjured the idea from the film after reading the early 80's short story ""Super Toys Last All Summer Long."" Kubrick wanted Spielberg to direct this film, and since Kubrick was never able to, Spielberg took the honor after Kubrick's death.This film stars Haley Joel Osment as a robotic child (mecha child) named David made for a family who's son is in a coma and may never recover. This couple acts as the guinea pigs for this new robot child. The couple's child comes to, and the couple realizes having a robot child just isn't safe for their real son, so they abandon David, just because they don't have the heart to destroy him. David then goes off on a search to find the ""blue fairy"" (taken from the Pinnochio story read to him by his ""mother"") along with Gigalo Joe (a lover mecha magnificently acted by Jude Law) to make him into a real live boy so his parents will accept him again.What makes this film incredible is basically everything, from the script, the directing, cinemotography, actors and metaphors. Everything falls right into place and just makes this one breathtaking film which leads to a tearjerker ending (that is if you're open minded enough to read deeper into the ending then for the face value of what it is).This message (what I believe to be the hidden message of the film) goes to show people something, something special about themselves and why we should appreciate the world around us. I really can't imagine any real film fanatic thinking this isn't an incredible film. Steven Spielberg is definitly one of the best out there."	5.0	Quite possibly one of the Greatest films ever made	2002-12-17	5	2	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3FZ06XRKW5JC5	"snalen ""snalen"""	In the not too distant future, robot manufacturers cook up an experiment, a robot that can love. A prototype, David (Haley Joel Osment) is given to a lonely couple to be their `son'. A simple `imprinting' ritual makes him love the mother, Monica (Frances O'Connor). This is a bit of a problem as robotic love, it seems, is not prone, like its human equivalent, to fade or corrode. And Monica will only last another 50 years while David might last forever. Not that David needs to wait 50 years before things get very tough for him.When this was first released, about three years back, it didn't sound like my cup of tea and a lot of critics panned it. So I never got round to seeing it till now. And well, I cannot but admit, it's really pretty good. There's no denying that Spielberg rather spoils things at the end: the last 15 minutes or so descends into credulity-defying hokum and sentimentality. But, that aside, it's a very interesting, original, intelligent and in places rather beautiful, science fiction film. Osment is extremely impressive in the lead role. It's intriguing and fairy-tale-like and probably, if you've not seen it, the less you know the better about how the story develops. Suffice it to say that if, like me, you've been avoiding this one, it is well worth relenting, as I did, and giving it a try.	4.0	Well Worth Seeing in Spite of Weak Ending	2004-10-03	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ASDP39VYB1AVX	SocraticMethod	The film is somewhat like a modern-day Pinocchio but deals with the philosophical notion of artificial intelligence and is much more human and emotional.  It has amazing effects even now, and a brilliant art design.  Many complained about the ending but it's not as 'Hollywood' as people realize, nor is it a really depressing ending.  The ending is very fitting for David's needs and furthers the contrast between man and machine.  The film did a great job of making you think of what constitutes a human and whether we should treat David as just a machine.  The film never blatantly poses this question for you, it naturally arises.  I never understood all the hate this film received, it's one of Spielberg's best since Saving Private Ryan.  I think many people expected more action, a more straightforward ending, and didn't expect the sometimes bizarre art-style in the film such as the 'flesh fair' scene.Some of the dialogue can be rather poor though, but not that often.  There's also some great dialogue and performances in the film by Haley Joel Osmont (at his best, better than Sixth Sense in my opinion) and Jude Law (one of his best performances, possibly his best).Sidenote:  The 'supertoy' Teddy is also one the greatest sidekicks and animated characters ever put on screen.  I loved the character (not just because he's so cute) and he really added to the film and David's character.	5.0	Unappreciated, misunderstood, but a great film	2011-04-18	3	3	0

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ANHGGQT4HTEK0	Sonia	"With Stanley Kubrick now gone, Steven Spielberg is the solitary living legend among directors in the last quarter century.  Every other director out there is merely a variable number of deviations from the perfection of Steven Spielberg.For those who miss Kubrick's cynical, sometimes cold spin on the human condition, Spielberg has given society one last chance to marvel at a story that is more thinking than feeling.A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) is a pet project of Kubrick's, nearly twenty years in the tweaking process.  Having consulted with Spielberg on the project gave him an inside track on Kubrick's intentions.  It is with that vision that Spielberg saw the film to the completion process.In the future, as the result of global warming, the ice caps will melt flooding countless coastal cities, displacing millions and strapping the resources of countries around the world.  The United States, with its edge in technology, seems to survive the horrific economic impact of such a catastrophe.In these conditions, couples must have a license to procreate.  Filling out the society are highly advanced cyborgs, or ""mechas"".  Robots, mechanical humans, whatever you want to call them.  The most appealing feature regarding these ""beings"" is the fact that they require no resources.  The lack of emotion is also an attractive element for some tasks.However, a scientist by the name of Professor Hobby (William Hurt) believes that he and his team can create a robot child that will be able to love once the assigned parents ""imprint"" a designated series of words into its system.  He believes this loving robot child will be a wonderful substitute for childless parents with no hope of getting a license to have a flesh and blood child of their own.Immediately the morality question comes up.  Is it right to create a child whose sole purpose is to love the parents?  Professor Hobby responds, ""Didn't God create Adam to love Him?""  Be sure, a morality question will spring to mind in many a scene offered here.After twenty months, a prototype is ready and a suitable family selected.  The prototype, David (Haley Joel Osment) seems so real it's hard to believe his innards are all wiring and microchips.  Before long, mom Monica (Frances O'Connor) feels prepared to go through with the imprinting protocol, which is irreversible and will bond the boy to her forever.It is at this point where I asked the first question.  Why didn't the father go through the imprinting protocol as well?  Wouldn't the ideal situation be one where the boy loves both parents, not just one?As a matter of course, complications develop and Monica takes David on a return trip to Cybertronics where he was manufactured.  Since the imprinting process is irreversible, any returned robots will be destroyed.  Avoiding that end, David winds up in the ""real world"" with other robots fighting for his life in a world that despises ""mechas"".It is during the second act offered here that the dark, Kubrick-influenced theme of Robot versus Human is heavily explored.  Once again, morality questions pop up during a sequence called the ""Flesh Fair"".  Haven't we already explored the downside of machines that do human tasks?  It puts hard-working people out of jobs.  This is not a new concept, so the escalation of the intensity will not be hard to fathom here.David, along with a super toy teddy bear, befriends a ""lover"" model robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law).  I should explain that the ""love"" implemented in David is not the same ""love"" offered by the black leather wearing Joe.It is Joe who helps David in his dogged pursuit of the Blue Fairy, the one and same Blue Fairy from the Pinocchio tale.  David believes, as his ""mother"" had read to him, that if he finds the Blue Fairy, she can turn him into a real boy and then his ""mother"" will be able to love him.That's right where I'm going to stop without ruining a complex third act.  A.I. is undoubtedly an ambitious, amazing film.  The biggest ambition might be the collaboration of two very different directors.In the simplest of terms, Kubrick is for thinkers and Spielberg is for feelers.  Kubrick challenged the brain.  His films ask questions, and just when you think he's going to offer you the answers, you end up with a whole new set of questions.  Kubrick had a very intensely stark and exacting perspective on our mental selves.  A Kubrick film is one where a trip to the bathroom better be life or death.On the other hand, Spielberg takes the moviegoer on an emotional merry-go-round the likes of which you're not certain you'll ever recover.  Spielberg explores themes where our hearts win out over our minds.  Love over logic.  Feel first, think later.Perhaps it is the divergence of these styles that make A.I. less seamless than it might have been.  It's quite obvious that Spielberg made every effort to realize Kubrick's A.I.  However, with a ""feeler"" directing a ""thinkers"" movie, it comes out a little forced at times.  An amazing film, no doubt, but a slight case of ""too many cooks"" spoiling the soup."	4.0	Almost Indelible	2001-07-02	2	2	0

This movie would be WONDERFUL and deeply moving if it ended at the end of part 2 in the flooded Coney Island and just left out the whole Alien finale'.

Instead, when the audience is on the verge of tears, its time to reverse direction totally and create a totally different, ultra sappy ending.  Dear, god it was horrible.Up to then the movie was fine.  I begrudgingly admit that Haley Joel acted wonderfully.  Jude Law stole the movie, and Spielberg directs with wonderful artistic flair.

While it is flawlessly executed and done beautifully I am afraid most mainstream viewers will just not get it. Ultimately A.I. is a fairy tale of the purest sort. I mean a really freaky and fantastic fairy tale done with some killer sci-fi special effects. Add a mess of non-fairy tale content along with a very different movie pace and you might just begin to understand this movie. Don't say I didn't warn you.Spielberg made this movie for Stanley Kubrick, who first thought of it in the mid 1980's. Though Spielberg was the one to write and direct it the movie is very much Kubrick-ian. I don't mean the mild Kubrick. I mean the trailblazing Kubrick. I noticed A.I. follows the same formula as 2001. In that I mean the story takes dramatic shifts to far left field and then far right field. Though I find it fascinating, A.I. will likely lose a lot of viewers in different pace changes. The movie shifts gears more than a formula one racer. It starts off as a family drama, then gets really sadistic and cyberpunk-like, then moves into Blade Runner territory, then goes WAY out off the park with the fairy tale wrap up. If you ask me that end part is the coolest part of the movie, and that's why I'm not going to spoil it.Special effects are perfect in about every detail. The CG and digital effects are practically seamless. I am amazed how well Spielberg made it all fit together. The tech is cool, but nothing jaw dropping. I liked seeing the futuristic cars and VTOLs as well as the cities and ruins. Of course the robots are the neatest things in the movie. I especially liked the robot teddy bear. Acting is very good with special kudos to Haley Joel Osment  (A.I.'s star robot) and Jude Law, who plays male sex toy Gigolo Joe.Bottom line the story is solid and engaging. It is a perfect tribute to Stanley Kubrick and I consider it a complete success in what it sets out to accomplish. A.I. is in no way ever going to be a blockbuster. If Spielberg were smart he wouldn't expect it to be. It is far too experimental for mainstream audiences. I would say the truest of sci-fi fans should watch this along with people who are really into cerebral or 'what the..?' type movies. I would love to see the masses accept this as a true work of art, but I know not everybody can look at a Van Gogh and understand it.	4.0	A.I. is an acquired taste.	2007-01-22	5	4	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence is an interesting piece of work not only because it mulls the possibilities of human technology in the future but also because it is a joint effort between two accomplished filmmakers.  The film had been on the late Stanley Kubrick's plate for over twenty years, but he shared many of the details on a regular basis with the man whom he planned to collaborate with - Steven Spielberg.  Through numerous faxes and telephone calls (the two rarely spoke in person), Kubrick offered his thoughts, ideas and storyboards on the project and then much to Spielberg's surprise, passed the torch to him to direct his upcoming masterpiece.  When Spielberg asked why he had decided to offer him such an important role, he simply replied, ""I think this movie is closer to your sensibility than mine.""  Sadly, Kubrick never lived to see the fruits of their combined labor - he passed on only two months before his last project (Eyes Wide Shut) was released nationwide and even though Spielberg had not written a screenplay since his 1977 film ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", he was determined to keep their dream alive and inherited the entire project.The story, recycled many times over in its making, begins somewhere in the near future where the creation of artificial beings has already been conquered and much of America's coastal metropolises are waist-deep in ocean.  A man named Professor Hobby endeavors to change the course of history by inventing an automaton that will not only be capable of human emotion but become a free-thinking organism, forming its own dreams and goals.  His accomplishment comes in the form of blue-eyed and rosy-cheeked David (Osment), an android child inducted into the household of Monica and Henry Swinton, a couple whose son Martin is lies frozen in a cryogenic chamber in a deep-seated coma.  Aghast at the thought of replacing Martin's presence in the house with a mechanized youngster, Monica questions her husband's morals as well as her own but soon finds David's presence to be a soothing surrogate.  One fateful afternoon, she recites a seven-word cryptogram and once voiced, the code causes an irreversible change.  David's blank gaze melts as the last word leaves Monica's lips, his eyes taking on a new light as he slumps into her lap, wrapping his arms about her and whispering, ""You're my mommy"".One might think because of Spielberg's ruling over the project that like his other fantasy flicks (e.g. E.T.,  ""A.I."" is sure to have a happy ending.  Guess again.  The film is anything but uplifting, and ever-optimistic spectators be warned - hope is a profoundly undervalued sentiment by everyone except our darling mechanized tot in this bleak futuristic saga.  ""A.I."" depicts human beings as being anything but human - we are a thoughtless and cruel species bent on keeping this entire planet to ourselves.  Kubrick/Spielberg paint a very dour picture of the future of the human race in a particular scene where hundreds of rowdy orgas are gathered at a ""Flesh Fair"".  Ruthless ringmasters tear innocent mechas limb from limb or perniciously liquefy their bodies with sulfuric acid, the bloodthirsty crowd cheering on like drunken patrons at a monster truck rally.  The movie doesn't even give us any hope of survival after 2000 years; the planet becomes a barren landscape of ice and snow and vast cities with their towering skyscrapers are hidden far beneath the wintry, mountainous slopes.There's no mistaking who rules this ultramodern parable - Haley Joel Osment stars as David, the endearing android of programmed compassion.  Once again, he wrenches our hearts with a powerhouse performance equal to that of his turn in the supernatural blockbuster ""The Sixth Sense"".  With his porous eyes and petite pucker, Osment is a sight for sore eyes and it's hard not to sympathize when he becomes the victim of cruel circumstance.  William Hurt does a nice job as Professor Hobby, David's lord and creator and a man torn between personal grief and his lifelong aspirations for technological triumph.  Jack Angel, a man who has done several voiceovers for animated movies and television shows gives the fuzzy-faced supertoy Teddy personality and compassion while Frances O'Connor (Mansfield Park, Bedazzled) looks beautiful, stricken and mystified all at the same time as Monica, David's orga mother.The most entertaining character is Gigolo Joe (Law), a mecha designed specifically for erotic ventures.  He's a suave and charming character that is quite obviously modeled after the twinkle-toed golden age movie star Fred Astaire.  Swathed in a nylon zoot suit and patent leather shoes that padebarie at a moment's notice, Joe can change his hair color at will and with a snap of his neck, serenade lovers with oldies resounding from a built-in radio.  Whenever Law takes a prolonged pause during the movie, his Play-Doh-like appearance makes him look like a statue snatched directly from Madame Trusseau's Wax Museum.Almost all of A.I.'s breathtaking visual effects are manned by the divine duo of Stan Winston and Dennis Muren.  Winston and Muren collaborated on the superb effects created for James Cameron's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", creating the mold for the T-1000, the movie's villainous doppelganger of malleable steel. Let's also not forget their dually produced jaw-dropping animatronics in Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"".  Spielberg and Kubrick picked the cream of the crop for their epic - Winston is the second of only two special effects artists to be honored with a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame and Muren, a man long recognized as one of the most accomplished innovators of modern visual film effects, is a member of the illustrious visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic.  Another old-hat is John Williams, an unearthly composer that has created dramatic and memorable scores for almost every one of Spielberg's films in the past (Jaws, E.T., Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, etc.).  This time around, he has produced a morose and eerie milieu for the symphonic resonance of A.I.  Where one might think there's a glint of hope, Williams paints a different picture with his immaculate and desolate oeuvres, a throng of weeping violins in the foreground of a melancholy chorus of woodwinds.Although ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" is quite the dour bedtime story, it benefits not only from its unique storytelling but also from its stark ability to reveal the truth about human nature.  It is only after taking a step outside of ourselves that we see the truth about one another and discover just how great the need for change really is."	4.0	Spielberg's Disconcerting Fable	2001-07-09	7	7	0

And after he died, Spielberg figured the best way to honor Kubrick was to make this film.Set in the not-so-far future where humans can make realistic robots (called mechas) comes an interesting take on the famous fairy tale Pinocchio.David (wonderfully played by Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his kind,an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings,who really wants to be a real boy.I still don't understand why no-one really liked this film,yes it's long but I love long films.

The special effects are fantastic, as are the script and the acting. The Jude Law character, &#34;Gigolo Joe,&#34; seemed a bit out of place, as did the glaring, blatant sexuality of Rouge City and the Flesh Fair. I'm not sure why Spielberg felt he needed to take the story to those extremes when he could have gotten his points across in a much gentler way that would be more suitable for younger audiences; I would be reluctant to take a younger teen or pre-teen to see this film for these reasons. I think the base-line story would be inspiring for younger audiences, however.

The first half of the movie was vital to the ending, yet, I felt it was painstakingly slow judging by the way my 11 year old fidgeted in his seat.  I was delighted when the pace picked up when the little mecha boy, Martin, began his journey into Oz, if you want to use Oz as an analogy.  How the movie could end at this point, as others have suggested is absolutely ridiculous!  Everything came together in the ending.  All I have to add about that is I have never in my life, displayed such control over my emotions as I did with this film.  I wanted to just stand up and yell stop, I can't handle any more of this painful longing for acceptance.  Maybe you have to be or once have been, a child who is unloved and in search of love to have this movie touch your very soul.

The subject matter is definitely thought provoking and the scenarios displayed in the film could have been far more provocative. I am sure Kubrick would've fought long and hard for an &quot;R&quot; rating if the subject matter was allowed to go the full distance since this movie isn't what you would consider an &quot;E.T.-ish&quot; or &quot;Close Encounter-ish&quot; framework. It's a very dark portrait of the possibilities of man over machine and quite possibly man becoming machine.There is so much to love about this film. If you take a step back and really think about it, the story will have you contemplating scene after scene for days. Having just watched it last night, I am reminded at how far we have come as a technological humanity in just the last one hundred years. Now imagine a few hundred more years, or even possibly 2000 more years! That's big! Steven Spielberg as always pulls this one off folks! To take subject matter that large and translate it to a visual product would be impossible for almost any director. Except Steven Spielberg!The story of AI is quite a simple one. It takes the legacy of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and transposes it to an ultramodern sci-fi epic. From the set designs, actors, special effects, costumes and a plethora of other entities, we are treated to something that is obviously much larger than we are.So why the three stars? Intellect.This movie lacks a lot of intellect. Not because it isn't smart. I think it tries too hard to &quot;look&quot; smart. From the unexplainable mannerisms of &quot;David&quot; as a supposed &quot;brilliantly designed&quot; robot that doesn't stop eating spinach, to plots holes galore found in the final ending. You are given this beautiful banquet of a film and all you get is a fat-filled hamburger and French fries WITH A DIET COKE! Satisfying for some, but not for all.  I also think that narration in sci-fi movies has never really worked unless they are used very sparingly. &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; should've been used as an example for this movie to avoid the senseless narrations. Narration simply makes the audience feel dumb and it leaves little for the viewer to contemplate when a scene is truly meant to be quiet, serene and simple.Should you miss AI?

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1E74B88Z4C0P2	Stelios Touchtidis	I think the problem with this film is that it tried to appeal to a mass audience -- and it went way over its head. If you are an SF reader, or just like to think about what is not in the realm of commonly accepted wisdom, you will find it one of the most intelligent and touching movies ever.The acting is nothing short of superb. Haley Joel Osment walks perfectly the tightrope between playing a boy and playing a robot that has a very sophisticated program to make him pretend to be a boy. He remains a robot throughout, but only if you are careful -- otherwise his program can easily seduce you in forgetting who he is. Jude Law has what must have been one of the most fun parts ever, and his robot gigolo with a heart of gold is every bit as memorable as any Oz character. Other supporting roles are very ably handled.The imagery is also breathtaking, with sunken New York and the town of the robot witch-hunt being poignantly rendered. The emphasis is on strangeness but the effect is beauty as well.But the best part is the central search for meaning by a character to whom meaning is just a definition. In watching the un-human way that the little robot pursues his dream, you get to wonder how much of our own thinking is just even better programming by mother nature. Where does free will come in?I only gave the movie four stars because the last 10 minutes or so (set centuries after the rest of the movie) comprise a deus-ex-machina 'solution' that is quite pointless and should have been cut. The movie really should have ended with the boy endlessly -- and contentedly -- waiting for the answers that will never come. Spielberg perhaps felt that this would have been too frustrating, but his attempt at a 'solution' diminishes what could have been an all-time masterpiece.	4.0	A completely underrated film	2002-01-19	5	5	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3LXKO2S6G2DBI	"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant"""	A.I. is one of those movies that makes you wonder who is making the decisions in Hollywood.  After all, just imagine the pitch:  &quot;Give me a hundred million dollars to remake Disney's Pinocchio as an emotionally hollow, live-action nightmare that offers lots of high-minded questions about existence but no tangible answers.&quot;  Noteworthy mostly because of the collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, the movie struggles on nearly all levels except the most blandly technical, though even the production design looks recycled, a strange combination of Blade Runner and Batman and Robin, with a dash of Spielberg's standard Coca Cola/McDonalds/The Gap sensibilities thrown in.  The story is more or less Pinocchio, except the wooden boy is mechanical and the adventure is just plain depressing.  The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osmont rehashes his performance from that film, this time as a robot, David, starved for his rather unappealing adoptive mother's affection while questing to understand the meaning of life.  You want to like this film because of the immediacy of its characters' pathos, but even with sincere performances from Osmont and Jude Law (and a robot teddy bear that, ironically, is more interesting than either of their characters), Spielberg never manages to harness anything meaningful or uplifting in what is essentially a bloated fairy tale.  The finality of the film's conclusion is particularly cynical.  One might argue nihilism is the point of A.I., but then one must ask the more important question:  why bother?  I'd also invite Spielberg to get out more--his constant film reiterations of the U.S., present and projected future, as a for-whites-only nation dotted by the occasional racial minority is neither accurate nor particularly endearing.  Even the irony of a scene that mocks six-pack America's obsession with professional wrestling and demolition derby (and a large portion of the audience for his movies) is lost in a film that rather spookily suggests about a quarter of our population will all but disappear.  In many ways, that's a more interesting conflict to resolve than anything in this movie.	2.0	A Hollow and Dour Pinocchio	2002-12-24	10	4	6

But I keep coming back to the sadness.  It's not the type of downer sadness that pushes those buttons that films find so alluring, but rather it deals with death in a way that gives meaning to death.  Not in the usual way of ""rebirth"" or even alluding to God and a new existence (another form of ""rebirth"", anyway) but rather absolute and final ENDING which has a beautiful closure and brings nobility to fatalism.  I wasn't crying for the loss of things, but rather for the acknowledgement of truth.  That being that even though life is a futile attempt at happiness, and is in a constant state of decay and entropy, when all is said and done maybe there is hope that even though things are not eternal, at least beauty and meaning can be experienced while life is still present."	5.0	Simply one of the best films ever.	2002-11-13	5	0	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"+++++This movie is based on the short story ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long"" as well as on a screen story.As a very brief synopsis, the movie occurs in the future when global warming is having an effect on the planet.  The movie begins with a discussion between Professor Hobby (William Hurt) and his students on artificial intelligence (the development of machines or programs capable of humanlike thought processes).  The professor announces that an artificial boy will be built who has the capacity to love.  Then we are introduced to this artificial or ""Mecha"" (mechanical) boy named David (Haley Joel Osment) who becomes part of a real organic or ""orga"" mother and father family. The mother then programs him for unconditional love (that is, to love her no matter what).  However, things don't work out and David is abandoned to fend for himself believing that if he becomes real, the mother will want him back.  Befriended by a streetwise ""love"" Mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), the rest of the story is about David searching for the ""Blue Fairy"" who he believes has the power to make him real.The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Osment (who was thirteen years old at the time) carries the movie quite well as the artificial boy David.  Jude Law's character of Gigolo Joe is quite interesting.I feel the background music is exceptional.  The movie is also technically superb with amazing images and special effects.Despite all the good things about this movie, I feel it has some problems:(1) The story.  The great Stanley Kubrick (known for his dark movies) worked on this project for a dozen years before his death and along the way decided to let Steven Spielberg direct.  (Spielberg is known for his cutesy, hopeful movies.)  The two collaborated for years resulting in Kubrick giving Spielberg considerable artistic leeway for this movie before his death.  This collaboration shows.  The movie begins (after a brief introduction) as hopeful and cutesy or, in other words, Spielbergish, then gets dark or Kubrickish, then its conclusion (which takes place in the far, far future) is Spielbergish again.  This resulted in an uneven story.(2) I had trouble feeling for an artificial boy.  The result was that this movie, to be sure, was interesting but boring.  Its long length also contributed to it being boring.(3) Spielberg added a character of ""Teddy,"" a ""supertoy"" and teddy bear that can walk and talk.  It becomes David's companion.  I know this movie is supposed to be a fairy tale but I found this character really, really annoying and even distracting.Thus, this movie can be described as a ""flawed masterpiece.""  That is, it's technically brilliant but with story problems.I would recommend this movie to hardcore sci-fi fantasy fans.  Despite the teddy bear, it is definitely not for children.Finally, the DVD itself (Special Edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a host of extras that mostly concentrate on the technical aspects of this movie.In conclusion, Steven Spielberg described this movie as a ""future fairy tale.""

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1YVTP35OVMWMN	Stephen P. Osvath	"About two or three times per year, I purchase a DVD ""sight-unseen"" based on reviews that I've read.  Usually, it's because the comments and/or divided opinions about the movie intrigued me enough to have it in my collection.  Sometimes it works out well; other times, it's a complete bust.  One thing I've learned is that movies affect people in very different ways.  All of my favorite films have been trashed by someone (often world-reknowned critics) and all of the films that I think are terrible are on someone's ""favorite"" list (sometimes winning best picture, to my dismay).  Film reviewing is a very subjective occupation indeed.  With that in mind -- on Thursday, I bought A.I. sight-unseen.  Here are my thoughts, ...1.  A.I. is one of the very best movies that I've seen in years!  I was captivated from beginning to end and I'm still thinking of it days later.  I absolutely cannot understand why some of the reviews I've read were so negative.  It was the perfect fairy tale.2.  I vehemently disagree with all of the opinions expressed about the ending (*** don't worry, ... no spoilers here ***).  The ending was absolutely perfect.  I thought that the film couldn't have tied everything together so perfectly with any other ending.  A.I. was an epic, to say the least.  I also don't believe that it ran one second too long.3.  I cannot understand why so many people thought that, of the three acts, two were Kubrik and the last was all Spielberg.  I disagree.  I thought that the movie flowed beautifully among the three acts.  Although the ending certainly took me by surprise, I didn't think it was out of place from the context of what had preceded AT ALL!  In fact, it was a breathtaking twist on the overall story and what made it so memorable.4.  This 2-disc DVD set is as well-done as anything I own (with a collection of about 150 DVDs right now).  The picture and sound are perfectly done -- it is obvious that great care was taken in mastering this DVD.  The extras are amazing and plentiful.  My wife and I, after watching the movie, sat through all of the extras!  I've never done that before, ever.  A.I. is a great addition to my collection of DVDs.  I look forward to watching it again.5.  The Oscars are totally fixed if A.I. does not get the following Academy Awards:A.I. should be nominated for, ...Best PictureIt should win (hands-down), ...Best Actor (Haley Joel Osment)Best Supporting Actor (Jude Law)Best Director (Steven Spielberg)Best Original ScreenplayBest Art DirectionBest Special EffectsBest MakeupBest Costume DesignOf course, we already know that A.I. is going to get robbed due to its lack of success at the box office.Shame.All I have to say is, ... Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews that you may have read about this movie, ... they're nuts.Go out and buy this film today.  Don't expect Star Wars.  It's not that.  However, if you love character development, a deep story, and films that make you think -- you won't be disappointed!"	5.0	A.I. is the perfect fairy tale!!!	2002-03-09	7	5	2

It fails at every turn. Instead it comes off as a maudlin fairy tale, sprinkled with technobabble. It has plot holes you could drive a hovercopter through.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AS36WIZJ3R2OS	Steve Hsu	It surprised me to see some reviewers critising this movie for its boring , its ending, its storyline ....etc. Hey, only the acting of Haley Joel Osment is worth everything.Don't expect to see a Starwar or ID4like action packed sci-fiction movie. A.I. is all about love, the uncoditional love from a child for his mommy. I felt sorry for Monica(Frances O'Connor), she asked for the love(by impriting David - Haley Joel Osment) and yet, not dare to accept it. Only at the end of the movie when she can't remember anything but David, she told him,&quot;I have always loved you&quot;. That's the moment David had been waiting and hoping for his whole life and it's the most touching moment of the movie.On the contrary to some reviewers, I think the ending is perfect. Because David went to sleep for the first time in his life and in his dreams, he will be with his beloved mommy forever. It is indeed &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.Of course this review is for the one who has already seen the movie, as for the one who hasn't, you will love it if you have love in you.	5.0	No one tops Haley Joel Osment	2002-03-10	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	"This is a movie that everybody loves to hate. But I love it, for many of the reasons that others hate it.People expecting your standard E.T. Spielberg movie are creeped out by some of the uncomfortable scenes: the flesh fair, the rivalry between Martin and David, the alternate creepy/cuddliness of David himself.But most of the criticism comes from the Kubrickians upset with the corny Spielberg touches, particularly the ending. They would be happier with a pure, dark vision of the future that would have left David at the bottom of the ocean.The conflict between the Spielberg/Kubrick visions and between the contrasting emotions that audiences feel however I believe is integral to the duality that David represents. David is both Pinocchio and real. He has emotions, and yet he is a pile of circuits. Do your eyes tear up when he is abandoned, do you feel compassion? Or are you repelled by David's creepy unnaturalism, the way the owner of the flesh fair is?Once created, does a robot that can love deserve respect, compassion, love in return, rights?That is the central question that the movie is asking, and there are no easy answers.Your reactions say as much about you as about the movie.Some, like myself, will feel torn between the two emotions and come away with an uncomfortable feeling that ultimately is deeply satisfying.If you go to the movies to make you think, there is no better movie made last year. This is a movie that will have you debating with your friends for hours over the meaning of existence, moviemaking techniques and the morality of advanced robotics.If you go to the movies to have all of the answers tied up in one, neat, tidy package, this movie will drive you nuts.Regardless of how you feel about the story, the acting and the production values in this movie are first-rate. Haley Joel Osment is absolutely convincing as an android Pinocchio who is striving to be a real boy. He's downright creepy in moments just how fake he seems, and yet at others he is as real as any boy, playing to the heart of the Pinocchio/real duality that David represents (and the universal need to feel ""special"" and ""unique"" -- note that David loses hope momentarily when he sees dozens of other ""Davids"" shrinkwrapped for sale in one of the movie's most powerful scenes.)The supporting cast, ranging from the everpresent ""Teddy"" -- The Jiminy Cricket character -- to William Hurt as the myopic robot designer, to Martin as the jealous brother, are dead-on convincing.And Jude Law as Gigolo Joe almost steals the show as the lover model with a romantic streak.This is one movie that will hold up and be talked about long after most of the detritus of 2001 (The Mummy Returns, etc.) will be put to the dust heap of history.If you want a good movie where good and evil are easy to follow and understand, go watch Lord of the Rings.If you want a movie where the lines are blurred, where you never quite know which side you are supposed to be on, watch A.I."	4.0	An uncomfortable near-masterpiece...	2002-04-21	4	2	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"Science fiction stories dealing with the morally-fraught cusp between mechanical and biological machines are usually interesting because they inevitably grapple with question of what it means to be human. Is it our intelligence, our higher consciousness, or simply our capacity to love?  Or is there really no difference between us and machines?  ""A.I."" asks all the big questions, but then answers them rather disappointingly with a syrupy, overlong and surprisingly tedious remake of ""Pinocchio"".  Spielberg's point seems to be that it's our myths of transformation that define our humanity. Fair enough point - I just wish he'd made it into a better film. ""A.I."" lacks the excitement of ""Blade Runner"" and the emotional power of the heavily underrated ""Bicentennial Man"", both of which deal with similar material in a far more engaging way.  Moreover, Spielberg's deservedly renowned skill as a masterful director seems to have deserted him.  Over exposed film stock and an undercooked script do not a good film make.  Still, at least ""A.I."" is ABOUT something, which puts it well ahead of Hollywood's usual platter of repetitive teen comedies and gormless action films."	3.0	Beautiful but dull	2002-06-01	4	3	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3UMC7TLQSUK25	"Stewart Axelrad ""sunbard"""	When I heard that A.I. was a &quot;collaboration&quot; between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg, I was intrigued and forced myself not to hold any preconceptions about the film. After all, these 2 directors have completely different styles. Having seen the film at my local theater, I can now say that it is a good film that could have been much better. True, it could have been shorter (it currently runs at about 2 and 1/2 hours). I also feel that Spielberg wanted to be true to Kubrick's original vision, while incorporating some of his own ideas. The result is a compromise that would not have pleased Mr. Kubrick. The first half of the film works on many levels, up the point where David (the Osment character) is left to fend for himself. The relationship between David and his &quot;mother&quot; brought up some interesting issues regarding the relationship between parent and child, if the &quot;child&quot; happens to be a robot. The Pinnochio analogy was apparent, with William Hurt as the Gepetto character; even though he had very limited screen time, he gave the best performance in my opinion. The second half of the film tries to do and be too much, in terms of plot. I actually thought the film was about to end at one point; it then went on for another 30 minutes. The actual ending seemed poorly thought out and really didn't make any sense to me. Also, the Jude Law character was completely extraneous and had no relationship to the rest of the plot. However, even with all of these flaws, the film was very entertaining and the special effects and robot creations were a definite thumbs up. If Spieberg had curbed his self-indulgence and tightened up the plot a bit, this would have been Oscar material. As it stands, a good flick for those who like the science fiction and fantasy film genre.	3.0	It's Not E.T., but............	2001-07-05	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2KVUYPLEW4LXT	"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time"""	"Like many great directors, Speilburg's versatility contues to amaze. Not content to break box-office records and bring home the horrors of the battlefield, Speilburg decided to finish a project long left unfinished that he had collaborated on with the controversial genius Stanley Kubrick. The result, while far from popular with mainsteam moviegoers, is a landmark science-ficiton fillmsure to be remembered long after the blockbusters of the moment have faded from memory.This film is about many things. It is about people who are becoming more like animals, and machines who are becoming more like human beings. It is about technology, obsolescence, and the stagnation and ruin an ideology of convenience and leisure inevitably leads to. But most of all, this is a story about a boy who is a machine and yet dreams of becoming ""a real boy"". David, played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment (perhaps the greatest child actor in history), goes through an incredible spiritual journey in his personal quest to become what he feels he must in order to win the love a human mother. At first quite an awekward ""mecha"", once the magic words to make him bond with a human are spoken, David finds himself victim to the unconditional love that a child feels for it's parent; a love that can never be switched off. As a result of this programming (and what is love if not instinct, and instinct if not programming?), and David's rivalry with the son he was once meant to replace, David becomes our eyes into a vision of the future, a world where the mechanical show more kindness and compassion thaqn their creators (the kindness of a french-maid mecha facing her demise had tears welling up in my eyes), and the unwanted almost-human are tortured, hunted down and executed for public spectacle (in perhaps the most disturbing part of the film).Really, David's joruney is a metaphor for the story of Pinnochio, but also a metaphor for the journey that every human being must go through in their life and search for happiness. While some might dislike te ending of this film, I found it enjoyable and immensely profound. Like the rest of this picuture, the final scenes call to mind more questions than they answer.Throughout the movie, questions came flooding to my mind. What is the differnce between programming and instinct? What is love really? If emotional look real, are they real? And perhaps the greatest question, (which concludes this mind-trip of a film) if love feels real, does it matter whether or not it is an illusion?

Could-a, should-a, if only would-a ended it for good at the two or three opportunities that clearly presented themselves. The film is actually physically painful to sit through, not because it was two and a half hours long, but because it seemed like five. It felt like weights were being piled on top of me, a pound a minute. There is no God if a &#65533;director&#65533;s cut&#65533; is ever issued with extra footage. The effects were quite good, but only CGI good. The novelty of this technology is already dissipating, giving every film that uses it a flat, canned, feel and appearance. I&#65533;m really starting to believe appliances, miniatures, and puppets produced much better FX. The bear should be given his own movie, though. If only this had been &#65533;Teddy&#65533;s Story&#65533;, told through the innocence of his point of view. Him, I cared about. How is he built? Where was he made? What does he think? How long do his batteries last? Can he crochet or do needlepoint in addition to mending? Will he suddenly jump to his feet and amble off the set in disgust? -- the most human/sensible member of the entire cast. Logical holes abound -- important corporate offices and manufacturing facilities in dangerous, rusting, semi-inundated buildings; catastrophic global flooding has destroyed the world, yet natural resources and high technology apparently abound; mom dumps robo-kid in Disneyesque black forest in cruel, weepy scene instead of putting an ad in the robot-trader magazine (or hitting his &#65533;off&#65533; switch); an hour after it should have mercifully ended, aliens/super-robots (???) appear, speaking swell English, yet explaining practically nothing; alien/super-robots can somehow revive one particular person on one particular day for robo-kid&#65533;s fulfilling enjoyment, but for only one day, tops; and others too numerous to mention. ...well, maybe just one more, a very basic and important one. The robot&#65533;s attachment I can understand, it&#65533;s programmed, but an emotional-ditz mothering what&#65533;s essentially a GE toaster-oven? Nope. What&#65533;s the deal, do the kid&#65533;s robo-pores exude some sort of futuristic, psycho-hypnotic, maternal love potion? Taking nothing away from H. J. Osmet&#65533;s fine effort, the robot&#65533;s programming is neither that good nor that convincing, if that&#65533;s what we&#65533;re supposed to be led to believe. He acts and sounds like a robot, period. Mr. S. has invented a new film genre, a genre called &#65533;saccharine noire&#65533; or perhaps &#65533;dark schmaltz&#65533;. Apparently, this genre was never invented prior to this because the illogic of the two strands causes them to completely annihilate one another, thus neutralizing any meaningful, sustainable plot-line and anaesthetizing a large part of the paying audience in the process.	1.0	Close Encounter with Huge Turkey	2001-08-27	20	9	11

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2WIF48MCM3L5E	Susannah	"This movie is less than the sum of its parts, but even though it is problematic, it still rewards the viewer's attention.The Pinnochio theme is obvious from the outset, but so is the cinematic debt the film and its makers owe to Blade Runner.  Like Blade Runner, A.I. deals with the interaction between human and android (sorry, replicant) and the humanism and ethics, or lack thereof, that apply to such relationships.Haley Joel Osment is a marvel in the role of David, the mechanical prototype boy who is ""adopted"" by a couple whose only child lies in an apparently irredeemable coma.  The odyssey of this family, and of David, in a future society that is breaking down and rebuilding itself right and left, continues until the last moment.Osment is the linchpin of A.I.  This child is amazingly talented and can lift up virtually any material on his little shoulders. If George Lucas had hired him to play the young Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace would have had some depth.  Osment's performance in one gut-wrenching scene is so true it's literally painful to watch; expect to need more Kleenex long after the scene is over.The film is hindered by some standard sticking points, among them sci-fi economics (in which the world is mostly destroyed -- and yet people live in huge, architecturally unique houses with nice landscaping; certain common products, such as perfume, become incredibly precious because they cannot be replaced -- and yet people seem to be quite wasteful of many resources), a broken-backed format in which new characters are suddenly introduced and the others virtually forgotten, and a kind of nervous breakdown (and bizarre deus ex machina) in the last reel in which A.I. sort of becomes a different film entirely.The latter structural problem is no doubt due to the untimely death of Stanley Kubrick, who had handed the project over to Steven Spielberg.  Kubrick's influence is seen through most of the film, until, toward the end, Spielberg pours on his (arguably worst) influence 110%.The special effects are outstanding, but it is Haley Joel Osment who makes this film worth the time and money."	4.0	uneven, but many remarkable scenes, plus haley joel osment	2002-04-12	8	5	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2F0Q8RO8Y8VEX	Susan O'Neill	This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen on the big screen. Or, actually, three of the worst movies, because it seemed to be three somewhat irrelevant movies patched together. The first was actually relatively engaging and dark--the Pinnocchio tale of a mechanical boy given to a family to replace a terminally comatose child. Then--Ta-DUM!--the original boy miraculously recovers, and the second movie, an overblown and disturbingly bad story of a runaway on a quest, ensues. And later comes the third. I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it (as if I could spoil it !), but let's just say I laughed aloud. A few minutes later, when I realized they really WEREN'T kidding, I became terribly depressed... I would have bailed at that point, if I hadn't been glued to the floor by a year-old puddle of coke. Chewing my leg off to get free wasn't an option, unfortunately, because I'm a vegetarian.Frankly, I can't imagine anything a DVD could add to this flick. Unless...Perhaps there's a track that features Haley Joel Osment, confessing that aliens kidnapped him and sucked him into this project. Or maybe Jude Law, who actually did look like he was enjoying himself up there, laughing all the way to the bank. Or maybe Steven Spielberg...Naw.	1.0	They were kidding, right?	2002-02-28	21	6	15

His character is a robot who is programmed to unconditionally love his ""parents"".  Unfortunately his parents are creeped out by him and leave him in the woods to fend for himself. So this robot who has been programmed to love this couple has been abandoned and he's like a salmon swimming upstream - doesn't know what to do with himself. It's twisted. It's Kubrick's ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" turned on it's head - the robot is the victim. The special effects are amazing - Manhattan under water, the animatronic bear. Towards the end you keep thinking the movie is about to end - yet there is another scene...but the last scene is heartrbreaking. It's a chilling Kubrick movie shown through the eyes of commercial boxoffice E.T. director Steven Spielberg. The ying and yang of both directors visions are brilliant. Only Spielberg could have gotten the budget for such an off-beat movie. It's kind a cross between Pinochio and Wizard of Oz - but dark. Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing nuanced performance. Just looking in Haley's eyes - he is able to convey intelligence and feelings far beyond someone his age. I highly recommend this dark fairytale."	5.0	dark big budget movie	2005-02-12	3	2	1

Those who do not understand the Gaze, what Eisenstein or Lacan were writing about, had better clear off. This film shows us something like unto the dilemma of automobile traffic: People far too stupid to be driving can always get themselves a license. Anybody, including a tiny tot, can walk into a theatre, but there is no guarantee they will understand what is going on.  People who are themselves something like artificial creations of their own egos will not ""get"" this at all, if they come to a creation like this expecting the gut-rushing thrills of Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. Notice, those two (now, presumably, ""classic"" titles) each include a measure of death.  Well, no one really dies in those movies. Artificial Intelligence delivers on its title and tagline, and you will have a devil of a time figuring out what is real, what is not, and what makes you real, after all, by the end of this, if you can comprehend it at all. Even the windows go smart in this film.AI may be one of the greatest films ever made, for it takes the entire conception of cinema, from its very beginnings, as its topic. While in film school, I fiddled with a little Benji bear of my wife's, I would get it in at least one shot of every film I made.  Don't you see? We have a need to project life on to things like teddy bears, so we can love them. In the cinema , one is enabled to do this. Terminator can cut off Arnold Schwarzenegger's arm, right while Arnie is pretending to be the terminator,  or cut out his eye, and he is a cyborg underneath! HJ Osment can pretend to be a robot--or an animation or an animatronic device can pretend to be him. If you slow the film down, or freeze frame it, you can see that this is simply a representation. In an earlier day you could even take the film itself off the reel and look at it, frame by frame. How real is an image in gel and silver nitrate?  But perhaps we, ourselves, are merely representations of our parents' DNA. They were the real people. We are virtual.All in the film, the almost perfect illusion, the simulation, of life itself. So if simulation became reflective, due to neuronal sequencing, as here, would it have an ""existence""? If you were not really you, say, but a huge battery of stored memory, still thinking, still active even though your body is dead, and this memory bank still remembered all the things you had done in your life, and thought about them, as your things, and reflected on them, just as you reflect as you are reading this, would that be an identity, an existence?  If things such as global warming, or nuclear war are concerns, right now, perhaps you should think of these things. And, by the way, this film does a masterful job of creating a future creation--some time far hence--in which human existence on this planet becomes challenged. You need to think about the issues this film brings to the surface. The beautiful silicon resin and fiber android beings with their nanotechnological disassembling car may never happen, you know. We may kill ourselves off before we have managed to create artificial intelligence.Visually, also, tremendous eye-candy, stunning effects, and Jude Law is absolutely brilliant in his role as Gigolo Joe. Just imagine, girls, a life-sized, musical comedy dildo. A world overcome by water, and ice.  A species extinguished by its own inventiveness.

He didn't give up, and Spielberg completed his dream. And the character david (an android played by Haley Joel Osmet) never gave up on his dream of being loved.This is the story of Pinocchio, in every sense, yet in modern terms. Of course, having read the other reviews, you know this.So many people panned this film because it wasn't ET. Well, IT'S NOT! There is no squatty alien with a glowing finger!!! This is a tale of sadness and longing. Sadness and longing from creations designed by man to love, yet abhorred and hunted because they can. The paradoxes abound in this film, which would have been an easy translation of Pinocchio, but set in the near future.The effects are superb, and create a seamlessly real future. They appear effortlessly real, which draws the viewer into the reality. There are two surprises here. One is Jude Law.Jude Law plays Gigilo Joe, a `mecka' programmed for female pleasure, who discovers his own humanity while helping David (Haley Joel Osmet) discover his.The other is the final five minutes of the ending, which I will not give away.If you have read my reviews, you know I weigh heavily on cinematogrophy and soundtrack to create a film. The filming actually allows you to watch this movie as if it were real, and the soundtrack surrounds you as softly as david's dream of becoming real. There are flaws; the length, and the fact you feel the movie ends twice. Get past them. The personal revelation in final five minutes is worth the indecision.Ignore the poor reviews, and watch the interaction between Law and Osmet. Watch the android David's face. You WANT him to be able to express his pain.This is what the movie is about.	4.0	Never Give Up On A Dream	2002-07-17	1	1	0

I doubt others will either.A.I. should have stayed a short story, IMO, because I bet it was excellent. Same can be said for &quot;Trucks&quot; by Stephen King and his dismal movie &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;.It's sad that Kubricks last two movies (Eyes Wide Shut and A.I.) and the remnants of this movie he worked on for so long leave a stain on some of his greater works.	1.0	Should have stayed in Kubrick's trunk	2001-07-15	3	1	2

He manages to show off his brilliant acting skills throughout the duration of the movie- he is a robot who cannot comprehend why his &quot;mother&quot; doesn't love him... he cannot cry, he cannot stop loving.The ending of the movie is bizarre, but it's also really good too.How people can say this is a family film I don't know... it's too heavy going for children (and apparently most stupid popcorn guzzling gun-toting Americans too)Give the film a chance.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A268EEWUXYCA8Q	Terry Mesnard	There is a phrase that has been used throughout time and is very fitting in one sense here: there are too many cooks in the kitchen.  Normally, you can see this problem when a screenplay is written and rewritten by different people because it ends up distorting the story.  You have one person thinking the story should go one way, another thinking it should go the opposite and then the third person thinks they are both wrong and it needs to go his way.  When that happens, disaster usually follows.I use this example to help explain my problems with this film.  It originated as a Stanley Kubrick film that he had been wanting to do for years.  He had been waiting for technology to catch up so he could create what could have been his magnum opus had he not passed away.  He and Spielberg were friends and Spielberg took up directing and finishing Kubrick's film from the notes, story boards etc that Kubrick had created.Unfortunately, what happened was that Kubrick's usually bleak and often satiric look at society became a sappy story with a weird, semi-oedipal ending.  It started as a film in which Kubrick wanted to examine the fairy tale story of Pinnochio and show how society can fool itself into wanting what we can never have.  The pursuit of the Blue Fairy becomes a pursuit for something that doesn't exist and can lead to our devastation.  That was a story that seemed interesting, if bleak and depressing.In fact, 2/3 of the movie seemed to be heading in that direction.  And then came the sappy ending that Spielberg decided to end on.  It wasn't the ending Kubrick would have ended with.  Instead, it tied everything up in a nice knot, albeit a weird and kind of disturbing one that seemed incredibly out of place with the themes and tone of the previous 2/3s.If Kubrick had been alive to create his magnum opus, the movie would have been quite different and, in my opinion, much better.  Instead of relying on the maudlin ending that gave even the robot a second chance at love, he wouldn't have compromised what his story was really about.  Love it or hate it, the story was originally supposed to be about the disillusion of the Pinnochio story.  That's not what we got.  The first 2/3s of the movie is verging on 5 stars.  The last 1/3 is a 1 star, trite and maudlin effort.  Overall, I'm sad to say it's 3 stars for me.	3.0	Total does not equal the sum of its parts	2005-05-04	4	1	3
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQ0YZNKQ4G6JI	Tevis Jacobs	In all honesty, A.I. was one of the worst films I've seen.  I was very disappointed to see that any of Kubrick's bright ideas were overshadowed by lengthy and excessively corny Spielberg scenes.  I felt myself not caring about any of the characters and wishing the film would end (which it takes a very long time to do.)  Finally, towards the end of the movie you are in for a surprise when you think that it is over and instead it launches into the final scene.  This is when I turned from simply disliking the movie to utterly hating it.  Please save your money and your three hours.

The fact that David's ""love is real but he is not"" means that what we're seeing is NOT REAL - it's a simulation of love, intelligence and so on. Combined with this bizarre and welcome conceptual leap into the unknown, the film looks and sounds gorgeous.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3JLKDUV0B6O5U	TFR	I bought the &quot;AI:Artificial Intelligence&quot; DeLuxe Double DVD set with all the bells and whistles for about eight dollars at a used bookstore. That should have been the tipoff right there.I can't imagine what sort of demographic the target audience for this movie could be. However, calling AI &quot;Sceince Fiction&quot; is a stretch, since most of what takes place is more in the realm of fantasy. Modern sceince basically tells us what can be possible, and based on what is known about what is and is not possible, something like the scenario described will never happen.Overall, the movie looks and feels like a tired version of Pinnochio, an awful story in its own right. The screenplay is basically built around this non-human kid-thing with feelings that eventually gets caught up in a quagmire of its own making. Like the wooden puppet created by Gepetto, it wants to be a real boy.AI is not about what may or may not take place in the future, because the question of whether or not human beings can create life itself is rather supercilious. Instead, much of what takes place in AI is more in the realm of fantasy, because the story itself is based on physical implausibility.For example, the human characters in the story look, act and behave pretty much like human beings do in the twenty-first century. In the event that human beings were ever able to create high-functioning entities from inanimate matter in the complexity this film describes at great length, then they would cease to resemble human beings. By that time, the human race would have evolved into some form that would make all of us look like neanderthals.AI is not sceince fiction, anymore than &quot;High Noon&quot; was a western. AI is a morality play, pure and simple. The message has more to do with the acceptance of artificial intelligence as a gateway to Godlike empowerment, sans spirituality. The future of the world as portrayed in AI is immoral, without feeling, without compassion. It is heartless, cold, and if you get the message behind AI, we're all headed that way.In the future, those quiet, Sunday picnics with your kids in the back yard will be lost and gone forever, because on the next lot over are a man and woman who like to get dressed up in leather and get into some great S and M action with you and your wife. You won't even think about your kids, because they'll be entertained at an amusement park filled with freaks and geeks as characters in fantasy games.Instantaneous travel to anywhere on earth will be available to all citizens; Plans to make everything from methampetamine to bombs made from fertilizer and fuel oil will be sold by vending machines; Devil worship will become obsolete because the concept of spirituality will be dead; Violent, pornographic images will become contemporary art that can be purchased at discount stores.But none of this will matter anyway, because by that time, all human beings will understand that the pursuit of Artificial Intelligence, not love or procreation, not the human pursuits of art, literature, or music and certainly not metaphysics, is the reason that the human race must continue to exist.The story of Pinnochio was cold, but this scenario is a sheer wall of ice. The human characters portrayed are, basically, less human than the robots they are struggling to create. They react to situations in ways that seem rather arbitrary and almost nonsensical at times, given the circumstances.More than likely, if you believe in some concept of God (whether it involves Allah, Jesus, Buddah, or Cosmic Muffin), and you are trying to maintain some measure of hope, then &quot;AI&quot; probably is not for you.It was truly a hateful experience to watch this dog. The thing seemed to go on and on, forever. Then, when I thought it was going to finally end, the aliens showed up. I can't tell you how cheated I felt. The next day, I sold it back to the store that I bought it from. I couldn't wait to get rid of it.Oh well...

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AT7W1EXT0PF2Y	The Patriarch	This movie gets a lot of harsh criticism, but it's actually pretty good. Most criticism make sense, but the movie's flaws don't seem so apparent if you see what the movie is trying to say and can empathize with the characters. Man at the current time, is very cynical and uncaring. And because today's generation wasn't really raised by their mothers it is very difficult for the majority of people to understand a story about a young boy's love for his mother and the hurt he feels when separated and alienated from her. Thanks to the women's lib movement women spend most of their time outside the home and as a result spend little time with their children. Therefore, if a person has never had a proper mother/child relationship how can he or she emphasize with a child who is separated from his mother? The movie runs a bit long, which isn't usually a bad thing, but perhaps it harms this movie because somethings simply could have been cut. The first half goes on for a very long time building up the story, so you're kind of tired by the time the action half of the movie begins. The ending is a bit confusing with the aliens and everything and perhaps could have been improved and shortened. Many criticize the movie for being a rewrite of the Pinocchio story. What they have to realize is that most movies are simply old folktales, mythology, or even older movies simply rewritten. In short, this movie isn't perfect, but in no way is it a bad movie, simply misunderstood by today's fast culture.	5.0	Not a bad flick, with an overlooked message	2007-07-20	3	3	0

You get this absolute piece of crap that we call Artificial Intelligence.  Stanley Kubrick created the idea for the film, and the idea is not a bad one.  The main problem is that Speilberg decided to write it.  Now, Steven Speilberg is not an intellectual at all which would be a requirement of the writer if this movie were to successfully present itself.  Also, it seems that instead of following his own thoughts for the film, Speilberg must have said to himself, ""Hmmmmm.  I better try to be like Stanley and so i'll make this movie as dark as I can with a few touches of my E.T. type sweetness.""Problems with this:A.  There is so much more to Stanley Kubrick's art than just ""darkness.""B.  Speilberg couldn't make a good dark movie if his life depended on it. (and I mean Clockwork Orange/Taxi Driver type dark i.e. Schindler's List isn't included.  I say this not wanting you assuming that I didn't like Schindler's because I liked it very much.)  Speilberg is a good director, but he isn't infallible, especially as a writer it seems.C.  His love is real.....he is not.  Sound's like a cute movie does it not?  Oh the childish, heart-warming joy that comes from watching Haley Joel Osment violently decapitating himself. (See the movie to understand what i said, or better yet don't see it and cheat yourself out of a fun-loving family film......NOT!)The final result of A.I. is a three hour long movie that is so annoying you that the amazing visual spectacles arent even enough to stop you from at the very least wanting to leave the theater/burn the DVD.  The jumps from intensely creepy to teary-eyed-teddy-bear cuteness are simply too much for anyone who is of a sound mind to take.  The first 45 minutes of the movie are so unbelievably fake that its painful to watch. My favorite example of this is when the robot kid eats spaghetti in a funny but not comical way, the parents laught at him, and then they give eachother this look like, ""maybe we should keep him after all.""  Give me a freakin' break.For all you people who loved this movie, go ahead and love it.  But realize that you are a slave to the few words that read, ""A Steven Spielberg film.""  I say this because I feel that the only reason one might have for enjoying this movie is if they have some twisted blind obsession with Speilberg.The one star I gave this movie is shared by Stanley Kubrick and Jude Law.  For his few on screen moments, Jude Law  did what he could to save this movie, but it was ultimately all in vain, and Kubrick had the right intentions with this futuristic Pinochio tale and, sadly, he died before he could see it through to the end."	1.0	Speilberg= Artificial Intellect	2002-03-09	12	6	6

Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AUX6E06ULOW9W	"Thomas Martin ""Bothwell"""	I haven't read all 600+ reviews here but, I'm surprised not to have seen any mention of Frankenstein in the one's I have read. The Pinocchio comparison is obvious since it is in the movie. Consider that in the book Frankenstein's monster laments his existence throughout the book and is last seen in an icy world just as David laments his existence and spends eons in an icy world. The monster is in many ways more human than his creator; David is more human than anyone else in the movie. When David finds the place where he was created he becomes violent and destroys his other selves. It's been awhile since I read the book but I'm sure more comparisons can be made between the two even more so than Pinnochio. I think A.I. was excellent although the ending was flawed and probably should have ended with David frozen in front of the blue fairy.	5.0	David is Frankenstein's monster!	2002-02-27	5	3	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3CKNGJIZQGSKU	Thomas Speers	A recent film journal noted that Spielberg missed an opportunity with &quot;A.I.&quot; to provide something other than a predictable 'Hollywood happy ending'.  The inference was that Kubrick, had he directed the film, would have created a more realistic (if dispassionate and cynical) vision..and that this would be more true-to-life.It is difficult to be dispassionate about this film.  Doubtless Kubrick would have created a different vision; I would have been curious to see it, but am frankly glad Spielberg made this particular film.A.I. is a retelling of &quot;Pinnochio&quot;, but in its briefest form is a story about a boy whose deepest desire is to go home -- to be loved, understood, and from that perspective to have the world make sense.  I believe that image, and the emotions surrounding it, are deeply woven into American culture. It's powerful because it is also personal.A number of critics, assessing Spielberg's creations as an artist and with their own ideas of what film as an art form should be, might dismiss this observation as unsophisticated.  I couldn't care less.  I tend to vote with my heart and my feet; I've seen A.I. tiwce. See this film.	5.0	(No Title)	2001-08-12	4	3	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""AI: Artificial Intelligence"" is the work of a master filmmaker at the height of his power and also the work of a beginning storyteller, straight out of film school. For ""AI"", these two people are one and the same.In the future, the ice caps have melted and drowned many coastal cities around the world. This causes government bodies to enact laws restricting newborn birth, in an effort to save the dwindling resources of the Earth. Because of this, the scientific community continues to create and advance the science of android or meccas. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) creates a little boy mecca that is so advanced that people mistake David (Hayley Joel Osment) for a human. He even has the ability to love. David is adopted by a couple, the Swintons (Sam Robards, Frances O'Connor). The Swintons' real little boy is in a coma and David could provide the love that Monica Swinton is lacking. Things get complicated when the Swintons' little boy comes out of his coma and sibling rivalry develops. Monica can't bring herself to take David back to the laboratory, so she sets him free. David begins his journey for the Blue Fairy, from ""Pinocchio"". He is convinced that she will make him a real boy. Along the way, he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), another Mecca.""AI: Artificial Intelligence"" is a film that began with the late filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Somewhere along the line, he asked Steven Spielberg to become involved. Upon Kubrick's death, Spielberg resurrected the idea as a homage to his friend. Spielberg wrote the screenplay and directed the film.""AI"" is simply one of the most outstanding visual feasts ever committed to film. Spielberg has created a concert of images and special effects which, for the most part, bring this future society alive. Future homes are just slightly modern. But future cityscapes on the other hand... Wow. Scenes are set in New York City, after the floods, and I quite honestly felt that Spielberg had filmed in a flooded New York City. The obvious use of CGI has become so advanced that it looks that realistic. The scenes in Rouge City are also very effective: a riot of color, sound and neon. Rouge City, a descendant of Las Vegas gone bad, is flashy and bright, filled with whirling holograms and characters. But it is believable. There is also an extended scene underwater which looks real. Everything looks real. Including the mecca that has her face pulled off. She looks like a human until her face splits in half and reveals a circuit board underneath. Gone are the shaky computer animated aspects of such a creation. Also, the climax, while fairly unbelievable, is also very convincing. Everything is done so well, that we could imagine that this happened, if the story were as effective. Visually, the film is stunning and a true example of a master at work.Hayley Joel Osment further cements his reputation as a great actor. He takes a very difficult role and makes it believable. He brings a lot of subtle nuance to the role of a mecca that wants to be human. Every moment, we get a sense that his character is working things out, trying to figure out how he can become the Swintons' new little boy. Osment doesn't rely on the theatrical gestures that many actors would employ to create the character of a robot. No jerky movements or stilted speech.Jude Law is the other stand out in ""AI"". Perfectly cast, Law plays a gigolo mecca, created simply to pleasure others. This is his role in life and colors everything he does and says. He has the looks, the swagger, the bravado to pull the character off.It is fairly important for people to pay attention to the fact that this film was inspired by Kubrick. At times, the ad campaign paints the film as a cross of ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters"". It does have elements of each, but despite the presence of a talking teddy bear throughout most of the film, there are some disturbing un-child friendly scenes.""AI"" fails as an exercise in storytelling. Spielberg pens a screenplay that moves coldly from one scene to the next. Probably conceived as a warning of sorts, the film loses impact because there are no characters in the film that are affected by the warning message. Without giving anything away, I understood that the film wants to warn humans against too much technological advancement. However, there are no humans in the story throughout. The journey is made by the product of our technology. The journey is entirely through his eyes. David also has a different journey, as he searches for the Blue Fairy. This journey takes him through the various stages of our obsession with technology, but doesn't seem to affect him in any way.The film is about thirty minutes too long. Essentially, there is a lengthy epilogue which stretches the imagination far too much. While it is created in a very real way, we have to wonder again why we are taking the journey. Young David doesn't experience what a human would experience. How are we supposed to relate to this message? In the end, I don't think that we do and the message loses power."	2.0	Master Filmmaker, Apprentice Storyteller	2005-04-12	3	2	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3DGSVDHINA8O4	"Tiffany A. Christian ""haemony"""	I think it's quite okay to tell a popular story in a new way. Responding to an earlier review, there's nothing wrong with Spielberg and Kubrick (giving him posthumous credit) for re-creating Pinocchio. By twisting the original around and relating it to our own time, it gives us things to think about that we might not have before considered.Personally, I believe this movie had a lot going for it. You have the outstanding performances of both Osment and Law (and if they don't give that kid an Oscar soon, I'm going to verbally throttle the whole Academy).  You have this odd mesh of the harsh future of Kubrick with the epic drama of Spielberg which, while not always working in sync, yet manages to spin the mind. True, the movie does take up more time than it should and drags a bit for those wanting more adventure and less thought, but for those willing to speculate on the ideas the movie brings up, its length is just fine. I saw this flick twice in the theater, and didn't regret it either time.On a personal note, I have to mention the fantastic job by John Williams. If anybody ever made a Spielberg film work, it's him.Anyway, I do recommend this film. If you can sift through its shortcomings to reach the real meat in the ideas it represents, then it makes for great inspiration.	4.0	More good than bad...	2001-10-09	0	0	0

It's about adoption, asking the question can a parent really love a child they've adopted as if it is their own? There is of course the obvious references to pinnochio. In the Pinnochio story they're about to burn him because he's made of wood. In AI they are about to destroy him at the Flesh Fair. There's the competition of siblings. Child abandonment, a child thinking his mom doesn't love him enough, trying to do nearly anything to gain her love. Humanity's inhumanity for things that are new or different or designed to help us at the Flesh Fair. Humanity's way of looking at children as being greater then adults. Once again this is conveyed at the Flesh Fair when David escapes. David refers to Monica as Mommy and to Henry, who should be his father, just as Henry. Showing children tend to be closer to their mother then their father. It's not only about robots, it's about humans, always looking for our creator, always looking for answers. Joe tells David ""Orga believe what c annot be seen or measured. That's what seperates them from us, Meccha."" David, like Orga (organic beings) Is believing what he cannot see or measure, giving him that human flaw later talked about in the film. The human flaw of wishing for things that don't exist. Joe says ""We are suffering for their mistakes."" Humanity once again is suffering from the mistakes of our creator. As humans we think we're something special. And one day we're going to realize we're not, there are billions of other humans in the world just like us, no matter what their race sex etc they are still humans, and we are not unique. This is conveyed when we see David in the room with the hundreds of dolls that look just like them. And all this time he thought he was special. When Joe sees David jump from the building, the reflection on the glass looks like a tear rolling down his cheek. At end when David goes to sleep by his mother after she says she loves him, it seems as if he's finally become human. His mother was the blue fairy.And for all those who didn't like the ending, without the ending it wouldn't have had the same effect it was wanting to have.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1FA0GBB3S1MWU	Timothy R Whitelaw	AI is the kind of movie that leaves you desparately wanting it to be better. Perhaps if you think about it hard enough, it ispossible to convince yourself that its as good as you wanted it to be. I suspect this is what American critics were doing when hailing the film as a masterpiece, a fantastic Spielbergian fusion - the imagination and magic of ET with maturity of Schindler, with a touch of Kubrickian objectivity thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, if one is looking for AIs precedents in the Spielberg canon one need look no further back than Hook, or going right back, his 1978 flop1941.  These are very different movies from AI it is true, but they are also examples of an unrestrained and out of control Spielberg, whose presence is felt very early on in AI, and who proceeds to gradually to rip the premise beyonds the bounds of credulity.  It would be wrong to label this Speilberg's worst film, but it certainly his most desperately uneven.The plot, ostenibly a curious whismy to have come from Kubrick (although mans co-existence with technology is a strand running throughout his output), is set in a not too distant future, in a world where humanoid robots are commonplace. Here, a robot scientist sets out to make a  hummanoid boy who is capable of both giving and recieving love.  Here, the boy, David (Haley Joel Osment) is adopted by a couple whose own son is in a coma, essentially to fulfil their emotional needs.  Its a fascinating concept, but right from the start, the emotional dynamics of it are ambiguous.  Are we suppossed to feel happy when Monica, the mother figure, begins to &quot;love&quot; David because the implication is that parental &quot;love&quot; is little more than a superficial need which can be filled by any bowl-haired cutie with cow-like eyes and a need for cuddles.In a strange way, there is misogynistic vain running throughout AI.  Ostenibly, the most important aspect in the films is its examination of the mother/child bond.  But what does AI say about that bond?  Monica falls in love with David, not a selfless, maternal love but a love based on how David is programmed to make her feel about herself - needed and loved. Then when her own son returns,  she dumps David in  the woodlands, having outlasted his usefulness. This is a cynical and deeply unfeeling portrait of the maternal bond and one senses it has far more Kubrick than Speiberg in it.However emotionally barbed they maybe, these are actually the best scenes in the film. They are Kubrickian in vein - shot in cool, stone-washed colours and alarming us with the emotionalseductiveness of David, a creation Speilberg never lets us forget is artificial, and therefore perhaps making us question our own precept of what love is.  It is unsettling and provocative, not at all pleasant,  but it has its own voice and logic.  The next two acts of the film, which concern Davids misguided quest to find his mother after she dumps him in the woods, dispense completely with both of these.The main problem with the remainder of the film is that there is virtually no interaction between humans and robots.  Therefore the principle strand of tension and interest in abandoned,  and Spielberg chooses to underline the artificiality of the premise by having virtually all the interaction take place between David and Gigolo Joe(Jude Law), a sort of robotic prostitute.  Because it is a relationship between robot and robot, there is no gravity here, and the film becomes increasingly emotionally and stylistically unhinged, with every weird odessey seeming stranger and more out of place than the next.  It feels, and there is no better word, artificial. The ending, a cloying and manipulative retreat in to Spielbergian sentimentalism, underlines the innocence of the child's love, but also the naivety of the director himself.  Spielberg has always dealt in moral and emotional certainies - and even in his most mature works, those polarities are crystal clear.  AI is ambiguous, even paradoxical in terms of its moral and emotional tenure and rather than acknowldege this with a thoughtful, somewhat inconclusive ending, Spielberg simply reverses the tone of the entire film for its third act which is almost jaw-droppingly miscalculated.Kubick passed Spielberg the mantle on AI becuase he thought it to be closer to the young director's sensibilities.  The problem with AI as it turned out is that there is no prevailing sensibility, just an ultimately incoherent hash -a director trying to tell a story whose ambiguities he does not acknowledge and whose need for restraint he does not recognise.  Whatever else AI maybe, on its own terms it is ulimately a faliure.	3.0	Beyond his reach.......	2001-10-09	2	1	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1R48YO4NJHPNP	T. L. Fentress	I think this movie is a fascinating piece of work. It took alot of imagination to create it and make it intriguing. I was totally captivated by it. It held my attention all the way through and the interesting thing is that each hour of the film was so different than the last. The first hour is very light and lets you know about the world as it is and how David (the boy mecha) came about. The second hour is somewhat dark,but, comical as it lets you begin a journey with David to find the Blue Fairy (whom he hopes will change him into a real boy) and introduces you to the hilarious and inticing &quot;Gigolo Joe&quot; who befriends David and is wonderfully played by Jude Law. The last 40 minutes becomes rather sad but very thought prevoking and almost disturbing. You will see when you watch it. David is played superbly by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, never seems to make a bad movie or any role uninteresting. I wish he had been in the film more and they had explored his character further. He added a light comical touch to the film and his role was very neccessary. This film moved me and was very unique in that it was like no other film I ever saw. I enjoyed it and will probably go see it again.	4.0	A.I. -Captivating	2001-07-05	1	0	1
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A18JCGDVPOJAW0	Todd C. Martin	It's interesting how artistic vision is often met with ambivalence, controversy, and confusion when first presented to the public.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; flopped when it was actually playing in the theaters, Led Zeppelin was initially reviled by the critics, and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; received as many bad reviews as good.  Now all are universally considered the pinnacles of their genres, and to criticize them only makes the critic appear ignorant.I suspect &quot;A.I.-Artificial Intelligence&quot; may be the current example of this tendency.  Some people call it brilliant, whereas others scoff at it.  While I admit I'm biased (I loved nearly every minute of A.I.), I suspect that much of the negative reaction against A.I. is simply a defense mechanism to mask an uneasy feeling often generated by things which don't quite fit the expected pattern or the current spirit of the times.It was interesting reading the review which analyzed the &quot;three acts&quot; of A.I.  The reviewer mentions characters which don't seem to fit (Jude Law), voices of toys which are too grandfatherly (Teddy), changes in mood (third act) and music (second act).  With all due respect to the author (who obviously put a lot of time and thought into his excellent and well-written review), it seems to me that the author's real problem with A.I. is that he doesn't like discordant elements.  After reading it, I found myself wanting to respond &quot;But I think the odd characters (Jude Law), unexpected voice tones (Teddy), changes in mood (third act), etc. make the movie more interesting and rich.&quot;In any case, the fact that over 2000 people have written reviews suggests that &quot;A.I.&quot; is generating strong feelings in its audience.  Some of us were deeply moved by David's quest, whereas others were distracted and annoyed.  Many viewers were somewhere in the middle...loving parts of the film and disliking others.  As for me, I was deeply moved and stimulated.  I thought alot about some big, important, and disturbing questions after seeing A.I., and for that reason alone I'd recommend it to anybody.  However, I don't know if it's a great film.  I believe &quot;A.I.&quot; may be the type of art that will require the passage of time in order to be properly evaluated.  I wouldn't be surprised if in 20 years, it is considered a classic.	5.0	What Will We Think In Twenty Years??	2002-12-17	11	10	1

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	"Artificial Intelligence is a film that was originally given some work by Stanley Kubrick. The idea is from a short story by a veteran science fiction writer Brian Aldiss. Kubrick never got very far with the idea but for some reason Stevan Spielberg ended up making it. He acknowledges Kubrick's contribution in the opening credits.A lot of the critical discussion about the film has centred on canning Spielberg as a director and suggesting that if Kubrick had done it, it would be miles better. It is hard to see why. Kubrick as a film director has a considerable reputation but his work is generally stodgy with jokes that are laboured and un funny and any ideas that he expresses are telescoped and lack subtlety. Kubrick made a number of films that dealt with issues but they are generally unsubtle and more in the realm of propoganda. My final and unrefutable argument is ""Eyes wide shut"". Spielberg on the other hand delights in film making and every one of his films are constructed with a rare technical excellence.Artificial Intelligence is a long film in which there are no jokes, the dialogue is sparse and never really interesting and the main characters face up to a succession of horrible events. Despite this the film is compelling and captures the viewer.Most of the elements of the plot have been revealed in the release publicity and in a review in the New York Review of Books. A robot child is created with the power to love. It is used as a substitute for parents whose real child has become ill. When their child recovers, the robot child is rejected to wander about  in a cruel world. As he has been made to love his ""mother"" each moment of separation is a moment of agony for him.The robot child hears of the Pinocchio legend and he desperately tries to seek out the Blue Fairly to be made human and to be accepted again by his ""mother"".The film is almost unrelentingly sad. It is unusual for an American film and it may well have contributed to its failure at the Box Office.Despite what some critics have said the film shows clearly the genius of Spielberg as a director. Despite sparse dialogue and limited exposition a future world is created which seems to make sense. One is drawn into the story despite not really liking anyone at all in the film."	4.0	Technical masterwork	2002-05-21	5	2	3

However, wonderful acting and super technology cannot overcome a cumbersome and disturbing plot.  The main character, David, was wonderful.  I cringed with sadness for him countless times.  Gigilo Joe and Teddy Bear were entertaining side kicks.So much of this movie was wrought with hopelessness and sadness, that two and a half hours proved far too long.  Additionally, the troubling ending in Manhattan did not mesh well at all with the epilogue in the far future.  The latter could have been a short on the sci fi channel.The bottom line is that I loved the characters, but just did not like the story.  I cannot deny the talent and art that when into this work, thus the three stars.

If this were a real fairy tale, it would have been a ""Grimm"" fairy tale, because that is exactly what the move is - GRIMDuring the first part of the movie, you actually feel sorry for the robot child, David (Haley), and want to ""beat the living hell"" out of his biological brother (Martin).All the compassion ends when his mom abandons David in the forrest presumably protecting him from disassembly.This is where the movie actually falls apart. David departs on a Pinocchioesque crusade to find the Blue Fairy who will magically turn him into a real boy (or so he thinks). Through a magical mystery tour of so-so special effect robots living and dying in a forrest, at a Brothel city (Rouge City), and at a flesh fair (where most of the robots are uncerimonioulsy dismembered), David and his sidekick (Gigolo Joe, a male pleasure robot, who for the life of me can't remember in the fairy tale) hunt down the messiah, Blue Fairy.Ending up at the undersea world of Manhattan (Yes, folks, we also have a global catastrophe here), David spends the next 2000 years pleading with a blue fairy statue at a submerged carnival to make him into a real boy... Many have reported the movie as very thought provoking, but all I can think of to ask is:""How would Pinocchio look after spending 2000 years at the bottom of the ocean?""The only thing I found enjoyable in the entire film was the little teddy-bear robot, aptly named ""Teddy"".If I had rented it before buying, I would now not own it and would not rent it again."	1.0	HOW TO RUIN A GREAT FAIRY TALE	2002-05-10	16	6	10

It is certainly a movie that is multilayered and can be seen on many levels.To me, A.I. holds a special place in my heart. It is a masterpiece and ranks alongside those movies that are to be experienced rather than watched and lingers for a long time (it still does after many years). It is a hauntingly beautiful one that has the power to touch the emotional resonance of what makes you truly human. Like Shawshank Redemption (one of my other favourite films) that evokes the power of friendship, hope and redemption; A.I. evokes the power of dreams, love and reunion. Both films utilize the universal theme of the possibilities of completion through the journey of life.And, I am sure, like other viewers have suggested, that this film will be revisited again sometime in the future and seen in a different light.The acting is excellent, especially by Haley Joel Osment as David and also Jude Law as Gigolo Joe.Also worth praising in this film is the musical score by John Williams. For me, it confirms him as the greatest movie score composer in history. The main theme with soprano is hauntingly ethereal, and both sorrowful and soothing at the same time. The piano score is like a lullaby that evokes memories of childhood innocence and purity.**warning: spoilers here if you have not watched the movie!!**The movie is about an android boy who has been programmed (in his little silicon soul?) with the goal to love his human parents (in this particular case, his mother) and, simply, to be loved in return. That's all. But, the unexpected happens when their once incurable human son is cured and returns to them so that effectively causes his mother, Monica, to abandon the android robot. So, this is where the real journey begins: on the level of abandonment, loneliness and absence of love.The android boy, David, begins his quest to return to motherly love again but has to travel through a dangerous world in search for the clues to fulfill his grandest wish.Many viewers suggested that this film was too long and that the final 3rd of the movie should have been cut, so that David never realises his dream of being loved by his mother. But, in my opinion, that is missing the whole point of this movie. David was programmed with the goal to love and be loved by his mother. His `program' was the reason for his existence. In human terms, it was this heartfelt dream to love that gave him meaning for living, and by only following his dream would it ultimately bring him home to happiness and peace. It was David's unwavering will and faith that eventually fulfilled his dream (complete his program), of course, with the helping of some advanced mechas.The 3rd act, to me, completes the cycle of life; not just an A-to-B ending that ends bleakly and without meaning. If you are a cynic, materialist, believe that stories with metaphor has no real meaning, that love has no power and striving for dreams has no value, then pre-3rd act is best where you leave this movie.For me, the 3rd act moves beyond the the limitations of the physical level and onto the philosophical, metaphorical and spiritual level. David is gifted with a temporary resurrection of Monica so that he can complete his goal. How ironic! First, humans play God to create machines. A machine gradually becomes more human. Humans regress and become more like machines/or animals. Then finally, advanced machines play God to recreate humans!David not only finally fulfills his mission of loving and in being loved by his mother, he also, through the journey of life begins from android/machine and evolves into what it means to be human: through abandonment, loss of love, hope for reunion, an unwavering will to strive for one's dreams and to have faith no matter what impossible `physical limitations' are against you. A love lost but regained can be one of the most blissful experiences to humans and this is what David eventually experiences. It is his emotional experiences and relationships with humans that transforms him. The very act of loving and in being loved in return makes him human. He realizes a truth told by her at the end: that he was `always loved'. Time and space (even 2000 years) had no power over his dream to love and be loved. Although initially seemingly futile, in reality it was only a temporary barrier as proved by the completion of his goal, and he is finally able to do what a machine cannot: to dream.The transformation from machine to human and finally transcending that condition to finally reach ultimate truth is, to me, what this film is about. Again, how ironic it is that it takes a `machine' to teach us what it means to be `human'. At the end, David returns home to `Where dreams are born'...the realm of the eternal, spirit and soul?It is a bitter-sweet ending. Bitter on the physical; sweet on the metaphysical.By the way, did you know that `AI' in Japanese actually means `love'?	5.0	A misunderstood MASTERPIECE	2007-01-07	11	9	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2T28ETOO7OBE	Travis Cottreau	"Steven Spielberg is a genius. The directing is some of his best work...Acting was absolutely top notch, especially Jude Law as Gigolo Joe. He was just mechnical enough to convince you he was a robot, but just human enough to be someone's work of art. Without Law, the movie would have been 1/2 of what it was. I'm quickly becoming a big fan of Jude Law, who is getting better role by role.The same goes for Haley Joel Osment - top notch acting. It's hard to believe he's just a kid, he's great at adding layers to his characters, and subtle facial expressions which were an absolute must for his character David. I can't imagine any other child actor pulling off that role, certainly not with as much power as Osment did.Kudos to the makeup people too - a little bit of shinyness to the skin, a little highlight here and there, just a subtle way of letting you know that the robots aren't human, but you can never quite put your finger on why. The lighting is the same way, making the robots look like robots, but the humans in the same scene continue to look human - I don't know how they pulled it off.Then there's the story - it is by far the weakest part of the film and actually quite dissapointing. I'm sitting here in the wake of what was a visual coup, a masterpiece of directing and acting saying ""that should have been much better.""Usually a movie as sophisticated as this has some subtlety, but at no time was the movie subtle. The ideas of prejudice against the robots beats you over the head again and again. Not only has it been done before, but it's been done better, although never as masterfully.I'm dissapointed, but at the same time, I have to say it was so worth my time to see. It's a movie that you can see and talk about later, and analyse for a long time. It wasn't a simple or shallow movie. Go see the movie to see for yourself, don't judge based on what I say or what any critic says, this movie is worth your time."	4.0	Good and bad	2001-07-03	0	0	0

Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment do some wonderful acting, yet the script and the plot are so bad that their efforts cannot save it.It seems that Spielberg no longer has an original vision for his films, since he rips off his own and Kubrick's prior works with poor results.This highly derivative work also pulls from: Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (flesh fair); Star Wars Series (teddy the [wannebe] ewok); The Wizard of Oz (Jude law as the tin man, and the wizard is obvious); Bamboozled; Close Encounters; Michael Jackson's Thriller video; and MS Office Assistant ""The Genius""The ending insults the audience's intelligence.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3HHKJEZNI2C7O	"""treker-d"""	"One comes away from this film with the impression that it is trying to say too much, too obviously but not very effectively.  By trying to mix Kubrick's more brooding style with Spielberg's E.T. sweetness, we end up with a film trying to balance an incongruous world that is dark and foreboding a la ""Bladerunner"" where unlicensed AIs can be hunted and killed for amusement yet inhabited by a supporting cast of overbearingly kind to the point of condescension characters.Ultimately this is a story that tries to tell us what it is to be human by having the viewer follow the journey of an artificial boy trying to become one and empathize with him along the way.  This theme has been done multiple times (from Bicentennial Man to perhaps 30 episodes devoted to Data on the Star Trek Series.)  In that respect, AI provides us with very unconvincing signposts and great difficulty in empathizing.  One theme of humanity is of course the ability to feel love, yet not once in this movie do we see indications that the boy David can develop love or even affection on his own for anyone or anything beyond his initial programming to specifically love one person (certainly none for Joe, his robot guide and mentor, or his human family Dad, for example).  His increased obsession with that one target makes him appear, if anything, more robotic, like a computer suffering a self-reinforcing feedback loop in programming. That the much, much lower-tech toy bear, seems to be able to develop new attachment and the converse emotion - dislike - for someone on its own, and that Joe's emotion can evolve while David's does not as he almost ruthlessly pursues one goal, leaves one with a rather odd feeling and not much empathy for the lead character.Fear of extinction is also a sign of life, which is true, as all living things from amoebas, let alone humans, have a desire for self-preservation.  In case we miss this, the movie gives us a melodramatic scene where a member of the cast actually gets up and says so - loudly.  Yet prior to this, we have already witnessed that all robots have a desire for self-preservation, Joe by fleeing a crime-scene, and even the Model-T Ford of robots scrounge for scrap parts and try to evade capture to prolong their right to exist even for one more minute if they could.  So we are left wondering what is so special and cutting-edge about David verbalizing his desire to live.  This is made worse when the script calls for Joe to show signs of gratitude and relief at the reprieve while the supposedly `nearer to human' David, despite the rhetoric, does not.Goal seek then is to be interpreted by us, as later pointed out by William Hurt in the movie, as a sign of `humanity'.  Yet goal seek programming that can adjust and modify itself to outside factors are within the capability of the science of today and nothing at all to get excited about in a life/non-life context.  That another robot actually shows a willingness to possibly give up his own goal of freedom and self-existence for another's goal while David singularly is unable to do so, makes us feel that the other robot is more `human' and David is upstaged again.Even at the very flawed-ending, where through deed, speech, tone of voice and accompanying music we are bludgeoned over the head without any subtlety whatsoever in an attempt to force us to see how `feeling' AIs can eventually be, David shows no gratitude, co-operation, reciprocation or compromise he just wants what he wants - a very robotic response.  This is not a reflection of Osment's performance, it is the script.  If the movie's intent was to deliver the message that selfishness is the primary initial characteristic of humanity and is trying to convey this moral judgment, then it succeeded.  If that was not what we are supposed to interpret, then it failed.Had the movie ended 20 minutes earlier shall we say (without giving away the plot), upon arrival at a certain underwater location, this might have been a 3 star movie that left us mildly unsettled with food for thought afterwards.  As it is, fine cinematography, visual effects and another sterling performance by Jude Laws earns it 2 stars"	2.0	Kubrick and Spielberg do not mix	2003-10-05	5	4	1

Instead, he turned this into another of his overlong, self-indulgent, emotionally manipulative productions (remember The Color Purple, or even the last 30 mns of Jurassic Park II?). Having said that, there are enough flashes of visual brilliance to make the movie a must-see.

As an added bonus the special effects are simply astounding. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law are terrific as the two mecha's. The mood and feel of the picture are also very well excuted.  I'm sure not everyone will like the end of the movie, you can even argue that it should of ended earlier, but I can forgive good ol' Steve because look at it from his perspective, we live in a society with no attention span. If he didn't literally spell out every last detail at the end of the movie I doubt half the people that see it will ever understand what they're watching. They tell their friends it sucked and will all go see Scary Movie 2 instead. Besides, if you swallow your inner critic, or cynic for most of you, the movie might even get it's message across!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1DELP2SEKHV87	T. Sims	"...to create a beautiful, horrific vision of the future in 'A.I. Artifical Intelligence.' From the impeccable, letter-perfect opening and closing narrations by Ben Kingsley to the plasticine sexiness of Jude Law's ""lover"" robot, Joe, and even William Hurt's compassion as a mad scientist/father figure, 'A.I.' stays in mind as a study in the combination of two the most brilliantly diverse directors to ever work in (or outside) the Hollywood system. The simple plot: Haley-Joel Osment stars as David, the first A.I. ""boy"" programmed to--get this--actually love, and the typically cliche quest: Once rejected, David goes on a journey to become a ""real"" boy--are, in actuality, deceivingly complicated. While the basics are set up like bowling pins(the assumption being that Spielberg will just knock 'em down), the execution is more like a couple of 7/10 splits and a spare. Spielberg manages to throw suprising curveballs around each corner; unexpectedly humourous moments tossed with a bizarre futurevison that even David Cronenberg would smile at. The studied, impressive performances from Osment, Law and Frances O'Connor as David's human mother, play great with the cool, atmospheric grays and tacky neon of a future America that is undoubtedly Kubrick yet accessibly Spielberg. While it's not surprising to discover that 'A.I.' is, at times, a modernistic 'E.T,' there are enough shades of '2001' and even 'Eyes Wide Shut' to create a stunning, highly absorbing, modern classic."	5.0	Spielberg contacts Kubrick from beyond...	2002-03-13	9	7	2

It rates a first and only zero from myself and many of the others who saw it with me. I can sit through almost any Sc-Fi type story but this one taxed my endurance to the limits!Real sleeper. Literally this could put almost anyone to sleep. If Spielberg was shooting for a cure to insomnia he's dead on, otherwise a complete failure.  Check out ... reviews, max of 2 1/2 stars, and that with an ... that has literally posted 100's of replicant 5 star entries (...), other wise it would have a 1-2 star rating, dont buy into the hype, this is terrible, critics who liked this must have been stoned or paid off.The after movie dinner table talk consisted entirely of how bad the movie was and what a suitable punishment for Spielberg would be for creating this ... and actually accepting money for it. No wonder he didn't hang around and sit through the hollywood preview, shame on Holywood, shame on Spielberg.The characters were so wooden and unrealistic, and Im not talking about just the supposed mecha's. The Characters were so 2 dimensional that if they turned sideways they would have vanished. The only likeable character was 'Teddy' and he was a stuffed doll!The story, if you could call it that was so slow, disjointed and so pointless that you kept hoping something would happen to tie it all together, not believing it could get any worse, but it did, plodding scene after scene after scene... The greenpeace'ish liberal stuff was so overdone that it detracted from the whole movie, nothing subtle deep or hidden in this piece.Cinematography was just weird. Shades of 2001 and Waterworld, odd angles, dark shots mixed at the end with glowing over the top luminence (ala 2001) some will say the shooting was interesting, but it had no real effect other than being disjointed like the rest of the story.Special effects were ok but nothing very interesting until the end.

It is a hodge-podge of plagiarism drawing from numerous sci-fi and fairy tales. To name a few: Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Robot Dreams, What makes this terribly bad is that these sources don't even seem to be disguised at all. It is like there is a blatant reference to all the original stories.The characters are extremely un-captivating, which leaves you with sense of not identifying with nor caring about their plight. But wait, it gets worse the lighting throughout the film is terrible. What should be lit isn&#65533;t and what should be dark is lit. It seems like the back ground was more important that the actors.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1DE58PW3Q6BWZ	Ve Yin Mark Tee	"Haley Joel Osment stars as the robotic replacement for the terminally ill and comatose son of a privileged American family in a not-so-distant future.  The artificial boy is infinitely cuter yet so docile and obedient that he allows his ""owner"" to dress and undress him.  Always loving he seems in every way the perfect child until the recovery of the son not only makes him redundant, but sparks off a rivalry which plays on the fears and anxieties of the ""real"" boy's parents.  The robot child is abandoned and from here on the tight, sensitive claustrophobia of the film gives way to the epic scope and sentimentality of an ""E.T."" or a ""Jurassic Park"" -- Kubrick in other words metamorphosises into Spielberg.  From a beginning which suggests a cutting edge exploration into technology and exploitation, into the corruptibility of love itself (unlike the robot boy's love, ""human"" love is too evidently perishable, too evidently morally suspect and morally suspicious), the film becomes another high-action spectacle drumming up the already much-trodden and oh-so-familiar spectacle of a ""beautiful"" protagonist triumphal not only over his ""ugly"" society, but over the logic of Space and Time itself:  robot boy gets reunited with human mum a thousand years into the future by aliens.  On the way of course, we get all the obvious moralising of a Spielberg direction complete with a ""Flesh Fair"" where these unwanted robots are systematically rounded up to be exterminated.  From the disturbing vision of the death of individuality, where perfect little boys and little girls may be mass produced, we get essentially a story from the eyes of a Pinnochio searching for a means to become a real boy.  The ending -- which I will not describe -- is so ludicruously illogical, so inflated with a hogwash of sentimentality that I felt terribly cheated. An apparently ""Full Metal Jacket"" has been turned into something which would do Walt Disney proud."	2.0	A potentially serious film trivalised	2002-02-07	15	7	8

I went to see A.I. with fairly high expectations, and the movie completely demolished them.  I was blown away by A.I.; never had I seen a movie that touched me so deeply.  A.I. penetrated me to the soul, and when I walked out of that theatre I was a different man.  The story is incredible, but the best thing about the movie is that child prodigy, the amazing Haley Joel Osment.  I can't believe how good that little boy is.  He definetly deserves an oscar for his performance.  A.I. really struck a chord with me; some people didn't like the &quot;ending act&quot; (i.e., the last 20 minutes), but I loved it.  I couldn't stop crying through the last 10 minutes of the movie; the ending is quite brilliant (although bittersweet and utterly heartwrenching), and I almost never cry at movies.  A.I. is now my second favorite film of all time, and I'm certain it is one of the greatest films ever made. It's probably the most tragic and heartwrenching film of all time as well.  I've seen it 3 times already!  However, after seeing other peoples' reviews, I understand this film to be very controversial; you either love it or hate it.

I walked into the theatre convinced that there had to be at least something original and intelligent about a film with a plot so carefully kept a secret and advertised in a manner that suggested novelty. Alas, I was wrong. It's true that first the first third of the movie things aren't so bad, due undoubtedly to Kubrick's contribution to the screenplay. From then on, however, the film turns into a ridiculously naive mixed-bag of trite sci-fi and cheap philosophy.Perhaps the most annoying part was seeing such a promising and original screenplay as Kubrick's original work most likely was, turned into the flat unidimensionality of Spielberg's perception of the world. Inevitably, the characters reflect this unfortunate transformation: the acting is inconsistent because the script is, and all this is such a pity as Haley Joel Osment's talent goes to waste.For Disney fans and 10-year olds, Spielberg's latest work is almost a masterpiece. For middlebrow adults who might expect more from modern-day Hollywood cinematography, this is surely a failure.	1.0	Unsubtle reuse of old ideas	2001-07-01	3	1	2

It is not merely the retelling of Pinocchio, although comparisons to Pinocchio are inevitable.  Neither is it merely the postmodern fantasy of a director of the surreal.Artificial Intelligence is a Siddartha-esque journey film, a story of a quest for identity and the meaning of life, and to a lesser degree, the documentary of some of the more important symbols of our cultural understanding of those questions.  The film's design and cinematographics draw from the dark and beautiful tradition of Blade Runner, while the semiotics put comparisons to The Fisher King in mind.Was it good?

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1NSHD4YCL5DV3	"Vish Iyer ""wish_1979"""	"The movie confuses not only itself, but also the viewer in terms of what it is trying to achieve, where it actually wants to go, and how to go about it. Initially, it starts off as a typical sci-fi movie, which exemplifies what would be one of the zeniths of the future-man's creation: the creation of custom-made robots, which not only look and feel like humans, but are also designed to exhibit a certain types of behaviors, and feel certain kinds of emotions. Then, the movie tries to answer the question, ""can humans offer the same kind of unconditional love, as offered by the custom-made `mecha'?"" by taking the example of David, and how he tries to get himself accepted by a `human'-family. The movie goes on fine through the course, which shows the various problems faced by the `mecha', and the `human' family, in trying to accept each other.After the point at which David is deserted by his family, the movie, then goes through a labyrinth, trying to give a totally different meaning to it, and deviating from what it had actually started off with, until the end, which again tries to continue from where it had left off, about an hour ago. Though the movie ends well, (conceptually, though again, the execution is flawed by the introduction of aliens, (or futuristic robots of the ice-age, whichever it might be) who exhume David, and try to fulfill his wish) by the time the movie arrives at this point, it has passed through so many confusing and supererogatory paths in-between, that the charm of this otherwise `touching' ending, and the movie, as a whole is completely lost.The beginning and the ending of the movie are coherent with the punch line, ""can humans respond equally to the unconditional love, the `mecha' bestows upon them?"" However, in the middle, it tries to depict that the human is, and always will be evil, by showing that the future-man will not only create the `perfect' robot, (or make his `best creation ever') he will also mercilessly destroy his own creation, regardless of their feelings, and the viewers are supposed to feel sorry about this. In the midst of all this, the story takes the shape of a fairy-tale, in which the protagonist, (in this case David) is in a search for the `blue-fairy', who he believes, will make him a `real' boy, so that his `mommy' will love him. These links, which try to build up the ending, are not only muddled and fatuous, but also are seriously ill directed, especially the parts concerning the merciless destruction of `mechas', at the `flesh-fair'.Spielberg is one of the best movie-directors of all time; not half as good as Kubrik, though (since this movie is supposed to be conceptually similar to ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"") and the best, when it comes to creating fantasy-flicks. In this fantasy-movie, however, he has tried to introduce too many ideas, which not only make the movie too long and over-sentimental, but also out-of-focus, from what it actually wants to achieve."	3.0	MOMMY.....I AM CONFUSED	2003-07-02	1	1	0

Read on.); 2) David's Super Toy robotic companion named Teddy's voice sounds eerily similar to HAL, the &quot;malfunctioning&quot; supercomputer from 2001; 3) in Rouge City keep an eye out for a bar named Strangelove's and note the Clockwork Orange-esque attention to human anatomy in the architecture and artwork; 4) Gigolo Joe's little moonlight dance evokes images of not only the Tin Woodman, but also of Alex from A Clockwork Orange (I'm Singin' in the Rain...WHACK!) amd 5) Monica and David's drive through the forest echoes a similar drive taken by Alex and his droogs.  I could go on further, but I'll let you see for yourself.  A.I. is full of Kubrickian reference points.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3W241G0ZNR9EM	Warren S Fentress	Although excellent performances from the cast, I had several problems with the script and the premise.  Firstly, the notion that David would have to be destroyed after imprinting is completely pointless and inaccurate in the reality of re-programmable computers.  That was glaring nonsense one.  The second problem was the lengthy quest for the Blue Fairy, even after David is told that it doesn't exist.  An obsessive-compulsive robot?  This is the point where the script really falters, because there are so many places it could have gone that would have been interesting, such as making a robotic mom to love David...  What is at issue is whether a conscious computer can have a soul. The ... at the end where they make a mom from DNA that can only last a day - again, poor logic to justify pulling emotional strings. Although the future robots were excellent, the point that they were conscious and able to love was not developed enough.  In fact, why is it not ok to love unconditionally without being loved back?....	4.0	Script Problems	2001-07-09	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"If you want a short review of the film, I'd suggest going elsewhere.Originally conceived as a film for director Stanley Kubrick and based on a short story by Brian Aldiss and a screen story by Ian Watson, ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" has a fascinating premise and story. Kubrick turned the project over to Steven Spielberg when he realized it ""fit"" Spielberg's style of direction more than his own. Spielberg takes ""A.I."" and turns it into a live action modern retelling of ""Pinocchio"" along with elements of Harlan Ellison's short story ""Jeffity is Five"" about an ageless little boy who--real or not--wants nothing more than to be loved for what he is.Playing like a more serious version of ""E.T."", ""A.I."" focuses on Monica and Henry Swinton (Francis O'Connor and Sam Robards)a couple who have a son in cryostatus because of an incurable disease. David (Haley Joel Osmond)a biomechanical humanoid with emotions is given to them by Doctor Hobby (William Hurt) to be a substitute for their son. When their real son returns home after a cure is found, David finds himself pushed out by a mother that cares for him enough NOT to want to have his memory destroyed but not enough to keep him. This sets him on an odyssey to find some way to become REAL and he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a pleasure ""mecha"" searching for meaning with his own kind.""A.I."" did well enough at the box office but there's a fundenmental misunderstanding of the film because it is a collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick two directors who's styles are polar opposites. Spielberg adopts some of Kubrick's stylistic approach and melds it to his own with ""A.I."" (and he did so as well with his next project the Kubrickian ""Minority Report"" based on Philip K. Dick's short story). Those going into ""A.I."" expecting an easy to digest adult version of ""E.T."" were disappointed and those expecting a Kubrick film were as well.As good as Osmond is at portraying David the character comes across as needy early on which is difficult to make appealing. Osmond a talented actor does the best he can with the role and Spielberg might have benefited from collaborating with another writer to make the character a bit more appealing early on to audiences.At it's heart ""A.I."" remains a story of a wooden boy who wants to be ""emotionally"" real and accepted. At the conclusion of the film, David gets his chance to at least momentarily experience the life denied to him when super advanced mecha--all that's left of humanity's brilliance--gives him the gift that he desires. Is it programming that drives him? It doesn't matter according to Spielberg because in our hearts we are ALL programmed to seek out acceptance and love to find a place where we belong even if only momentarily. The film is certainly flawed--it runs 20 minutes too long and the transition from the Kubrick elements of the story to the Spielberg are hardly seamless but, somehow, the film still manages to work.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a beautifully rendered 1080p transfer that nicely captures the theatrical look of the film. Keep in mind that Spielberg intended grainy look of this film so blame the director not the transfer if you don't like it. Audio likewise sounds beautiful with considerable detail sprinkled like pixie dust for each channel to envelope you in the experience.There's nothing new here in the area of the special features--all of the previous special features have been ported over for this edition. In a way that's good and bad news--while this isn't a bare bones presentation, it would have been nice to get something on the initial critical reaction of the film and it's reaction a decade later. The special features are presented in SD. The trailers however have been transferred from HD sources. Interestingly, the film which was released just three months before 9/11 acts as a mirror in terms of the tone of the nation and a featurette discussing this might have been interesting as well.Although ""A.I."" is certainly flawed the film offers much food for thought in a modern retelling of ""Pinocchio"" by writer-director Steven Spielberg and producers Stanley Kubirck & Jan Harlan. Osmond's David comes across as an occasionally needy and whining character which does hamper the film some what. There are elements of both directors in this film and while they sometimes sit awkwardly next to each other the over all impact and emotional power of the film works well.Recommended."	4.0	"""A.I.""-Pinocchio for a modern audience"	2011-04-05	15	14	1

But this is Spielberg we are dealing with so don't be too surprised. This movie continues to move me and entertain me. I watched it for the third or fourth time today on this wonderful Blu ray and enjoyed it with my 16 year old son. He remembered aspects of it but was too young to really get it the first time he watched it. I am amazed that the film is now 14 years old. There is only one scene, a passing shot of the world trade centers, that dates the film in the least. If in 2000 I had watched a film made in 1986, I would not be able to say that. Same as if I watched a film made in 1976 in 1990. But the material and the skill with which was made, give this film a timelessness that I think it will retain well into the future. This is a masterpiece.	4.0	The Blue Fairy is ET!	2014-01-25	2	0	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AQXDADS36PCJO	"""wcopsey"""	Throughout the months of hype preceding the wide release of A.I., I found myself becoming quite interested and more than a little bit excited.  Unfortunately, the film did not live up to my inflated expectations or the marketing responsible for said inflation.  I lost count of the number of reviews I read in anticipation of this movie.  None of the critics wrote with unrestrained glee about the movie's excellence.  That, I told myself, is not a critic's job.  I continued hoping for a truly great movie.To qualify, I must say that the A.I. was a good movie, but far from the doorstep of greatness.  I believe that one of its main problems is due to its birth from two wildly different directors.  While Spielberg did a wonderful job with many aspects of the film, his inheriting it from Kubrick left me thinking of a fallen quiche.  It started out very well, it still tasted good, but lost some of its structure and direction.  Okay, so the quiche analogy doesn't work extremely well.  The point is that I left the movie thinking that issues I found important were left alone.  Deeper issues-the ones beyond and surrounding love-were only paid mild attention.Spielberg's strength in direction showed through marvelously.  A.I. was a gorgeous, excellently acted film.  Its problems came from a mixed background of great directors and a story that relied much too heavily on Pinocchio.  Mr. Spielberg tugs at the heartstrings, no doubt.  This time, though, I could tell when and how he was tugging.I have to call A.I. a very good but confused, jumbled, schizophrenic and fundamentally flawed movie.  I thoroughly believe, though, that Spielberg accomplished what he intended.  A.I. should inspire-already has, actually-some interesting debate about humanity, technology and love.  Its questions are ones whose relevance many of us may live to see grow greatly.  The film did not try to answer its questions, which I consider a good move.  At its root, A.I. is about humanity.  It's about how we treat other people and others who are not like us.  Flawed as I found it, I did enjoy A.I.A side note to movie-goers:  If you do not understand a movie, kindly shut your mouth and let those who do enjoy it.  My experience with A.I. was made slightly less enjoyable by a group of imbeciles who decided to loudly joke about the movie after it surpassed their low levels of intelligence.	4.0	Moderately Disappointing	2001-07-01	0	0	0

Such a dark film, but at times it showed humanity as we cannot imagine it being, through the eyes of someone who desperately just wants to be loved - that is all.  The acting was superb.  Obviously thought, this film is not for everyone - it's a mental journey.  It's not Clockwork, and it's not Close Encounters.

They think Spielberg ruined it with adding more cheer and love than Kubrick's darkness.  Well, the movie has both.  The darkness is fun, the love is sweet and emotional, and the score is the best I've heard in a LONG time.Haley Joel Osment gives yet another great performance, as always, and he will steal your heart!  Although I did find Jude Law's performance as Gigolo Joe, a robotic escort service, to be somewhat empty and un-needed, everyone else gave solid performances, Esp.  the woman that played David's mother, she was good at &quot;both parts&quot; of the movie.As far as awards go, I doubt this movie itself will win awards, but Haley Joel Osment should be nominated for something.  And if the score for this movie doesn't even get nominated, they need to wake up and listen!So if you're expecting both Spielberg and Kubrik magic, love, and darkness, this is the right movie for you.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A5ZNKK1C1Y0QU	William D. Martinson	I just got home from the theater and I still feel like an idiot for wasting money on this film. Sure, there were some really nifty special effects, and Osment is a great young actor and all that stuff, but this movie is S - L - O - W, and can't really seem to decide what kind of film it wants to be.  Is it a tender story about a young boy trying to fit into a foster family? A future-shock horror film about the terrors of the future? An indictment of humanity? A testament to man's genius? A warning about the greenhouse effect? It seems to stagger drunkenly from one act to the next, shifting its style and its focus, never letting us in on where it's going, who we're supposed to care about, or what it all means.  Just when you think it's about to mercifully end, it staggers off in a new direction, bringing in even more ridiculous and convenient plot turns than before.  My wife and I both found ourselves begging for it to be over (repeatedly), and found it hard to keep our frustration silent (just in case somebody near us might actually be enjoying this film).I enjoy science fiction, I love cool CGI, I loved Osment's performance in The 6th Sense, and as a father I'm a real sucker for films that have nice emotional payoffs where family matters are concerned.  This film tries to deliver but just falls flat.  (Though I will say that Jude Law was good -- one of the few characters I found interesting.)  Other reviews on this page talk about tears streaming down faces and standing ovations; there was none of that here tonight (and the theater was pretty full).If you are a Kubrick or Spielberg sycophant, if you are am incurable CGI junkie, or if you would like to pay $7 to $10 to see a few minutes of guys in glowing suits riding around on wolfish motorcycles, then I guess you should go see this movie.  But if, like me, you need to spend your movie dollars wisely this summer, then I can't help but believe that Evolution, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park III, or any of a number of other selections will be a much better expenditure of time and money.  At the very least, defer your viewing until there are enough reviews piled up here to make an informed choice.It is possible that most people will like this film and I am just one of the few who &quot;didn't get it&quot; -- but boy, do I wish I had been warned.  This is one of the biggest disapointments I've had in the theater in a long time.	1.0	Plodding, boring, and pointless	2001-06-30	14	7	7
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"Forget that the desire to be loved and to feel ""real"" is a universal emotion, but Kubrick/Spielberg give no reason why these feelings should have any special meaning when applied to a robot.Forget that ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" does a better job -- in just a few pages -- of exploring these themes.The fact is that the first two hours of this film are absolutely magical -- but the ""aliens ex machina"" ending is an arbitrary, pointless, tacked-on (non-)resolution that has no dramatic or philosophical connection with what came before.For those interested, here's the letter I sent to Steven Spielberg.I saw AI at its premiere. As an only child raised by incompetent parents - a goofy, wise-cracking, ineffective father, and a self-centered mother who actively disliked me - I found parts of AI extremely disturbing. Had I been alone in the theater, I probably would have broken down and had to have been helped out.But although AI provoked a legitimate emotional reaction, it still has problems. Attempting to get a handle on my feelings about AI, I browsed the Jerome Agel book on 2001. (I was born May 14, 1947, exactly one year after George Lucas, and saw 2001 during its first New York run.)Much was made of 2001's ""disruption"" of the conventional narrative flow of film. But 2001 is a conventional narrative film. It has a plot - an extraterrestrial intelligence is interested the development of humans and desirous of promoting their evolution. It influences proto-man's evolution sufficiently to prevent his extinction. Then, when it is able to obtain a specimen (who's proved his worthiness by ascending from hell through his own efforts), it transforms him to a higher life form. There's no need to ""force"" an ending to the story, because the end is implied by the concept.AI has no inherent plot. It is a study of basic life questions: What is love? What does it mean to love and be loved? Does human love have any real value, or is it just a self-serving reaction to the way others treat us?There's nothing wrong with a book or movie that asks questions without answering them. Up to the point where David finds the Blue Fairy, AI does an exceptionally fine job of exploring these questions.The film might very well have ended here, albeit on a dark note. Joe's remark about the Blue Fairy being the embodiment of the human failing of wanting unobtainable things was good preparation for such an ending.But AI isn't an intellectual discussion - it's a story, and we like stories to have plausible resolutions. In good drama, this resolution grows out of personality and character.Unfortunately, AI's alien ex machina resolution is arbitrary. It doesn't evolve out of what came before, but (like Teddy stitching himself) is merely a way to patch up the holes. The tedious and unconvincing explanation of the persistence of an individual life-force and its brief attachment to the regenerated body (which seems to be swiped from Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer) not only brings the film to a dead stop, but is an obviously clumsy attempt to force the story in the direction the writer wants it to go, not where it ""should"" go (wherever that might be).This might not be bad if there were some ambiguity or even unhappiness to the ending. But David appears to get what he wants (his mother saying she's always loved him), and is happy with it. Do you believe that nothing else is required to fulfill our lives than our mommy telling us she loves us?AI's resolution is neither logically, dramatically, nor emotionally satisfying. It undercuts what preceded it, and looks too much like a Spielbergian ""happy ending.""There's another philosophical point AI neglects to explore. If you've read A Clockwork Orange, you're aware of the scene Stanley Kubrick omitted, because it would have undercut his conscious perversion of the book.Alex's Nietszchian point of view is that he has the right to steal, rape, and murder, because (unlike the sheeplike mass of society) he chooses (wills) to do these things. When robbing the house of a college professor, Alex finds an essay titled ""A Clockwork Orange."" Said fruit is  something that looks ""real"" on the outside, but is internally nothing but mechanism. This cuts right to the heart of the question of whether there really is such a thing as free will, and Alex tears up the paper in a fit of rage.Ditto for David. Is he or isn't he a clockwork orange? The film's tag line - ""His love is real, but he isn't"" - is clearly self-contradictory. How can an ""unreal"" being have ""real"" emotions?Programming a robot to express ""real"" love implies that the human mind contains (or embodies  ) a mechanism for love that can be duplicated through some combination of hardware and software. So doesn't that make David's ability to express ""real"" love proof that human love is merely the mechanical operation of a neural mechanism, and that humans aren't truly ""real,"" but merely ""clockwork oranges""?The belief that the human mind is nothing more than the electro-chemical workings of the brain is a ""given"" of science fiction. These workings can be analyzed and the observed patterns transferred to a machine (or vice versa). Truly advanced aliens would have the power to transfer David's mind into a biological entity, thus making him ""real."" Moving the story in that direction might not have been any more satisfying, but it would have made more sense.AI has an obvious relation to The Velveteen Rabbit. When the horse explains to the rabbit that, once you are loved, you become real, the author isn't talking about toys - she's reflecting on the human condition. Don't we all long to have our existence and purpose justified by being told that someone truly needs us?David's problem is one that all human beings share. What is the point of showing it from a robot's point of view, and why should his experience have meaning for a human viewer?Alas, the film doesn't say.PS: My AIBO's name is Mr. Peabody.

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	"Steven Spielberg's A.I. is that cinematic rarity - a film that is really and truly about its subject matter.  The trend in science fiction lately (especially on television) has been present half-baked ""character studies"" (read: soap opera) in an environment of hardware and technobabble.  But serious science fiction - REAL science fiction - has always been more about big ideas, philosophy, and the meaning of life.  Enter A.I., a film nurtured for a decade and a half by one of the greatest minds in film-making, the late Stanley Kubrick, and now finally realized by the inestimable cinematic wizardry of Steven Spielberg.  And when I speak of his cinematic wizardry, I refer not to the special-effects of Industrial Light and Magic (which are, in fact, extraordinary), but to the skilled visual story-telling of a master craftsman.For example, there is a pivotal scene where David - an artificially intelligent robotic child - is seeking protection from a snotty kid with a knife who wants to &quot;test&quot; his Danger Avoidance System (the robotic equivalent of pain). &quot;Afraid&quot; of injury, David latches on to his human &quot;brother&quot; tightly, and accidentally pulls him into the deep end of the family swimming pool.  After a few frantic moments, the nearly drowned brother is pulled out.  The humans at the party never consider David.  As far as they are concerned, he's just a now-dangerously malfunctioning machine, no more important than a broken toaster.  He lays at the bottom of the pool, isolated in the rippling water as we look down on him from above.  Watching that scene, I realized what a perfect visual metaphor that was for a sense of utter social isolation.The story concerns the adventures of a modern Pinocchio - a young robotic boy designed from the outset to love his adoptive &quot;parents&quot; through the same kind of imprinting that animals experience.  As in most fairy-tales, the pure-hearted but misunderstood robotic hero is abandoned and left stranded in the woods to fend for himself.  What follows is a series of adventures as he tries to find the mythical blue fairy who can grant his wish to become a real boy. The robots, or ""mechas"" in this film, are disarmingly nave, and tend to take human mythology at face-value.  They actually believe in blue fairies that grant wishes.  But this isn't kid's stuff, and, in spite of Mr. Spielberg's imprimatur, it is not a simple-minded &quot;heartwarming&quot; journey in the Disney tradition.  It is a rich, haunting tapestry of tough questions and elusive answers.  What does it mean to love?  To be human?  To be intelligent?  Are we, in fact, just complex machines like our hero?  Is David's quest for acceptance, in some measure, like our own?Kubrick's themes of urban dystopia and dehumanization (exemplified in the Blade Runner-esque Rouge City sequence) penetrate through Spielberg's more humanitarian vision like a dark counter-melody in a great fugue.  That Spielberg allowed this in what has become HIS film is a great measure of the trust and respect he obviously has for the late master.The performances are all spot-on, including those of William Hurt as David's inventor, Jude Law as his protector (a lady-killer ""love-mecha"" named Gigolo Joe), and especially Frances O'Conner as his adoptive mother, whose on-screen presence and vulnerability eerily recall a young Susan Strasberg.But the ultimate kudos go to Haley Joel Osment as the robotic boy David. He has all the technique and refinement of an actor with three times his age and four times his experience.  Watch for the scene where he ""imprints"" on his mother; the subtle way he telegraphs going from an intelligent but essentially mindless automaton to a conscious, feeling entity.  We can SEE the transition, and it's amazing to behold.What ultimately results from this fusion of Stanley Kubrick's icy misanthropy and Steven Spielberg's warm humanism is not a lumpy, queasy mishmash like many (including I) had feared, but an intensely moving and authentic hero's journey.  Without diminishing the achievements of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, I believe this is Steven Spielberg's finest hour."	5.0	Brilliant!

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A25S4Q7KSTEW02	W. Rodick	Is it science fiction or a philosophical exploration? My favourite Spielberg movie is both a visual delight and an intellectual feast.It is essential to begin at the beginning. The world created by the film makers is due to the excess of consumption of the human species. The issue is often packaged to sell political support. More power for some and less for others. In A.I. the consequences of rising sea levels are clearly expressed. Cities have disappeared. But technology still prospers.Love is packaged in the shape of a boy. Unquestioning real love. But how many parents treat their boys and girls like toys? This is the heart of the movie. Uneasy viewing for the conscious parent.The boy's journey to find the way to become real takes us to another level. A robot being rational and learning about its own motivation. Learning how to fight. To hold hands. Gaining intuition. And all the time I realised that he was becoming more human than the humans destroying things around him. Our consumer psyche has eroded the caring instinct. We produce and consume far more than we need in order to provide the essentials of life: food, water, clothes, heating and shelter. The balance is wrong. The craving for power is measured by money.I first saw A. I. on the 21st September 2001 at a cinema. The ticket lies in the jacket of the 2002 dvd. Now I view it flat-screen but with the kind of depth which only wisdom can hope to provide. I am eleven years older and still have no urge to raise children. Not just because the world is out of balance but for the sake of my own sense of equilibrium. I believe in what is natural and real. Everything matters. Everybody is important. Whilst the politicians prattle-on in broad sweeps of social rhetoric, I know that it is details which matter. Funnelling massive amounts of resources into Armies and weaponry is at the cost of prosperity for every individual. Nobody talks of full employment, only `our best interests.' The Blue Fairy runs this satellite-covered planet. Can you recall the last intelligent conversation you had? We are being separated from our instincts.	5.0	Everything is real	2012-04-27	3	1	2

I smell something wrong when I got a lecture on artificial intelligence, a robot that can love in the first 10 min. of the movie. This is not you would like to see in a sci-fi movie or any kind of movie.I think the most anonying part is David. I didn't mean Osment did a bad job. It is something to do with that robot boy. I can only feel &quot;artificial&quot; but not &quot;intelligence&quot;. All I would say is David is dumb, and that make the movie much less convincing than it should be.	1.0	Way below my expectation.	2001-08-01	6	1	5
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A2P9MUAADOQAEZ	"""wunder4598"""	Spielberg and Osment will be getting awards this year.  This is the best movie I have seen all year.  The reason I liked the movie so much is that I was pulled into the story.  From the previews I had really no idea what the movie was about.  I knew it was about a little boy robot and that is it.  The easiest way to sum up what I went through was an emotional roller coaster.  This ride for me puts anything at Disney World to shame.  It is kind of like when you get off of a roller coaster and you have that hazy feeling.  I was left in that world when the movie ended and it took a day to get back into reality.  I have to go see that movie again just because the story is so good and I loved the ride it put me on emotionally.	5.0	Emotional Roller Coaster	2001-07-04	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	Spielberg's movie is eventually rather slow and convoluted after a promising start. It becomes a tad pretentious, sends mixed messages and fails to hang together as a coherent vision. Throw in the typical Spielbergian tendency to sentimentalism, and you end up with a fairly uneven film.It will disappoint those who expected a pacey action-thriller, but as a futuristic fantasy/fairy-tale variation of Pinocchio, it certainly maintains a genuine charm and sense of enchantment. And despite its hopelessly tangled thematic web, it is full of points of interest that will no doubt draw me back to it again.	3.0	An enjoyable mess	2004-08-15	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A37R7QYQFBQCCR	"""yogsothoth666"""	So the world's a rough place. People are cruel. Society's pliers keep trying to bend you out of shape. Your friends are dying and so are you. You're not sure your parents did too good a job of raising you. Well, here is a magically hypnotic place where even though all that is true, it's somehow okay. When Mom says to AI son (I mean, you think you've got it bad, think of him!) that she loves him YOU ARE THERE. Why wasn't this movie popular? The first generation of kids growing up with single moms or broken homes are still trying to cope with the problem with anger, not wisdom.Keep at it Spielberg. They'll get it in the end.	5.0	A masterpiece	2003-05-31	6	4	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3C370FIMJ6LTF	Yoshitsune	I know many people did not like this movie, but I thought it was a great movie.  The plot/story was very well done and the acting was superb.  I found the movie a very emotional experience because of the excellent job done by Haley Joel Osment in the lead role.  I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this film.  Personally, I think everyone should go see this movie, and I hope the kid wins an award for his superb acting in the role of David.	5.0	A very well done movie	2001-07-28	4	2	2

B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	AB2AQMK9PCWWX	"yygsgsdrassil ""yygsgsdrassil"""	....you could just about tell what Spielsberg took from Kubrick's storyboards and what is pure Steven Spielsberg. My problem with this moovy is that such a drama and collaboration would have gone over bigtime 10 years ago....pre 2K, dig? But certain things in the moovy seem forced. Jude Law doesn't seem to really form a bond with the Boybot (or is this the closest thing to bonding Mechas do?), the teddy bear was it supposed to be more humorous? Osment comes off as being creepy, period. Particularly in that scene where he's trying to mock his 'mom' eating and laughs at strands of noodles in his mouth.C'mon folks. Had Kubrick lived to flesh out his darker, thinking mans' vision, it would have been a masterpiece a la A Clockwork Orange or 2001. This product, however, failed to live up to it's great promise.	2.0	Kubrickian Vision Fails in Hands of Fantasy Pulpmeister.	2002-12-11	5	3	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	APWB3HPGJORCU	Zachery Seward	This movie is definitly touching, Spielberg does it again. Do not listen to those ignorant critics, This movie will keep your eyes watching, and maybe tearing. I promise I won't give any spoilers but just a few thoughts.1. The actors do a great job, I wouldn't be suprised if any of them were nomitated when the time comes. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law shine on screen. Plus a cameo by Chris Rock and Meryl Streep2. This movie is definitly not for children, I can say that, it is not being rude, it is just that the movie can later get dark, and sometimes send a chill.3. This movie raises some good questions, can something other than humans and animals love us, if so would it be true love or would it be natural love that you would forget it is something other than a child. To me this movie defined one thing, that we are all robots, why i say this, well we grow up from begging to end asking questions, searching awnsers, in our own little way we are all robots searching for something, it is practically as in robotic term an objective all of us have it.4. This movie will touch you from begging to end and no use hiding the tears as i tryed, I reccomend this movie to all people who not just want to see the special effects but to also see a great movie for which I hope will be a trademark later on, I can't say anymore if you really want an emotional movie with some comedy or a teary eyed movie i reccomend this one it is truly great.	5.0	A Truly Emotional Movie	2001-07-10	3	1	2
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	The movie takes place several years into the future, where a multi billion dollar corporation is now investing in creating an artificial child for select parents whom are in need of one. The corporation decides to ask a young couple that has just suffered a tragedy of having their son in a coma, and they ask them to test out the prototype for them. The story follows a young android, David, throughout his many experiences with his new family, but his experience is suddenly abrupted by the return of the family's real child. When jealousy and sibling rivalry start to cause friction between the two siblings, the family decides to take David to the factory for dismantling. Along the way however, the mother is unable to go through with it and sets David loose. She tells him to run away and to never come back. Now, David is all alone and confused in post futuristic society where machines are persecuted by human beings. The story for this film is one the deepest and warmest stories ever, and Haley Joel Osment is brilliant in his performance as well. I do admit that the film's theme isn't consistent because it feels as though there are two directors doing this film. One moment you'll get a dark film (similar to Stanley Kubrick's style) when they do scenes like the robot killing festival, yet you'll recieve some light hearted touchy moments (Spielberg's style) with scenes like the uplifting ending. Overall, this film may seem a bit weird for some, but I highly recommend this one.	5.0	Awesome Movie	2004-11-27	2	1	1

It was a bit slow in the end, but by then I knew it was a fantasy and everything else in the movie made up for it BIG time. Speilberg did a fantastic job! Haley Joe Osment also did a fantastic job(I think he was even better than he was in ""THE SIXTH SENSE""). Anyways, I came out of the theater fullfilled to the fullest. The special effects were great(A visual masterpiece!-through my eye), great acting, great score, and overall A.I.-Artificial Intelligence is a must-see film."	5.0	A STUNNER!!!	2002-06-06	0	0	0
B00003CXXO	A.I. Artificial Intelligence [VHS]	A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ	Zoe Paris	This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing.	1.0	The blue fairy? Gimmie a break!	2006-10-26	19	5	14
