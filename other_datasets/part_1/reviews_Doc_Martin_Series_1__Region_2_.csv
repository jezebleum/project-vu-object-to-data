B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AQXB4AR9HCZTE	1912 House	Ok, so I am a hardcore lover of BBC, have been for more years than I care to share. PBS has offered BBC comedies for decades now, however this is the most recently produced series available on PBS to date (at least in our area).  When our local PBS station went into it's month-long fund-raising they stopped the regular programming and we decided to watch this series via Apple TV instead (and Amazon's Prime video app). The PBS station was showing the episodes out of order (very annoying since it is a cumulative story line) which was another reason we wanted to be able to watch the series in order.  There are currently 6 seasons out, with the first being aired in 2004 and Season 6 aired in the fall of 2013.  According to internet news,  there WILL be one additional season made, to tie up the story lines, but at this time it is unclear whether it will air in 2014 or 2015.Technical Notes:  We had some difficulty with Amazon Prime's video streaming dying in the first five minutes of many of these episodes. Not sure if it is attributable to this series, Amazon's app, or possibly the Apple TV.  If this happens, you may have to restart the video several times before it runs properly. The opening credits are displayed faster than when watching these episodes on regular tv - maybe Amazon is trying to save bandwidth, not sure, but it is the fast forward during the opening credits that is causing the streaming to fail I am sure.	5.0	BBC Comedy-Drama at its best!	2014-04-01	0	0	0

I watched season 3 first -- I receivedseason 3 as a Christmas present. When I read the descriptionof the series on the back of the box, I wasn't sure if I'd like it.That description makes the series sound kind of campy ormadcap. If that's also your concern, rest assured that thisseries is funny, but not silly.

It was a great episode as all the elements and most of the characters fell right into place as I had understood them in the subsequent episodes that I did see. It was great to see that the ""marker"" for Martin's relationship with Louisa was solidly established in this first episode. Martin's wierd interaction with people, especially Louisa, is misinterpreted negatively, and later Louisa becomes somewhat embarassed when she finds out what he really meant. This interaction with Louisa happens in practically every episode.BTW, I saw clips of the scene of their first meeting in the Spanish and German versions, and it was just as funny as the English version. Now I'm waiting for Season 5 to come out so I can see what happens next."	5.0	"Review of Doc Martin video, ""Going Bodmin"""	2012-03-03	0	0	0

Humor, drama, mystery, romance & a jerk doctor that you can't help but love. It's very well acted & grabs your attention from the very first scene in the very first episode. Doc Martin goes from being a world class surgeon to the GP of a tiny village in the Cotswolds all because of an unexpected phobia to blood that reared its ugly head during the middle of a routine surgery. He takes the job of GP in this village thinking he won't have to deal with blood, but what he doesn't expect is a town full of clumsy, accident prone people who seem to bleed a lot.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1USEY1KMYPNPZ	Amazon Customer	If you enjoy Brit Coms and haven't tried 'Doc Martin', you owe it to yourself to sample a few. We started with season 5, last winter and then picked up season 1, from Amazon to get more into the series.Martin Clunes plays Dr. Martin Ellingham, a gifted surgeon who lost his 'nerve', and became a small town GP. Martin lacks certain social 'skills' and the series runs with this.Clunes is a naturally funny guy playing a straight, dry character and does it so well. The supporting cast of characters and the small town only add entertainment.Try 3 or 4 early episodes and you may find yourself hooked.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	APGYHQWUVOUAY	Amazon Customer	Ostensibly about an unlikable, highly successful, big city, vascular surgeon who retreats to a small and charming village as a GM because he develops an aversion to the smell and sight of blood. Doc Martin is socially inept (from years of cutting himself off from his real feelings, it is apparent) and at first, unapproachable. The viewer is given to believe it is the lovable although kooky townspeople who will put him right.  However, as the series progresses and the doctor begins to adjust to his situation, I find the characters of the town to be less simple/quaint/eccentric than obnoxious - some of them ignorant bordering on dangerously ignorant. Is this how small town people truly are? I hope not? Seems strangely unbelievable and manipulative to me.Anyway, difficult to continue watching when you don't really like the characters. I especially find the so-called receptionist impossible to stomach. In the end, the two I most cared about were the good doctor and his guardian angel, the homeless dog.	3.0	3 Stars for the doctor and his dog	2014-04-22	0	0	0

From the first episode, I've been transfixed not only by the stunning scenery of this seaside Cornwall hamlet but also by its quirky and eccentric characters.  Doc Martin is beyond rude in a classic case of Nature and nurture.  Louisa, the town's schoolteacher is as fascinated by him as she is repelled by his abruptness.  And every Portwenn resident has his/her own story to unfold.  I am now at the end of the second series and even more enthralled.  The only downside &#34;to Doc Martin&#34; is that it becomes an addiction and you long to relocate to this place which engenders both laughter and tears.	5.0	A Treasure	2014-03-14	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	ARN0I9XACINII	"Anna Elle ""mrs-l literacy coach"""	For an American Anglophile just the scenery of seaside Cornwall is a treat. However, the attraction goes deeper, and more universally, into the lives of people who try to tolerate one another's idiosyncrasies while they ferret out village secrets - of which there seem to be few that last. In Doc Martin's irascible character we are confronted with our own fears of being disliked, yet we are comforted because, despite his inept social skills, we like him anyway, just the way we hope others feel about us. And there is also his rather super-human ability to diagnose and cure all human complaints so long as he is not weakened by his earthly kryptonite - blood.  Through it all, he and Louisa (Superdoc's Lois Lane) keep us off balance as we root for each of them to overcome their shortsighted focus on the other's flaws and regain their initial blinding heat of passion. Well, that sounds like a universal romantic longing, too. Maybe the show set in Cornwall could really be about anywhere. And that is its true charm.	5.0	Dodgy Doctor Delightful	2014-04-24	0	0	0

The setting in Cornwall, England is so beautiful that even if the actual show wasn't so funny and unique, I'd still be watching it just for the scenery.  Martin Clunes is hysterical in his role as Doctor Martin Ellingham, former surgeon from London, who has recently developed an aversion to blood and therefore, cannot perform surgery.

As Doctor Martin Ellingham, Martin Clunes not only shows that he is a top drawer actor, but he has created one of the all-time great television characters.  The cast is rounded out by a number of other accomplished actors who in the series comprise, to say the least, a town full of offbeat, quirky characters.  As with the acting, the writing is superb.  Unlike American television, there is no gratuitous violence, gore, sex, nudity or cursing (to speak of) here, yet the series could hardly be improved upon.  My wife and I hate to see each episode end, and can't wait for the next one.  Highly, highly recommended.	5.0	"The Doc Is ""In"""	2013-08-21	0	0	0

I will admit much of it was over my head since I was without any context from previous seasons. I wasn't all that impressed but was told to give it another try. So, I figured I'd better start at season 1 episode 1. I was almost immediately hooked.

My wife and I have actually been watching this out of order - and season 1 is as good as the rest of them - it is also nice to see where the characters came from.If you aren't familiar with it - Doc Martin is a doctor moving from London to Port Wenn - and changing his life around. Lets just say that Doc makes Clint Eastwood look like a chatterbox - he may not have a lot of bedside manner - but he is an ace doctor. Both the Doc and the townspeople have a lot adjustments to make. It is cute, smart. upbeat, and we always feel better after watching!

I have watched the entire six series to date and hope there will be another season this year. The two Doc Martin movie prequels are both entertaining, but are not as good as the series. The Movies portray Doc Martin (Martin Clunes)  as a somewhat aloof, Obstatrician , who gives up the big city for a small village. In the series he is a very successful surgeon in London who developed a fear of blood and had to give up his prestigious practice to accept a General Practitioner job in a small Port town.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2HCC3I9E5POOU	Brenda Griffin	I first stumbled upon Doc Martin on PBS while channel surfing. What caught my eye was the scenery the story is set in as well as the humor. While the PBS episode was from season 4, I was thrilled to see I could catch up a bit starting at the beginning here on Amazon. In today's often hectic, fast-paced world, it's refreshing to see storytelling that's simple, witty, and engaging. The show is well written and clever. The actors do a wonderful job bringing these quirky characters to life with all their humanity.  I look forward to more Doc Martin!	5.0	Great series!	2014-01-12	0	0	0

The characters are well developed and the comic nature of this series is contained within their stories.  The Doc is irritable, clueless regarding social cues, and somehow attractive at the same time.  A slice of small town life in this seaside community.  As a middle-aged male, I LOVE Louissa!!  Her physical beauty and her compassionate personality have a strong  &#34;pull&#34; and complement Ellingham's acerbic nature. Her character brings the humanity to the series.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2O65G4UYD8CAI	buyerofvariousitems	This series is a must-see, especially if you like British comedies. It's set in a small village in Wales, I believe, and stories revolve around the inhabitants who include: the socially awkward but v. funny doctor who is the main protagonist, his love interest, his aunt, a hilariously played pharmacist (brilliant), pub owner, plumber, etc.  Everybody is nosy as would be expected in a small village. And, last but not least, one of Doc Martin's receptionists steals the show, every time!

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1QQBR1UPS2SME	Carole Eberhardt	What a shortage of this kind of entertainment there is in the USA.  I so thoroughly enjoyed watching this and within a week I was back watching for the second time around.  Like any good story there has to be an ensemble of characters who are quirky and a village full of stories to tell.  This one is up there with All Creatures Great and Small but has us in a much more current time. The only fault I can find is that absolutely nobody would put up with the receptionist that Doc has to endure. She is rude, stubborn, and self obsessed but somehow the village thinks she deserves a job.  A good mixture of comedy, drama, and nail biting is what the perfect series needs and this has it all. I'm hooked and will have to buy the whole series now.	5.0	Great Entertainment	2013-02-06	0	0	0

It's not because his character says all the things I wanted to say but never had the nerve - because even I wouldn't think to say some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth - it's because I can't wait to see how he can turn what most folks would see as a friendly light situation and turn it into a ranting fiasco.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A23CYAEWYCWA6X	Carolyn Mae Kolssak	If you know anyone whom you deem insensitive to others feelings, your irritation with that person will rise.  While Doc Martin in rude, insensitive and probably suffers from Asperger's, he is also very keen to diagnose and bring healing to his clients.  Sometimes he is a world away from even being courteous yet it appears to be funny.  Other characters add to the enjoyment like Aunt Joan who embodies all the love Martin's mother never exhibited, the father and son plumbers, the very sweet and tender school teacher Louisa.  If you're interested in health issues Doc Martin sees them all:  infertility, low testaterone,knee replacement, narcolepsy, pregnancy and accident causing hemorages while he has a phobia at the sight of blood.  This is an unusual comedy, spiced by real life predicaments, beautiful coastal scenery and colorful people.	4.0	"A study in ""bed-side manner"" - NOT"	2014-04-13	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A61J68KXFQNWK	C. Eub	I started watching Doc Martin based on a recommendation from my cousin. So far I have watched only a few episodes of series one. I enjoy it mainly because of the very beautiful outdoor scenes of Port Isaac, Cornwall. The title character is a new general practice doctor in a small fishing village called &#8220;Portwenn.&#8221; He is a capable physician trying to appear all-knowing but it comes off as more awkward than arrogant. He bumbles along, learning the ways of the small village making many errors along the way that help him to learn about the people of the town, and their wonderful attributes. I catch an episode or two when I can, and I am eager to see more of the show now that I've become familiar with the characters.	4.0	Doc Martin Season 1	2014-06-20	0	0	0

The picture quality is not quite up to the standards I expected, seems a lot like it was filmed in 480P.  We are used to Hi Def filming.  The story line is interesting but does not seem to make any headway chronologically.  There are new stories and new characters introduced but nothing happens to the characters, in that they are here today and gone tomorrow.  We will continue to watch the show but not with the enthusiasm that we felt with Downton Abbey, now that is a great show.	3.0	Doc Martin	2013-05-19	0	0	0

But, he has some great help from others such as John Marquez (PC Penhale - Seasons 3-6),  Lucy Punch (Elaine - Season 1) and Ian McNeice and Joe Absolom (Bert and Al Large - Seasons 1-6).

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2XNOB1T796Y6B	"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!"""	If you've seen 'Saving Grace', you are sure to love this series. Why? Because the very character of Doc Martin was originally based off of Clunes' character of Martin Bamford. A revision or two later & the series 'Doc Martin' was born! And boy, do I love it!The series follows Clunes' character of Martin Ellingham, a doctor who was previously a successful surgeon until he developed a nasty aversion to blood. Hoping to find some peace of mind, he decides to become a GP (general practitioner) in the town he used to vacation in as a child- Portwenn. Unfortunately the good doctor seems to have a humongous problem dealing with people... and his bedside manner leaves much to desire. Whether it's dealing with a highly inefficient secretary that's loved by the entire town or making snap diagnoses about health problems, Doc Martin is sure to please!The series is wonderful. This disc set however, does leave something to be desired. Unfortunately the set is beyond being even the barest bones. There's only the episodes on here, with no special features at all. No subtitles & no close captioning will make this set unfortunately inaccessible to many viewers out there. (My set has close captioning turned on & nothing showed up.) So if you are hard of hearing or are unable to hear regular television noises, this will unfortunately be something you may want to pass on.But oh man... the series is wonderful. I couldn't help but giggle throughout the funny parts & commiserate with the characters during the more sad parts. Seriously folks- this is as good as it gets.	5.0	Absolutely wonderful... but is a bare bones set	2010-01-10	13	12	1

This show itself is wonderful and if you are interested please read my review of it written under the box set purchase. This review is here just b/c I want people to know that it contained no subtitles which made it very difficult to follow. The British accents are very thick so if you think you may have trouble understanding them, get the dvd with subtitles. I recommend the box set also b/c the seasons are so wonderful you will want the set. Also note in this first season the character Elaine who serves as Doc Martin's secretary is annoying but she is only in this season so things get a lot better once that character is gone and she is gone after season one thankfully.	3.0	THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DVD ITSELF NOT THE SHOW!	2013-03-15	2	2	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2J6T80ME844E2	Cloudy_Weather	I'm a late bloomer.  :)  I've been streaming my way from season 1, up through season 4.  I had only one complaint, and that was the movie-length episode ending season 2... too over the top, trying too hard to hold attention, and not quite in sync with the characters.  I'm glad season 3 went back to normal again.  I love how it bounces from drama to comedy to both, and never quite knowing just how things are going to go.  I wonder if they'll be able to keep up this momentum, but for now I'm having a great time viewing.  It's nice watching a lot of episodes in a row, and not having to wait for new ones... until I finally get caught up.  All actors are doing a great job.  I'm hooked.  And that says a lot, coming from someone who was never all that wild about tv series.  I prefer movies, or a mini-series that is complete within a few days.  I detest major cliff hangers where you have to wait a year to get answers.  Those lose my interest after the first time they do that.  It seems the outrageous cliff hanging is becoming more and more the norm.  Big mistake!

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	"Curmudgeons, if blessed with good writers, can be satisfying house guests. They're irascible, oblivious, often insulting (sometimes unintentionally), but usually with a hint of endearing rehabilitation. Dr. Martin Ellingham, formerly a top-rank London surgeon who now practices general medicine in the Cornish town of Portwenn, not only has first-rate writers, he's blessed by having as his impersonator the actor Martin Clunes.Dr. Ellingham (""Martin or Dr. Ellingham, please. Not `Doc Martin!'""), during one simple operation, found himself overwhelmed and unable to continue. The sight of blood suddenly sickened him, not a good thing for a surgeon. It stopped his career cold. He retrained and accepted the job of Portwenn's GP, far away from London and from the people who'd learned of his phobia.But Doc Mar...Dr. Ellingham...seems to have a gene missing in his make-up. He is all too frank, oblivious to human courtesies, awkward, means well but has one of the worst bed-side manners in miles. If you're a young boy who has sprained an arm, an elderly gentleman whose wife is using too much hormone cream, a well-intentioned busy-body who stops by for tea or a cancer patient, don't expect much from the doctor by way of chit chat or hand holding. Even with an actor as good as Clunes, this could be a tiresome one-joke premise, except that Portwenn has a classic collection of idiosyncratic residents, all played by some skilled British actors. There's Doc Martin's aunt, Joan Norton, played by the fine Stephanie Cole, so good inWaiting for God. Joan is an elderly, brisk, no-nonsense woman (wise, too, of course) who wrings a chicken's neck to prepare it for dinner. She lives by herself competently on her farm. There's Bert Large, played by the equally fine Ian McNeice. Bert is Portwenn's handyman and plumber. He's a short man so fat he prefers to give the orders while he sits and trains his son to do all the work. There's the town's policeman who is big, competent, young, shy and concerned about...ah...size. The town's schoolteacher, who cannot understand how Doc Martin can be so obtuse, is about Doc Martin's age, not married and... we'll have to see. Maybe something will happen in season two. It certainly didn't look like romance when, at the end of season one, Doc Martin helpfully mentions to her the possible causes of bad breath right after she unexpectedly kisses him, something he was too ill at ease to initiate himself. There's an assortment of small town biddies, blokes and giggling teenager girls who all love a bit of gossip. Periodically showing up for one-time parts are such established actors as Richard Johnson, Celia Imrie and John Alderton.Doc Martin finds that in Portwenn he has to deal with human nature as often as he has to deal with diarrhea. But with human nature he hasn't a clue. Still, when he suspects something is wrong with a patient, he's not only usually right but he'll do whatever it takes whoever he offends to get good care for the person. Because the quality of the wring is so high, the installments are amusing and satisfying. Good actors make Portwenn's residents more like odd but possibly real people than the usual cut-out yokels. Portwenn itself is a star, too. The town is right on the Cornish coast, picturesque as all get out, with a friendly pub, sea air and easy jaunts down country roads to some beautiful scenery.Most of all is Martin Clunes as Dr. Ellingham. Clunes is a big man with a large head, large ears and a wide mouth. He's not handsome. Clunes, however, is a fine actor who can dominate a scene. He also can effortlessly project cluelessness, umbrage and impatience...and do so while he also makes us realize Doc Martin is almost an innocent when it comes to human interactions.Doc Martin is superior entertainment. Season one consists of six episodes totaling 280 minutes on two DVD discs. The video/audio transfer is excellent."	5.0	"""That's Dr. Ellingham, if you please, and what's all this moaning about a little diarrhea?"""	2009-08-30	92	87	5
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A23R3EOZ837242	"Colin Brown ""Colin Brown Microsoft MVP"""	Doc Martin (Martin Clunes from Men Behaving Badly fame) is a quirky British comedy based around the main character who is an ex physician from one of the top medical institutions in the UK, who through an epiphany, now gets queasy at the site of blood and so goes off to his old village where he grew up to be the local GP.Doc Martin starts off hating the village and the local hicks (being used to London for so long) but through each episode you see him softening and starting to like the place.The cast of characters gels well, especially his air headed secretary and makes this a good comedy.  Its not as funny as men behaving badly but still a well written series and worth watching.	4.0	Quirky British comedy that works well	2013-07-09	0	0	0

It is a kind of character study, showing the complex interactions of people living closely with others who are all a little dysfunctional, but basically good - so much like most of us.  We keep hoping people will change, but as this show reveals, our characters are slow to do much changing from our original natures.

At first I was not sure about it, but after a little while I found that I really liked it. Maybe it just takes a while to see where it is going - it is hard to explain, but it is a little different.Doc Martin is about a hot shot surgeon from London who suddenly develops a phobia about blood - kind of a problem there. He ends up taking a job as a local GP in a small town in Cornwall where he has an aunt living nearby. Things are a bit ""informal"" there, and it does not go too well at first, but he finally settles in. The Doc is a bit arrogant, but he is a good doctor and does care.There are some zany characters and picturesque village life. I guess it is a mix of comedy and a little drama too.Give it a try.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2HVRC3QIIWRVH	darlene purcell	"Thats right!  I hate Reruns! But I love Doc Martin, any episode, any time!He's not exactly Prince Charming, in fact he is about the most socially awkward man on tv  but he might be the best doctor in the world.  He WILL save his patients whether they like him or cooperate or not!  Everytime he tells someone to do exactly as he says, I keep waiting for them to punch him rather than just look afronted and scurry away like wounded puppies.  No matter how obnoxious he is they can't deny the fact that he knows what he's doing and they trust him with thier lives even if they make fun of him behind his back.I'd actually like to see his love interest Louisa Glasson stand up to him just once with more than a scolding  for treating her like an old shoe. How deeply she loves him and keeps giving him second, third and millionth chances is actually what the makes the series so endearing.  I love watching her kiss him, closing her eyes and peeking to see if the frog has turned in to a prince yet! :pDespite his gruff exterior and unimpressive manners, Doc has a kind of charisma that keeps me coming back for more. His brilliant mind tunes in instantly to any illness and he's quite the hero saving lives and looking like a fool in the interim with his adversion to blood!  Easy to do considering in almost every episode it seems to shoot out like a gusher everytime someone walks in the office!I wonder if he will ever figure out how to cure his own maladies?  Not just the hemoglobin heebeegeebees.  You know the ones I am talking about.  Hoof in mouth disease.  Shut-up-itis. Lets don't forget the ""how the heck did you get pregnant Weeza, I'm a doctor, not a daddy!""Port Wenn is a beautiful island, the people there enjoy a way of life that most of us can only dream of.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AHIK7BUXFRMT8	David Bower	We're fans of British drama but had not heard of Doc Martin so we decided to give it a try. Now we're glad we did as this series reveals a truly non-typical hero, Doctor Martin Ellingham.Our first reaction to Doc was how unlikely his appearance was for a leading man, after we adjusted to his appearance we were somewhat put off by his rude, self-centered behavior. It didn't take long, however, for us to get completely interested in this very strange, but dedicated individual.Circumstances, which I will not reveal, results in this well established and competent surgeon relocating from London to the small fishing village of Portwenn in Cornwall. The initial shows in this series address the rather difficult process the Doc and the people of the village have in trying to adjust to each other. A teacher in Portwenn, Louisa Glasson, played by Caroline Catz, provides the occasional romantic interest for Doc; Catz is very touching as Louisa.Whereas this may sound rather mundane, let me assure you it is anything but that; after watching the first episode we were completely hooked on the Doc and his life in Portwenn. Martin Clunes is outstanding as the irascible Doc and actually begins to generate some sympathy for him and his situation. I commented to my wife that the Doc character is very interesting to watch but I certainly wouldn't care to know him personally.One of the benefits of this series is the beautiful scenery around Port Isaac where the series is filmed. For instance, the Doc's house in the series can be seen in Port Isaac. Although the location is a tourist destination, the filming of Doc Martin has helped put Port Isaac on the map.We are now watching the second half of series 4 and look forward to seeing all of the remaining shows. If you enjoy British actors and acting you will enjoy this series. It was a real wake-up call to find something as good as this series and realize that it was only by chance that we found it.I was interested to note the longevity of the actors; it appears all of the leading roles have been played by the same actors since the shows inception in 2004.I have read that a 5th series is scheduled to be filmed in 2011; this gives us fans something to look forward to! The 5th series is scheduled to run 8 episodes.This is a very distinctive series; it may be so distinctive as to polarize some viewers but we have solidly come down on the side of fans of the series. I recommend you check it out and see what you think.	5.0	A Really Different, But Captivating Series	2011-01-27	1	1	0

Doc Martin is a gruff, short-tempered misfit who is definitely a product of his upbringing.  That upbringing is explained by remarks of his wonderful Aunt Joan, his only local family member.  He is love struck almost immediately by the local schoolteacher and he is unsure what to do with this new feeling.  Martin Clunes' portrayal is spot on.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AL1WBEKIEPUPE	"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL"""	"If anyone has read my reviews on this board, it is obvious that I am a great fan of British television programs; however, being in kind of a rut, I decided to try something new to me--the ""Doc Martin"" series.  I am so delighted; it is just what my life needed.The ""Doc Martin"" comedy series is a funny delight.  Doc Martin is a wonderful character. Martin was a successful surgeon in the ""big city"" of London.  After developing a dislike for blood, he becomes a General Practitioner and the only doctor in a small picturesque seaside town that is filled with rather odd and eccentric people that includes a plumber and his son that just don't seem able to repair any faulty plumbing with disastrous results; his rather surly receptionist that is very incompetent that she and the townsfolk won't ""let"" him dismiss plus a host of very interesting patents for him to treat that have all kinds of ailments from men growing breasts to the extreme bowel problems to a man that has an imaginary six foot grey squirrel as his best friends that he needs meds for.Doc Martin has NO ""bed side"" manners and tends to speak what he is thinking even if it's not too nice.  Nevertheless, he is very intuitive solving medical mysteries that are plaguing the little town.This series is extremely well written and is filled with loads of rather ""black"" humor that the British can do so well.  It is also very well directed.  I love it and intend to purchase more of the series"	5.0	THANKS, I NEEDED THIS	2010-07-09	6	4	2

Unfortunately, it just isn't my kind of humor. If you enjoy a show that ridicules everyone - I guess then you can't say it's making fun of any particular segment of the population - then go for it. My personal experiences are such that I made it through a couple of episodes and then took it off my Prime Watchlist.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A15C1VLFXE6HGI	G. Ruest	"Ran into this series by accident on PBS and was hooked immediately by the witty writing , characters, and casting. Martin Clunes is superb as the blood phobic London surgeon who relocates to a rural General Practice role . His lack of a bedside manner is in stark contrast to his previous work in the William and Mary series where he played a sensitive undertaker courting a busy midwife. You can explore his work on PBS and Netflix. I gave this DVD as a gift to my adult daughter and her family as they don't watch TV much but greatly enjoy a good human story. The topics dealt with in both series can be very adult but are handled with humor and can be used as teaching and talking points with children, especially teens, if you are the kind of parent who teaches kids to cope with problems rather than keep them ""protected"" from real life.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A13TO5TU4A68LD	Gryphonisle	"(I'm willing to bet all the 5star ratings this show gets are due to it's British Accent.  Some people...)""Doc Martin"" often gets compared (usually unfavorably) with ""Northern Exposure"", so let's start by saying it is NOT the British version of that show.  It was inspired by the movie ""Saving Grace"" about a once wealthy widow who turns to growing pot, and which was also filmed in Port Issac, on the Cornish coast.  However, it doesn't even pick up where that movie left off, either.  ""Doc Martin"" is about a big city doctor with personality issues who takes up practice in a small town, it sounds like ""Northern Exposure"" but it lacks the ensemble cast format, so it always follows the Doc when the show would benefit by focusing every now and then on other characters and their relationships.  It also fails to make anything more than a backdrop out of the gorgeous Cornwall coast, which is a shame.  The producers seem to want to make it into the California coast and always shoot in sunshine, when clearly, this town is not a warm, sunny, Santa Barbara type of town.  I would have enjoyed more good old English weather, rain and all that.Still, once you sit on your ""Northern Exposure"" expectations and smother them, this show entertains.  The doc never fails to leave you exasperated with his sheer rudeness, while at the same time you cheer when he tells some dolt to ""Shut up!"" or ""Get OUT!"".  I watched the series disc by disc, season one through four, and enjoyed all of it, and I look forward to season 5.  Having said that, I would recommend it as I viewed it:  As a rental.  It's good, but not so good you'll want to have it on hand, right now, when you think you'd like to watch an episode or two.  I love the British accent as much as anybody, but I've heard enough of them to know not to be swayed into thinking the mere sound of the Kings English makes anything seem sophisticated and top notch.After all, the British don't think that way..."	3.0	A Good Entertaining Show, But Better To Rent Than Own	2011-03-18	9	4	5

This show is a breath of fresh air with  the ability to whisk you away to the Cornwall region of the UK. I especially like not previously knowing the actors so that the characters seem real. The humor maybe tailored to UK and us older US folks. Not sure my grown kids appreciate this type of programming.	5.0	Quirky City Physician Meets Small Nosey Villagers	2014-05-01	0	0	0
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AD4O1EKHSGS4A	happycaregiver	If you enjoy quirky characters, a beautiful setting and interesting plots, then Doc Martin is the show for you.  It is wonderfully written, with the main character being so sarcastic and socially inept that you will love him from the first.  He is actually not a bad person, he just says exactly what he is thinking without regard for others feelings, but not in a nasty way.  The love story between Martin and Luisa is wonderful and just gets better each season, which is a testament not only to the writing, but to the fine performances of both actors involved.  The supporting cast of townsfolk, as well as any guest stars, are perfectly cast and really make the show shine.  If you enjoy British humor along with good storytelling you will love this series.	5.0	Truly one of the best shows to come out of the UK	2014-06-21	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3IXZJ1L73DYTA	Jack E. Levic	I read the reviews and had high hopes for this series. I imagined a big city doctor moving to a quiet village full of quirky and loveable characters. Well, the characters were quirky but few were loveable.Doc Martin is a cranky and unpleasant doctor surrounded but cranky and unpleasant villagers. It should be a perfect match but neither the doctor nor the villagers are accepting of each other. It seems like the only two in town who like Doc Martin are his elderly aunt and a homeless dog that follows him around despite his best efforts to rid himself of the animal.A sudden aversion to blood ruined his highly successful career as a surgeon. The lovely village of Portwenn need a new GP (General Practioner). Doc Martin had spent a few summers in the village with his aunt and that seems to be his reason for applying for the position. It's never clear why the village and the townsfolk seem alien to him even though he had been to Portwenn in his youth.Enter his inept receptionist Elaine--the epitomy of a quirky character. She'd rather talk on the phone than work and she seems dangerously unqualified to work in a medical office. She apparently comes with the office and despite an attempt to fire her, Doc Martin is stuck with Elaine..just as the townspeople expect.It's a slow beginning and finally he has some patients but none have any medical issues. His office becomes a social gathering place for tea and biscuits (cookies). Yet, Doc Martin does have the knack for diagnosing serious conditions in non-patients that he meets in his everyday life. He can see medical conditions before the people realize there is a problem. This is an interesting side of Doc Martin's character that could really be used to liven up the bland storylines.There is a one saving grace of this series and it is a BIG saving grace. The village and the surrounding area are truly beautiful. It's a joy just to see the village and the typical British buildings and the lovely countryside. The scenery alone makes it worth the view.I tried to give the series a chance. I watched 4 episodes and the show seems to be a constant repitition of the villagers showing their disdain of Doc Martin and the doctor returning the mistrust.Lots of reviewers love the series and I wish I could be one of them. I just couldn't get over the bland storylines and the fact that so few characters were likeable. It was almost like a toned down GREEN ACRES with totally annoying characters throughout the show.	2.0	BORING AND UNEXCITING BUT BEAUTIFUL SCENERY	2011-09-22	15	5	10

There is something about the seaside and greenery that is relaxing and different. At least for State-siders - where all our coasts are followed by miles of sand, heat, and tourists. Although the actual town of Port Isaac may be a tourist stop, it doesn't appear that way on camera, and it is quite refreshing.  So I went back and watched season 1 on Amazon and it really put everything together. Makes much more sense - as far as some of the characters and their relationships. I think that season one is by far the best one of all. It has much more humor in it too.	4.0	Doc Martin - funny and relaxing at the same time	2014-05-31	0	0	0

Oh and the scenery is beautiful too.	5.0	Great Show	2014-06-18	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A28EF47E1PUEUU	"Jan P. Rochester ""True Believer"""	This is a series that is very entertaining even if it is a bit prickly -  much of that coming from differences in British and American culture.  I've been watching it on and off for the last two seasons - some episodes from previous seasons as well.  The first year my wife was watching it and I kept it at arm's length.  But the second year I began looking forward to each episode.  It has good acting and decent story lines, some better than others.  The characters are intriguing, especially that of Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) - I'm a sucker, number one, for ladies with dark hair and, number two, the same with an English accent.  Doc Martin's (Martin Clune) character is off the charts peculiar and introverted, with good reason given the character development.	5.0	Very Entertaining	2014-05-14	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2236W0X2LTB7J	Jayebee	I have never been so addicted to a story line where the main character (Doc Martin) is such a awful person.  He has no patience for people or animals or anything, for that matter.  The series concerns the life and times of a surgeon who was dismissed from his occupation because he developed a fear of blood.  He relegates himself to general practice in a small coastal town, where he essentially alienates himself from the community as a brilliant doctor but a disgusting and offensive human being.  The writing and acting are superb and as the series progresses very tiny changes occur that reveal that under his very rough exterior there exists the smallest spark of humanity.  Each episode is filled with humor and mild drama, which makes for pure entertainment.	5.0	A Delightful Series	2013-08-09	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	ARJZH30D8LGUB	"Jeffrey D. Gilbert ""an average viewer"""	"Netflix streams this, so I was pretty much able to watch it in its entirety before purchase.  My hearing is, at best, marginal so the absence of closed captioning during streaming is a detriment.  In any case, I enjoyed this British Doppelganger of House, MD (should they have had an American actor for the lead?).  The Amazon description didn't have any comments about CC (which should have warned me - I could have avoided the disappointment).  So I now have physical possession of the series with a slightly better picture (and noticeably better sound) than streaming - along with the improved ""run control"" of a disc player.  The show would surely look better on BluRay, but I'm assuming WYSIWYG for a product is clearly going to be low volume.  I'm just happy it made it to the US market."	4.0	Great show, OK transfer, no closed captioning	2009-09-20	3	1	2

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A15EVL2IECAEKK	J. M. Welsh	"I found this series while home sick and trolling through the instant watch section on Netflix.  What a find!  This series is astoundingly well written and well acted.  I was not familiar with Martin Clunes (outside of his smaller part in Shakespeare in Love), but now I can't wait to see more.  This is listed as a comedy, but it is more of a ""dramedy"" really.  The humor comes from the main character's absolutely miserable bedside manner.  Characters, in fact, are the essence of this show. They are all wonderful.  And the Cornish scenery is an extra treat.There is no direct comparison to US tv in my mind-it's just too real.  Possibly a hint of Northern Exposure, ER, Seinfeld, and Frasier? And Archie Bunker springs to mind, but I'm not sure how. Read the other reviews for the basic plot line.  And watch this series...you'll feel so much better about your own character flaws in comparison to Doc Martin."	5.0	no comparison with American shows	2008-09-14	0	0	0
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1FUUL8EZ00ADY	JMZ	We are loving the first season of Doc Martin.  The setting for the show is breathtaking!  I want to live there too!  We are enjoying the characters in the show so much! They are funny, strange, loveable, and unpredictable!  We like the fact that there is a story line to follow and it isn't all comedy.  We like the interaction between the Doctor and the teacher from the school.  It is charming and fun to watch.  We want to watch all the seasons!	5.0	Doc Martin Season 1	2014-03-02	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1KHARE059WKWI	John Herbert	I have just recently returned from a visit to England with my wife. One of the places we visted was Port Isaac in Cornwall where this series is filmed. We were very lucky that series 4 was being filmed whilst we were there and we got to meet some of the stars. The village is exactly as it appears in the series, small and sleepy with narrow winding roads. Life doesn't seem to have changed a great deal for the residents and the ones we met could have been out of the show.We were sat in a pub overlooking the harbour where the cars are parked on the sand and whilst we watched 2 of the cars began to be covered by the tide. No one seemed to panic and when the drivers were eventually found they waded out to the cars and drove them ashore, locked them up and went back to work. It is so typical of the way it is shown on screen.This show is a must for anyone who likes the quieter way of live with a good dose of humour thrown in.	5.0	Doc Martin Complete Series 1	2009-08-01	3	3	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AVE67GYXLRAFV	"Judith A. Knight ""Daisy's mom"""	&#34;Doc Martin&#34; is the ultimate British medical comedy--a snarky doc with a well-hidden good heart.  I only discovered the series this summer although I has been on both our PBS stations for some time.  Doc is a complicated guy but a great surgeon; he has been thrown into the general practice system we meet him in because he developed a phobia against blood and could no longer practice his chosen specialty.  He loved surgery probably because he only likes his patients mute and asleep!  The town where he has been assigned [this is the nationalized medical system in Great Britain] is a beautiful little seaside town full of people you will grow to love in a short time.  He meets the intelligent and beautiful primary school teacher Louisa and and the stage is set for a wonderful series full of episodes that can be watched over and over!	5.0	Worth the price of my Kindle Fire!	2013-09-25	0	0	0
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AFY2X79AFGGFP	Judith A. Ort	If you haven't seen Doc Martin you're missing a great show.  I started watching it last year and loved each episode, especially the last one of the series.  I won't say what happened because I don't want to give away the ending, but I was really anxious to see what happened next only to find out that it was not offered again but will be back in 2011 because of demand from the public both in Great Britain and the U.S.Doc Martin is a doctor who says what he thinks and yells at patients who do not take care of themselves or follow his instructions.  It is hilarious!  He has come to Portman on the Cornish coast because he has a special problem that makes it impossible to continue as a surgeon in a London hospital.  He has a phobia towards blood.  It makes it hard to deal with patients because he gets sick whenever he sees blood and he is always trying to hide his problem.  He meets Louisa, the town schoolteacher, and falls for her but they don't seem to get along most of the time until later when they get cozy and she becomes pregnant.  He has a hard time showing his feelings to Louisa. She leaves town after their marriage plans gets cancelled.  Then she returns and he has to watch her pregnancy without being involved in her life and it makes him crazy but he's too proud to tell her how he feels.  The last episode is a stitch because the baby is coming and he is there but can't seem to be of any help.  It's the best part of the whole series.  I have watched all of the shows at least three times and can't wait until it starts again this year. Everyone who likes English sitcoms and romantic comedy will love this series.	5.0	Doc Martin Series Review	2011-01-09	37	31	6

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A38C7JFNIAARG3	"Just Jill ""Jill"""	Doc Martin is an unusual but ultimately likeable character. He is socially ill at ease and priggishly high on himself, based on to his past identity as a surgeon in the big city. But the people and lifestyle of his provincial new home in Port Wenn acts as a chisel to his ego as he fulfills his role as a general medical doctor. Supporting characters (the pretty teacher, who offers intrigue as a potential love interest -- and his feisty receptionist, who does pretty much as she pleases) are strong. Very enjoyable! Each episode draws you further in to the story. I'm happy to be coming late to this show, because I like it very much and know that there are five more seasons to catch up on and enjoy!	5.0	Intelligent and Witty	2014-02-28	0	0	0

I had seen Doc Martin listed and decided to see what it was all about.  I watched the &#34;movie&#34; which I assume was the series premier.  It was ok. When I started Season 1, I expected it to move a little faster.  I found myself wanting to fast forward.  Not as &#34;catchy&#34; as Downton Abbey or Mr. Selfridge.

At first I wasn't too sure, but I was drawn into the characters, and feel a little sorry for Doc Martin.  I compare it to the TV series Monk, and that Monk was brilliant with being a detective, he had several phobias he had to overcome, and also the TV series Becker, with all the crazy people and staff that Dr Becker dealt with, but he himself was the most hardest to deal with.

Yet you will love this man by the time you watch a few episodes because he lives his life the best he can with the lot that has been put before him.

We went onto season one and were thoroughly delighted!  Everyone in this series is a &#34;character&#34; to the max.  We laugh in pure enjoyment of their antics.  You will become invested in the lives of the various characters and await each new episode with excitement.  This series has 6 seasons, we are in season 3 and tonight we are so excited....we begin season 4.  I know...you may say we need to get a life but really with all the strange shows on television and in the movies these days, Doc Martin is a fresh breath of springtime.

Having all the seasons available on Amazon Prime encouraged me to start watching at the beginning, and I was hooked from the first minutes of the first episode. The plot evokes one of my all-time-favorite television shows, &#34;Northern Exposure.&#34; Both feature an outsider doctor who finds himself in an unusual setting peopled with quirky characters. So far I've watched the first four episodes of &#34;Doc Martin&#34; and am thoroughly impressed with the understated and excellent acting and the literate writing. The show has charm in spades and strikes the right balance between acerbic wit and genuine human interest.

The episodes have good story lines; however, to me, it's the inhabitants of bucolic Portwenn who make each episode so darn enjoyable.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3MC5MKA6NKHP5	K'nick K'nocker Fan	Doc Martin is a crusty, curt, verbally inept doctor who gets sick at the sight of blood. What makes him a sympathetic character is (1) he is a brilliant diagnostician, (2) he is a dedicated healer whether he's treating a scheduled patient in his office or if he stumbles across a medical emergency on a street corner, (3) he forces himself to do what is necessary even when blood is involved, and (4) he is genuinely puzzled when his brusque demeanor offends someone. I vacillate between wanting to shake the townspeople for being rude to him and wanting to knock some common courtesy into his thick head.	4.0	The most likable unlikable doctor on television	2014-01-06	0	0	0
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3ROU1AC4S6GP8	"Kristin Henry ""reader chick"""	Doc Martin is a socially inept yet brilliant doctor who lives on the edges of both panic and anger.  He serves Port Isaac in Cornwall, on the south west corner of England.  Unlike most doctors, Martin tends to faint at the sight of blood, a phobia he fights constantly.  At the same time, he ministers to his patients with a mixture of  dismay and incredulity, wondering, with a shake of his head, how they could be so wrong-headed while they wonder how he could be so cold and at the same time, such a fine doctor.  Much of the time they refuse to believe his diagnoses, which always leads to complications and unforeseen difficulties.  In the meantime, and despite his dicey reputation, he manages to keep his patients as healthy as possible, even to the point of ignoring the high school girls who tease and mimic his stiff walk and startled look as often as possible.  This is a wonderful portrayal of mismatched couples and colleagues, neighbors and nay-sayers, almost friends and well-meaning relatives.  This series promises to be addictive.  Who could ask for more!	5.0	Doc Martin, Not what you'd expect.	2014-03-08	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1TLCMO6QSR62M	"LDM ""ladlaw"""	"My husband and I - as well as our closest friends - have become dedicated to BBC series for their quality and subtle story/character developments. Conversations between characters tend to be verbal and non-verbal, with inflection and innuendos not commonly seen in US television.Together with our friends - we've created ""libraries"" of these series on DVD sharing them back and forth - and turn to these when ""scheduled"" television offers nothing on a given night...That said - Doc Martin is one of the very best of these series. Combining drama and humor - it at times seems to faintly reinvent the BBC classic -  ""All Creatures Great and Small"" - although with the 'patients'(including the doctor himself) being HUMAN this time round. At other times - you might be reminded of Northern Exposure at its best - but with more focus and with the ongoing interest of the medical challenge facing the doctor in each episode.The characters all have depth and foibles -  and over time you come to see that the community of Portwen (where the series is set)  is a reflection of real towns - and friends - and families - anywhere.  This is suggested early in the series - when the inevitable clash between the ""arrogant"" Doc Martin - and the ""unsophisticated"" villagers comes to a head - one villager steps in as mediator and points out the obvious - despite all their differences - the villagers - including their new doctor - need one another.  They are in fact - the sum of their parts. And then you get it.  The series is not one-dimensional - the plots of each episode generally turn not on one story - with key players and a back up cast - but rather on the development of circumstances - which likely involves multiple characters and their personalities.  For this reason the show somehow remains fresh - season after season - episode after episode.Highly recommended for anyone over 14 (there are some adult situations and medical situations in some of the shows that in my opinion are not appropriate for younger children)"	5.0	Great Television !

The townspeople characters, although often seeming a little one-sided, are delightful to watch against the curmudgeonly, but brilliant doctor. From the irrepressible secretary to the insecure police officer to the no-skill plumber, Doc Martin is surrounded human foibles that he cannot tolerate, despite his own - hemophobia.

Indeed, watching the first season of Doc Martin I could not help but feel that its creators were inspired by Northern Exposure, transplanting the stranger in a strange land doctor from the relative desolation of Alaska to the relative desolation of a coastal town in Britain.  And just as Joel was never happy in Cicely, Doc Martin is forever ill at ease in Portwyn.  There are numerous other parallels.  In any event, I would strongly urge Northern Exposure fans to give this one a try.	5.0	Northern Exposure on the Other Side of the Pond	2011-12-05	1	1	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A275WJBGGUHC89	Marilyn M. Green	A friend of mine mentioned watching Doc Martin so I started watching it on my Kindle, It is such a different show because it defies all rules of TV shows. The main character is a surgeon that develops a phobia about blood so he changes careers suddenly to become a general practitioner in a small but picturesque town. Unfortunately, he has no social skills so things do not go smoothly with the people in the town. He is respected as a doctor but everyone knows how difficult he is. His interactions with people are so funny because he is blunt and truthful. This is not always the easiest way to be. He falls in love with a local teacher but both realize they could never make each other happy. The teacher leaves town to teach in London but returns 6 months pregnant. After the baby is born they try so hard to make it work but dealing with a baby can be very difficult for anyone let alone the situation they find themselves in.  (I just realized I am reviewing more than Season 1. Sorry!)  I would recommend this to anyone. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the things he said. You will too!	5.0	Funnier than expected!	2013-06-16	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2Y8E7YQR7AEAK	"Marmalade Girl ""Alethea"""	I love the writing as well as the acting in this series! I was so enchanted that I watched five seasons in about 6 days--then watched them over again the next week. I can't wait for the final season to air. I have heard from some friends that they found the repetitiveness tedious after a while, but they likely didn't marathon the episodes like I did. The show mixes comedy and drama very well, though I occasionally feel sorry for the townspeople of Port Wenn, who are often the targets of jokes and made to look like fools. Still, for all that the doc himself loathes their idiocy, he and the viewer warm up to the locals... eventually.I've always loved Caroline Catz and Stephanie Coles (and Ian McNeice!) but the actor in the title role was new to me. I enjoyed Martin Clunes so much that I sought out the tv movies (which I didn't enjoy as much) andReggie Perrin(very different from Doc Martin, but I adored it anyway).

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1TGFLIMON68AD	Marty Dart	A highly dysfunctional English Village-(is there really any other kind?), and a brilliant but border-line autistic doctor make a very funny pair.The stories are imaginative and the dialogue is quick and smart.  The acting/directing are first rate. There are some plot holes big enough to drive the Queen Mary through but somehow they don't matter.  Intersperse some fantastic and classical physical comedy and you get a wonderful mix of characters that you really learn to care about,  a series that will make you laugh out loud, and occasionally tear up a bit too.I've finished the first three seasons and am on the fourth now.p.s. Ya, I admit it...I watched Green Acres back in the day and this has some of the same kind of zany-antics.  It's more than just zany though, it's very thoughtful and sensitive too and in that way it has parallels to As Good As It Gets, which starred Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.	5.0	Green Acres meets As Gppd as it Gets	2010-12-22	3	3	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3U3BEZMH3F01Q	maskirovka	"That pretty much sums up ""Doc Martin.""1.  It's one part Northern Exposure in that it puts a city doctor in the middle of a beautiful country setting and has him have a slow-motion romance with a comely local.2.  It's one part ""Local Hero"" because the good citizens of the Cornish village that the story is set in are pretty much the equivalent of the equally zany Scottish ones in that movie.3.  It's one part ""House"" because the center of the show is a gruff but brilliant surgeon who has a disability that makes life for him very hard sometimes.Actually, ""gruff"" is an understatement.  Doc Martin is arrogant, humorless, impatient, and does not REPEAT does not suffer fools easily.  But with this being said, you get the impression that underneath that very hard shell is someone who is fundamentally decent and who looks on at the previously mentioned comely local, schoolteacher Louisa with longing in his heart.The show is not perfect.  Doc Martin and Louisa go from being barely speaking to each other to being on the verge of marriage with very little in the way of any tender moments shown between them.  I also wonder when we'll get to see Doc Martin laugh or smile.  But I suppose there's time for all of that and unlike ""Northern Exposure"" where the entire long-form comedy storyline got derailed when Rob Morrow left the show, I hope they wind up Doc Martin with the happy ending we're all rooting for."	5.0	"One Part ""Local Hero,"" One Part ""Northern Exposure,"" and One Part ""House"""	2010-07-19	5	4	1

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	ANBQYEW3F1TNI	Maui Bob	"I have watched the 31 episodes of the ""Doc Martin"" television series five times. It has the best casting, the best acting, and the best story line of any television series I have ever seen. The series is filmed, in the summertime, in the real village of Port Isaac, in Cornwall, England. They have renamed the town Port Wenn, and this locale is a top contributor to the lovability of this series.This series is about two people in search of love and happiness: Doctor Martin Ellingham, an arrogant chief surgeon from London, and a local elementary school teacher Louisa Glasson, who will soon be a middle aged old maid school teacher. They both have never found success in ""love."" Martin, forced to leave his powerful position as chief of vascular surgery in London because of a sudden onset of panic attacks at the sight of blood, applies for the position as GP in Port Wenn, a village near his fraternal aunt's farm, where he spent summers as a child. He meets Louisa on his flight to Cornwall, to be interviewed by the committee that will hire him. Lousia is the ""lay"" representative from Port Wenn. Their meeting gets off to a bad start for both, but they both come away from that initial meeting puzzled and not understanding their feelings for each other.  As the series progresses, their interaction stirs emotions and sexual tension. Martin Clunes stars as Doc Martin, and Carolyn Catz stars as Louisa Glasson.Running side by side with the ""love story"" is Doc Martin's trials and tribulations with the locals and their quirky problems and ways.  More than any series I've ever watched, the top quality filming of these episodes leaves you with a feeling that you are an invisible observer wandering about the village observing its life, and chiefly the day's activities of Martin Ellingham. I sincerely hope they continue this series, as has been rumored. P.S. And you can understand every word spoken by the cast, in contrast to much of television in the UK. (Try understanding the long running series ""All Creatures Great and Small""; the books were great, the TV show was obviously for local Brits, only.)"	5.0	The Best Television Series Ever!	2011-07-21	23	22	1

However, I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this show is.  Although Doc Martin is a bit of an unfriendly guy, the character has a lot more depth than that.  You do get a sense of why he is the way he is and that despite how he presents (with very few social skills), he does care about his patients and is capable of caring deeply.	5.0	Great show!	2013-05-27	0	0	0

It's a pleasant 45 minute escape into the beautiful scenery along the coast of Cornwall. There are no commercials and no laugh track; two factors that make some American comedies annoying to watch. The show is not hilarious comedy or semi-high brow drama. It's a light escape from all the variations of Law & Order or CSI. The negative critique was overblown and over-written.	5.0	de gustibus etc	2012-03-12	2	2	0

It doesn't matter how many changes take place in a character's evolution, I gotta have 'em all! This first of two Doc Martin ""features"" (I'm assuming they were done for TV) based on a character in ""SAVING GRACE"" was popular enough to ultimately be reinvented in a delightful TV series in the UK. I enjoyed this volume 1(and Doc Martin volume 2, as they are named) very much. What can one say when my wife and I are unabashed fans of Martin Clunes? We had to see this before moving on to the 4 TV series of releases. Enjoyable but not something that goes on the shelf as ""Gawd, this is bloody great!"" However, that said, I do feel one should see this and it's sequel, before watching the brilliant series it inspired. Doc Martin volume 1 and 2 are enjoyable and a nice introduction to the beautiful little town the stories take place in. Let's face it. To make a series based on the character of Doc Martin, the changes made were necessary to allow for a format that would encompass character and personality development. Back to my opening sentence...I'm a collector and I must have ALL the Doc Martins. It just turned out nicely that this and the 2nd feature are enjoyable and even help one in realizing just how much the ""changes"" in the series make the character of Doc Martin GREAT! I guess I should also mention that the 2 Doc Martin features from the Australia company are wide screen (not full screen as noted on back cover) and beautiful.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A23NB3GLGYZREG	mkb	"Doc Martin was inflicted on me during a rainy week on vacation when the friend of a friend had the box set and insisted everyone watch several series. With the exception of this complete imbecile, we (British and Americans) absolutely hated the show. Has he BBC really become so desperate for a hit?Specifically we found that it completely lacked any real character development most especially in the leading role (Doctor Martin). It truly represents British drama or comedy drama at it's very worst with dreadful writing, directing and acting. The characters are all simple one dimensional pastiches of country types as envisaged by the smug London-centric writer/creators of the show - deeply insulting to people whom live outside the sophisticated confines of the ""Home Counties"". Every single story line is so obvious and manipulative that it insults the intelligence. A good metaphor for the utter shallowness and complete lack of attempt at any basis in reality is the permanent state of sunny blue sky weather in the coastal village in the south west of England where one is lucky to get 2 month's worth of such beautiful days in a year - speaking from bitter experience. Those who love the show are apparently content with such utter banality. A common groan rose every time a shot of Doc Martin's big silver Lexus (an unusual car in the the UK) tearing across the moors appeared with musical accompaniment - what was the director thinking?! It simply looked like a bad car commercial - a good one has more drama and technical competence than the entire series.The acting is almost offensively bad with Martin Clunes - not exactly renowned for any role other than his brilliant comedic depiction of boyish oafishness in ""Men Behaving Badly"", is truly awful. Although playing a doctor devoid of human empathy, his inability to express this other than using crass remarks and a total lack of emotion is bottom of the barrel stuff. Almost no attempt is made to go beyond this and indeed one quickly realizes that both actor and writers are incapable of doing so. As mentioned above, the supporting cast are demoted to simplistic characterizations of country bumpkins with exaggerated accents, eccentricities and simplistic ways. A few of the actors who complained about this during series 1 didn't make it to series 2... The critics in the UK hated the show and after watching it myself I can clearly see why they loathed this utterly dreadful crap lacking in any real comedy or drama.In contrast one one can hold up various UK and US shows past and present that contain various similar elements of cantankerous doctor or vet and/or fish out of water scenario. ""House"" of course reigns supreme with both viewers and critics as did ""All Creatures Great and Small"" back in the day. Simon Cowell on American Idol and various British variants, the grouches on Scrubs and ER are all good characters that were well executed by good performers and evolved over time. Doc Martin has absolutely nothing on such shows.No stars if possible - save your time and money with a sow that actually stimulates and genuinely entertains beyond the lowest common denominator.DREADFUL!!"	1.0	British drama/comedy drama at it's very worst	2011-09-24	54	11	43

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AIIRJDW085SMS	M. L. P.	Doc Martin is the best comedy/drama series shown on British television in many years. Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) leads an excellent cast in their portrayal of a group quirky but lovable Characters that live in the small seaside town of Port Wenn, Cornwall. The rugged Cornish coast backdrops the hillside town with its winding paths and beautiful harbor and provides the setting for most of the outdoor scenes. Each show offers a unique perspective into the daily life of the often tactless but always dedicated Doc Martin as he engages in the routine duties of a town doctor while pursuing Louisa, the woman he loves. The shows real charm is watching Doc Martin as he performs heroic acts of medical proficiency while trying to deal with his blood phobia and awkward persona. Louisa, played by the beautiful Caroline Katz is always there to lend assistance and smooth over some of Doc Martin's more abrasive comments. What more could you ask for in a television series? I am looking forward to series four to continue viewing one of the best programs on British television.	5.0	The best British comedy/drama in years	2009-07-17	3	2	1

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1S4RK8CHUQCMD	"MusicFan ""MusicFan"""	"Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times."	5.0	Perhaps the Best Television Series Ever!	2012-09-06	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2MR18R4B2SGPF	nanapatt	Doc Martin is not the touchy- feely humorous fare one generally anticipates from PBS so it took some getting used to.  The humor is there, but is subtle.  Doc Martin appears arrogant but it doesn't take long to realize he is honest and direct...and insecure in some areas.  This is a series that took more than one viewing before it became a 'must see'.  But it is well worth the time and effort.  The supporting players are excellent, and while the Doc brooks no fools, he could be any of us, or the person we might want to be if manners did not stop us.	4.0	Surprise	2013-12-23	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A36WTXJBYS3DB6	N. B. Kennedy	This medical drama about a surgeon who decamps to a small Cornish town as a lowly GP after he develops an aversion to blood is absorbing and entertaining. In fact, I am riveted to the screen if only because it's filmed in a town where my family once rented a house on vacation. My favorite crab shack is in almost every shot taken by the cove!The characters are endearing and quirky (but not overly so, which can be annoying... although I'm glad Elaine is gone after the first season), even Doc Martin, who is actually abrasive and even unpleasant at times. But you come to understand him somewhat, and of course he saves the day on a regular basis.My only complaint about the show is that some of the story lines are overly dependent on sexual themes. I dislike when TV writers distrust their audience with tamer matters. Everyday life is fascinating enough; there's no need to try to dress it up with salacious (and patently ridiculous) matters, in my opinion. My favorite U.S. show at the moment isRoyal Pains, another medical drama that has aMacGyver-like main character who can be a little much at times, but at least the story lines don't reach so low for viewer attention.	4.0	Doc Martin will cure what ails you	2012-12-30	0	0	0

I get up the following morning and find that one episode was indeed ordered! I furiously looked for a phone number to cancel said order. I finally found one. The order is cancelled but now I am gun shy as to ordering the whole season for fear I might make the same mistake again. This &#34;new&#34; per-episode designed for ones computer or iPad stinks Amazon and you should make entire separate section in which to order this way. I know you won't heed the advise of ONE person so, it leaves me no other choice but to find another on line source for my movies, sorry!	5.0	5 stars for the Doc Martin TV series: ! star for Amazon 1.90 per episode!	2014-02-17	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1W6U5WDAO4TRK	"Nora Rousso ""Book lover"""	I heard about this show while listening to a radio program that features soundtracks.  It's about a successful British surgeon from London that suddenly develops an aversion to blood.  He gives up his practice and becomes a general practitioner in a small village in Cornwall.  There are the usual assortment of wacky village types (kind of like &#34;Green Acres,&#34; but in a good way) and the scenery is breathtaking.  The doctor also is a brilliant diagnostician and has an uncanny ability to diagnose someone just by looking at them, usually when the would-be patient is lecturing him or being obnoxious.  My whole family is enjoying the series. Check it out!	5.0	Quirky fun British comedy	2013-07-15	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AOZ4ANEXZHXKK	P. A. Thompson	This program is another triumph in the long line of British comedies deserving top spots on American airwaves and in our DVD libraries at home.  Martin Clunes has nailed the cranky, haughty, yet deeply insecure and compassionate doctor with a dark secret that makes him the punchline of jokes among lesser medical colleagues, a source of endless entertainment for his new community and a joy to watch for us in the audience.  When a top London surgeon has to pack it in and take the position of the only GP in a coastal Cornish village we see a man both brilliant and troubled who has to re-boot his bedside mammer 101 lessons and polish his interpersonal skills if he's going to make the transition work and keep the job.  There's a sweetly cheeky and very grown-up romantic sub-plot, village eccentrics with twists you won't see coming, breathtaking Cornish scenery and thought-provoking life lessons.  This is a keeper to be savored over and over again!	4.0	What Grownup Fun This Is!	2010-10-04	4	4	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A20WH1YZFRQ4BG	"Patricia K. Gross ""Patty Gross"""	I have watched this series repeatedly because I find it to be so relaxing, funny, touching, and optimistic.  It is a joy to find the characters all have such interesting lives which one can relate to.  Martin Clunes is positively perfect in his roll as the village doctor. A former London surgeon, he developed an aversion to blood; hence, his return to the town of his childhood.  He appears to have some Asperger Disorder tendencies, and is certainly a man of few words.....often answering questions from his fellow villagers, who are also his patients, with one word.  Monosyabillic is his manner of speaking in many instances, which is considered by his fellow villagers as both rude, shocking, and endearing!  In our chaotic world in which live, we hear of  daily disasters, economic problems, healthcare problems, high crime rates, etc., I find the Doc Martin series takes me away to a quirky, charming, amusing, and far better land than the real world now has become.  Just watching the stories from the beautiful seaside village of Portwenn in Cornwall, England, serves as a far better and healthier tranquilizer than any pill.  Whenever I want to leave the problems of our world behind for awhile, I simply watch a few episodes of Doc Martin.	5.0	Excellent series of life in a seaside English Village	2013-02-18	1	1	0

I like this series because even though there is two years between each season; the first episode of each season picks up from the last episode of the last season. This creates a continuity that rarely exist in a television series. It keeps you wanting more. I can barely wait for season seven. They have not promised that there will be a season seven but I, along with many other fans are hoping there will be. I admit I am addicted to this series and have watched the series over and over and hope it continues.	5.0	"The complete ""Doc Martin"" series"	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1CIZ90FFOZTLM	phantomfan	I absolutely LOVED this series. I had heard Martin compared with House, and I think that's a bit unfair, albeit understandable. However, I prefer to think of him as a strange cross between House and James Harriot. Although James was just nice, nice, nice (ad nauseum), the situations in which they find themselves are really very similar - close-knit countryside full of bizarre natives with bizarre rituals. In personality he is much more like House, with one huge difference: House is a rude, insensitive jerk simply because he enjoys it, while Martin, not a jerk at all, frequently acts like one because he doesn't seem to know any better. Like House, Martin's dry, deadpan comebacks are hilarious.Each episode of Season 1 is better than the one before, culminating in an ending so funny I think I had tears in my eyes. He just never learns, does he?I still can't quite put my finger on what makes Martin so charming, since I'm not sure I would enjoy knowing him in person. Probably (and due in large part to the brilliant Martin Clunes) it is because he is so very real, and you can't help but identify with his out-of-place, misunderstood persona. Haven't we all been there?Simply a brilliant show - extremely funny, while taking itself seriously.Can't wait for Season 2!	5.0	Brilliant! A must-watch!	2008-06-21	193	189	4

However, the first year was very entertaining. There was something a little hit strange about the main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.Dr. Martin Ellingham, a  London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella.  Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline.  Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's  son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables,  and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan.  I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.Recommended. prisrob 04-07-14	4.0	The Soul Of The Village	2014-04-07	1	1	0

The location is perfect, it has beautiful backdrops for all the scenes. American television has gotten a little too real, too much gore in their detective programs, and comedies are too P.C., they've been that way for a long time now. I don't need to be brain washed.This program, on the other hand, provides an escape from day to day life and that's what entertainment should do! Yet, the characters are very real with their interesting foibles - a surgeon who's sickened at the sight of blood and a bedside manner somewhat impaired by Aspergers yet he has a good heart! Fortunately for him, Louisa, ever the good teacher, sees through all that and diligently brings it to his attention.Great program!	5.0	currently my favorite tv program	2014-06-17	0	0	0

Two days later, the original order (placed on 5/7) arrived.  It is still in its wrapper, and eventually I will view it to see if it is in good shape, or if it skips too.So.... the Doc Martin series gets 5 stars; the very late delivery of the 5/7/10 product gets zero stars; and the prompt replacement of the 'lost in shipping' dvd gets five stars; but the quality of the replacement dvd gets 3 stars.	3.0	quality lacking	2010-06-29	11	0	11

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3FQT36FEE81P	R. Halloran	The Doc Martin series is wonderful. We would have rated the experience 5 stars except for some technical issues with Amazon Prime.The Amazon Prime transfer process to my Vizio Wifi TV has had problems even though my internet connection is usually in excess of 30Mbps when the show is loading. The program sometimes loads very slowly and pauses and stops while watching the show. Last night I checked my internet speed cable connection on CNET and it was 45 mbps and the program still stopped and started quite a few times. My wife & I enjoy it. It remains to be seen whether we will continue with Amazon Prime after the trial period.	4.0	The series is fantastic - some Amazon Prime loading problems experienced	2013-10-06	0	0	0

At first it seemed just so so but gradually the principle character and the village come to life in full humor.  The technical aspects are accurate, as are the public health aspects.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A35DI28HRSEEP6	Richard B. Schwartz	Martin Clunes is, of course, a first-rate British comic actor.  Here he plays a more serious character with a sufficient number of foibles to add comic dimensions to his actions.  He plays an eminent surgeon who has suddenly developed an aversion to the sight of blood and redefined himself as a G.P. in a small, seaside village in Cornwall.  This is a succession of fish out of water tales, with the amusement coming in equal measure from the doctor himself and the quirky locals.  The doctor is well-meaning but occasionally feckless, dead-panned in his honesty and laconic in his speech (when, e.g., he is being interviewed by the local talk show host).  This is the sort of thing that the British do expertly.  The individual episodes are relatively brief, so that you can watch several in an evening or shoehorn one in when you don't have the time or inclination for a full-length feature.  The Cornish setting and ocean views are a significant bonus and the stories are sweet, clever and suitably clinical.  Highly recommended.	5.0	Bittersweet Fun	2009-03-28	3	3	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1F07EXBSN5R5N	Richard	Not really like the movies, the series begins again the Doc Martin saga.  This time he is portrayed as more difficult; rude, insensitive but dedicated to his work as though ther is not much else.  The character, Doc Martin, began his pratice in the last series and the town characters were developed.  Now in season two life in the little town of Portwenn begins to happen.  You get to see into Don Martin and how he may have become the way he is.  You also get to see how caring he is for this town at least whiile hes there.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AU7ZYSXISCYBJ	RichF	Doc Martin is a pleasant departure from the other choices that are offered as Tv fare currently. Though series is a bit dated though, Season 1 was released around 2004. The scenery is worth the view all by itself. The Cornwall blend of landscape and seascape is just beautiful. Mix in the quaint old architecture and narrow streets made for horse and carts initially and you have a pleasant visual escape in every episode.The characters are quirky and interesting and the situations in which they find themselves range from hilarious to frightening. It is refreshing to watch intelligent dialogue and become involved and interested in the people and and how they live their somewhat ordinary lives in this close knit community of diverse types. After each episode we looked forward to the next one and were not disappointed in any of the 1st season's chapters. Our intent is to watch each succeeding season and we will do that at a leisurely pace in order to savor and discuss each episode as we have done for the first season.	5.0	Thoroughly enjoyable	2014-05-05	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A12NHIJ6GMU2MV	R. J. Heard	I am American, and older, but I became very interested in this show, and now have all the CD's of every season.  It has morphed a lot through the many years since it started, and each year is interesting for different reasons.  The story of Doc and Louisa now dominates the series, but I feel that the writers and actors have done such a good job, that people can relate to it in some way  or another.  Basically, after a while, you feel if these two characters can make a go of it, then there must be hope for the rest of us.  The trials and tribulations of their relationship, are very real to anyone who can relate to them.  If you follow closely, you might find something helpful or insightful to help in your own relationship... I know I did, for several of their situations, I could see (in some way) in my own life (even the doc's attitude). And so far, they do continue to work through their problems.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3BQO4Q27HOX81	Robert A. Schweim	Talk about a culture shock? This is a bit like sending &#34;House&#34; across the pond to terrorize a small coastal village in Cornwall. Doc Martin is a real grump, with absolutely no bedside manner whatsoever. That said, this is a remarkably funny and heartwarming series. Despite the lack of bedside manner, the gruff shell, and Doc's retching at the site of blood, he is a character you really want so see over and over.Being a series from England, you have to work through the accents and occasional phrases and terms (his doctor's office is called a &#34;surgery&#34;). Even so, the series is easy to warm up to, and you get to liking all of the local characters. Good cast, entertaining stories centered on a beautiful seaside village. Getting ready now to enjoy season 2. Tip: If you want to get into the characters and story line, we strongly recommend you begin viewing with the very first episode. Enjoy!	5.0	"If ""House"" lived in the UK"	2013-07-22	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1FI07OI3QSGLB	Robyn Ousby	I started watching this online and somewhat like it. I don't know why, but I think there are better British shows to check out. I would certainly never by this show on dvd. I like shows that are truly funny, like IT Crowd or Spaced. Even Kingdom was more likeable for me. Maybe it is because the main character seems like a jerk. When bad things happen to him, I guess we are supposed to find that funny, but my reaction is almost the same as his because who would be so daft as to think they wouln't have to answer the phone at their job? Why would a whole town turn their backs on a peson because he rightfully fired a person? IDK, thankfully there is a lot more out there and it is better than this show.Sorry go see some people had horribel experiences ordering from other vendors through Amazon. I can understand how frustrating that must have been. But let's be frank, if you are buying a dvd filmed/shown/produce/etc in another country check to see if it will play in USA dvds or if a universal dvd player is needed.

There is sadness and some small drama,  and each episode meakes you ready for the next.	5.0	I want to move there!	2013-05-25	0	0	0

The quirky characters are freshly written, the actors chosen to play them are all custom made for their parts. The standout difference in roles Martin Clunes has played before is also remarkable. Men Behaving Badly didn't show how good an actor he is. It doesn't hurt that the scenery in ""Port Wenn"" is so picturesque either. If you like British humor....even if you don't, this is a wonderful series. I purchased a PAL dvd player so I could see more of the series sent from other countries, ahead of the US release.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AU9G3LW3F2BI2	Sharon	I've missed this program somehow, and am now catching up and enjoying it on my Kindle Fire!  This is a charming program, highlighting the life of Doc Martin and his neighbors in a small English village, where he serves as the town physician.  The scenery is just magnificent, and the opportunities to go inside the homes of the various neighbors, is a pure delight.  While the program and story line is greatly entertaining with subtle humor, the marvelous insight into the people of this village and how they live, is wonderful!  And I must add that viewing this program, as well as others, on my Kindle Fire is better than seeing it on a large screen, as the smaller screen allows for a greater feeling of intimacy and enjoyment as you are able to see the fine details of facial expressions, costuming, and details of the surrounding landscapes and inside rooms!

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A35VI0H5AFHOJ5	Sharon Isch	"3.5 stars.Doc Martin (Martin Clunes) is an arrogant,  socially inept, short-tempered, dog-hating,  big-time, big-city surgeon who takes over the practice of  a small-town GP after developing a sudden and  unfortunate aversion to the sight and smell of blood.On the one hand you kind of feel sorry for him, on the other hand it's not all that easy to like him.He interacts with the  usual coterie of small town characters--the pretty young teacher who hates him at first sight (and we all know where that's going don't we?), the incompetent,  attitude-challenged secretary that the town won't let him fire (Lucy Punch, one of the wicked stepsisters in ""Enchanted""), the incompetent plumber  (Ian McNeice--could the Brits make a series without him?), and as Doc's beloved aunt, Stephanie Cole (Diana on ""Waiting for God""). John Alderton, Ben Miller, Celia Imrie and  other familiar faces make guest appearances. The series writer is Dominic Minghella (brother of  Anthony) The waterfront town is lovely.Not great dramedy,  but good enough to keep me watching till the end.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A17WQZJO5WB9HC	Sharon Zentner	I love British shows, and this one in particular, because they cast average-looking people. American shows always feature impossibly attractive people, which makes the show harder to relate to.Doc Martin is a fully developed character. To anyone who meets him, he seems to be grumpy and curmudgeonly, but as you get to know him throughout the show, you see that he is almost disabled by his inability to relate to people. It makes him seem to be a real person to whom one can relate.The scenery on the show is lovely, and is almost enough reason in itself to watch the show.	5.0	Anglophiles will love this	2013-07-19	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A2SAASUF1I1YJG	SherlocksSolutions	For anyone who wants a real life; ups and down, serious but quirky comedic series to become immersed in - this is your series!Also, anyone who has first-hand knowledge of surgeons (any speciality) can readily feel right at home with asocial Doc Martin. His plain spoken, unvarnished truth is painful to listen to; but don't we all wish we could tell it like it is, maybe the person will improve their behavior or in medicine - live instead of die?Doc Martin's first and seemingly only interest in life is practicing  medicine. It is the only way he can show his love of humanity.Unfortunately in this 1st series, his love for anything does not apply to an all-loving dog (GOD, spelled backward)who is the only living creature  willing to love the cold doctor. His harsh, unloving treatment of the animal is difficult for dog lover's to watch. Martin's inability to accept love or kindness by anyone or anything is startling, but does exist in life.The supporting actors are gifted in their ability to portray strong eccentric personalities. They give not an inch to the rude doctor. We not so silently praise them for socking it to him.While Doc surprises us with his unilateral personality, we develop a strong affection for him as he is forced to suffer and evolve.So much so; I can't wait for Series 2, Region 1 to come out!	5.0	Doc Martin Series One, Region One	2007-12-07	23	20	3

Watching the character development among the regulars is a treat, too. If you've seen the movies that preceded the series, you'll notice some changes (Martin's last name and personal history, primarily), but I think the series is even better than the movies.Some episodes deal with mature subject matter, so it's not for the whole family, but the subjects are handled sensitively by the writers (if not by Doc Martin himself). I think fans of Big Bang Theory will find a lot to enjoy about this show, and vice versa.	5.0	Clever fun for teens and above.	2014-03-27	0	0	0

It's been a long time since I have been absorbed by a program...I feel like I know these people.  Definitely recommend it ....especially if, like me, you are weary of the violence, ignorance and mindlessness of much current programming.

I read a few reviews on Amazon, and decided to purchase the series. I was very surprised on what I got. The cast is strong, the writing is WONDERFUL, and best of all, the acting is the best I have seen since Foyle's war.If you are looking for witty, well- written and well-acted series, then pick up all of them. You will not be disappointed!The best part of this show is that you can sit down and watch Doc Martin all day all and not get bored.More importantly if you are looking for some brownie points with you wife, buy this series. The love story written in here is wonderful. Your wife will love you for it.Just watch out for Anthony, ever since he left the ranger's place, he might just show up at your house!I can't wait for series 4! The sad part is I can't watch it on ITV's website (don't live in the UK).

Martin Clunes plays the title character, a doctor with a less then impressive social manner and a phobia with blood. All of the residents of the local town seem so real with their little quirks. This series reminds me a bit of The Andy Griffith Show but with more adult themes. It's a great series and I'm looking foward to getting Series 2 when it comes out for the North American region.	5.0	Great Brit Comedy/Drama	2008-11-23	2	2	0

He went to see the doc for bruising, and had a long history of injuries. We watch Doc Martin with caution now and some disappointment and certainly would not recommend it for children. No further disagreeable scenes and we are in Season2. If we find another we won't watch it anymore. We found another series called &#34;Lark Rise to Candlewood&#34;.

The series, which has run six seasons in the U.K. and fans are wishing for a seventh, features memorably very human characters,  a lovely setting, and situations and relationships that are both surprising and believable, which is a hard balance to achieve. High recommended, if your taste runs to human dramas touched by wit and, at times, eccentricity.	5.0	Quirky, Funny, Touching	2014-04-12	0	0	0

Seems like there is no in-between.  IMDB lists this as &#34;Comedy | Drama&#34;.  Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) takes on (IMHO) a roll which swings from overly-overbearing to tender & caring.  And he pulls it off.  Ian McNiece (Baron Harkonnen| Children of Dune) is a pivotal character throughout the season(s), and does a great job.My only disappointment is the character they created in the Pilot for Doc Martin is a somewhat different persona than what Clunes portrays in the Series.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AAJXUXOBWS97B	The Girl Who Loved Books	"So Doctor Martin Ellingham was a heart surgeon who developed a blood phobia, and now he works as a GP.  It's a funny show at times; the best characters are Auntie Joan (played by a brilliant Stephanie Cole), and Bert Large and his son Al.  But ""Doc Martin"" and his, well, sparring partner Louisa are both oddballs severely lacking in people skills.  It's not as much funny as ridiculous.I guess I am just cynical, but would a heart surgeon have the kind of knowledge displayed by the doctor with the kinds of extremely rare disorders that his patients contract?  I mean, Portwenn is a small fishing village...how do these people get these rare disorders, and how come the doctor instantly identifies them by little symptoms such as a scab, or tic, or whatever?Now that I've seen this, I'll probably never watch it again."	3.0	Meh, it's funny at times	2010-09-28	8	5	3

The Doc Martin role is very  unique and provides many laughs over his lack of social graces as he serves as a local area physician.  Louisa is a charming role for an actress as she attempts to understand Dr. Martin while seeking to form a loving relationship with this man who is not in touch with his heart, but is a very capable physician.  The interaction between Doc Martin and Louisa is fun to observe and offers many surprises.  Doc Martin is unique with regard to his relationship with Louisa and his lack of a good &#34;bedside manner&#34; with his patients who present themselves to the doctor with a myriad of issues.	5.0	Doc Martin	2014-02-10	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	AKLV6WQSHEOBE	thomas l saracco	For American audiences this show is very British.  Personally, I think that is a good point.  The main character is sort of a grizzled young doctor, a surgeon, who moves to a small community from the big city because he suddenly develops an aversion to blood.  All he wants to do is practice small town medicine.  He keeps getting dragged into situations with the townsfolk who view their doctor as an elder of sorts.  The story is about the struggle of one man's dedication to medicine only and the town's humanity.  He melts from time to time and even finds love.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A3QRYGPH3MA7HD	T. Lassiter	I started watching Series 1 of Doc Martin a month ago, and then quickly went through Series 2, 3 and 4.  I had previously watched the first episode of Men Behaving Badly, but soon forgot about it.  I was shocked to realize that Martin Clunes was in both shows!  I guess that's a tribute to his acting skills.  He really is amazing.  His actions and reactions in Doc Martin are so subtle, while in Men Behaving Badly all of the characters are over the top.  I was very sorry to come to the end of Series 4 of Doc Martin, and I'm thrilled to hear that a new Series is now on in the UK.  Hopefully it comes to the U.S. soon!	5.0	Great series!	2011-11-03	1	1	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A9D3ZTE1MGTU9	TriedandTrue	Be it Doc Martin or Foyle's War, some of England's producers, directors, and writers have finally nailed grass root values again.  This is while America's Hollywood embraces political correctness as if entertainment worth watching, their hoping Americans will pay for it, too.  Only Tom Selleck's Jesse Stone was some of the few programs that seemed to understand what was coming from across the pond. In fact without CGI, too many in Hollywood wouldn't know how to make a movie anymore.  With programs like Doc Martin and Foyle's War, I feel like I'm back into real people, real places, and real life, miles away from the junk indoctrination we too often get over here.  While I understand England's political correctness is off the charts, someone in their entertainment industry is finally getting it right.  I hope the Brits appreciate it, support it, and then demand it.  Begin the revolution!	5.0	Doc Martin	2013-09-29	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1OV42A6S5JNBH	Vivaldi's Doppelganger	"This is a terrifically funny and sometimes moving series about a famous London surgeon (Martin Clunes) who suddenly becomes nauseated at the sight and smell of blood and must therefore take his skills elsewhere, specifically to a beautiful village on the English Cornish coast called Port Wenn. The series is British, of course, because we simply do not do this kind of romantic comedy in America, where the hero must look like George Clooney (jug-eared Doc Martin, who walks like C3PO in Star Wars, is light years from George) and the characters are drawn in black and white rather than many shades of gray. And thank you, BBC (or whoever produced it), for NOT having a laugh track, which I cannot abide. Doc Martin reminds me of a doctor I once had who, after being called by my wife because of a relative's hugely elevated blood pressure, asked her, ""And what is so wrong that makes you think you can call me on a weekend?"" After being taken aback, she responded, ""Because you are the doctor on call this weekend, lest you have forgotten!"" We dumped him as our GP, but in Port Wenn that would be an typical response from dear old Doc Martin, and few of his patients would expect anything different from their cranky GP. Doc Martin's very appealing love interest in the village is the local school teacher, Louisa (Caroline Catz), a beautiful and conflicted woman who says more with her eyes and facial expressions than words (or other actresses) can ever convey. Amazingly, viewers grow to love this curmudgeonly character, who is a great physician but has the fatal flaw of expecting others to view the world in the logical, orderly, unemotional way he does."	4.0	Curmudgeonly doctor but lovely underneath.	2014-03-20	0	0	0

I accidently saw episode of current season on PBS so I went back thru Amazon video and I am catching up all previous seasons. Witty and interesting cast of characters.I enjoyed this series very much.	5.0	Good Series	2013-09-29	0	0	0
B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	APCUOY13RW1VW	"Whistler's wife ""whistler's wife"""	I just love the sense for reality that British TV has. In the US it seems TV characters have to be slender, wealthy, hip, and beautiful. But the Brits celebrate the average and the peculiar with great understanding and without apology. Kudos to them! Dr. Martin Ellingham (Doc Martin) emerges as the character that the viewer loves to hate (or at least, to misunderstand) as do most of the unique dwellers of the little town of Portwenn, where Martin has just arrived as the town's new general practitioner, transplanted from big-city London where he'd had a successful surgical practice until he spontaneously developed a phobia for the sight of blood (!). As the nutty stories develop, following the nutty but believable townspeople and their interaction with Doc Martin, we begin to give our &#34;hero&#34; better consideration, and the townspeople do as well; that is, except for the ubiquitous band of teenage girls in the town, who enjoy taunting Martin at every opportunity, and who function a bit like a Greek chorus in the series. &#34;Doc Martin&#34; is thoroughly enjoyable.......and did I mention the breathtakingly gorgeous setting that is this little town of Portwenn?	4.0	Quirky and delightful!	2013-06-13	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A12O5SEIF162P8	"William A. Nolan ""freeholder"""	Typical British comedy, but very well done.  Quirky, and filled with characters and actors unlikely to be in an American show.  It reminds me a bit of Northern Exposure, but with that British difference.  Better yet, all six seasons are feww with Prime.	5.0	Just discovered this!	2013-12-20	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A17KMU0OLHPZQW	William Weller	I love this PBS TV series.  Doc Martin must have been behind the door when social skills were passed out.  A brilliant doctor, who had to quit surgery because he suddenly developed nausea at the site of blood -could such a thing happen in real life?-he now is the GP in a quaint village which loves to socialize and doesn't seem to care that Dr. Martin can't or doesn't want to.  Very entertaining.	5.0	Funny, entertaining series	2014-03-14	0	0	0

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	ACOH6NFHT10GN	WSmith	Great series...loved it...the characters were well thought out and engaging and leave you wanting more each episode. All the villagers are a great counter-point to Doc Martin, and the story as it develops between he and Louisa is well done.  I appreciate that he keeps his attitude through the whole series, not becoming a new person to fit it, but rather making everyone adjust to him and his clinical, straight-forward ways.  As an aside, it's nice to find a quick witted, comedy series that I can watch with young kids running about the house and not worrying they're going to pick up some stray word here or there I don't want repeated, or have to turn it off if a sex scene pops up (very common in today's tv world).  I hope it continues and can't wait for season 5 to come up for watching.  And I heard they're doing a season 6 in 2013...yay!I really can't recommend it enough, enjoyable series, witty, charming, fun.	5.0	Great fun!	2012-05-25	0	0	0

I myself am a doctor and found out about the show from a patient and from the first episode of season 1 was hooked. All the characters are quirky and fun and I love trying to figure out the puzzle of the diagnosis du jour. I am also impressed by the medical accuracy that disappoints me in other shows.

B000AE4QD8	Doc Martin Series 1 [Region 2]	A1VSFE9ZXQM7NH	Zowar	He is socially inept, but wonderfully human! Doc Martin is a very funny series with a master actor in charge of the difficult task of making this seemingly unfeeling, insensitive, poor-bedside-mannered, blood-fearing physician come across a an endearing and (sometimes sympathetic) loveable human being who truly shows that perserverance and a bit of prodding from family and friends can lead to happiness and love...with a great deal of humor along the way! A special kudos to the wonderful Stephanie Cole who is absolutley wonderful as Martin's aunt, Joan!	5.0	One of the funniest anti-social characters ever created!	2012-12-16	0	0	0
