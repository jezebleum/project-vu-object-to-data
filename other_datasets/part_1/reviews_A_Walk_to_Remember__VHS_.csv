B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1AAIZE46O771R	100% Real	"Mandy Moore has been in better, but the plot is very good, but somehow it never came together for me. It wasn't that great and I don't understand how it touched people because it was the kind of movie where you're like, ""Is it over yet?"" It kind of dragged on. You may like it, but I've seen much better. if you want a sad, touching love movie, try the ever fabulous 'Titanic'."	3.0	eh	2005-07-25	5	1	4

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AADJXNY9HSKJF	Aaron	Recent teen movies have pretty much showed teens as cold and uncaring. This movie does nothing of the sort. A very likable cast displays emotion and yet they remain very believable.The movie is about an 18 year old boy the name of Landon Carter (Shane West) who is your typical high school &quot;big man on campus&quot; who gets himself into some trouble. He ends up getting involved with misfit Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) when he's forced to participate in his high school's spring play. The story takes off from there and i don't want to give away any spoilers. Shane West's acting is terrific but the real star is Mandy Moore who definitely displays the fact that she has acting talent and is definitely a young person to watch for in the future. The movie's love themes are not mushy *surprisingly* and the corny moments are pretty forgivable and handled well by the cast. &quot;A walk To Remember&quot; is definitely a movie to remember and a must see. It's not just for teens either. Anyone can enjoy it. My own mother loved it.	5.0	A Great Alternative To Modern Teen Movies	2003-07-22	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2KUDJOC55PFIX	Adam Hill	Ok im your average black wearing, heavy metal listening, long hair, type of guy. Ill be the first to admit I never was nor probably ever will be a fan of Mandy Moore's music (I said music not singing). And I only watched this movie because its all that was on HBO at the time. But listen, the way the love in this movie was portrayed, so real, so untouchable, broke me down like a little boy. The love in this movie itself was enough to break tears from my eyes like water from a rung out rag. Then when Jamie (Mandy Moore who is an amazing actress) drops the bomb on her love its almost like you feel the same pain he does because in fact if your a member of the male gender you will slowly fall in love with Mandy's Character too. After watching this movie and relating so well yes ill admit...I cried...Hard I may add. I woke up this morning and still felt the after effects. Now if a movie can do that to ME then think about what it can do for you. I REQUIRE YOU TO SEE THIS FILM!	5.0	If it can break me down it can break you down too...	2003-07-04	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	"It's so sweet yet real. Typical high school situations. Jamie's a bore with a few secrets from the world in the beginning. But once she finally hooks up with Landon who really wasn't her type at first, things start to change and she does things that she's held back for too long.Is it typical? Yeah. Sometimes. But you get to hear Mandy sing her heart out on ""Only Hope"" one of Switchfoot's most touching ballads ever. John Foreman and his brother wrote it I believe.Everything is peachy save for the haters at school (they make fun of and pick at Jamie for being the ""Virgin Mary"" and try to get Landon to break it off) and Jamie's father's disapproval of their relationship at all. Even worse, something very sad and tragic is revealed by Mandy's character (Jamie) and sends things into a downward spiral. The movie gets 10x as serious here.Overall, it's recommended. It's from 2002 which is a kinda old but I would highly advise you rent this. I think it'd be safe to buy it instead however; an all-around great love story!Cover Art: B-Characters: C+Story: A-Dialogue: BLength: B+Overall: B+4.2 stars."	4.0	This movie is amazing. 4.2 stars.	2007-11-27	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	A Walk to Remember is a really beautiful and poigant film but it does have some embarrassing and cheesy moments. I wasn't expecting to like this romantic drama but Shane West really blew me away with his performance and who knew Mandy Moore could act! Peter Coyote plays Moore's father in the film he is a fantastic actor, too bad he never got the recognition he derserves. I guess you would say this film is a tearjerker, it's a film about faith and second chances. A Walk to Remember is mostly targeted for younger audiences rather than mature ones, that's why I feel it's cheesy but nonetheless, I like this movie, it has a good message.	4.0	Jamie's miracle.	2007-11-14	3	2	1

I was curious so I bought it here and didn't quite know what to expect except that it was a ""tear jerker"".  Boy were they right!  I cried through most of the second half of the movie and do so every time I have watched it since (about 5 times so far)!I like that they don't have all the swearing and teen sex in this movie.  The second time I watched this movie was with my then 13 year old step-daughter and she cried with me.  After the movie she said ""I can't believe I've never seen this movie!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"Is love an instantaneous combustion?  Can two nobodies, living at opposite ends of the social Earth, suddenly fall in love, change their lives, and live a happy co-existence together (well, not forever in this movie - but you get my drift)?  This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery - this time it was called ""A Walk to Remember"".  An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, clich&eacute; bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore).  As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together.  Sparks fly?  Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally - through Hollywood magic fall in love.  What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments.  As I mentioned in my review for ""The Notebook"", one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale.  I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before.  With ""A Walk to Remember"", I was not impressed or surprised.  Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films.  There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom.  Gasp! Did he say that?  Yep, I was bored with this film.  The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen.  Alas, nothing - I repeat - nothing of the sort occurred.  From the clich&eacute; play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, ""A Walk to Remember"" proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab.  Why is this?  Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)?  Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry?  Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks.  It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention.  Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this ""gig"" mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role.  I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting.  The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film.  I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss - as only you could find in Sparks' story.  He fit the mold of what this film represented.  He was a father - one that nearly anyone could relate to.  There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish ""popular"" behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe.  How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier?  While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad.  I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet.  Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut - language and nudity - to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film.  Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a ""religious"" film, but instead, a film about faith.  I didn't see that.  Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought.  Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind.  I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- ""A Walk to Remember"" could be the result.Grade: ** out of *****"	2.0	A Walk through the Spiritual Woods sans Bill Bryson	2007-03-24	4	1	3
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3R9DWL4R90VJK	"Ahmed AA ""James"""	This is simply the BEST romantic movie I have ever seen. I have watched it THREE times consecutively & NEVER got board!!. Every time I was watching it as if it's the first time!. After watching it, I spent four hours or something thinking about it like I'm London (Shane West).Generally, I'm not into these kinds of movies, but once I have seen the first half part over a TV & didn't complete it, as I was busy with something.However, something in that movie has touched me that I could not explain it!. Thus, I decided to rent it firstly to figure out what this movie is all about?!, & I was SO touched, impressed & turned upside down!. Then, I had to purchase it...Well, I don't believe that there is a girl in the world like Jamie's character (Mandy Moore) in her simplicity, passion & softness. Because, if there's such a character most of the guys will do MORE than London (Shane West) does to Jamie (Mandy Moore) in that movie.Actually & without an embarrassment or shame, I'm one of the guys who would do the impossible for her, would die for her seriously if I had too, lock her in my heart forever & ........!!.Anyway, this movie is excellent, brilliant & fascinating if you want to travel with your imagination to a fantasy world of TRUE love which does not exist in reality!.Watch it & you WON'T regret, but remember, you have to get back to the real world when the movie ends!.	5.0	Is there a true love in the real life?!!	2006-03-02	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A36NLHJZ1SNX2F	"A. J. ""geeky girl"""	It was a nice story of how love can change a person's life.  Some of it was inappropriate for the tweenagers who would enjoy it most.  From an adult standpoint, the acting as well as the writing left a lot to be desired. It was also a bit surprising to me that a girl who could hold to her strict convictions all her life decided she could be equal partners in life with someone who didn't share her strong faith.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2HLIDULIGWRRG	Alec Malczynski	"When an onslaught of teen movies came pouring in the pre-summer of 2002, I knew this would be bad for the box office.  Seriously, who wants to see a dumb teen flick about a girl that a guy is trying to get on a bet, or maybe because she's popular or beautiful?  No one.  ""Crossroads"" was a huge waste of time, and was filled with sex, teen drinking and mid-driff Britney (Adolencent boys will probably disagree with me on that).  When ""A Walk to Remember"" came out, I was slightly reluctant to see it, especially with the disapointment of ""Crossroads"".  Later, when it was released on DVD, my sister said I should get it because it's nothing like other teen movies.  I though ""What the hell"", and got it for her anyways.  I thought mainly the only reason why she wanted to get it was because hunky teen actor Shane West (TV's ""Once and Again"") was in it.  I thought what's the harm in watching a innocent teen flick?  They're all the same, right?  Not this one.  Once I started it, I couldn't stop watching it.  It was beautiful.  It was wonderful storytelling and very intresting characters.  But probably the most important thing about this movie is what it made me do...cry.  Yep, I cried.  Like a baby.  Very rare does a movie come around that is so touching that you feel along with the characters.  Especially not a teen movie.  This isn't just another teen movie.Landon Carter (West) is a troubled 18 year old in North Corolina.  After a hazing gone bad when a kid is paralyzed, Landon runs from the cops...for about a few seconds before crashing.  Injuring his left leg and a scar on his forehead, Carter is forced to do community service with his school.  To help him in the suituation is plain-jane girl, Jamie Sullivan (Pop-star Mandy Moore, who I must say is a very, very talented actress).  Jamie is the town's Baptist's preacher's daughter, whom her strict Baptist father (played by Peter Coyote) forbids her from dating.  After Landon is enrolled in a school play that is lead by Jamie, he starts to grow attacted to her.  Landon's friends, however, keep Landon from expressing his true feelings because they are the popular crowd.  But in no time at all, Landon falls in love with Jamie.  But Jamie is struck with a problem that prevent her from falling in love with Landon, and it not just her dad what I'm talking about.""A Walk to Remember"" was a brilliant film, complete with love, laughter, heartbreak, and tragedy.  All this sounds like a William Shakespeare story, right?  On the contrary...it's based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (""Message in a Bottle"" is his first novel-adapted-into-a-movie).  The film is so beautiful, that scenes when Jamie and Landon are bonding together makes you wanna burst into tears of joy.  If you rent, or buy, this movie, it's best to watch with some tissue.  In one such scene, Landon thanks his divorced father for a very special treat (see the movie), where he starts crying while he hugs his father he hasn't talked to in 7 years.  That scene made me cry hyerically because it makes you love your own father for all the sacrifices he's made in the past for you.  Both West and Moore give Oscar worthy performances, and Landon's Mother (played by Daryl Hannah) also did a wonderful job as a parent figure.  See ""A Walk to Remember"".  Hopefully, with this movie, Teen movies will never be the same again."	5.0	The moment you'll start to cry	2002-08-27	7	7	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2QMLRALDX4U2B	"Alexander Kemestrios Ben ""A.K."""	Technically, this film is putrid. It suffers from every hollywood sin imagineable. Characters are poorly developed, the plot is choppy and inconsistent, the cliches are utterly blatant, and the movie is predictable. In short, it is your average syrupy dip of cotton candy fluff.Yet, I am ashamed to say that there is something redeeming about this film. There is a certain poignant, hidden honesty. Perhaps the movie pulls on the universal strings of human nature in the right way.You have the damsel in distress. The bad dude who saves her, and, in turn, is saved. The father who hates him, but grows to appreciate him. Oh, and sundry bathos filled scenes that blatantly attempt to pull the tears from your lacrimal glands.Like an under-ager sneeking cigarrette, this movie is a guilty pleasure. It is hard to hate Mandy Moore's character (however inconsistent her development). She is uber-innocent, exists in a ethereal world, and is picked on by all of the people you hated in high-school. She gives this film what life it has. The viewer feels a certain attraction to her-even if this attraction is contrived in formulaic fashion.One must note the irony here. The movie is making a moral point of telling you that it is not cool to pick on dorks, geeks, or what have you. Yet, in order to make us feel guilty for picking on the weak and meek, they choose a beautiful, lustrous young woman. Who would pick on her?! I guess it would not have the same resonance if they picked an ugly, importunate dork. Owell, such are the foibles of mankind.At any rate, I found it hard to despise this mawkish flick despite its blatant limitations. Perhaps, in some quixotic universe, unalloyed love and redemption do exist. Perhaps pure salvation is possible. At the least, sane humans hope for such things. To paraphrase a classic quote from the movie, hope is like the wind, you can't see it but you can sure feel it!! (facetiousness intended)To all the lugubrious souls in the world, it might be alright to spend a few hours watching this film. Your time could be spent doing worse things.	3.0	lugubrious and badly directed, but touching.	2008-03-22	4	2	2

However, as the plot unfolds, you suddenly realize it has taken you by surprise and basically beslaved you. It gently penetrates your skin and finds its way to the deepest places in your soul. Those you might never have known existed at all. Those you might have forgotten along the way. A place where you learn to discover love all over again. Clean from all the mischiefs of our times.Pure as it was meant to be.Timeless as it should certainly be.I am not part of the typical viewer group of these types of movies (I am 30+ years old) and I know something about love. Or at least I tought I did! This movie made me rediscover love. Saddly it made me also realize I was not living love even though all may lead to think so. I know now I have forgotten love and I wonder what I should do about it!For those of you who are still looking, this one is for you. It will show you the right perspective about love. Love where feelings are the main actor and where sex holds only a supporting role.And maybe, just maybe, if your're lucky enough, you'll find a love as pure and beautiful as Landon's and Jaimie's.Most Recommended!"	5.0	A Movie To Remember...	2003-05-05	1	1	0

It would be amazing in real life to find someone this special and have the relationship that Landon and Jamie have in the movie. This is more then the written words and acting, it's about what you feel inside. Its not cheesy like other movies you may have seen. I think that no matter how many times I watch this movie- I will never stop liking it.It is truly amazing.To all the people that haven't seen this movie-go see it, it will change your way of living.	5.0	Heart-warming &amp; Heartbreaking	2002-08-19	2	2	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2PUYMR4W89GUY	Amanda	"I rented A Walk To Remember because I wanted something to do. I didn't really want to see it, mainly because it looked schmaltzy and sappy and it stars teen singer Mandy Moore. But I like to give some movies a chance, so I rent them anyway. I just don't end up finishing some of them. With this one, I was expecting the same old teenybopper chick flick with bad acting and a bad plot.Boy, was I disappointed.It was nothing like I'd expected. Sure, the premise IS schmaltzy and sappy, but it's executed in such a way that you forget you're watching a teenybopper chick flick. Instead, you find yourself lost in the world of Landon Carter - resident bad-boy - and Jamie Sullivan - just your average plain Jane Christian gal. After a prank-gone-seriously- wrong leaves a student paralyzed, Landon is forced by the principal to engage in janitorial duties, tutor children on the weekend, and to join a production of the high school's drama club. The latter produces problems when he's given the lead role in the play, and he's having a hard time remembering his lines. So, he enlists the help of Jamie, who is also in the play. She decides to help him, even though he and his friends are always making fun of her. She tells him she'll only do it under one condition: that he not fall in love with her. He laughs and tells her she needn't worry. That would NEVER happen.Of course, just as he says that, the audience laughs as well, because we all know, from previews, that he is in fact going to fall in love with her. But what follows is unlike any romance in a teen movie. First off, Landon predictably starts turning into a good guy under Jamie's influence. But despite still (most likely) being a bad boy at heart, he seems to respect Jamie. Jamie is not your typical high school girl nowadays. She wears long dresses, and the same sweater everyday. She does not wear makeup. She talks with a soft, sweet voice that reveals just how sweet and innocent she really is. She is the daughter of a preacher, she's in the church choir, and she carries the bible everywhere with her. Yet Landon recognizes that she is a remarkable young woman, and he doesn't even care what his friends think (they think he's crazy, by the way).Perhaps the biggest surprise of this film is Mandy Moore. You know her. She was whom you once labeled a ""Britney wannabe"". Well, now Britney should be a ""Mandy wannabe"". Why? Because Britney, too, made her feature film debut this past year with Crossroads, in which she pretended like she could act. Crossroads was your typical teenybopper road trip chick flick, where Britney looked for any excuse to show some skin and sing some tunes. Now don't get me wrong, I was NEVER a Mandy Moore fan. But she did always hold my interest because, unlike her predecessors Britney and Christina Aguilera, Mandy has never once sold her music with sex. And now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Mandy's bellybutton. This is a major achievement in today's pop society. Mandy, who's all of 17, is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. And - OHMYGOD - she can act! She had a small role in last year's The Princess Diaries, in which she played a snotty cheerleader. That performance was forgettable. But this one isn't. She is perfect as Jamie Sullivan. (And oh my, she's even beautiful without makeup.) Give this girl another starring role; I think she's onto something.Shane West is great too, as Landon Carter. The two of them together make a beautiful couple. And even though the ending is not original, and has been done in a few movies before, it will make you weep like a baby. But it will also make you smile. This film is a rare gem. A teen movie that really isn't a teen movie. A sappy chick flick that really isn't really a sappy chick flick. Overall, it's a feel-good movie that will make you feel bad at times. Its PG rating, which is almost profanity and sex-free, is a breath of fresh air in a time that our younger society seems to thrive on the gross-out humor of American Pie. We should all look up to Landon in Jamie. We should all hope and pray we can find a love like theirs."	4.0	A Film to Remember	2002-11-09	0	0	0

What makes this love story so unique is that it's not about looks or sex or anything in between, it simply about the heart. Landon fell for Jaime's heart and he made the most out of her final days.  Both were better because of each other.  The song selections for the movie is perfect as well. The chemistry between the characters, even the intimacy (although very little) was just perfect.  It's wasn't forced or rushed.  It was simply beautiful.  I loved the story.  The movie was way better than the book in my opinion.	5.0	A Beautiful Love Story that stays with you.	2013-02-27	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A7JVF1KHYOMF	Amazon Customer	(This review was written by my wife)  I first saw this movie a couple years after it came out, and after the first couple of minutes I was about ready to turn it off (it has some mild language, and inappropriate gestures and such) but everyone else I was watching it with wouldn't let me shut it off, so I left, and came back around the time when the characters have their school play. I thought it was a different movie at first! I sat and watched the rest of it and cried like a baby.  It is such a heart warming movie, and I don't have a description of how much I loved it.  I'm still a little mixed about how I feel about it, I understand that it's mild compared to how some teenagers act (especially the main character, and his friends) I would recommend not watching it with your family if you have younger kids(the first little bit anyway.) But it is still a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a cute romantic movie with a good story to watch.  I hope you enjoy it!	4.0	A really cute movie!	2013-09-14	0	0	0

I even had two of my three children with me and not once did I have any discomfort watching it with them, which was nice.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3E1KL2N4ZOQ8W	Amazon Customer	Shane West and Mandy Moore had average performances as Landon and Jamie.  They would have not been my first choice for the leads.  However, Miss Moore's singing ability made sitting through her lack luster acting performance worthwhile.  She has been blessed with a beautiful voice that can easily bring out many emotions in her listeners.Peter Coyote's performance as Reverend Sullivan, Jamie's strict, protective, and loving father, more than made up for the mundane performances of the two leads.  He was brilliant and very convincing in this role.  He played the role perfectly.  His character was intimidating, strict, and protected his daughter, because he did not want to see her get hurt by Landon or anyone else.  It was an award winning performance by Mr. Coyote that was sadly overlooked by all.	5.0	A worthwhile tissue movie	2007-09-18	4	3	1

""A Walk to Remember"" didn't make me cry, which surprised me.  ""Here on Earth"" which is essencially the same kind of story - boy's first love dies of cancer - made me ball for at least half an hour after it was over.  Essencially, my problem with this movie lies in one very basic thing - the story didn't come together very smoothly.  Landon, our supposed hero, treats Jamie very badly at first.  And then he sees her in a pretty dress and some make-up, and all of the sudden he's in love with her and calling her ""Baby"" when a nasty prank picture of her gets passed around at school.  The story lacked tension.  The threat of the ""cool"" kids wasn't strong enough (the pressence of the old girlfriend ""Belinda"" was much too mild), nor was the pressence of the required ""disapproving father"" - here a minister, always a rich source of material- very much to make me think their romance was in jepordy in any way.  And the ""I'm sick"" shocker wasn't all that shocking. They should have spent more time developing the relationship between the two characters before the romance.  The book handles that much smoother, drawing out the time that Jaime and Landon spend together prior to the play, though the book's blatant Bible-thumping message toward the end is heavy handed and off-putting. Shane West and Mandy Moore aren't bad as the lead roles, but the story they have to work with needs serious help."	2.0	I'll try not to remember this one.	2002-07-15	5	1	4

Jamie Sullivan with her virtuousness will fascinate you as no other heroine will ever do.

This motion picture captures the essence of what life is really about...of rare things such as true friendship, timeless love and altruistic faith and hope.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3RFNQZQYXN3OS	Amy	Before I watched this movie I did not have high expectations of its brilliance. I was already a fan of Mandy Moore's music, and had previously seen her briefly in 'The Princess Diaries', but since it was a small part which did not give her much room to show her acting abilities, I could not tell, so I decided to see this film to get a better view of her acting skills.I was very surprised. After seeing Britney Spears in a main role I was cynical that any teen singer would have any more talent than that in which Spears already lacked, but Moore's performance was very moving. Buy the end of the film, I was positively sobbing, I so fully believed Moore's character to be real. This film is for the hopeless romantic in all of us, and also any Mandy Moore fan. I would also recommend this DVD to anyone who ISN'T a Moore fan, so that they could get a different view of her, as music tastes can often get in the way of one's opinion. Any cynics of Shane West are also in for a surprise. Weak as his first main feature, the teen flick, 'Whatever it Takes' was, West makes up for in this sweet movie. This flim seemed a break-through for him to be able to push past the 'teen flick' actor, and I would not be surprised to see both West and Moore in future films - of even less 'teen' origin than 'A Walk to Remember'.Highly recommended with the only warning that it does have a fairly predictable storyline - but the enjoyment in the film is seeing the actors abilities.	5.0	Refreshingly good	2002-07-31	1	1	0

I recently saw Princess Diaries and she was great also as a bad girl. Oh, and Shane West, I already knew he was a good actor, but this was the reaffirmation.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	There really are no spoilers with a Nicholas Sparks film, but I'll yell SPOILERS now in case you, for some strange reason, don't already know how this ends.Nicholas Sparks is one of those cultural phenomenons that I just don't get.  I mean, the man basically writes the same story over and over, changing the names and occasionally the dates and then randomly inserting a different disease or horrific accident here and there (sometimes not even that).  I don't see the fascination with his material because he offers nothing new, ever.  And yet, the man is rich beyond belief because his writing is consistently devoured by middle-aged white women who desperately cling to his faux love stories for emotionally medicinal purposes.  Films are made from his books on a yearly basis (sometimes two or three times a year, considering that he churns out regurgitated fare at a monthly basis almost) and they rake in the dough since they star the latest pair of hot young things to hit the cinematic circuit.  In 2002, before the world went overboard with Sparks, Mandy Moore and Shane West took their places in the adaptation of `A Walk to Remember', the formulaic story of a rebellious `popular' boy who is forced to spend time with the quiet, nerdy, unpopular girl.  They fall in love, obviously...and then she dies.Seriously, we all knew that was coming.One thing that sets this apart from most other films in this genre is that the acting is so pure.  Both Mandy Moore and Shane West deliver performances that feel natural and expected and just beautifully in tune with one another.  The way that Adam Shankman directs these young actors is with simple grace, and while that can at times come across rather boring on screen, it doesn't here.  Like some have already mentioned, there is something appealing about showcasing characters who are respectable and admirable.The film goes where it's expected to, so it's one that you've seen before you've seen it, but it works well for what it is.  Moore is terrific here, and when she uses her pipes (when she sings `Only Hope') she really soars.  This may be typical Sparks fare, but this is one of the best adaptations of his work.I still don't `get him' though.	4.0	Better than it should have been...	2011-10-17	2	1	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A295YBJ2KROL8Q	Andrew Shih	"It is hard to make a PG-rated romance, because you can't simply use sex scenes to show the feelings which the couple has for each other and to imply the degree of intimacy in the relationship.  You can't paint with such broad strokes.  Instead, you must use a narrower brush to depict all the small but significant things which bring the two closer together.  It is also hard to make a movie reflecting traditional Christian values, especially a romance, and yet appeal to a wide audience.  It is problematic to communicate beliefs without being preachy, the only solution being to show through examples rather than to tell through sermons.  A Walk to Remember succeeds in both endeavors and is in my opinion both the best PG-rated romance as well as the closest thing to a Christian film (in mainstream media) in recent memory.  It is truly a breakthrough event.The characters are well-developed, the acting is superb (this is pop singer Mandy Moore's debut BTW), the pacing and picture is perfect, and the soundtrack is great.  But it's the story based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks which will be most remembered.  A note to prospective viewers who may have some misconceptions concerning this film:  This is not a superficial teen romance, nor is it a feel-good romantic comedy.  It is a romance in the classical sense of the word, a serious exploration of the emotional journey experienced by two young people who are truly and deeply in love.Although the stereotypical target audience for this movie may consist of teenage girls from the Bible belt, I am none of the above.  For starters, I am a guy who is not generally into ""chick flicks.""  Of the DVD's in my top twenty collection, only two or three could qualify as such while the rest consist of such ""manly fare"" as ""The Matrix,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""A Better Tomorrow II.""  Additionally, although I am a Christian, I generally stay away from so-called ""Christian music"" and ""Christian movies"" because frankly much of it ... and I suspect that the reason it is labelled or marketted as such is to get people to buy it just because it's ""Christian.""  I like to consider myself as having some independence and objectivity in my assessment of artistic merit.  However, this also means not having a negative bias just because the subject of a movie happens to be a good person, a spiritual person from a Christian background, the minister's daughter.  Anyway, I appreciated this movie tremendously even though I am not part of the ""target audience"" and I believe that I am not alone.  I gave this movie a chance initially because I was seeking diversity and a degree of balance in my DVD collection and I recommend that you all do the same."	5.0	The Best PG-Rated Romance	2002-07-16	8	7	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3ILL5C4WMGULL	Angela	What a surprise! When A Walk to Remember first entered the box offices, i turned my nose up at it. Figuring the movie was another one of the stereo-typical teen movies. Not worth my time and effort.  Even as my friends raced to see it and told me how wonderful the movie was, i found those thoughts difficult to believe. Recently, my best friend convinced me to rent the movie with her since she just couldnt wait to see it anymore. I am so grateful that i deciede to give into the whims of her request. A Walk to Remember turned out to be one of the BEST movies i have seen of all time.  It was good to see a movie that focused on the values and beliefs of a person, with out the usual sex and drugs content. Mandy Moore and Shane West, brilliantly pull off the sweetness and instrigent qualities of Nicholas Sparks book. I would recommend this movie to ANYONE. Even my best friends brother loved it.

I think casting teen icons like Shane West and Mandy Moore was a great idea because they set a good example for teens out there now.  This is the best love story of ""our"" time and it sets excellent examples.  It also should teach guys to go the distance for romance and girls to hold on to that ""flower"" as long as you can because there are guys that will wait.

And of course I cried (and still cry), with almost every scene!  I must admit, there are some cheesey moments to it, (like the dancing on the porch balcony), but that does not bother me one bit.  The story is just so heart warming and inspirational and the perfomances so well done, that this movie has become an all time favorite of mine.

Mandy made a great debut as an actress in this and I can't wait to see her in Try Seventeen. Shane, a great singer and guitarist as well as actor, did a great job playing a tough guy, but a soft sweetie.If you liked this movie, please, check out Life as a House, a movie about a boy and his divorced parents trails and errors over becoming a family again. The boy becomes a druggie but soon learns to love in more ways then one. And check out Life or Something Like It, about a news anchor who finds out her life will soon end and does everything she can to change it. Both movies are funny and some what sad, at least in the first's case.	4.0	Sweetest Teen Love Story	2002-07-04	3	2	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2HXVZDB5Q2SZ6	Bendr1985	Now I'm not a huge chick flick watcher, but this movie is quite an acception. I was with my Grandfather in the Ramada Suites and I was flipping the channels for a good movie to watch. I looked at the TV Guide and saw that &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was on. Now previously my friend Maddie had recommended it to me, during a discussion in English class. Now I usually dont like to watch a movie before I read the book, but I had no time to decide. I just flipped to the channel and began to watch.I began the movie about fifteen minutes in and well from what I gathered there was a cocky badass jock (Shane West) and a pure and good hearted christian girl (Mandy Moore) From what it looked Shane was tired of the same old hotties and preppy girls and was looking for a pure relationship. But then he met a girl (Mandy Moore) and at first Shane West really doesn't think that much of her but as time goes on he begins to like her, but it's the opposite for her she thinks he is a very nice guy who could be a friend but as time goes on she see's him as a little full of himself.Shane West and Mandy Moore star in a play one night where they both share a kiss, where they both realize that they are destined for each other (they dont admit it but they know it) Then when Shane West asks Mandy Moore out, her father who is the Pastor of a church doesn't allow her to date (very typical) But when Shane West asks for permission he changes his mind. As time goes on the couple date and have a few controversial episodes together, but of course they work them out. When it all comes to, Mandy Moore and Shane West get married, but there is one problem. A month before the wedding Mandy Moore confesses that she had been diagnosed with cancer. So, the ending is very sad.I liked this movie because although its typical it is very good. I recommend it to everyone that wants to watch it. It's good for all ages, some innuendo but nothing bad.	5.0	Mandy Moore and Shane West Get Two Thumbs Way Up!	2004-01-15	2	1	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"I've been told that 'A Walk to Remember' should be forgiven for its multitude of faults because a)It has a positive Christian message for teens, and b)It's a 'Chick Flick', and, for some reason, that makes leaps of logic somehow acceptable. Personally, both arguments, to me, demean the groups referred to. A good film stands on its own merits; a bad film, and this one is a stinker, should not be rationalized away by saying it's target audience expects less!'A Walk to Remember' opens with the world's most clean-cut 'gang' of overprivledged kids busting into an abandoned warehouse complex at night (shades of 'Footloose'), then daring a kid as a rite of initiation to dive from a tower into a sinkhole of water (shades of 'Breaking Away'). Conned by the charismatic leader (Shane West), the kid jumps, and is badly injured. Naturally, the police immediately arrive, and West is busted, for staying with the kid. As punishment, he is given probation, community service time...and he has to JOIN the DRAMA CLUB!!! (This is PUNISHMENT for nearing KILLING a kid???) In the Drama Club is school geek and Born-Again Christian Mandy Moore, who you can tell is 'The Good Girl' because she carries a Bible, doesn't wear makeup, and is wardrobe-challenged! From her soulful glances at him, and his arrogant smile in reply, you know that True Love is only a few plot-twists away. It takes Opening Night to provide the catalyst, though...apparently, this club doesn't believe in dress rehearsals, because when she walks onstage, in makeup, and a slinky dress with no underwear (one wonders how her minister father approved of THAT!), and sings to West, as the male lead (yes, despite having no acting ability, or experience, he gets the lead in the play), he sees how hot she is for the first time, and falls for her.She warns him NOT to fall in love with her (ah, could there be a secret she's not sharing? DUH!), but he follows her around, anyway, even to the cemetery where she stargazes with her telescope at night. (This sets up one of the most brain-dead scenes of the film; he asks to see Pluto, to which she replies that it doesn't rise until two hours before sunrise. ""I'll wait"", he says...In reality, Pluto is impossible to see in a small telescope...it wasn't even discovered until 1930, in an amazing piece of detective work...and this supposedly brilliant astronomy hobbyist doesn't know this??? As a Born-Again Christian, you KNOW she wasn't fibbing to get a night alone with West...or was she?)Eventually, Moore collapses, and it is revealed she is dying of cancer (shades of 'Here on Earth'), and, on her deathbed in the hospital, West proposes to her. His estranged doctor father pays to get her Home Care, for her last days...and the next scene, the couple are walking through the woods together, with Moore looking better than ever! (I believe in Love's healing powers, but this is a stretch, even for me!) The couple marry, and share a Summer of Love, before she finally dies (shades of 'Love Story'), and he, redeemed, goes on to ace Medical School (shades of 'Magnificent Obsession').The acting is uneven, at best; Shane West does a credible job, certainly better than Chris Klein did in the 'Walk' clone, 'Here on Earth'. Peter Coyote, as Moore's minister father, does what he can in a role that seems to have been 'lifted' from John Lithgow's in 'Footloose'. Daryl Hannah, nearly unrecognizable with dark hair, is quite good as West's mother. But the rave reviews Mandy Moore has received as the dying girl seem unjustified; no makeup and stilted line readings do NOT equal a great performance! In order for a film like this to work, you must believe the heroine, and the bittersweet nature of her love. I never got beyond the 'golly, look, Mandy Moore is acting' stage, and her delivery often had me wincing!There ARE some great tearjerkers out there, both classic and contemporary...'A Walk to Remember' is just NOT one of them!"	2.0	Squeaky Clean Does NOT Equal Good!	2002-08-29	5	0	5

I watched it once. Nice, but not moving. Classical teen outcast wants to date the Reverend's daughter. (ho-hum) - a lot of drama could have added to these particular scenes and made the movie at least a bit tense, but this did not happen. So, if you buy this DVD, perhaps your teen will like it. As an adult, skip it, not worth the money and it will keep you yawning. The ending is predictable, the actors/actresses ok but nothing to rave about, and it seems to go slow, as boring movies I guess can do.  Truly sappy. Mushy. Cornball.

Before I saw this movie, I used to despise Mandy Moore, but she portrays Jamie perfectly. Shane West is an amazing young actor, and I look forward to seeing a lot more of him.

Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy turns his life around and has life-changing experiences because of girl.  Sound familiar?  It's only been done about a million times.  This is as cliche as it gets.The story is incredibly weak.  The characters love each other, hate each other, and love each other again from one scene to the next.  The plot is very, very flimsy to say the least.  Oh, and the acting is horrendous.  Even the high school play didn't look acted well enough to have been real.Like I said, the plot is weak, but at least there is a good moral to the story, and at least it's clean.  It has a touching ending, with everyone loving each other and living in perfect harmony, but that just isn't enough for me.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AE5F46Q10VPCE	Bob Martinez	My daughter turned me on to this movie last week.  Even though, this is will prove to be one of the all-time Kleenex sellers, it is uplifting and has a &quot;feel good&quot; aura about it.  Mindy Moore and Shane West were superb.  But the beautiful message of this film is that It is better to have loved than never to have loved at all.  It proves that Love is the most powerful emotion of them all and goes on forever in those we touch and can change lives on a spiritual basis.  The emotional depth of this movie is deep and fulfilling.  I'm a 57-year old guy, not easily impressed anymore.  But this movie more than any other  captured the feeling of being young, and in love , including Love Story in 1970.A beautiful story, beautifully done, and the closest expression I've ever seen to &quot;the meaning of life&quot;.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A27SD1RM9JX2PL	Brad Caswell	A Walk to Remember is a pleasant uplifting film based on a small book of the same qualities.  If you've read the book, the film first may disappoint, but it captures the author's intentions and firmly stands on its own as a fine piece of work. Mostly why you want to view this film a multiple of times is the performance of Mandy Moore.  She is truly a gifted actress. At first I wasn't even conscious of her acting, her skill being so great that the author's imagined character, Jamie Sullivan, seemed simply to have come to life. Mandy has a lovely singing voice too. But she also has what I call &quot;stage magic&quot;. Watching her face when she says her lines reveals a multitude of expressions that convey her portrayed emotions with certainty. You can turn off the audio and still understand her meaning. Its like magic - you can't take your eyes off her and she is the focus of any scene she appears in. There are very few actors with this quality, and she has it in spades! People will remember this film as her launching pad to fame in films and Broadway musicals.	5.0	Gifted actress with &quot;stage magic&quot;	2003-05-01	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A28HB1CS21SRDU	canopy	Two teenagers falling in love in high school may have people write it off as another teen flick but I thought the teenage factor was a necessary element if not an advantage in the story-telling.  If you can remember that far back, when you fall in love as a teenager it's a crystal pure love with a lot less complications.  The two actors of the movie capture that so well which I believe is one of the successes of this film.Shane West - I'm now a fan.  I have not heard of this actor before, but his portrayal of Landon and his tranformation from a bad boy to a boy in love is satisfyingly accurate.  Mandy Moore - a rare breed in Hollywood - beautiful and sexy with a wholesome image.  I was aware that she received a lot of credit as an actress in this movie (which was one of the reasons why I wanted to see the film) but I was surprised at how she was able to carry the film with such ease.Honestly, I am not a fan of Nicholas Sparks - his novels or adapted films.  I am not going to say that this one was an exception.  The movie still had sappy lines, unrealistic plot, and unconvincing elements to it.  But I give it five stars for successfully sucking me, a non-Sparks fan, into the movie.  And as someone who loves, just looooves, romance movies I could not dismiss the brilliant chemistry of the love story with less than five stars.  I would be dishonoring my integrity as a professional romance movie-ist.  :)	5.0	From a profesional romance movie-ist	2006-08-18	7	7	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3TX85VR4JT858	Carlos Enrique Fox	Don't get mad at me for saying this, but I got suckered into watching this DVD by my wife and daughter.  By the end of the movie, I was glad that the lights were out in our den so that they couldn't see the water in my eyes.  It's a surprisingly moving and affecting story, thanks in large part to the outstanding performance of Mandy Moore.  Unlike her terrible, cliched, and hostile role in the movie SAVED, this movie is a vehicle for Moore to portray a Christian young lady in a positive light.  Peter Coyote as Moore's father gives a restrained but powerful performance that left a lump in my throat. This is a great family viewing experience that isn't corny but is packed with drama and reward.	4.0	Suprisingly moving	2004-11-22	4	3	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	APXZRLC8LO165	Carly	"Yes, I love this movie. I love the acting, the sincere storyline, and the courageous separation from the typical teen movie formula. In today's world, this is exactly what people need to watch, especially young people. And it was released in theaters just a few short months after September 11; a better time could not have been picked.It is a simple yet beautiful plot that takes a risk and goes straight to your heart, even through its own cliches: Landon Carter, the big shot high school senior hangs out with the wrong people, gets into trouble, and eventually falls for Jamie Sullivan, the purehearted, sweet, beautiful, and talented daughter of the local minister. When they take the time to truly go that extra mile and understand each other, the uncertain friendship forms into the kind of loving and trusting bond that all of us dream about. They would do anything for each other; they're happy together. Oh, but there's a catch. There always is. They form a relationship that not even tragedy can break....and that is certainly proven by the end of the film.This is the kind of romantic plot that too many teen movies push down into darkness with sex, drugs, and drinking. The media has done this so much that some of us actually forget that Landon and Jamie's love is not all that unrealistic. I think this is why so many critics out there are not even looking at this movie the way it should be; Landon and Jamie are role models to admire, and if you are willing to overlook the beauty and innocence of this film and dismiss it as a corny and unrealistic view of teenage romance, then you need to sit down and look again.I am inspired by the love story presented in ""A Walk to Remember."" I used to watch it and be lost in any attempt I could ever make in finding something wrong with it. After seeing it for at LEAST 15 times now (no joke), I will admit that it could have been made a little more realistic if the film was longer. Yes, many of us agree that this is a tearjerker of a romance between the two main characters, but doesn't it all happen just a little too fast? One minute, Landon is looking at Jamie in a totally discriminating light, laughing at her and assisting in making her the butt of jokes; then, all of a sudden, he's punching his best friend in the face for her. I have noticed that even when Landon was caught in the bad crowd, he seemed to be somewhat distant and not as bad as you think he is; still, I think the movie needed a little something more to make Landon's transformation a little more convincing.Then you've got the school situation. I'd love to see a school like the one in this movie in real life. A huge fight goes on in the lunchroom....and it seems that there are no teachers or adults around to break it up. Twice, Landon and Jamie jump in their cars and leave during school hours. This is an aspect of the film that always bugs me....they needed to focus on that a little  more to help the whole movie make sense.However, these are only minor setbacks that many of us are willing to look past because the loving and outstanding love story makes it all worthwhile. Mandy Moore and Shane West have VERY difficult roles to play, and they pull it off well. They have excellent chemistry, and not all on-screen couples do. It's a great movie that certainly deserved a better DVD--the commentaries were awesome, but what about all the deleted scenes? Apparently, there was a pretty good handful of those.... I would have loved to see them. Regardless, this movie just isn't one to ignore; buy it, rent it, do whatever you need to do to see it. You don't have to like it, but we can all at least walk away with a positive lesson from it."	4.0	a beautiful, beautiful movie, but....	2002-12-17	0	0	0

The reviews I read were incorrect in that the movie was not sweet but rather blasphemous to the Mother of God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, used inappropriate language along with much immodessty in clothing. One may believe that such is needed to emphasize the Bad character of the ""tramp"" in the movie. This is not true for the movie ""Belle and the Beast"" a Christian Romance does it quite well. One does not need to blaspheme God and His Mother to make a point nor use such words which I would never let my children speak. Why this movie was ever put into the kid and family section I cannot comprehend.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1C5KB7EJYT8Q9	"""c_e_l_e_b_r_i_t_y"""	A Walk To Remember is hardly original. It offers no special effects, no big named Hollywood celebrities and didn't cost alot of money to make. Yet those facts which might make one hesitate to watch the film is the very thing that makes this movie such a winner. Singer Mandy Moore stars as Jamie, a young girl who's confident in her own simplicity yet is teased by the popular kids in school. Landon, played by Shane West, is one of the popular kids who gets himself in trouble and needs Jamie's assistance to help him with the school play he must be in or he'll get thrown out of school. Opening his eyes to a different world, Landon begins to see that everything he knew before he met Jamie doesn't matter anymore and true beauty lies deep within the heart. All very predictable and drowning in sappiness, this movie was such a hit due to it's irresistible charms and like Moore's character Jamie, it's confidence and well awareness of how important it is in today's society not to lose your morals and not to lose yourself when others want you to change. It's very well acted with a light story that will tug on your heart a time or two and this is one walk you will remember for quite some time. The DVD features are quite nice with a music video of Mandy Moore's hit song Cry. behind the scenes featurettes and two audio commentaries; one which featurs the stars of the movie.	3.0	Worth Remembering	2002-07-14	8	7	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2AXATITHCK1X3	C. Eshelman	This is one of my favorite movies.  It's a great drama and love story.  Watching these two different people come together and fall in love is very inspiring because they teach each other so much.  Landon takes life more serious because of Jamie and becomes more of a responsible person.  Jamie learns how selfless he becomes.  Watching their transformations is exhilarating.  I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection because it shows that people's dreams can come true.  It's romantic, spiritual, full of drama and it left me with a feeling of peace at the end.	5.0	A Walk  To Remember	2007-12-02	3	2	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AIYXDS2TP47W8	C. Gentile	...So reads the review on the front cover of the DVD.  This could not be said any better.  I have never seen a movie like this, one that touched me when I least expected it.  Honestly, I never even wanted to see it when it was in theaters, I just rented it one night for something to do.  I am so glad I did.Since every other reviewer has included a synopsis, I won't do so again.The amazing performances take this film from beautiful to remarkable.  Shane West plays Landon in a way that does not make you question his character's transition at all.  It is so subtle and gradual, which makes it so believable.  And Mandy Moore is simply wonderful.  She plays Jamie as a sweet and innocent girl, without her being stereotypical.  She has that naive quality where she sees the good in people, but she is not one-dimentional, either.  She is not perfect, and Mandy really captures that spirit.  You can see the simplicity in her, but you can also sense the mystery.  Both actors get a huge A+ from me.I just can't stress enough how wonderful this film really is.  It teaches you about life and what should be truly important to you without shoving these things down your throat.  It is so simple, yet so wonderfully told.  Adam Shankman's directing was wonderful.  The other brilliant thing is the soundtrack.  It ties the film together so well, and I can't listen to it without picturing scenes from the movie.All in all, it is a film that must not be missed.  It is one of those movies that you want to see it again as soon as the credits start rolling.  You walk away in tears, but at the same time feel uplifted.  I have never felt like this after a film, and I get the same feeling even today, after countless viewings.  I don't think I will ever get tired of it, it is my favorite movie.  So do not pass this up because it isn't the book or because Mandy Moore is in it or you think it will be rubbish.  Don't make the same mistake I almost did.  Watch it, and you will understand the feeling I was trying to put into words.	5.0	"""Mandy Moore is Amazing...."""	2006-06-05	2	2	0

I will give mako4509g1g23 credit that the book and the movie was somewhat diffrent but in the movie it had great parts that the book didnt. Like when landon gives jaime all of her wishes (like being in two places at one time). That is a great part that wasnt in the book. And i just want to give Nicholas Sparks some credit that man can make a girl cry (which isn't that hard) but he can make the tears flow down on men too. When i saw this movie i bet there were more men than woman crying. But this movie is recomended for everyone and it is a trly 5 star movie	5.0	ThE BeSt EvEr	2002-06-22	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AAK5DX75GH8IW	Chad Follick	If you like romances, then you should definetely buy this movie. This is not a regular romance though. I am not a big fan on romances, but anyone who watches this and thinks it's bad is crazy! It is about a high school kid who has to play in a play at school because he was caught drinking on school grounds. Well, anyway, he has trouble with his lines and he needs a little help learning them. He goes straight to the girl who has no trouble learning her lines. Before they can do anything, though, he has to promise NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. Well, you can pretty much guess he does. But, she tells him not to fall in love with her because an unexpected incident takes place. Mandy Moore and Shane West play a break through performance in this ROMANCE/DRAMA. It is such a good movie you will watch it over and over again.	5.0	Good Romance	2003-04-19	2	2	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3K8POFWCQI2GS	Char	"Focusing eventually on the relationship between two teens who have the courage to stand out among their peers, this story opens onto the scene of a typical late-night daring teen adventure which ends in tragedy.  The scene sets the movie's theme which pertains to the antithesis of true friendship and love--relationships of supposed ""friendship"" that take place in the midst of cruel mockery in a crowd that sets itself up in brutal superiority.  These contemporary young people live a life based on almost incredible (to me) unkindness and treachery.  But the story is about how true love and friendship do grow into fruition, chiefly because of the courage of one person of strong faith.So this is a movie about going through really just the usual PAIN that many young people experience during the teen school years.  Although the story isn't about the phenomenon of bullying in schools, it could be viewed in the context of  a concern about bullying.  At this point in life where they have begun the growth process of becoming mature adults, the major characters live in imperfect, non-ideal situations of family life.  Their parents are going through some of the emotional struggles of typical modern adulthood.I found the early scenes about ugly teen behavior and the raucous teen music that pervaded them hard to stomach, but the rough music was relieved by moments of more harmonious music that promised better things to come.  Although repulsed during maybe the first third of the movie, I ""hung in there.""  And was glad that I did because the story turned out to be about a beautiful awakening to true love, capable of bearing sacrifice.  And despite unhappiness and imperfect circumstances in the characters' lives, the story conveyed a very enCOURAGing, STRENGTHening message about  love and life.Even though the movie was put out by Warner Bros. in 2002, obvious references to Christian love were inextricably woven into the story.  This is definitely and deliberately a movie that upholds Christian ideals of love.  It's excellent and deeply affective although it contains some heart-break and unpleasantness (as expressed in the unkindness of the teens).  I found the VHS tape in a rummage sale and had never heard of this movie or the actors in it, but, from the brief summary of its plot on the cover, it sounded interesting and I took it home.I see from the numbers of reviews, nearly a thousand (!), that this was a very popular and well-loved movie despite the Christian content.  (Maybe movie-makers should take that ""message"" into great consideration.)  For anyone who likes Christian references in a story, or who at least tolerates them well, this is a really good movie.  (Just keep your volume control handy and turn down any music you find unbearable.)  I highly recommend this as a good and edifying movie for the moments when you want to relax but with some meaningful and uplifting content in your entertainment.  (You will probably cry during the last scenes.)This movie would be interesting and suitable for teenagers and adults."	5.0	Vicious teen peerage, one person's courage to be different, fruition of real friendship and love.	2013-04-19	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AB34G6VKP28L	"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic"""	"I know a lot of people pick on this film merely because it's not the usual lame sex-obsessed crude-joke-filled and corny trash that is constantly fed into the minds of teenagers. But actually, ""A Walk to Remember"" is a great film beyond its acceptability for most audiences -- Christian or secular. The reasons why this film are so special is that love is treated in the way that it should be... a willingness to love even if you know that you will be hurt. When it first came out, I had no interest in seeing it... but I went along to a showing and was captivated. I didn't know Hollywood had the intelligence to make this kind of movie any longer!By now everyone knows the plot... it's about a wild child, Landon Carter, who gets into trouble for endangering the life of another student and drinking on school grounds. He's turned over to the principle, who informs him he must tutor underprivileged children on weekends, help the janitor after school, and participate in the annual spring play. Reluctantly, Landon accepts his punishment and is thrown in with a group of hopeful thespians, the most memorable of which being Jamie Sullivan, the local Bible-carrying minister's daughter. Since Landon is terrible at acting, and Jamie seems to have it altogether, he asks for help, despite her father's loathing of him.The two go through the ups and downs of attraction, and that's when  it really gets good, on an emotional level as well as visually. I loved seeing the changes in not only Landon, but Jamie as well. Landon becomes entirely unselfish and giving of himself... his soul desire through the last half is to make Jamie happy. It's a lesson in agape love that everyone needs. (I had at least two of my guy friends see this and totally get a new perspective on how they should treat their girlfriends.) And Jamie loosens up... she even wears a pair of jeans at one point and leaves her hair down. The scene in the middle of the highway will bring tears of joy to your eyes, since it's such an emotional ""wow"" that someone could do something so loving for you.The music is also great, particularly the ""Only Hope"" sequence sung by Jamie (Mandy Moore) in the school play. That has to be one of the most gorgeous musical cuts I've ever seen on film... the images become a part of the music. I also appreciate the respect for Christianity shown by the characters; Jamie's father, the pastor, as well as Jamie herself, help break out of that stereotyped gay-loathing, Bible-hugging ""religious"" people mentality. It's a beautiful film, a gorgeous screenplay (the dialogue is so meaningful it's amazing) and tackles an emotional high with just the right level of good humor. I've reccomended it to all of my friends, and I would to you, as well.On the DVD:The picture and sound quality are beautiful; the textures and colors blend seamlessly to create something lovely to look at. The director's gorgeous cinematography is well-used in this edition, which is sadly under-pushed and without goodies. I would have appreciated a featurette or two, although there are two full-length commentaries, Mandy Moore's ""Cry"" music video, and a trailer. I didn't particularly like some of the comments made by the director on his commentary, which reference a raunchier version originally planned, and talks about some of the ways in which they knocked it from the targeted PG13 to a PG rating. (Why did I have to know that? Why can't I just respect him for making a clean teen flick?) But the movie itself, and the well-cut trailer, are exceptional in quality."	5.0	Jamie's Miracle Belongs to Us All	2002-07-18	7	6	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AQHH81ZOPJJMM	Charles Geary	This is a very well told story that is inspiring in its scope of peer pressure and courage to be the one who stands for good under pressure. Belief in another person that is communicated honestly changes lives. I faced that as a grade schooler and in high school and one student put in to words belief in my chance at success. That friend did not die in my story but another one did. This movie spoke to my heart and expressing belief in another person a great benefit. The only part of the movie i did not like was the bad language. All of those ideas could have been communicated in words that are not offensive. Those who believe they are necessary to communication lack in moral fiber. Mandy Moor and her co star did a good job making this a very believable story.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AKVU4HUG6AN1U	"""chick_flick"""	"""A Walk To Remember"" is so much more than just your average teen flick. It is a film based on the bestselling book by Nicholas Sparks, and is about two very different teenagers who unexpectedly fall in love. Landon Carter (Shane West) is your typical ""bad-boy-next-door"". He's popular and has a lot of friends. But when he gets into trouble one too many times, Landon's high school principal makes him participate in the school play and help tutor children with learning disabilities on the weekends. On the other hand, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the sweet, kind, religious girl who lives with her widowed minster father and is always being made fun of by her classmates. Landon and Jamie had known each other all their lives, but Landon doesn't expect to fall in love with her during the school play's opening night. It takes a little while, but their love soon begins to blossom. As Landon is starting to learn about love, life, and himself, Jamie confesses a secret she's been keeping from him that might destroy their relationship forever.The film was simply moving and touching. West and Moore have amazing on-screen chemistry and their talents really shine. The supporting cast was also excellent. There is a wonderful storyline and smart dialouge. Hardly any violence, very mild language, and no sex makes this viewable to basically all ages. The DVD is all right, but it could have add a few more extras. It only includes 2 commentaries (one by the director, and one by West and Moore) and Mandy Moore's music video, ""Cry"". The DVD is available in widescreen format. I gave this film a score of 98 out of 100 points because it didn't follow the book as well as it could have, but it was just a really beautiful movie anyway.I highly recommend ""A Walk To Remember"".Score:98/100A+"	5.0	Take a walk down memory laine.	2002-09-27	12	11	1

I wasn't impressed with the book, either, but the way the movie just took an idea or two out of the book and left anything even remotely good out of it is just plain wrong. ""Based on the novel"" is saying it in the loosest of terms.Acting is downright horrible, and the essence of the characters from the book is completely missing. Modernizing the story probably did more harm than good to the movie, as the story is about the simplicity and the power of love, which can't be portrayed with today's problems of the youth.Simply put, it is a bad movie, and that's two hours of my life I will never get back."	1.0	waste of time and money	2008-07-04	16	2	14

A friend rented it left it at my house?  who the heck knows, but it was there and I was bored so I popped it in the VCR.  All I can say Is ""If this is love then pour me another glass""(watch movie to get reference). I own it now and have watched it god knows how many times.  I love it, and bear in mind my other favorite movies are The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and Memento.so whats good about it?  First off the acting is above average in general, and incredible when considering that teen movies usually consist of subpar performances.  Shane West is really talented, and played as good of a blown out of proportion Backstreetboyesque(its a word I swear) villain in ""Get Over it"" as he plays a bad boy with a good heart in this movie.  The transformation is somewhat believable(more than it would usually be)  in the beginning you get the feeling he doesnt actually like being a jerk, and his nasty friends force him to choose(as is realistic)to change.  As for Mandy Moore, believe it or not she fits the role of Hollywood's favorite romance cliche known as ""The Pretty Ugly Girl""  better than its ever been done before.  She's pretty cute at the beginning of the movie with baggy dresses and scant makeup, and what do ya know in her last scenes she is still pretty cute-- why?  because she dresses just like she did at the beginning.  Yup she doesnt take off her glasses or get a makeover or buy hip clothes or trade in her bible for a copy of Vogue -- she doesnt need to change, astonishingly enough she likes who she is the way she is !  whodathunk?I warn you though once this movie sucks you in(and unless you are totally immune to sentimentality you almost certainly will be) they throw every piece of cheese from the dairy at you and then some.  If the fact that they are purposefully trying to get you  to go for the kleenex box annoys you, or you are a guy petrified of having teary eyes over a teen movie, by all means stay away.

Something I believe we all wish the movie had. Didn't any one think the 'love' Landon developed for Jamie was rushed? It was like after he saw her in the play, he went ""Oh she's hot, I like!"" Hmmm...I wished they had more touching moments and a gradual liking that would then lead to love, but that would have made the movie too long/sappy. Read the book if you loved the story!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1YNN6VT7RD858	CJ	"""A Walk to Remember "" is not your typical teen movie.  Based on the best-selling novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks, ""A Walk to Remember"" tells the bittersweet story of first love with a maturity not often found in adult on-screen relationships.  The compelling screen presence of the film's leads, Mandy Moore and Shane West, is a result of the charisma and chemistry between the actors.The film opens in Beaufort, North Carolina, with a tense scene at the town's cement factory.  West's character, wealthy and popular Landon Carter, and his group of ""friends"" dare a wanna-be clique member to jump from a platform into the murky water below.  The diver is injured and Landon is left alone to suffer the consequences after a failed attempt at escape.  Landon's punishment for the accident is far from hard time.  He is ordered to tutor children on weekends, and, strangely enough, forced to participate in the school's annual musical.  This is all in hope that exposure to other activities will help Landon reform his rebellious ways.  The authorities, of course, never take into consideration that his rebellion may be a result of a lack of male role model in his life.  His father, a cardiologist, is not an active part of Landon's life since divorcing Landon's mother.It is during rehearsals that Landon is ""introduced"" to Moore's character, Jamie Sullivan, despite having known her his entire life.  Jamie is the motherless daughter of Beaufort's Baptist minister.  Dressed in horribly outdated clothing without a speck of make-up, and entirely unafraid to express her faith, Jamie is hardly the type of girl ultra-cool Landon would associate with by choice.  Jamie even tutors for fun-imagine that!Landon finds himself spending more and more time with Jamie outside of school.  During school hours, however, Landon must keep his distance in order to save his reputation.  It is at opening night of the school play when Landon sees Jamie in a whole new light; okay, let's be honest-it had to be the dress.  It also could have been Jamie's mesmerizing, angelic sounding solo.  Jamie's physical transformation helps Landon become aware of the new feelings Jamie stirs inside him.  This may sound superficial, but, strangely enough, it's not portrayed as such.  Jamie's wardrobe improvements don't last through the night, but Landon's feelings persist.  He even finds himself defending her honour in the school cafeteria-something his ""friends"" are unlikely to let him live down.Gradually the two find themselves falling in love, despite Jamie's initial insistence that Landon not fall for her.  Each opens up the other's world to new experiences.  At this point in the film you know that such sweet happiness cannot last.  You can sense tragedy waiting without knowing why you feel that way.  While watching the film you yearn for a happy ending while thinking, at the same time, the film wouldn't be complete with one.The tear-jerking curve ball is certainly typical of author Nicholas Sparks.  While screenwriter Karen Janszen doesn't follow the novel exactly, the audience is able to understand the basic story.  Adam Shankman, who also directed last year's big screen blockbuster ""The Wedding Planner,"" starring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, directs the pair to an outstanding performance.  The supporting roles of Landon's mother, played by a horribly brunette Darryl Hannah, and Peter Coyote's role of Reverend Sullivan add familliarity to a talented, young cast.My verdict: if you're looking for an action-packed thriller, don't go see this film.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a wonderfully heart-warming story or, if you're a parent whose kids are looking to see a flick, this is the film to choose.  In the often less than G-rated Hollywood film industry, ""A Walk to Remember"" is truly a gem.  My advice: bring tissues; ""A Walk to Remember"" isn't easy to forget.  Its effects will last beyond the closing credits."	5.0	Unlikely to forget &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;	2002-08-16	5	4	1

The town bad boy breaks away from peer pressure when he is befriended by the minister's daughter who everyone makes fun of. The story shows how every person you meet can change and influence you.Landon and Jamie are an unlikely pair, but when they are forced to interact in a school play and tutoring disadvantaged children, they saw past the labels and into the inner person. Their romance is sweet and beautiful, but turns poignant and sad. Based on a Nicholas Sparks book, you can guess what the nature of the tragedy is. The story has a heartwarming ending because Jamie's love changes many people, Landon, her father, and even brings the bullies around.	5.0	Sweet romance and uplifting coming-of-age story	2013-11-07	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2RAJ0QJYQ1CGY	Colin	"Now I'm not a huge chick flick watcher, but this movie is quite an acception. I was with my Grandfather in the Ramada Suites and I was flipping the channels for a good movie to watch. I looked at the TV Guide and saw that ""A Walk to Remember"" was on. Now previously my friend Maddie had recommended it to me, during a discussion in English class. Now I usually dont like to watch a movie before I read the book, but I had no time to decide. I just flipped to the channel and began to watch.I began the movie about fifteen minutes in and well from what I gathered there was a cocky badass jock (Shane West) and a pure and good hearted christian girl (Mandy Moore) From what it looked Shane was tired of the same old  hotties and preppy girls and was looking for a pure relationship. But then he met a girl (Mandy Moore) and at first Shane West really doesn't think that much of her but as time goes on he begins to like her, but it's the opposite for her she thinks he is a very nice guy who could be a friend but as time goes on she see's him as a little full of himself.Shane West and Mandy Moore star in a play one night where they both share a kiss, where they both realize that they are destined for each other (they dont admit it but they know it) Then when Shane West asks Mandy Moore out, her father  who is the Pastor of a church doesn't allow her to date (very typical) But when Shane West asks for permission he changes his mind. As time goes on the couple date and have a few controversial episodes together, but of course they work them out. When it all comes to, Mandy Moore and Shane West get married, but there is one problem. A month before the wedding Mandy Moore confesses that she had been diagnosed with cancer. So, the ending is very sad.I liked this movie because although its typical it is very good. I recommend it to everyone that wants to watch it. It's good for all ages, some innuendo but nothing bad."	5.0	This Chick Flick Isn't Just For Girls!	2004-01-14	1	1	0

But do to Landon's(West) bad behavior, they are forced to be together.  Many things attribute to them coming together.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	"I have read Spark's book, ""A Walk To Remember"" which was extremely sweet and touching. But as usual I had doubts about the movie released upon the same name staring Shane West and Mandy Moore. Landon Carter (West) is the popular high school bad boy. He is punished after commiting a dangerous stunt and forced to join the school play and comes upon Jamie Sullivan (Moore) the girl who has been in all of his classes for years and has been the target of pranks and put-downs for much of her life. She is also the local preacher's (Peter Coyote) daughter. At first, he is resentful of her coming up to him, but he soon finds himself asking her for help with his lines in the play.Landon soon falls hopelessly in love with Jamie (don't blame him), something he thought impossible. As you watch their relationship blossom throughout the movie, your own feelings are inextricably linked and you find yourself cheering the couple on, marveling at their sweet times spent together and secretly envious of the intense love that they have discovered. Jamie is so incredibly pure and unselfish that she had my heart fluttering by the end of the movie.The movie benefits greatly from its two talented leads, Moore and West, who prove their acting worth with great performances. Moore lends her character a huge amount of depth and surrounds her with an innocent, heartwarming aura, so much so that by the end of the movie, she can do no wrong. This movie isn't like other teen movies, it has a heart and it's ending will no doubt bring you to tears."	5.0	Sweet as can be	2009-07-30	3	2	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2W0SHGPT7O0OI	"""critic_2000"""	"""A Walk to Remember"" is truly a beautiful, touching film. It's based on the wonderful novel by Nicholas Sparks. In ""A Walk to Remember"", Shane West stars as your typical high school teenage bad boy, Landon Carter, with very low expectations for his life and future, and a troubled family situation. Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, who is just the opposite. She is the daughter of the town's minister. Very religious, sweet, and always kind to everybody. When Landon gets busted drinking, his school principal forces him into participating in the school play...the same play Jamie is in. During the performance, Landon falls for Jamie, and tries to get Jamie to go out with him. As their love blossoms, Jamie finally confesses her true feelings for Landon, but she also has a terrible secret that could ruin their relationship forever.Mandy Moore and Shane West have amazing chemistry, and that's really what pulls the film together. Superb acting from the entire cast, and a great storyline. There is no sex in this film and very mild language and violence, so it is a fine movie to see by the entire family. The DVD extras include 2 commentaries, cast film highlights, theatrical trailer, and the music video for Mandy Moore's song, ""Cry"".I highly recommend this film to everybody, but especially teeangers.Final Grade: A+"	5.0	An inspirational teen film with a religious feel to it.	2002-09-19	5	5	0

This movie is all about faith,hope,finding one's self and most importantly, love. As punishment when a prank goes wrong Landon Carter (Shane West)is forced into taking a part in the school play and giving up his weekends to tutor a student. All of which bring him into contact with the reverend's daughter Jamie (Mandy Moore). Jamie Sullivan is not your normal average teenager. She is always seen with a bible in her hand, and could care less what anyone thinks about her. Landon soon realizes he is in over his head, and asks Jamie to help him rehearse his lines for the school play. After spending time with Jamie, Landon soon finds out that Jamie isn't as weird as everybody claims she is. Soon the two find themselves falling in love with each other, but what Landon doesn't know is that Jamie has a secret. A secret that changes Landon's life forever. The ending is so bittersweet, and it reminds you that life throws you curve balls every now and than. It's what you do with them that counts.	5.0	a movie worth remembering!	2003-07-12	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"I am probably the biggest anti-teen movie critic out there. From American Pie, to Scary Movie, to the horrid She's all that, I hate teen movies, usually because they try to be cute, and funny when they're really not. It's amazing to think that I was 18 only four years ago, and four years ago I probably would have had a completely different out look on teen movies. It is with the anti-teen movie mindset that I set out to avoid this movie like a plague despite my sisters begging me to see it.Now that it came to DVD, and my sister wanted me to see it so bad she bought it just so I could see it I felt obligated to watch this movie. To be honest I'm pretty hard to get emotional with a movie, but this film nearly succeeded in making me cry. It was so very good that I've picked up my own copy, the first ever-teen movie to be added to my 200 plus DVD collection, and thus somewhat of a milestone for me.Although the film does follow some stereotypes of a romance story I noticed the ""jerk goes nice guy"" but was the only stereotypical element of this story, and even though Landen (West) was a complete jerk at first he was still somewhat likeable. Me? I would have been Chasing Jamie (Subtle movie reference, sorry) from the get go because she was a very loveable character from the beginning. Normal, not a super model like what is normal of romance films, just a cute girl next-door type.Another aspect of this film that I liked is its refusal to divulge into inappropriate content. Jamie (Moore) starts the movie out as a faithful religious girl and ends the movie the same way, unlike other films I've seen, many of which featuring the exact opposite of this character, the ""good girl gone bad"" routine is tiresome, but nowhere in this film.Language is clean, characters down to earth and normal, with everything about this story seeming much more realistic, and much less superficial than many romance movies I have suffered through. I'm not a fan of romance movies as they are often formulaic, and stale, but this was definitely a huge breath of fresh air to the genre, as it is definitely a beautiful movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Plus it's made a Mandy fan of me. Now to hunt down the rest of her CDs..."	5.0	Finally, an enjoyable teen movie!	2002-08-15	8	7	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A31LHED3SKLWVB	Darren	Ultimate girls' fantasy about taming the Boy from the Wrong Side of the Tracks ... except that Shane West isn't really from the wrong side of the tracks or anywhere near any tracks, actually.  As in all of Nicholas Sparks' fictions, everyone lives in genteel small-city/large-town America and is quite well-to-do.  Our hero starts off playing stupid practical jokes on people and getting them hurt, and ends up becoming a saint thanks to Mandy Moore, who plays the daughter of the widowed town reverend (Peter Coyote, really slumming it here).  She's deeply Christian, which is the only interesting thing about her, considering that almost all lead characters in mainstream movie fare are non-demoninational and yet not even atheist.  Her hobbies are astrology (to counter the Christian thing, perhaps?) and singing in a bland R&B; style like a modern diva.  She wears sweaters borrowed from the Little House on the Prairie props department.  She's not allowed to date boys.  In the first hour it all seems like &#34;Footloose&#34; -- one expects Coyote to bark from his pulpit, &#34;NO DANCING ALLOWED!&#34;  But I won't go into the particulars of the plot, because there's a Big Reveal at the end of the second act which you should see coming a mile away.  Put it this way: if you're old enough to remember &#34;Love Story&#34;, you'll know what happens.Sometimes I'm surprised by a movie, which is a really cool thing, so I gave this a chance because it has been sitting free on Prime for some time, and I do recall some generally positive reviews for it from critics.  I cannot think why.  Unless you're the target demographic, and I'm not sure precisely who that might be, as it's not really fun enough for kids and it's a little *too much* for the older set (or it should be), I think you'll be embarrassed by its shameless heart-tugging and tear-jerking.  But a demographic there most definitely is for Mr. Sparks, whomever they are out there: his books sell by the millions and several of them have been made into glossy motion pictures.  At least this one is about teenagers, thus making Sparks' gooey earnestness somewhat easier to take.  First love is by definition gooey and earnest.  Problem is, Sparks seems to apply these adolescent fantasies about noble suffering in love to all his characters and situations, and in my opinion it doesn't wear very well on people in middle-age, like, say, Kevin Costner and Robin Wright.  Frankly, I'm not sure it wears so well on the kids here, either.  Shane West is a fantasy construct, and is never believable, both when he's a &#34;bad boy&#34; and when he later becomes the Most Perfect Boy Ever.  Regardless of the manifestation, West applies the same formula throughout: he preens, he pouts, he frowns, he occasionally cries.  What he doesn't do is convince us that he's a young man going through a major transition.  He makes Moore look like Meryl Streep by comparison.  Speaking of Moore, her character is also a fantasy construct of a writer who must have spent a great deal of time in his own adolescence building the Perfect Girl in own doubtlessly overactive imagination, an imagination that has nonetheless paid off for him in silver dollars.  I remain mystified by his success.  More particularly, I'm mystified by the title: what walk?  Near the end, there's a small walk, but that doesn't seem to fit.  If &#34;a walk to remember&#34; is supposed to be a metaphor for an important journey through life, then it's the sort of clunky metaphor that probably infests Sparks' prose.Well, I think I'll give this 2 out of 5, if only because director Adam Shankman had the excellent taste to start off his movie with the Breeders' &#34;Cannonball&#34;.  Trust me, that's as real as this movie gets.	2.0	In which Nicholas Sparks exploits fantasies; makes millions	2014-01-20	2	1	1

The opening scene led me to believe this was a knock-off of &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; but then when we meet Jamie and see the interaction between her and Landon, I got the impression this wasn't just a teen flick about peer pressure. And Mandy Moore didn't &quot;seem&quot; like a rock star in this movie. Jamie was a kind and caring young lady who sought her self image from her love of her pastor father and her relationship with God. I enjoyed seeing the transformation of Landon from bad-boy image to responsible adult, but I thought the movie was too abrupt with that, without much detail in the middle about his own transformation.I also like the fact that it was filmed in my home state of North Carolina and you get to see some of the scenery of the coastal areas of the state.I hope the book goes deeper into all the characters, since you can't really get into all the character buildup in the short time frame of the movie. We jump too fast from their wedding to four years later, after Landon graduates from med school. to reveal why would give the story away!	4.0	You won't be disappointed!	2002-12-23	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1QZGL03AUTBS	"David ""samijubal"""	I don't usually watch romance movies, I'm not much of a teen movie watcher either, but this is not like other teen movies. It doesn't have any sex, no stupid or rude jokes, it does have some swearing, but not anywhere near as much as most teen movies. I don't usually like the soundtrack in teen movies, hate rap music, but this soundtrack is great with some very good songs by Mandy Moore and Switchfoot that are played at the exact right moments in the film. The movie is a truly inspirational film about young love crossing all boundries and enduring to the end. Very well acted by the entire cast, especially the lead characters played by Mandy Moore and Shane West. Hopefully we will see much more of them in the future. There are some very moving scenes and some great backgroung scenery. I admit I cried during this movie more than once and I am a 40+ year old male, a must see.	5.0	Inspirational	2004-04-08	2	0	2

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2QQ1P4VUMJAPP	Dawn Shumate	After reading the book, I'll confess the movie was somewhat of a let-down.  Granted, trying to pack in the content of Spark's rich novel into the span of a movie is bound to leave some of the texture out.  Morevoer, it was disappointing they repackaged the time frame from the original late 50's, if for no other reason than to appeal to a younger audience?  Sorry, but that's selling out.  I wonder what Mr. Sparks thinks of Hollywood's treatment of his novel?The performances by Mandy Moore and Shane West were great.  If you like this movie, do yourself a favor and take the time to read the book - it's even better, more thought-provoking, and worth a few more hankies - and while the ending is essentially the same, so much is different I promise you won't be disappointed.	3.0	The book is better...	2002-07-26	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2BH0YEWH4CV8U	d'Banana	"I was poised to hate this movie. It featured a pop-princess, it was a teeny-bopper film and it was based on a book I truly hated.  Then I saw the trailer.  Hmm, it looked kinda interesting and Mandy Moore looked as if she could actually play the part.  So off to the theatre I went.And wow...what can I say...I still can't stop thinking about it. Something about this movie touched me and made think about love, faith, romance and how I've given up on finding those ideals at the early age of 24.  The film had a certain sincerity that appealed to me and made me willingly believe in the love story which, in other movies, I would have simply dismissed as contrived and manipulative.  But the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West made all the difference.  They made falling in love on-screen look natural.  Although some credit must also go to the writer and director.  It's nice to find a teen movie where the film-makers took the time to actually develop the relationship and therefore make their transformations believable.When I read the book, I seriously hated the story, mostly because of the Jamie character.  I thought she was too bland, one-dimensional and totally unreal.  Even for the 1950's...she was toooo nice.  But Mandy Moore's interpretation of Jamie improved the character.  She easily conveyed the innocence and sweetness that are Jamie's fundamental traits, but added a little attitude to make her stronger and interesting.  I don't know any other teen actress who could convince me of being naive without looking mentally-challenged.  Mandy Moore embodied Jamie with angelic purity, strength and intelligence.Shane West, normally forgettable in his other roles, also stunned me with his amazing performance.  In less than two hours, he went from lost and aimless cooler-than-thou pretty-boy to an I-am-my-own-man-and-I-like-it character.  The surprise for me here was that I didn't doubt his 180 transformation.  His subtle performance was touching to watch, especially in his scenes with Mandy Moore when he's granting one of her wishes. You could practically hear the audience swooning.Yes, there are flaws in this movie. But for me, the love story unfolding more than made up for those flaws.  It's been years since I actually believed in an idealized romance.  One where I didn't laugh or roll-my-eyes and said, ""Oh puhleez! Is this guy for real?""  The movie is hardly original and does not aim to be high-art, but it is in its simplicity  that I found great expressions of love.  That tiny scene where Landon (Shane West), allows Jamie to be in two places at once, had more romantic tones than any sweeping David Lean epic.  There's a sincerity here that is rarely found in other movies.As a plus, there are areas  where the story veered away from the cliches such as: 1.) ugly-duckling to beautiful swan transformation for the heroine...there's none of that here.  The Jamie character stays true to herself and that for once, is a refreshing thing to see in teen movies 2.) The parents are not heinous creatures --- woohoo!! I'm so sick of seeing movies where all the blame goes to the parents.  Glad to see that the Peter Coyote character (Jamie's dad) was portrayed as strict but understanding 3.) No romance between the single parents.  Thank god!So there, this might not be a movie for everyone.  Some found it too sentimental and sappy for their worldy tastes.  But when it works, well, it may never leave you.Great job Mandy and Shane!"	5.0	A Pleasant Surprise	2002-06-09	20	18	2

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AXMPBUWHJGHGO	Desperado	I decided to rent this out just to see what it was like .  was quite surprised on how good this movie was. This film takes place not in the present time but in the year 1996, look real closely at the &quot;new&quot; kid's jeep (the one who has to make the jump)  in the begining of the movie you will see his jeep's registration expires on 10/96. The story is basically about two differnt typs of teenagers falling in love. On the plus side, this film had a good story. Also this film has strong performance from Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote and Darrall Hanah. . The only bad part about the movie that it is depressing.Now to the DVD. It is a Wide Screen at 2:35. it has two commentary tracks a music video and a trailor for this film. Sadly this DVD has no deleted scenes. In the commentary track the Director talked about how sad he was when he had to cut some scenes out. They should have put some in the special features.I highly reccomend you watch this film, if you like love story. However avoid it if you are not in a good mood.	5.0	One of the better love stories out there	2002-07-18	4	3	1

It's definitely on my top ten movie list, and it's the only drama on that list (in spite of its sad ending).  It's one of only five or six movies that I've seen in a theater that I then went out and purchased on DVD shortly thereafter.This movie showcased Mandy Moore's immense talent (unlike most of the teen singer/movie stars we've seen since then).  The onscreen chemistry between her and Shane West in this movie is absolutely amazing, and the supporting cast was also top notch.As far as storytelling goes, it felt like something was left out in one spot, right before he starts building the telescope, but otherwise, the story is solid, the acting is superb, and overall, it's just a great movie to watch... if you don't mind walking away depressed and hopeful at the same time.	5.0	Deeply moving.	2011-04-12	3	2	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A12XE98V7N4BQV	Dianne Schenk	"The only good thing about this movie is the relative morality factor being displayed in place of the normal potty-mouthed, crack-smoking, beer-drinking teen movies that abound. But it goes downhill from there. Here are a couple of reasons why this movie makes after school specials look more inviting: Reason #1: The real-life issues in this movie are in fact so far from reality that the sentimental and serious nature of them flies out the window and it only ends up looking stupid--Mandy Moore's character Jamie Sullivan, supposedly sick with leukemia, doesn't show a single sign of being ill, not even fatigue, until ""the big moment"" when she tells her loving boyfriend Landon (Shane West). Then magically, all the signs appear and she gets sick. Another issue: the saving grace about Jamie, which is supposedly her faith, is so misrepresented, it's not worth trying to portray in the movie. She's supposed to be a Christian, yet when Landon finally asks her why she has faith, she gives some Moonie-slash-New Ager answer about it being something she ""can't see but she feels it when the wind blows."" Last time I looked in the Bible, that wasn't the definition of faith that I remember reading. Reason #2: Mandy Moore needs to stick to singing; there's no question that she's good at that, but as for her acting ability, I failed to see it--all I saw was a cookie cutter teen pop singer reciting lines to her co-stars who could've acted the movie without her and just used her songs as a soundtrack, all the while the audience is simply waiting for her to sing something else so the misery can end. Bottom line: If you want a good teen movie with romance, rent or buy something featuring Julia Stiles. She's beautiful and she can act ""circles"" around Mandy Moore."	2.0	After School Special	2002-12-10	7	3	4

It is very refreshing because the teen star in this movie (Mandy Moore) is not popular, not promiscuous, and unconcerned with trying to get there!In the process ""Landon"" (played by Shane West) can't help but be drawn to ""Jamie.""This is a movie about going for your dreams, believing in others, and faith.  The parents are neither stupid nor ""out of touch"" with the teen's world..but instead are real and concerned for their respective children as they enter into a serious romance that surpasses the fragility of their situation.The only ""rough spot"" I would recommend that families watch out for is at the very beginning of the movie where there are some kids gathered to ""test"" a new friend. There is alcohol, and some minor language and sexual banter.But on the whole, this movie takes a far right from the other teen movies out there and is very inspiring in the fact that instead of making fun of the ""Christian girl"" or making her look weird or fanatic, she is charming, likeable, and passionate about standing firm in her beliefs. It's also got a great soundtrack. :)"	5.0	An Unforgettable Walk	2005-04-26	4	4	0

You remember the type:  people who are superficial, shallow, egotistical and more into stupid (not to mention dangerous!) pranks than they are being good students or good people.After one of these pranks lands him in hot water, he finds himself in the company of a young ""nerdy"" woman (Mandy Moore) whom he can't help but become fond of - even though he tries his hardest not to.  The result of his being around her is astounding:  he actually becomes much more likable as the movie goes on!Unbeknownst to him, she has a deep secret that she has kept from everyone:  she has a terminal case of leukemia.  Goodness, that's terrible!  Instead of returning to being the jerk he used to be, he actually grows up and does everything he can to make his own personality more congruent with her's.This is a remarkable film in that, unlike most movies about people with terminal illnesses, it's actually more about the love interest who is completely healthy than it is about the girl who is sick.  This is a movie about a transformation, not just of him, but of the motley crue he hangs around with as well.  Mandy Moore is as adorable as always, and her persona in this movie is like rays of sunshine pouring over a group of high school kids who were previously directionless.

The only minor criticism I have of the movie is that I thought the teenagers were a little too crude and obnoxious....this could have been played down a little bit.  Luckily, this tapered off within the first 20 - 30 minutes and then evolved into a beautiful story.  It's almost as if the first few scenes don't fit with the rest of the movie.  Case in point....there was a scene where one of Landon's friends was reading lines with him and he suddenly began making obscene sexual gestures....was this really necessary?  Also, I think the movie may have been even more beautiful if they had kept the setting the same as it was is the novel...1958 rather than current day.	5.0	Surprisingly Sensitive and Touching Love Story	2004-05-07	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A15TNUM2PBS6F0	"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover"""	I read the book, &quot;A Walk to remember&quot; by Nicholas Sparks, and I really liked the story and how it's main character, Landon Carter, evolved. It was a story of redemption and undying love. The overall message to it is: It is what inside that counts. We can all learn from this that people can really have an effect on what kind of person we really want to be deep down.The movie has kept up the part of the story between Landon and Jamie Sullivan, the girl he falls for. However, I was not at all pleased with the fact that they had made it a modern day story when it was set in the 1950's in the book, and Landon narrated it from the present.  It was like he was looking back at his life, and replaying those most important momments.  It was a quality the book had that kept the story and it's meaning so true to life.  We all often look back at past relationships and experiences that helped shape who we have turned out to be.The movie totally disregarded that whole part, and that awful soundtrack of &quot;movie rock songs&quot; doesn't help my opinion.  The only song that had any meaning was the song that Jamie sang to Landon in the play.It was perfectly clear to me that this movie just used the book as a springboard for a new teen movie.  I have no idea who Shane West is, and I didn't think there was anything special about him. When I pictured Landon in the book, he was nothing like this guy. He just appeared to be another cast member of Dawson's creek.Mandy Moore, who played Jamie, was okay. She is the latest of the pop singers to grace the silver screen, and she didn't do much better than any of those who came before her.  She wasn't the worse actress, but like West, I didn't feel anything special about her performance.The best acting was by Darryl Hannah as Landon's mom, and Peter Coyote, as Jamie's father who is the reverend in the small North Carolina town they live in.  They were both very believable.The scenery was beautiful. I know the story is set in N. Carolina, but I don't know that it was actually filmed there.If you just see the movie and skip the book, maybe you will better off than me. I tend to compare movie to book. The book is always so much better because you get to know the characters so much better. If you don't have time for the book, but like romantic films, this is an okay diversion from reality.  It is not one of the best, but if you are under the age of 18, you will probably appreciate this more.  It seems most of the reviewers here are of that age group.I am on the fence here, I recommend it to young adults. Fans of the book, it would be a better movie had it been more true to the original story.  Skip it, and read the book again.Eileen Famiglietti	2.0	Utterly Disappointed	2002-07-12	5	2	3
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1QXPV3U6IOTCE	ELF	A Walk to Remember is my favorite movie.  It captured me the second it started with mystery, suspense, excitement and true love.  Every single scene gave me cills up my back.  I was always sitting on the edge of my seat excited to see what happened next.  It always turned out just perfect.The actors are the best for their parts.  I couldn't believe Mandy Moore.  I thought she'd be a horribe actress, but she is so great.  I am suprised she didn't start acting sooner than she did.  She takes you into the world of the movie so well.  She plays her part so perfectly.  Without her, the movie wouldn't be a movie.  She is great!Everyone in the world should be privilaged with seeing this beautiful romance.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2UBFS0B9NZZPI	Elizabeth A. Hancock	I rented this DVD for my daughters and wound up watching it myself before it was returned.  It was FABULOUS!I'm utterly thrilled that the producers agreed to make this teen movie and keep it rated PG.  The love story was great, but even better were the portrayals of Mandy Moore as Jamie--a &quot;religious geek&quot; who sticks to her standards despite what the high-school in-crowd thinks or does--and Shane West as Landon--a &quot;big-man-on-campus&quot; who ultimately discovers that there is more to life than fun.  Both performances were believable and realistic; the chemistry between Moore and West helped move the story forward.The film's ending is a bit abrupt(I want to read the book and find out what I missed), and although the storyline finishes somewhat sadly, I think it does so in the most positive way possible.  I also think this film is a great example  (from, hard as it STILL is to believe, Hollywood!?!) of how faith and personal integrity help a person get through the trials of life.  As Jamie once says, &quot;We need pain to help us learn compassion.&quot; (Or something like that!)I recommend this to EVERYONE (I think even guys wouldn't mind it).  I generally don't buy DVDs, but this is one I'm definitely getting for our family labrary.Enjoy!	5.0	THREE CHEERS FOR A CLEAN LOVE STORY ! ! !	2003-01-15	2	2	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A12I4HIKMHA8XK	Elizabeth Graham	I can remember when A Walk To Remember was still in theaters.  I waited anxiously for weeks for it to come out in theaters.  When it finally came out I begged my parents to let me go see it.  A Walk To Remember tells a story of Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter, two 18-year-olds who fall in love despite their different aproaches to life.It begins when Landon(Shane West) convinces a new student to jump off an extremly high diving board into a pool of water, causing the teen to become paralyzed.  Landon gets caught and is punished for his serious lack of judgement.  Landon must perform in the fall play.  Since he doesn't have much acting talent, he asks Jamie Sullivan(Mandy Moore), the ministers daughter, to help him.  After a series of romantic events, Landon finds himself falling in love with Jamie, as Jamie, in turn, falls for him.Jamie finally tells Landon a deep secret she has been hidding.  Through his love for Jamie, Landon helps her get past her deep dark secret.Check out A Walk To Remember, it's the best movie ever made!!!!!	5.0	The Best Movie Ever Made	2002-07-08	8	6	2
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2VDNLW7XPPENA	Elizabeth	This movie is definitely a tear jerker (gets me every time!), and has a wonderful message about self-discovery and self-improvement, as well as becoming more self-less. It's about true, pure love that goes deeper than most high school romances. It's a classic and a super cute story!The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is because I was surprised by all of the explicitly sexual references in the beginning of the movie that I naively didn't notice the first time I watched it when I was much younger. (Spoiler alert: the friend, when helping him out with his lines, physically acts out having sex with the drama teacher by hip thrusting a bench, basically). It also swears a lot during the beginning of the film. On the other hand, this can also be used to show just how much the main character really does change. By the end of the film I don't recall hearing any swearing anymore, and the love they share is very pure and clean. Definitely a great overall message, but also a sketchy scene to watch out for.	4.0	A Wonderful Message!	2013-05-21	1	1	0

So many of the wonderful moments that are in the book between Landon and Jamie arent in the movie.First off the movie is set in present day but has a 50's feel to the clothing which is really cheesy. In the book Landon was a somewhat ""bad boy"" because he didnt take school seriously and was a smart mouth, bad by 1950's standards. In the movie they made him be malicious to other people to make him ""bad"".The sweet story of the penny jar and the presents for the orphanage is left out, which I really enjoyed from the book.This is an awful version of a book to movie.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AFWJF3CQ76VTI	E. L. Warner	I was incredibly disappointed in this shallow adaptation of a great book.  Inexplicably, the author has sold out his endearing characters for a flat Hollywood production complete with a nauseating musical number thrown in to one of the central plot lines of the book - the sweet and innocent play.  In the movie the play comes off like a meaningless High School Musical episode.  Nicholas Sparks, who has the ability to create deep, flawed, and tremendously likable characters is willing to chuck all this aside for a payoff.  If he had pressured them to produce something resembling his book and characters, we'd be talking about a classic for all time.

And the actors portrayed their characters SO well that it really makes you believe in the love that they have for each other. And for the people like me who cry during movies, I suggest you get your Kleenex ready! But its a good type of sad, one that makes you think about how you treat people around you. And almost makes you want to be a better person. Its a movie that will pull at your heartstrings.

At first, he is so afraid to be seen talking to her that he ignores her in front of his friends, but after getting to know her, they both fall in love.

Through falling in love with Jamie and watching her succumb to her illness, he changes as a person and becomes better for it.  And then there is all the romantic stuff that makes it such a special film.  Its definitely a movie that will make you cry and its rare in that it shows how one person can change the whole path of your life.""A Walk to Remember"" is also about rising above peer pressure and making choices of your own.  It doesn't have to rely on sex to make the romance work.  The rare film is able to do that and this is the kind anyone can see and enjoy.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how good Mandy Moore did in this film.  She was completely able to capture the innocent and good Jamie and I hope to see her in other films.All in all, this is a real tearjerker with a very good message.  If you like romance, this is the one to see."	5.0	A rare and beautiful movie!	2002-07-28	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1HH9ZRK5J650G	fortwaynemom	I'm not much of a movie fanatic.  I like them, but don't make much time for them, even when they are free.  I have had amazon prime over nearly a year and have never made the time to watch any of the free movies that you are privileged to see. Being there is only 2 weeks left on my annual membership, I decided to finally take advantage of this offering.I am a sucker for romantic  movies.  So as I was scrolling through the titles, the title and picture caught my eye.  Plus, I like Mandy Moore. Never heard of this movie even though its been out a long time,so didn't expect much.  Much to my surprise, I loved it. The story line, the acting, everything.  Loved how this young man was so inspired that he was so changed for life. Love that it is based on a true story. Touching story.Thanks amazon prime.	5.0	what a unexpected surprise...it was so good.....	2013-10-07	0	0	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3S4VXP1WYM70D	Frances A.S. Lizama	I have to admit that I was unable to see the movie when it premiered in the theaters earlier this year but after buying the DVD version of the movie, I can honestly say that it was definitely worth the wait! The way that Shane West and Mandy Moore bring their characters to life is quite exceptional!You can see the transformation that Landon Carter goes through from being a popular, rebellious and confused individual into a loving, devoted and caring person. He learns to love another person more than himself, even at the cost of his friendships.It is nice to see that even though the movie is pretty much geered toward the teenage crowd, that an adult such as myself, would actually love this movie as much as I do! - I have to say that this movie is definitely one of my all-time favorite movies! I welcome any movie that deals with the subject of unconditional love. - A love that goes way deeper than just the inner surfaces of the heart.This movie was brilliantly made and I highly recommend it to anyone that believes that there aren't any people left in this world that would do the things that Landon did for Jamie during their short time together. - This movie is much more than a teenage &quot;chick flick&quot;. If you love and are loved, you will sense a special feeling towards this movie and learn to love and appreciate it as much as I do!To Shane West, Mandy Moore and Director Adam Shankman, thank you so much for the brilliant movie and a job well done! - Encore!	5.0	Definitely a Movie to Remember!	2002-07-16	2	1	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2MRZPTMYFADUV	Frodo	"This is my favourite romantic movie of all time. I always get the same special feeling when I watch its beautiful and moving scenes. I definately always look to it for inspiration when I'm feeling down.Landon Carter is part of the ""popular group"" at his highschool. A rebel through and through, Landon has no outlook on life, love and certainly faith. Then when a careless teenaged stunt lands a schoolmate in hospital, as punishment, Landon must clean floors, tutor disadvantaged students, and worst of all, participate in the school play. All these loserish activities intertwines him with Jamie Suverlin, a devout christian who keeps to herself. Landon finds himself intrigued by Jamie's mysterious ways and consequently finds himself fall for her. Then Jamie reveals a secret that will change his life forever...""A Walk to Remember"" is a beautiful and simple film about the pure innocence of first love. Mandy Moore and Shane West deliever fine performances as the two leads, and also features Darhyl Hannah and Peter Coyote.The other highlight of this film, is the brilliant soundtrack, featuring songs from Switchfoot and Mandy Moore. Each song adds depth, meaning and emotion to each scene.The story is simple, but the messages are so powerful. The movie teaches us to forget about what it means to be ""popular"" and follow your heart truthfully.This is a bittersweet movie. The love of the two teenagers is almost powerful enough to brighten the film's heartbreaking finale, but you will definately shead a tear nevertheless.Based on Nicholas Sparks' bestselling novel, ""A Walk to Remember"" is a beautiful, tranquil movie, blending an awesome soundtrack with essential life lessons, and taking us along the road of first love!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1L3E4ZLRNKFNP	Gary	After seeing the trailers to A Walk to Remember, I have to admit, I wasn't psyched about seeing this movie.  It seemed to be yet another stereotypical cardboard cut out of recent teen movies in the past few years.  There are a few 'chick flicks' that I have enjoyed in the past, but they're not my favorite movies. But, because of my friends eagerness to see the movie, I gave in, and went to see it.  The results were very surprising. This movie wasn't just another average 'chick flick,' it was something much more.  It became one of my all-time favorite movies.The movie is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, and tells the wonderful tale of two people who are the definite opposites of one another only to be brought together by a miracle.  There is Jamie Sullivan, played brilliantly by Mandy Moore, who is a shy and meek girl who is always teased on by her peers.  Her head remains strong however, because she doesn't allow the rude and immature comments penetrate and hamper her uplifting spirit.  This is a true definition of a great person.  I always admire someone who isn't afraid to be themselves and not be terribly afraid of what other people would think or change themselves to be something they're not.  Jamie has high morals that she never allows to be jeopardized.  There is also Landon, played by Shane West, whose only concern in life is not to jeopardize his reputation in other people's eyes.  Both of these characters are brought together by an incident and fall amazingly in love.  This tells a wonderful and amazing story of how true love can be.Before watching this film, I doubted Mandy Moore's acting capabilities, but now I realize just how fitting she was for this role.  Shane West also plays his part convincingly.  The story is combined with an awesome cast to produce a remarkable and very rememberable movie.	5.0	A Movie That Will Be Remembered	2002-06-29	60	55	5

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3BMZYA7CT2E74	G. Garner	When I first saw this film, I found myself completely infatuated with the heroine. But I wasn't fully sure why. Yeah, she was beautiful, but most young women in the world of entertainment are these days.Jamie was sweet, and intelligent, but I've seen those things before, as well. Then it hit me-the telescope. She had this love and passion for astronomy. From the moment I saw her entering the cemetery, in the dead of night, to pursue her love of the celestial, it was over for me: I have never been so enchanted with a character. Now, I, personally, can take astronomy or leave it. But it's what it represents that makes her so appealing. Most people in America do things because of how they wish to be perceived within their peer group. But Jamie is into astronomy for its own sake. It is something she loves, for her own reasons. What other motivation could she have? After all, nobody is going to get elected homecoming queen for lugging a telescope around a cemetery at night.It's not something you do to be accepted. It's something she did because of who she was.She was so charming, and so beautiful, but also so strong and independent. So kind, but also so sincere.Jamie was as close to the ideal woman as I can imagine. Yes, I know, I know.....she's not real(although I do seem to recall reading that she was inspired by a real person). But the response she awakens within me is quite real.Based upon some of the comments I've heard from other guys, I can tell that I'm not the only one who sees her in this light.They say you can't wear out a dvd. But I have the feeling I will be putting that theory to the test.	5.0	Jamie	2007-08-04	3	2	1

I decided to read the book before it came out and it was wonderful. Jamie and Landon are total opposites but somehow they find love. I read it in one day and cried my eyes out in the end. In the book though, when Jamie and Landon get married,Jamie, who was too weak to stand was in awheelchair. But with a little bit of help, she walked down the church without her chiar, Landon describes this as ""A Walk To Remember"", I found that part to be the most touching part of the whole story and was outraged when I saw that they did not include it in the movie.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AR0YM5WOXR2M3	Grace	A Walk to Remember is a great movie.  Some people call it teeny-bopper fluff, but it's really a GREAT movie!! It's about high-schoolers Jamie (pop sensation Mandy Moore) and Landon (Shane West) who are practically opposites!! Jamie is a Christian girl who is unpopular and at a loss for style. Landon is part of a beer-drinking popular group. Jamie doesn't care what anybody thinks of her, and Landon does. When fate throws them together, they fall completely in love. Jamie makes an impact on Landon's life, and both of them are changed forever - for the better. This tear-jerking love story is a hit with pre-teen and teenage girls, but also with adults.	5.0	A great movie!!	2009-06-30	2	1	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7	Grace	You'll either love it for its sweetness and sincerity or dislike it for its sappiness. I personally love it. It's such a sweet story, not to mention an important one about true love. Shane West and Mandy Moore were great together. This is such an important movie. It's the kind of film that everyone can get at least SOMETHING out of. Don't pass up the chance to see this. Mandy Moore has some exceptional acting skills, and I can't wait to see more from her in the future. Shane West is awesome too.... at first, you hate his character, but then you love him. If you don't cry during this movie at any time, then you should definitely at least have the chills. Every time I see the ending scene with Jamie and Landon, the tears come. It's just so beautiful. What's not to like? It's just a very honest and moving film. I can't recommend it enough. If I could recommend only one movie in my life, this might be the one. Something about it just makes you want to do something more with your life.Rent it. Buy it. Do whatever you can to at least see this movie.	5.0	beautiful, beautiful, beautiful	2002-07-22	2	1	1

The acting, cinematography, script, editing, soundtrack, and other elements were excellent. It is refreshing to see such a sweet story of passionate, true love, that is rated PG, and spiritual. Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter have a pure relationship, and prove that love is everlasting, and not simply sex. This movie is very touching, and made me cry happily, and sadly, laugh, and smile. It shows that love can move mountains, and is all you need. It shows that you must be strong, and always have faith that everything will be okay. It is a tale of a true but tragic romance between two young adults. And it is the best movie of 2001.	5.0	The Best Movie of 2001	2002-06-29	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1K5KYE4MNQXG	Halo Jones	Take it from the gal who smirked through &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;-this movie is a breath of fresh air in the teen angst cateogory. Sure, it's a little heavy handed at times, especially towards the end; however, Shane West and Mandy Moore really make this story work. Mandy is nicely cast as the ethereal, good hearted preacher's daughter while Shane West steals the show as the bad boy who wants to do right because of the love of a girl. I know what you are thinking-the set-up sounds completely cliched; but for some odd reason, it works. I found it touching and earnest-I let my cycnicism have a two hour vacation while I thoroughly enjoyed the film.	4.0	Sweet and sincere	2002-07-29	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A206LUQRGSKJ4Z	"H. A. Masanga ""BOSSY*SMALLVILLIAN"""	A walk to remember is a story of Landon Carter, the rebellious trouble maker(Shane West)and Jamie Sullivan, the reverend's daughter (Mandy Moore), a quite good-natured girl but teased by Landon and his friends. When Landon finds himself playing the lead role in the highschool musical along side Jamie he turns to her seeking help with lines. As he spends more time with her the two become closer and closer. Jamie shares a list of life goals with Landon inspiring him to do more with his life. He begins his own list of goals. When he first learns Jamie has terminal leukemia he is shocked but then talks to his dad who pays for her home care. Landon helps Jamie complete many tasks from her list as she is too weak to do them herself. Jamie's number one is finaly completed when Landon and Jamie are married in the church where her parents were married. Jamie dies just one summer later but in that short time she had changed Landon's life.This is one of my favorite movies! It has great charaters, story line, music, lesson...everthing about this movie is great!!! This is one of the very few movies I enjoyed more than the book!!	5.0	Love is like the wind.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	"Adam Shankman's (""Bringing Down The House"") respectful screen adaptation of the wonderful romance novel of the same name by New York Times bestselling author Nicholas Sparks is an instant classic, featuring a star performance by singer-turned-actress Mandy Moore (her first film was Disney's ""The Princess Diaries""). At long last, we get a love story devoid of the sexual overtones so prevalent in today's society (I don't have anything against sex in movies, it's just that I prefer the classic romance films, like ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone With The Wind"" [see my reviews on these and others like them]). THIS film deserves to stand among them as a symbol of family-friendly (if you don't mind the mild language and subtle sexual innuendos-hey, movies aren't devoid of reality and this stuff happens every day) entertainment. Mandy Moore, fresh off her film debut, plays the preacher's down-to-earth, beautiful and ""Almost ethereal"" daughter Jamie Sullivan so well that I almost thought she was real. Shane West turns in an equally fine performance as the teen who, against his will, finds himself drawn to Jamie and subsequently, comes to appreciate her for who she is and what she represents. Darryl Hannah (the villainous one-eyed assassin Elle from ""Kill Bill"" [see my review on it]), Peter Coyote, David Andrews (Claire Danes' dad in ""Terminator 3"" [see my review on that one and ""The Terminator"" in my review of ""Terminator 2""])and the rest of the cast add to the tenderness of this film, so lovingly adapted from the book on which it is based. I LOVED this movie. I nearly cried during the scene where she sang ""Only Hope,"" the sad scenes, during the end credits and the music video. This is the role Ms. Moore was born to play. Rated PG for some thematic elements and mild language."	5.0	A Love Story Devoid Of Sex. An Instant Classic.  Irresistible.	2005-06-30	0	0	0

The acting of the teenagers is quite good, and the girl's voice is just terrific when she sings. The only weak character is the pastor father of the girl.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AVO9QQWRRXESK	Heather Hays	"After seeing Mandy Moore and Shane West light up the big screen, I picked up the book on a whim at Target. I recently finished reading it. I expected it to be absolutely stunning because of the reviews I've seen here complaining that the book would be better.So how is it similiar to the movie? It's not, at all. The book takes place in 1958, the characters have different physical characteristics and absolutely none of the scenes were identical. It seems that the only thing that they remained faithful to is the characters' names.And while I probably would have liked the book if I had read it by myself, I thought Mandy Moore added a little extra to Jaime Sullivan's character. The chemistry between her and Shane West was sweet, not overly sappy and charmingly honest.I thought the book left out a lot too. What about all of Jaime's wishes that Landon spent so much time granting? What about the cemetary and the telescope and Mandy Moore's rendition of ""Only Hope"" ? I always want to break down at the end when Jaime sees the comet Haiku Taki.But I think what really spoke to me about this movie is that it isn't a movie about love, or about dying or believing. It's all of those and none of those and at times it comes across as unbelievably pure.By the way, the soundtrack is worth checking out as well."	5.0	From someone who saw the movie first	2004-10-26	6	3	3

It's very refreshing to see a ""teen"" movie that isn't about bathroom humor, young people behaving stupidly, or overt sexuality that is gratuitous and nonessential.  ""A Walk to Remember"" may be at times trite, but is always honest.The DVD presentation is somewhat disappointing.  There are no special features other than Moore's video for her hit ""Cry.""

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1EEEXLSNFO42O	Historian1912	I normally do not like this type of film. I actually randomly came across it on youtube and eventually got the DVD. I really liked the movie. I found the character development of Landon rather interesting and well done. However, I cannot give this movie four or five stars due to two problems. One is Mandy Moore. She plays a Christian in the film, but sure isn't one in real life. I find that to be almost insulting. Then again, I never could understand how actors could play characters that are at least safe to expose children to, if not worthy of admiration, but in real life be some of the most morally bankrupt people I have ever read or seen in my life. The other problem I have with this film is the cursing. It has a lot of unnecessary cursing. The director, if I am remembering this correctly, added quite a bit of cursing to make it seem more 'realistic.' I found it distracting and irritating. I hear enough cursing at the university I attend. I don't need more when watching a movie. Even more ironic is the inclusion of songs by the Christian band Switchfoot. It seems this movie could not make up its mind what tone it was trying to set. I must say it is a good story, but I would recommend not showing this to kids under thirteen, to use a standard cutoff point, if you are trying to not encourage swearing.	3.0	A Walk to Remember	2011-10-30	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	ANK9O4DUKCIH2	Iona Sun	"While I haven't read the book, so I can't do a comparison there, the movie was refreshing from at least one standpont... it was nice to finally see a movie where the christians aren't (a) psycho-extreme fundamentalist-radicals (like the radical cultish terrorist guy, or the Rob Lowe ""moral majority type"" character, in Contact), or (b) shallow and without convictions (like the Catholic guy in Contact), or (c) so caught up in American evangelical christian culture (like Leap of Faith or The Apostle) that the average person can't relate.I'm not beating a drum for Hollywood to produce christian propaganda (as if they would), and certainly some of those stereotypes of christians I mentioned are real and deserving at times, and should be acknowledged. But it was nice for once to see christians portrayed at least a little bit more like the ones that I know. A little more perspective, and a little less bias and prejudice in this area, is refreshing.The movie could've been better - it really missed some possibilities in my opinion - and the end section was a little too sappy for me, and such an obvious play for emotions. It didn't feel completely honest.The movie wasn't as thoughtless as it might appear, though.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1LYOSD15OLNVI	Ira Simmons	I seriously and honestly only wanted to see the movie because Mandy moore was in it and didnt know what I was getting myself into. The more I set here watching it the more I said to myself this is just isnt my kind of movie... and even though it was driving itself more and more away from my intrest I continued to watch. Then just when I least expected it she told Landon she had cancer and was going to die.. totally unprepared and shocked I instantly saw the movie changing direction ( I mean c'mon where did that come from?? ). Complete with a sad ending and my mixed emotions throughout the film I think its very worthy of 4 stars. I'll even admit some of the stuff in the movie was uncalled for and ridiculous but it wasnt really all that bad of a movie.. just ask yourself after its all said in done would you have been better off never seeing it?Im not really an emotional person but very strong and powerful between Mandy Moore and Shane West just really got to me... if there was no laughter in this movie I would have been depressed for days.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1ZMNARCR1DS18	"Jamie Stewart ""Mrs. Stewart"""	"I have to admit that when I first saw this film, I thought it to be simply sweet.  When I heard it was a book I became quite curious, and read it.  I read the book in one sitting, and was captivated by Jamie's eloquent honesty and the mark that she left on the lost characters that she comes in contact with.  I couldn't help but compare and contrast the book with the movie.  The movie gave a very poor rendition of this originally set in the fifties tale of love.  The time setting in the movie is modern day, which deprives the book of its elegance and innocence.  The actors, Shane west and more importantly Mandy Moore are prosaically mediocre.  I was sorely disappointed in how they bring Jamie's book in this film.  First of all, it was her mom's Bible originally, and not just a book of quotes.  What makes this inanimate object special, is that her mother has died and left it to her of which Jamie carries around with her everywhere, and is held in the highest regard...she chooses to give it to Landon as a Christmas present.  He is touched beyond words, and this is the high point of the novel.  What bothers me even more, is the title of the movie. How can you call this ""Teen Chick Flick"", A Walk to Remember.""  The book was named this because of several walks, but prominately it refers to Jamie's walk down the aisle for her wedding.  You see by this time Leukemia has taken its toll on her body, and she is sitting sickly but sweetly in her wheelchair, when to Landon's surprise, she arises and walks weakly down the aisle towards him.  In the movie Mandy Moore looks more than healthy, but the best looking that she has since the commencement of the film.  How utterly unrealistic! I hope that the audience lovers of this movie read this book that has substance of which the film desperaltely lacks."	2.0	There is NO WALK TO REMEMBER	2006-07-17	10	3	7

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AYJNY01NFTVX3	"Janet Morris ""fuzzypinkslippers"""	This tearjerker will make you long for the love that Jamie and Landon share.  It takes place in the '90s in Beaufort, North Carolina.  Landon is your typical &quot;I'm better than you&quot; type of high school guy.  Jamie is the kind of girl who doesn't care what others think.  The only opinion that matters is God's.When Landon is forced to choose between working with Jamie on different projects or going to jail for breaking the law, he chooses Jamie...and chooses a path that will lead him to the greatest love and loss of his life.Honestly, this movie is one of the best ever.  It isn't really one you'd expect to win Oscars or anything, but it is a sentimental favorite of mine.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1EA7VXIUZBYIK	"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist"""	"To start things off, I should mention that, even as a headbanger, I've enjoyed watching this movie since the first time I saw 5 years ago.Why? Simply put, it gives a reason to hope for something better than superficial lovey-dovey stuff. Though this film has people exemplifying stereotypes (overprotective preacher-father, cool guy that's rebellious, preacher's daughter who doesn't care for popularity, etc.), most of the characters change to be a deeper personality by the end of the film. And for this movie, it's worth that change.About that preacher's daughter, she also shows that Christians aren't a bunch of boring, bland people who don't have humor and only want to serve in soup kitchens- she also has wit sometimes when she gets made fun of for her fashion, sense, and belief. And when the cool guy needs help for the school play (for which he's forced into as part of his punishment for getting drunk and causing an accident that paralyzes a fellow student in the beginning), her one condition almost sounds like a no-brainer for him... until he finds he can't help but break that one rule (part of his rebellious nature?), and doing so helps him see another side of her he never thought he knew existed- a side of her with ambitions, questions, hopes and dreams that go beyond the church her father tries to put a handle on.Then again, her father does happen to have a thing or two (thousand) against the guy, Shane. Namely, that he's a typical rebellious ""dude"", always looking bored, never thinking the preacher notices him, and has always been judging him for it. Typical, huh?Well, things change. Not too quick (lest it be another overly cheesy Christian flick), nor too slowly (lest it be another bland romance flick), but at the right pace. And with the situations and twists that pop up, you find out more about each person and each person's view of someone else, breakign their own perceptions of each other. To this day, this is still in my top 5 favorite romance films."	5.0	Very memorable for what it's worth	2012-03-01	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A200TOTZ77CNKN	Jason Weaver	A Walk to Remember is a terrific story and an awesome movie.  I saw it in a movie theatre when it first came out and recently bought the DVD because I loved the movie so much.  Responding to critics who feel that A Walk to Remember is too teen-focused, I say so what.  I was 26 years old when I saw it in the movie theatre and was 30 when I bought it from Amazon.  The story/plot is timeless and transcends arbitrary age categories.Responding to critics who feel that A Walk to Remember's cast was sub par, I say Mandy Moore was terrific and Shane West and supporting cast were more than adequate.  Peter Coyote was a great Southern Baptist minister and single father.  In her limited supporting role, I even saw potential for Daryl Hannah to play more dramatic and thoughtful roles in the future.Overall, this movie was not designed to win Oscars and other awards.  It was designed to entertain and inspire and I contend that it did both admirably.	5.0	Inspiring Movie	2006-03-14	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1L7HMJN4KGVVH	J. Benka	"A beautiful coming-of-age love story written by Nicholas Sparks that will have you cheering the dream we all have about waiting to find our perfect soulmate. Rebellious Landon Carter meets the quiet, kind and bookish Jamie Sullivan; a girl he has known for many years but has rarely ever spoken to. Landon falls head over heels for Jamie and as a result, his life is transformed and their sweet journey begins. A gem of a movie that reinforces a form of birth control we rarely hear about these days; abstinence until marriage. Oh, it's clear that Jamie is ""passionately in love"" with Landon, but she is a young women of unwavering morality, and that's exactly what Landon loves about her. Get out the tissues, and grab your daughters(and sons)to share this movie with.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A21VNB9XGT1KQD	Jen	"This film is laughable at best.  They got the two worst actors in HISTORY to lead this film.  Mandy Moore is pouty a usual, saying every line with overzealous dignity.  Shane West - HA!  Who in the world thought this man could act?  WHO?  Every scene, if you look carefully, features Shane with what seems to be something in his mouth or something bothering his teeth, so he rearranges his lips and toungue in EVERY SCENE.  He does this for ""bad boy effect,"" like it will make his acting seem more badass.The script, OH DEAR GOD THE POOR SCRIPT.  Landon (West) falls in love with Jamie (Moore) after he sees her sing in a play.  Before that, he thinks she's the biggest loser ever.  But when she sings...bam! He's in love.  Pathetic.A boy and a girl go out on a first date.  Girl talks about beauty she feels in the wind.  Boy says he loves girl.  Girl says ""I told you not to fall in love with me.""  Boy says ""I might kiss you.""  Girl says ""I might be bad at it.""  Boy says ""It's not possible!""Sounds like a comedy sketch, no?But it's an OMG  TEEN DRAMA!***SPOILER*** She has leukemia.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2N4Y0WTYEXUWB	Jenn	In generality, teen movies are plagued with bad acting, silly plot lines, and clich&eacute;s upon clich&eacute;s. I will formally rank A Walk to Remember, based on the novel by Nicholas Spark, as one of the better teen movies. The acting is passable, the plot line is touching, and... well, there are still plenty of clich&eacute;s, but this is a teen movie after all.This movie's greatest asset is the tragic love story between bad-boy Landon (Shane West) and goodie-goodie Jamie (Mandy Moore). Many teen film romances seem contrived and leave me wondering what the two characters ever saw in each other. The love between Landon and Jamie seemed natural and believable, and made the ending all the more poignant. Mandy Moore can actually do a decent acting job, surprisingly enough.I still have my usual gripes: The ending is predictable. Many of the transitions seem rushed. On a re-watchability scale, this movie seems like a one-timer and would not be as touching second time around. But still, for those of us who can appreciate some good sap now and again, this is a lovely movie to sit down with a box of tissues by your side.	3.0	Better than your average teen fare	2002-11-23	4	4	0

A Walk To Remember was the best teen movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. Just about all teen movies have the same things in commen weak plots, weak characters, and inability to show life how it really is. However, this movie rose above all the typical teen movies. It had a strong plot, strong characters (Shane and Mandy were wonderful) and it actually showed life the way it is. The movie teaches that people can change for the better and that sometimes we have to take a leap of faith. What do most teen movies teach us? well basiclly nothing. If you haven't seen this movie because it's labeled as a teen movie, take a leap of faith and try it out you won't regret it.	5.0	A Walk You Will Never Forget	2002-07-09	2	2	0

She doesn't care when peaople make fun of her clothes or what names they call her. Then, she meets a extra cute Boy named Landon at school,and even though he is popular, and a huge trouble-maker and her father tells her not to be around him, she still tries to teach him the good things about life, and church, all the while, growing to like him more and more.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3QAATYM09AJMU	"Jeremy Blake ""*Blake*"""	Everyone who knows what a good movie is and has seen this movie knows that it is a very good movie that is not just another teen movie. I've left a review on the film itself already, so please check that out. So now I'll leave a review on the overall DVD. The DVD includes two commentaries, the first by Mandy Moore, Shane West, and director Adam Shankman. It is a very interesting and funny commentary, and it is fun to listen to. But the 2nd commentary by author Nicholas Sparks and the screenwriter is much more fact-filled and interesting. Overall, both commentaries are essential to hear if you want to learn more about the making of the film. Next we have the music video for the main song of the film, &quot;Cry&quot; by Mandy Moore. Now this has got to be Mandy's greatest video ever, she looks great in it, and her voice is amazing. Shane also made an appearance in the video, which makes it alot better. Overall the video is very well done, and it is a great special feature. Then you can watch the trailer to the film, the full-length theatrical trailer, which as with any film, is a nice feature. The last thing is the Cast biographies and filmographies of Shane West, Mandy Moore, and two more cast members. The film includes English and French audio, and it has English and Frech subtitles. The only dissapointment you might realise, is that during Mandy's singing, there are no subtitles. So go buy the DVD if you haven't already. It's a great add to your collection, and believe me, you WILL watch it more than once.	5.0	A movie to remember	2002-07-14	2	1	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A127E6EAFW1AH5	jess	Wow. This movie was an amazing one, and I absolutely loved it.  While I did not read the book first, I would recomend doing so. The movie may be based on the book, but there are many differences, and the book was slightly better. But movies are rarely as good as the book, but this one would have to be the closest. As a fair warning, though, this movie will make you cry.  And I never cry in movies (I was the girl who saw Titanic, and laughed at all the crying people at the end), but I cried in this movie.  Part of it was that it touched close to home (I had a family member going through the same thing as Jamie Sulivan), but mostly it was the story, and how well it was told. The movie captures your heart from the beginning, and it takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  I highly recomend it to anyone.  Enjoy!	5.0	amazing, but a tear jerker	2004-02-03	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	ALCXIQRMPANO8	Jessica	Okay, so I picked up this movie expecting a cheesy teen love story about love on the inside, and overcoming 'peer pressure' and all that cheesy ..., but this movie was SO MUCH BETTER and DEEPER than that.  The acting was on the most part very good (esp. Shane West!), even though sometimes Mandy's lines made me almost cringe, the rest of the movie made up for it.  I cried about five separate times in the movie and it has made such an impression on me its crazy.  Honestly, I fully recommned this movie cause it is so heartwrenchingly good!  Jamie and Landon's love haunts me -- I am such a romantic, and if you are too, you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!  by the way, the soundtrack is UNFORGETTABLE, with songs like Only Hope (which Mandy sings in the movie during the school play -- its such a beautiful ballad) and Dare You To Move by Switchfoot, which just brings tears to my eyes thinking about when it played during the movie.....sigh.	5.0	SO MUCH BETTER THAN IT LOOKS!!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A309RWKRNKMGTR	Jessica	I love this movie! It is incredibly sweet and heartwarming. You really become absorbed in the story line and you can truly feel every bit of what the characters are feeling. Shane West and Mandy Moore were incredible in this movie. They delivered every line perfectly and their performances were truly touching :). This movie is based on the book by Nicholas Sparks so of course, you are going to cry haha. But the parts that make you cry make the movie even better and more genuine. I have watched this movie over and over again and I still can't get enough of it. Everyone should see this.

I loved everything about the movie until Mandy Moore's character, Jamie, died. I couldn't believe it had to end like that!,but by her dying, it really showed Landon's love for her. After all he married her when he knew she was going to die!!!!!!!! How romantic and sad is that????!!! Anyways, this movie makes me cry every time, but I loved it so much that I had to buy it.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3QVPHPMZ0M65Z	Jim Theesfeld	Being a 15 year old boy I'd have to same with some degree of certainty that these types of movies are not my 'thing'. I'm the typical Star Wars meets Die Hard: With a Venghence type movie goer. So I snuck the movie down to my room (lest I should be teased by my family for watching a chick flick)to watch because..well, not to sound crass, but Mandy Moore is hot. The movie has a fairly well developed story line, and the acting seemed OK to me. Most of the negative reviews here say the acting was weak, and I just don't see how. Quite seriously, it gave me watery eyes and as I said before, I'm a 15 year old boy with a penchant for action video games and sensless violence movies. So I'd say that makes the movie worth watching. For the parent out there - I recomend forcing your teenage son to watch this movie. It's great.	4.0	Good movie	2003-11-23	11	10	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2OA16X68B1G25	J-Kwon	"Many have tried and failed to crossover into acting, but surprisingly Mandy Moore has done an incredible job.  We all know that she is talented in terms of sining but in acting?? Well I thought her acting ability was questionable until I saw this movie.I was blown away!I though the movie was great but I don't know if I can give her all the credit, this was based on a true story.  I think that part of the realism really helped Mandy Moore.  I felt that she was really able to make a connection with the audience and relate the true emotions of this true life story just as she does in concert.It is inevitable to make comparison's to other great singers that have had great success in crossing over to acting.  First you have one of the greatest DIVA's in Mariah Carey in ""Glitter"" I loved that movie so much I purchased two copies. One to watch and one to keep in it's original packaging (I think this might be a better investment than Star War's action figures). I think Mariah Carey opened the door for musician's who want to crossover.But I must make one more comparison and that is to the greatest crossover talent that the Universe has ever known ""Vanilla Ice"" starring in ""Cool as Ice"".  This man brought the rap scene to the main stream. This man coined the such great one liners ""Drop the Zero and get with the Hero"" and ""Too the Extreme"". How can one not make any comparison's I ask you.  This man opened the door the for other talent's such as Eminem (In my opinion not as talented he can't even dance). Eminem = Vanilla Ice the Return or just ""VI 2""ALL HAIL THE KING OF CROSSOVER'S ""VANILLA ICE"" IN ""COOL AS ICE"""	5.0	Mind Blowing A Must Have	2002-07-28	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1FML9FCUPV6TI	J. M. Zuurbier	Mandy Moore and Shane West shine in this truly touching movie, based from the novel written by Nicolas Sparks. Mandy Moore plays Jamie, an honest and devout Christian who has good morals and a good head on her shoulders. Jamie is picked on in high school by the popular crowd, in which Landon (Shane West) is a part of. Based on a prank/accident, Landon is the only one caught of his friends and he is punished by being forced to tutor the handicapped, janitorial tasks, and to take part in a play. Jamie has written the music for the play, and at first Landon and Jamie don't get along, he is concerned with his image and the perception others have of him. He grows past this and realizes he has deep feelings for Jamie. Jamie has a list of things she wants to accomplish in life, and Landon helps her acheive some of them. However, Jamie's dad is a minister who does not approve of Landon, but slowly Landon wins him over and her dad lets him take her on a date. Jamie and Landon fall in love. Through the story we learn of Landon's estranged relationship with his father. Before Jamie and Landon start dating, she tells him he has to promise not to fall in love with her, but ultimately he does and she confesses that she is dying of leukemia. Feeling ashamed she pushes him away and he is so torn about what to do, he goes to his father and they patch up their differences when he offers to pay for home care for Jamie. Landon makes her a telescope, and they see a shooting star. In the end Jamie and Landon marry, and she dies later in the summer. He ends up going to medical school like he planned, and realizes through her father that he was the miracle that she saw in her life. Overall I was really moved by this movie in a very emotional way, it really touched my heart. One of my favorite movie, good performances all around.	5.0	So Emotional	2003-03-03	7	6	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A13BZOXAC3RQ46	"Jo28 ""jo28"""	"Having read this book and loved it, I had no idea what to expect when I went to see the movie.  I was especially uneasy about the movie being transplanted into the 90's, I felt it could lose a great deal in translation.  Happily, my fears were unfounded.  Instead of bowing to all the traditional bents of a teen movie, A Walk to Remember stayed sweet and touching, just like the book.Mandy Moore is excellent as Jamie, the goody-two shoes misfit with a big heart.  She brings the character alive in a way strikingly similar to how I imagined her.  Shane West, meanwhile, has a most memorable performance here, as Landon Carter, first as a member of the in crowd, who has no plans for life beyond weekends and then as a young person in love.Sweet, touching, and emotional, this is a beautiful movie.  And whether or not it is considered a ""teen"" movie, I highly recommend it to people of all ages."	5.0	Sweet movie about first love.	2002-06-30	1	1	0

This movie is about true love and a bad-boy discovering that there is much more to life than partying and drinking.  When Landon  (Shane West) is forced to work on the school play, and needs help to learn his lines, he is forced to ask for help.  He convinces Jamie (Mandy Moore) to help him, and through her he begins to see that life is too precious to waste.  This story really fits the title, as Shane West's character finds a new path for his life, and the ensuing transformation is really moving.  This movie will help you to remember the important things in life, and will remind you to treasure the ones that you love.

(And I don't cry at a lot of movies.)  I was impressed with how the filmmakers stayed VERY true to the book and only updating what was absolutely necessary for time period's sake.  Mandy Moore was great, and I wasn't that big a fan of hers before.  Shane West (hubba-hubba by the way!) did a good job of the rebel-turned-nice guy...one of my girlfriend's sisters named her baby after that character.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1L9PISQC7S4NC	Jon R.	The plot of this movie, although ending on a sad note, is one that delivers a message rarely seen these days. It is truly a good wholesome story that any age group can enjoy. This film sends a few messages telling the viewer that peer pressure can be overcome and a person can turn their life around. This film also inspires the viewer that in this day and age it is okay to practice a faith and fully open yourself up to someone. In today's society more often than not the emphasis is placed on drugs, violence and sex. This film casts all that aside and focus's on the ability for love to prevail in the any situation no matter how unlikely the circumstances, and how it can inspire someone to change their life for the better. While this is a fictional story the underlying messages are extremely realistic rather than idealistic and can be adopter by anyone that cares enough to try. I would highly recommend that every parent have their child watch this movie to help explain how precious and great life can be when inspired by the right people. Mandy Moore triumphantly emerges as America's innocent sweetheart heart in the character of Jamie Sullivan' and while Moore's career in music and film hasn't been the most successful, she has clearly delivered one of the recently more meaningful roles through this film. Movies and stories like this are what America needs to start trying to mold the youth of society for a brighter future.	5.0	A film of rare quality and substance	2013-07-06	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2A3D0ESBYQ0HE	Josie	I read the book &quot;A Walk to Remember.&quot;  Shane West and Mandi Moore did exceptional jobs at making these characters come to life.  For an acting debut, Mandi Moore was excellent in the role of Jamie and captured Jamie's innocence beautifully. Shane West shows enormous range as an actor in this role as he comes of age in this beautiful story. I am hoping to see him in many future roles.  It is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again and in some way, will become a part of you. It will lift your spirits, and take your breath away.	5.0	UNFORGETTABLE	2003-01-30	2	2	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2AC90XOFWEHH2	Joy M.	I first read the novel by nicholas sparks, and decided to give the movie a shot.  This is one of the few movies that has truly moved me in ways I never imagined.  It is nice to finally see a movie which accurately reflects people my age.  So many believe teens are only like those seen in the recent crude teen movies.  The wonderful acting creates a feeling in the audience as if these two actors are truly in love.  It is a refreshing look at first and true love.  Anyone and everyone should give this movie a shot.  It is incredible!  Mandy Moore and Shane West do a wonderful job.  Bravo!	5.0	A movie that truly moves the soul	2002-08-28	3	2	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AWEOR1WZSMBEZ	"""juj"""	It's Capital C!  No, it's not 'cancer' as you already know, but 'cheesy!'  it cannot get any cheesier than that.  An impossible love affair (popular boy & a social outcast girl) with Mandy Moore singing one of her own songs in full  (She just had to sing)& a string of romantic scenes with a famous backgrounder.However, it comes to me as a great relief to finally view a teen movie with heart & values unlike other teen-flicks which gorge on sex, drugs & foul languages.  Finally, a movie that teens can watch & learn from.If you want to view a more serious version of this film (e.g. serious acting), I suggest you watch Leeli Sobieski's movie.  She shares the same fate as Mandy a.k.a. Jamie.  Unfortunately, I do not remember the film's title, so you just have to search for it yourself.	4.0	It's about time...	2002-07-23	2	0	2

And wow am I glad I did see it! I cannot seem to get the movie and the music out of my head. Have watched it several times and absolutely love it! There is so much emotion in this movie. The story moves me to tears but is so beautiful and romantic that I have to watch is over and over again. The songs 'Only hope' and 'Cry' are wonderful, but so are the rest of the songs on the soundtrack. I can really recommend this movie to anyone with a romantic heart. It is NOT a teen movie, but for all ages!I would really wish Warner Bros would release the deleted scenes, because I want to see mo(o)re, mo(o)re, mo(o)re. Shane West is the most wonderful hero and Mandy Moore IS Jamie Sullivan.	5.0	A movie I cannot forget! Moved me to tears...	2003-06-24	2	2	0

This movie has without a doubt changed my life...on how I look at people, never again am I to judge a person before I know them! My favourite part would have to be after Jamie's picture is spread throughout the whole school and afterwards outside Landon is hugging her, calling her baby, and being so kind!!!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1IA41WC15HYJC	junghwa Lee	This &#34;film&#34; was equivalent to a bad 70's made-for-TV flick.  I don't know which was more difficult to tolerate, the burned out, contrived plot, the unrealistic dialogue, the melodrama, or the often amateurish performances.  Aside from all that, the entire movie could have been done (and oh, how I wish it had been) in about half the actual running time.  So much of it just seemed like filler. Oh, and is it possible that somebody could make a &#34;plain Jane&#34; movie with a lead actress who ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A PLAIN JANE and not just some hot chick in a bad sweater and pony tail (although I will give them credit that they didn't put her in stodgy glasses)?  If you're really in the mood for this kind of movie, there are probably about a hundred better options out there.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1IC28TYLLRZFQ	Kate	A Walk to Remember is the best movie I've ever seen.  I'm sure you've heard that this is a tear-jerker because it's so sad, well, I balled my eyes out all five times I saw it, but not because it was sad.  I cried with joy, being how real love is in the movie, I mean, A Walk to Remember was the first actual movie that I saw showing love.  I really didn't even know what love was until I saw it.  I'm very obsessed with the movie, having the screensaver on my computer, the movie downloaded onto my computer, the movie poster, my own fan site for it, my binder decorated with pictures and movie stubs from the movie, I post on its message board, I own the book, I think you've gotten the idea.  This movie is definitely worth buying, and watching over and over again.  Mandy Moore and Shane West did a wonderful job, having great chemistry.

Boy meets girl, boy resents girl for being stronger than he is inside, then boy falls for girl because she is everything he wants to be. No darkness, no vampires or shapeshifters needed. There's enough real life drama and life in this story all that other stuff pales in comparison. More movies like this need to be made, to remind us that we aren't vampires, we aren't wolves, we are human beings enduring life, learning about love.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A267KW0PQJ2DXQ	Katie	If you've read the award winning and highly acclaimed book by Nicholas Sparks, you already know that the story is extremely touching and emotional.  The movie is a wonderful interpretation of the book.  This is an unusual case when I loved both the book AND the movie.  The movie, directed by Adam Shankman, was well done without going over the top.  This is a sweet story that leaves even the most hard-hearted in tears.  There are funny moments though, in thanks for the most part to the character of Eric, Landon's best bud.The acting is phenomenal and the characters and plot are well-developed.  Mandy Moore and Shane West are amazing in their portrayals of Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter, respectfully.This movie is sure to become an instant classic and it's a terrific addition to your own movie collection.	5.0	A Movie That Can't Be Forgotten	2002-07-14	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A33Y4RA1XC0WT1	Kayla	where to begin...ah, yes.  i saw 'a walk to remember' in theaters earlier this year, even though i didnt actually want to see it.  if it wouldnt've been the only thing out at the time, i probably would've never saw it.  after i started watching it, i was extremely glad that we had decided to go see it.  i cried so hard during the whole last half of the movie, and so did my mom and my friend.  we still couldnt stop crying after it was over and we were driving home.  this is not a bad thing, dont get me wrong.  it is such a cool movie, and everyone should see it!  on top of the greatness, the music is sooo overwhelmingly cool!  when i got home from the movies, i downloaded all the songs and listened to them over and over!  also, mandy moore rocks and so does shane west!  the first day it came out on video, we HAD to rent it again, so we did.  and i quote my mom, 'the whole &quot;not-crying&quot; thing didn't work...'  i really need to buy the movie AND soundtrack...but there are money constraints, so i rented it online and should be arriving soon!  i cant wait!  once again, 'a walk to remember' is one of my favorite movies, and you have to be crazy to turn down the oppurtunity to see it!	5.0	I love it!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1V8BM46HQ5LHL	Keith Rose	When my girlfriend first told me she wanted to see this movie, I avoided it for as long as possible. When she finally got me to watch it in early July I regretted waiting so long. It started off just like every other teen movie in the world, but that pace quickly changed. We see popular kid Landen Carter (Shane West) receive a &quot;fitting punishment&quot; for being seen drinking on school campus on a Saturday night. This punishment includes janitorial work, tutoring disadvantaged students, and taking part in the Drama Club's spring play. During all these events, he runs into the immensely unpopular Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore). We see Landen change over the course of the movie as he spends more and more time with Jamie, and we come to realize that they're falling in love. A surprise twist complicates their deep and true love for one another, and the ending almost left even me, an 18 year old male, in tears. This movie is most definately a must see. You'll love it as much as I do.	5.0	One of my new favorites	2002-07-13	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A35TZP9EQJ0BA5	Kelly	"After watching this movie, I knew my daughter had to see it.  This movie is about true love - but there are a lot of movies about true love.  This movie is about young love - but there are a lot of movies like that too.  Somehow though, this movie shines in the portrayal of the characters by the teen actors who do a wonderful job of bringing Nicholas Sparks' hero and heroine to life.  For once, I saw the movie before I read the book.  I knew I had to read the book after watching the movie though, because rarely does a movie make me sit there sobbing with a box of tissues.  The book and movie are very different from one another though, for example, in the book, the setting is in the 1950's but the movie is current.  But the overall storyline is the same and the emotions they evoke are also the same.  I even went so far as to look up a script of the movie, and that is also very different from either the book or the movie.  So there are really three versions of this story out there but all of them have the same theme.My 14 year old daughter loved this movie so much, I had to buy it immediately from Amazon (she saw it online via a movie website).  I wanted her to see it because it is a teen love story that does not include sex.  Landon (played by Shane West) and Jamie (played by Mandy Moore) are thrown together through a series of circumstances that allows them to realize there is more to a person than what they see on the outside.  Jamie is plain, the daughter of the reverend at Landon's church.  She dresses almost nun-like and always carries her bible wherever she goes.  Landon hangs with the popular crowd and they don't hesitate to show their disdain for Jamie at every opportunity.  Even though Jamie tells Landon ""you must promise not to fall in love with me"" as a condition when he asks her for help, somehow he finds himself doing exactly that.  Suddenly he sees himself and his so-called friends through her eyes and realizes Jamie is not the one that should have a big L painted on her forehead, they are.  There is another twist in the story though, and Landon shows that he is truly a changed person.  She is touched by his attempts to help her accomplish her ""life list"", while through her love, she helps him mend his life - his relationship with his father, his future, and even his friends.This movie should be watched for the story.  There are several small editing mistakes you might catch if you watch it as often as I have.  It is not a masterpiece of cinematography or special effects.  It DOES have a great soundtrack though, with songs by Mandy Moore, as well as Switchfoot and others.  Her solo in the school play ""Only Hope"" is a sweet song which you understand the lyrics to only after you finish watching the movie.Now go watch the movie, but grab a box of tissues first, you'll need it!"	5.0	A must-watch for teens (and romantics!)	2010-07-21	3	2	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1GGCWUB5UY2NG	Kelly Spink	This movie was romantic; a definite chic flick. The plot was predictable, but it was nice. I think true love is demonstrated very well. However, for Christians, it is a little disappointing that she would marry a man who has not professed Christ as his Savior. Although the change in his life could be proof of that happening, it was never directly stated. I would recommend this movie for a sleepover with my girlfriends.	4.0	Nice but predictable	2013-05-03	0	0	0

I'm not into real mushy stuff... but I thought it was great. I am a Christian, so I thought that this movie not only reached out with how cute it was, but a good-firm-Christian background. It wasn't all about God, in fact, that was just a minor detail. But, I loved Jamie. She had so much faith in everything she did. Then comes Landon. This screw-up popular kid. It's so cool that he gets in trouble and has to do everything she participates in. So, they hook up! I loved it that he really got into her and didn't care if she was a loser. Go see it!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AI9S8KX39N7SR	"""kkat032"""	This is a great movie filled with romance and tragedy. Mandy Moore makes a great apperance in her first star role as Jamie Sullivan in this movie. Shane West is also a great actor. It is about a girl who has cancer that falls in love with her total opposite. It is a beautiful movie. I have also read the book and I love the book too. I cannot chose a favorite because they really are two different stories. They both have the same plot but the main events are different. This movie makes things that don't seem possible so real. It is so obvious that there was so much chemistry on set. That makes a great movie. Another thing that really makes this movie what it is is the fact that it is not your basic average teen movie. This is filled with less fantisized real issues that people have to deal with. During this movie I have felt every emotion possible. I could not stop crying at the end. If you don't think Mandy Moore can be a good actress, give her a chance and see this movie. She is not like Mariah who came from singing to acting. Mandy Moore has a natural talent of acting. This is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who is searching for a great movie to check out.

I saw some of this movie on television but I didn't see it all; and that's were I got fooled. When I bought the movie I had no idea, I just thought it was a minor romance movie which I can tolorate, but not one that would have a depressing story.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1QCAFP6OK5IY2	KW	One of the best movies I have seen in years, easily the best this year. I rate it right up there with &quot;Jerry McGuire&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; in the dramatic romance genre. Don't let the young actors fool you, this is a mature, heartfelt story that in many ways surpasses the novel it was based on. Karen Janszen did an amazing job on the screen play bringing the best elements of the novel to the film, yet adding so much more. Mandy Moore gave the performance of a lifetime, she quiets any critics that might say a pop singer can't act. It would be hard to find an recent performance by an actress that was so well executed and believable. She really became the Jamie and her brief singing in this movie show us even more so why she should be a star. Shane West gave an excellent performance of a very complicated character. Not at all what you'd expect from the previews or the first few minutes of the film, this movie has a depth an emotion that is hard to find these days in film. A remarkable film that I had to rewind and watch over again because it was so good.	5.0	Amazing	2002-07-07	8	7	1

It started off ok, it wasn't bad, wasn't great. Somewhere 15 to 20 minutes into the film it started gaining more and more depth till I almost thought I was watching an entirely different film. I will admit some of the high school stuff was not really original, but the love story between the 2 main characters was where the real magic took place. Their willingness to overcome the adversity of Jamie's(Mandy Moore) preacher father played by Peter Coyote, the mocking of Lance's(Shane West) friends. It makes you believe in love all over again.Can't say enough about this, it truly touched me. Shane West was both likable and heartfelt, Mandy Moore was sweet without being fake or overdoing it. I can't really see how someone would not walk away from this feeling something for these characters. It was warm and charming, hopeful and courageous.	3.0	Wow!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is another one of those bad boy/good girl movies that manages to transcend the fact that we have seen this story dozens of times.  The bad boy is Landon Carter (Shane West), who runs with the popular crowd and is responsible for a dare than has tragic consequences.  The principal decides Landon needs to meet some new people are orders him to help the janitors, tutor at the grade school, and join the drama club.  That last one is important because it brings the bad boy and the good girl together, but the idea that the principal can put the &quot;bad boy&quot; into the school's big production where he can ruin it for everybody else bothers me big time.The good girl is Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), the daughter of a widowed reverend, who stands apart at school because she carries her Bible and always wears the same blue sweater.  Although she is the subject of looks and comments from Landon's crowd, she never bat's an eye because she really does not care what others think about her; she has a numbered list of what she wants to do during her life.  The film does not make a lot out of the fact that Jamie is a Christian, but it is certainly a key part of her as a person.  What I liked is that Jamie is a &quot;good&quot; Christian, by which I mean that she not only embodies her faith but that she does so without pushing it on anybody else.  The stereotype in films is for Christians to be judgmental and superior, which constitutes an implicit attack on such characters.  The character of Jamie might be too good to be true, but she is what makes this film work.More importantly, she gets the great line.  Early on in the film as Landon continues to take shots at her, Jamie looks him up and down, makes a couple of totally on target remarks and finishes him off with the declaration, &quot;You act only works on an audience.&quot;  It is one of those lines that makes you sit up and take notice, whether you are watching the film or simply the character at whom it was targeted.  Meanwhile, he has the most romantic moment in the film, when he fulfills one of the items on her list (being in two places at once).  Ultimately what makes &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; so differen from your standard teenage films is that it is about romance and not sex.  Hopefully some of the teenage males who watch this film will get a clue on what romance means and how powerful it can be.  But I have to worry that your average teenager is not in a position to appreciate a movie like this where the teenagers are intelligent and written that way.For this 2002 film the novel by Nicholas Sparks, which was set in 1958, is told in the &quot;present&quot; (it is not linked to any particular year).  I was fortunate that once again I was oblivious to the big twist and did not know it was coming even before the opening credits.  My biggest hint that something was amiss was when we find out what is #1 on Jamie's list and I did not think it was big enough to have the top spot.  Of course, in the end it all makes sense.  My only complaint with the end is that when we get to the obvious thing that needs to be said it just gets said and I was expecting it to get punched up for the grand finale.  It would not have been that hard: Landon gives the Reverend Sullivan one of the two important books in Jamie's life, so the Reverend should have given Landon the OTHER book and in it would have been that which needed to be said.	4.0	A particularly good girl reforms a quite romantic bad boy	2004-02-22	22	19	3

Was never really a fan of Mandy Moore but this movie has made me appreciate her work, the songs she sings on the soundtrack are very catchy. The rest of the soundtrack is excellent, songs that fit very well with the theme of the movie. A great movie at a great price.	5.0	great movie	2009-03-20	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1IWWRZJOXOSYP	Lee Armstrong	This was an enjoyable movie to watch.  Nicholas Sparks' 2nd novel to be brought to the screen, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; being the first, is not innovative, but it is touching.  What I enjoyed most was seeing Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) be a girl who had strong religious beliefs and was true to them.  She didn't sacrifice what she thought was right to be popular, didn't lapse into anger at God as a result of her illness, and yet experienced life to its fullest including falling in love and marriage.  Her character is a stunning study in faith-based lifestyle.I also enjoyed the transformation of Landon Carter (Shane West) from a troubled kid, adjusting from a divorce to a young man inspired by love to accomplish his best, becoming a medical doctor.  Because of these two main characters, those who substitute negativity for depth will consider the movie shallow; and those who equate sleaze with style will consider the movie unfashionable.  But in reality, it is the best of both because it's an inspiration that calls to the best in each of us.That said, it's not a perfect film.  West achieves a better handle on his role, adding more nuance and dimension than does Moore.  However, she certainly makes Sullivan come to life.  Peter Coyote gives another concrete performance as Reverend Sullivan.  Daryl Hannah does a great job as mother Cynthia Carter. Living in North Carolina, I enjoyed Mandy Moore ordering sweet tea, but wondered about the outside cafe next to the water and how many mosquitoes they had to swat shooting the romantic scene.  As a theatre instructor, I was also unhappy that Landon had to be sentenced to being in a play which made it seem like punishment!  Adam Shankman did a great job of direction.  You have to walk into a project like this knowing that you're going to get your hits from those who want to watch cop cars collide and more graphic romance.  He delivered what was needed; this film fires successfully and touches the heart.  The VHS version includes the Mandy Moore music video after the feature which has universes gliding by Shane West's head.  Enjoy!	4.0	True Blue	2002-07-15	0	0	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A19RAJY6R7USN0	"Lee Neville ""emotionboy"""	You get romantic comedies like &quot;She's All That&quot;, and you get romantic dramas like &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot;. &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is one of the latter. You also get movies designed to promote popstars such Britney Spears and &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Thank God this isn't a movie like that. Speaking of God, this movie does feature Christian values but in a non-preachy way. The movie is simply about having faith in what you believe in. I'd never read the novel before hand so I had no previous notion of what this movie should be about. I watched it in a non-cynical way and with an open mind. I discovered that Mandy Moore was fantastic, as was Shane West. I'd already seen much of Shane West's work in tv and film so I was able to maintain my respect for the actor here. Mandy Moore though is more than a popstar and quite an accomplished actor. I'd only seen her in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, and now after seeing this I want to see more of her. &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is unashamedly romantic. Ignore all the negative reviews regarding this movie and accept it for what it is.As for the DVD itself. The commentary by the original author and screenplay writer is fascinating. The other commentary featuring Mandy Moore, Shane West and the director is quite cluttered at the beginning with them talking over each other, but after a while they do get used to giving their commentary, and there is a seemingly nice bond between the three. The DVD also features the trailer and a music video from Mandy Moore. It would have been nice if there was a featurette and some deleted scenes which apparently do exist but were omitted from this DVD. However all in all, the movie itself is worth the buy. &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is a movie to remember. Brilliant!	5.0	A Movie To Remember!	2002-09-17	5	5	0

I was expecting something that was a let-down when it came to purity, but it wasn't and I can honestly say that I loved A Walk to Remember. :)The Top 5 Reasons to Go Out and Purchase This Film(No Particular Order)1. It is almost totally clean and that makes it a film viewable for teenagers (like myself) and other members of the family, thus, having the capability to be dubbed a family film.2. Outstanding performances all around, Mandy Moore and Shane West were especially superb in their roles.3. The music was great, Mandy Moore has a beautiful voice, and they also even used a Christian artist. :)4. If you love sweet stories that also incorporate a bit of sorrow into the storyline, or you just love great films.5. If you read the book and hoped that they would make it into a film.Overall:There were a few things that I didn't like about it so it wasn't perfect,  but it was fabulous, so I still give it five stars. :)	5.0	Superb...	2003-06-01	0	0	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2K3Y1WCXX3V35	Lindsay	"Contrary to my own advice, I saw ""A Walk to Remember"" in the theater before I read the book. It made me cry. That may not seem like the most unusual thing, but a movie has never made me cry before. I am a teenager, so I take great interest in the way Hollywood portrays people my age. Watching movie after movie where the teen leads jump right into bed (without any forethought) gets wearisome. This movie was totally different.I am an avid Mandy Moore fan, but I had some doubt as to whether she could act well. I was blown away by Mandy's acting ability, and I can't wait to see what she does next. Mandy portrays Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of a strict Southern Baptist minister, with the skill of an Oscar veteran. She uses her amazing singing voice to accentuate a character that could easily become too sweet and good. I was also impressed with Shane West's performance. He makes you see that even though Landon Carter hasn't always done the right thing in the past, he can change.As a final note, I recommend the soundtrack and the original novel in addition to this film. The soundtrack will bring back all your favorite scenes from the movie with its mix of genres. The novel will tell a slightly different version of the story, but leave you feeling satisfied."	5.0	A refreshing deviation from the norm	2002-07-29	0	0	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A38UOJPP7M2EBK	Lindsay	I absolutely loved this DVD. The story is so touching, sweet, and innocent, that I couldn't help but love it. The main characters were extremely well cast and believable, especially Mandy Moore. She totally captured the innocentness and wisdom of Jamie Sullivan. I was so relieved to find that this wasn't another of those &quot;ugly duckling turns into a swan&quot; makeover type movies, but that Landon (Shane West) accepted Jamie as she was, and loved her for who she was. I admired Jamie so much for not letting other people's opinions bother her. She is truly aninspiration. This is a movie that truly deserves praise. I givekudos to Mandy Moore for not picking just any old role topromote her singing career (like others do), but a movie thatreally meant something. She is not at all like other &quot;popprincesses&quot;, and she stands apart from them because of herbeautiful voice, and her respect for herself.	5.0	So Moving That I Cried	2002-07-29	2	1	1

I mean first you got the popular, high school hunk and than you got the unpoplular, shy, outcast. Than you see when they do come together the difficulties facing them.I wish I had a guy like Lnadon Carter to do thoughs kind things for me like he did for Jamie Sullivian. And i just loved it when he... well i wont say, but belive me youll love it.This movie will make you laugh and cry. But mostly you will cry. You should definetly watch this movie. I love it so much when I rented it the next week I went out of town and saw the book version(the book was written first and the movie was based on it) and I bought it right off the bat.

Landon Carter (Shane West)is a popular boy and Jamie Sullivan is a very unpopular girl whose faith is important to her. Gradually the two fall in love- demonstrating that despite their differences in ideas about life and religion, lessons can be learnt from one another and that everybody can have hope. Before Landon even realises he may not be able to be with Jamie forever (without giving away too much), he helps her to fullfill her &quot;wish list&quot; whilst simultaneously and unwittingly proving that miracles do not always have to be &quot;sudden acts of religious magic&quot;. The film has a million messages to take from it including hope, judgement, true meanings of love etc. It sounds like mushy teenage stuff but it really does carry very deep themes and it is the most touching film I have ever seen. The sound track is damn good too- a refreshing blend of pop, rock and ballards.	5.0	This should be called a FILM to remember!!	2003-07-30	4	4	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2R500JIE1D27O	L. Johnson	"This movie is based on the book by Nicholas Sparks (author of The Notebook, Message In A Bottle, The Rescue, A Bend In The Road).  Each spring in the little port town of Beaufort, North Carolina, Landon Carter remembers his senior year at Beaufort High and Jamie Sullivan, the girl who ""changed his life."" Serious, conservative, daughter of a preacher, Jamie (Moore) was as far from cool- and didn't care.  Landon (West) hung with the in-crowd as an aimless, moody, reckless guy who breezed through school on looks and bravado and had no plans, no future and no faith in himself. When a prank goes wrong and lands a kid in the hospital, Landon is assigned to tutor a young student on the weekends and participate in the Drama Club's spring play. Clearly in over his head with both assignments, Landon is forced to ask Jamie for help. Soon, against his own expectations and the scorn of his friends, Landon finds himself falling in love with this outwardly plain girl who possesses a passion for life he never imagined possible.Though critics gave this move an average of D+, I have to say even now this movie still makes me cry (if I sit still and watch it ... getting up and coming back sort of destroys the vibe). It's a passionate movie that reminds you of pure love and beauty without being tainted by sex.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Another Amazon reviewer who has consistently given me good recommendations, directed me to this movie.  I'm glad he did because had he not, I might never have watched because this movie appears to be just another maudlin teen movie.  Instead I found the story to be sensitive and compelling.We are introduced to Landon Carter (Shane West) at the very beginning of the movie.  Landon is one of the ""popular"" crowd, and he and several other teenagers have challenged another teenager to jump into a pool of water, where he immediately becomes injured.  I quickly disliked Landon and had him pegged as shallow with too much time on his hands; his only goal was to have fun.  During the initial portion of the movie I struggled to keep watching because Landon's character was too stereotypical and too shallow.  Landon is the kind of person I avoided in high school.Soon we meet Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore).  Jamie is everything that Landon is not.  She is serious and focused.  She is involved and has goals.  It's also immediately apparent that Jamie is considered a geek and is about as far from being popular as a high school person can be.  Yet, I found Jamie to be far more interesting than Landon, and once she was introduced I started to become interested in the story.At first I thought that Landon was going to spend a fair amount of time trying to have sex with Jamie.  He started his relationship in just that way.  Jamie has a healthy dose of skepticism for the motives of ""popular"" males and sees his advances for what they are.  Jamie intrigues Landon.  She is everything he is not.  Landon likes her self-assurance, her goals for the future.  In spite of his background, he finds himself falling for her.Jamie, on the other hand, is the daughter of Reverend Sullivan, played by Peter Coyote.  Initially it appeared that the Reverend was a very restrictive father, particularly since Jamie is not allowed to date.  Eventually Landon talks with Reverend Sullivan and asks him if Jamie can go to dinner with him.  While Reverend Sullivan is at first reluctant, he senses Landon's sincerity and relents, with strict admonition regarding the time that Jamie must be home.We are soon deeply involved in the romance between Jamie and Landon.  Jamie shares her goals with Landon, some of which he tries to make come true.  One of my favorites was Jamie's goal of being in two places at once.  Landon figures a cool way of making it happen.  Jamie has a lengthy list of goals, a number of which Landon makes come true.Eventually we find that Jamie has a secret that she reluctantly must share with Landon.  Rather than pushing Landon away, Jamie's secret causes Landon to fall so deeply in love with Jamie that the rest of the movie is incredibly, wonderfully beautiful and poignant.I puzzled for much of the first part of the movie to figure out what this movie was really about.  Was it about Landon?  Was it about Jamie?  Was it about the two of them together?  It took me until the end of the movie to realize that the central character was always Landon.  Jamie remains the same person from the beginning to the end, a beautiful soul.  Landon starts the film as a shallow person, but changes his life to one of purpose by his exposure to Jamie.  We see Jamie fill Landon with a sense of resolve that will carry him through the rest of his life.After having seen so many awful teen movies, it was wonderful to find one that treated teenagers as people with hopes, dreams and goals.  Jamie's secret is profound and sad, but Jamie's secret was but one step in Landon becoming a sensitive man with goals of his own.  Therein lays the beauty of this movie.  It recognizes that all things beautiful require evolution, and the love that Jamie and Landon share evolves naturally versus a single event that pushes the two toward love.  I strongly recommend this movie for teenagers and older family members, avoiding the younger members of the family due to some of the situations and profanity.  Just be sure to have a box of tissues handy."	5.0	Poignant, Sensitive Story	2004-01-08	5	5	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3AXSQVR4BWJCI	Loves old books	It is hard to believe Hollywood is capable of producing something as beautiful and uplifting as this movie and yet chooses to immerse the viewing public in garbage 90% of the time. Many secular critics panned A Walk to Remember, a fact which underscores the mentality and agenda Hollywood and the media have to reduce our culture and society to the lowest common denominator. Fortunately, the viewing public has more intellect and much more class and good taste than these so-called media &#34;experts.&#34; This film has met with much popular success and acclaim and justifiably so. It would be difficult to oversell this movie or find adequate expression of its greatness. It is a beautiful story of faith, love, and redemption. The emphasis is on strength of character and good, old-fashioned integrity -- something we do not hear much about anymore. The writing and characterization are superb, the acting exceptional. I am sorry it took me 10 years to discover this movie, as I could watch it 10 times over and discover some new beautiful nuance of meaning or expression each time. This is the kind of love story they don't make anymore and one you will never forget.	5.0	Unforgettable	2014-01-04	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AGLO95OCA0ZDE	L. Schmitz	"O.K., O.K. everyone has said that the book is WAY better than the movie, so I won't go over that ground, just know that it is comparing apples to oranges.  While the book was wonderful, the movie was just O.K.  I know that it is probably impossible to recreate and recapture the feelings of a romantic novel in movie form.  There is so much introspection involved with a novel.  Things that cannot be ""seen,"" Thoughts that cannot be acted out etc...which are the basis of Sparks' books.  So, for that, I can understand how a movie cannot be the same, or have as much feeling as the book.However, to include the opening scene, which I hated, and the scene with the ""computer generated"" picture of ""Jaime,"" was taking away time that could be so much better utilized in developing the chemistry between Jaime and Landon.  In the book I felt it.  In the movie, I didn't believe it.  Not enough time was spent together.  What attracted him to her?  Seeing her in make-up and a dress????  I wanted to know more of Landon's thoughts.  In the book he shares so much of that because he was the narrator.  Are the previous mentioned scenes in there so it will relate to our ""teen culture?""Also, after watching the movie, I wondered what the ""Walk to remember"" was.  So, maybe they should say it is based on his novel and call it something else, especially because they have changed the plot so much.  Of course it is going to disappoint loyal Sparks' fans!I know that Mandy Moore got rave reviews.  I didn't see the reason why.  I saw nothing special in her as I did in the book's character.  Shane West was much better.  He is very handsome and believable, yet I still didn't ""get"" why he fell so quickly in love with her.  There was no explanation of these growing feelings and I felt ""left out"" wondering how they got to that so quickly.  Why would any guy like him want to date the girl who wears old lady clothes and has one sweater???  That's what I was wondering.  If you want to know--go read the book :-)All in all, not terrible.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1D3MXCKV3TZH5	"""lucky_wish23"""	After seeing an add for the movie in the magazines I subscribe to, I thought that since it was based on the best-selling book by Nicholas Sparks, I'd buy the book, then see the movie.  Even though I knew from the beginning of the movie what was going to happen, there were a few surprises along the way.The acting was excellent, especially from Mandy Moore.  I never thought that one of the bubble-gum pop princesses would ever be able to act.  And she sure did a good job, considering MTV viewers voted for her to be the best-breakout female actress!  Way to go Mandy!But we shouldn't forget the male lead, Shane West.  The first song you hear, So What Does it All Mean?, is performed by him and his band, Jonny Was....  Listen closely when he is driving in his car, and you can hear it on the radio.  (I have heard that the car he drives in is his own car theat he used for the movie!)This is a great, classic love story, and isn't a normal teen film.  The chemistry on-set is realistic, you can almost feel the love, and if you're a girl you will fall in love with Shane West, trust me - all of my friends, including me did.I hope you buy, rent, or go see this flick at a second-showing theater, because it's good.  The book is equally as good, and the soundtrack is also to the same level as the movie and book.Hopefully you didn't make the same mistake as me.  I bought the soundtrack before I watched the movie, and when I was in the theater, I was singing along with the movie.  My friends sitting next to me were yelling at me to shut up!Hope you love the movie - and from the poster -She didn't belong.She was misunderstood.And she would change him forever.(cue the music)GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!	5.0	A Great Movie	2002-06-10	4	3	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A7D4GK4GDAI82	Luis Aurelio Torres Salazar	Vi esta pelicula no sin antes plantearme serias dudas acerca de ella, debido al corte juvenil en el cual se incluia musica y la conocida trama de amor... afortunadamente al salir del cine comprobe que no era una de esas otras tantas peliculas. Las actuaciones de Mandy Moore -Jamie Sullivan- y Shane West -Landon Carter- como pareja dispareja para luego formar parte del juego de amor frente a la muerte, imponiendose a los devenires propios de cada personalidad que les corresponde cuenta con una quimica perfecta. Mas alla de las lagrimas o la inesperada enfermedad, la historia gana adeptos a medida que transcurren los minutos.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A17FM1VF1JAA69	Lynzi	First of all... A Walk to Remember is an amazing movie! The plot of the actual movie was so good and the story behind it made this movie incredible. I rated this movie 4 stars because once i started crying i couldn't stop.A lot of the people in the theatre actually started to stare.  The way Shane West treats Mandy Moore is so delicate and you can see that he actually cares. To me, that actually means something. The entire second half of the movie i cried so hard! I couldn't stop and when i came home from the theatres I went to the website and printed off pictures from the movie. While i was viewing the pictures i started to cry again. This movie is so overwhelming and breathtaking. If you are wanting to see a dramatic movie, A Walk to Remember is the one for you. I guarentee it, you will want to watch it over and over again. My boyfriend even said he would have cried if my one friends hadn't started crackin jokes.

I've heard so much about the movie and people are starting to rag on me, having not yet seen it. It's an added bonus that it's on Amazon Prime! And let me tell you, what a gift that is, because I do not recommend that you watch this video ever.Now just because I don't fancy it doesn't mean you won't. After all, look at the average rating; 4.6 stars. That's a pretty ace rating.What I dislike in this film is how unrealistic it is. I suppose it is meant to be romantic--bad boy meets good girl, girl changes boy, boy falls in love because he is spoiled and oppressed and girl is ""different"", girl has tragedy, CAN BOY OVERCOME OBSTACLE FOR LOVE?The answer is yes, ladies and gentleman. Mr Boy here will be the most absolute prince handsome charming gentleboy any dying girl could ever want.Sure, it sounds sarcastic. But that's the movie.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A165JPQFQQAF09	Magneto	"I don't mind admitting it - I'm a 30 year old guy who really likes this film, and if there's one phrase I hate, it's ""chick flick"" - I'd like to get my hands on whoever coined that phrase!. Apart from immediately limiting a film's potential maximum audience once it's been branded a ""chick flick"" (which no doubt this one has), it assumes that guys won't like it. Well I can tell you that not only do a lot of us guys want to see a good romantic film, we also aren't all into action and sci-fi films, we just like a good story. Now I've got that out of the way...A walk to remember seems to get better with each viewing. The first time I saw it I just thought it was ok, but quite cliched. But there are certains elements of the film I really liked, so I watched it again and really enjoyed it. For starters, it nice to see a charming, sweet-natured film that doesn't feel the need to resort to scenes of a sexual nature, or that uses crude/vulgar humor. This alone for me lifts AWTR above your typical ""teen movie"". Then you have great performances from the two leads of Mandy Moore & Shane West, who do the script proud. I particularly like Mandy's character Jamie, who although definitely isn't the coolest person in school, is confident enough about herself to not let other people's opinions worry her (except for one incident in the film). I think it's this personality trait that first appeals to Shane West's character Landon, who *does* worry (initially) what is and isn't perceived as being cool, and often succumbs to peer pressure. It's this transforming of character for Landon that takes him onto ""a walk to remember"".One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Landon takes Jamie to the state line one night and tells her to stand over it. He then tells here that she's in two places at the same time-  thus realizing one of her dreams.  Talk about romantic!. Another scene I like is where Jamie asks Landon to promise not to fall in love with her, which at the time seems a little arrogant  and which Landon laugh's off. It's only later you find out the relevance of her request. I also like the play scene where Mandy sings ""Only hope"". Mandy sings impeccably, looks beautiful, and this is where I believe Landon really falls in love with her.Unfortunately the DVD of AWTR is a little thin on extras. What you do get however is two good commentaries. The first is from Mandy, Shane, and the director Adam Shankman which they all recorded together (doesn't always happen that way). They share anecdotes from making the movie, have a laugh, and generally makes a very entertaining commentary. This is probably the one most people will listen to, but the other is also worth checking out. This second commentary is from the original novelist of AWTR Nicholas Sparks, and Karen Janszen who adapted it for the screen. This commentary is very interesting as they talk about the differences between the book and the movie, how it was adapted for a modern day setting, what they thought of the cast, amongst other things. On the DVD you also get the music video for Mandy Moore's ""Cry"", but that's about it. There's no ""making of"" or behind the scenes stuff. And there's not even any deleted scenes, even though they are mentioned several times on the cast/director commentary track!.AWTR is more a romantic drama than comedy, so those looking for laughs may want to look elsewhere (although Mandy's retort ""God's too busy looking for your brain"" is hilarious!). That said, this is a very good movie, well acted, and the nature of the story should make it appeal to many older viewers - male and female alike - that will lift it above typical teen fare."	4.0	A great old-fashioned love story	2002-07-27	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2CULVDIOC50S4	"""mako4509g1g23"""	"I have to begin by noting that this movie/dvd has already garnered a 5-star rating and over 300 reviews, which isn't bad for prerelease.My personal story is that I made an agreement with this girl: that I would watch this chick flick if she would step in a puddle.  She obviously had the advantage, and I suppose I intended to lose.  Besides, she'd already bewitched me into reading the book, which wasn't too bad by itself.But the movie...it differed so much from the book, and in bad ways.  Landon (the guy) starts out as a very bad character, so it was incredibly unrealistic for him to fall in love with the highly religious Jamie (the girl).  The whole first part of the movie is wasted in my opinion.  The intention must have been to establish Landon's character, but so much more could have been shown of Landon's and Jamie's developing relationship.  In the book, there's the school play and the orphanage that play important roles.  In the movie, there's only the play, and it's lost its religious significance that was so important in the book.The movie also wastes some very good ""lines.""  In the book, Landon asks Jamie for help with his lines (in the school play).  In the movie it's something totally different and Jamie's ""only if you promise not to fall in love with me"" makes no sense at all.  If anything, I would recommend this movie for the ""pure"", ""wholesome"" love story, and the cute things that happen.The saving grace of this movie is the cuteness of it, after Landon and Jamie get together.  Before that, it's horrible, and after...well, I won't spoil it.  They do some very cute things together, so guys, get some ideas from this movie.If you can look past the bad acting, the bad scriptwriting, and the general chick-flick-ness of it all, it's an OK movie.  It may be worth your time.  Add it to your summer movie list, if you have one, and try to look past the faults."	3.0	Well, it's ok I guess....	2002-06-19	7	2	5

I just watched it again several years later and I still liked it, but not quite as much.  I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars but decided to go with 4 because there are some really good moments in this film.Pros:  1. The songs are amazing. 2. The acting is very good overall, except by a few non-key characters.  3.  There are some incredibly sweet, touching moments between the main characters that are just about as good as love stories get nowadays.  4.  It definitely makes you CARE what happens to the characters.  5. It manages to have strong messages about forgiveness, faith, and loyalty without getting preachy.  6.  For once being very modest and religious is not portrayed in a negative light. 7. It's a love story where the hero and heroine don't just jump into bed together at first sight and call it ""love"", which also almost never happens in Hollywood.Cons: (and some may disagree with me on a few of these) 1.  It really bares no resemblance at all to the book it is ""based on"".  2.  There were some very cheezy cliched overdone teen drama moments involving bullying.  3. (And really this is #1 on my personal cons list) this is not a clean film - there is a lot of foul language and even a few scenes of very crude humour which is totally unecessary to the plot and rules out watching this with your kids.  If it had been truly based on the book, it would've been clean enough for a 4 year old.  4.  This is not necessarily a movie you will want to watch over and over, because it's quite bittersweet and can be emotionally difficult to watch."	4.0	Has it's moments	2012-01-26	4	4	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	ACBMADACNYMUS	mandylou80	"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It follows in the tradition of my favorite classic movies and has moral values, unlike so many other movies that are made today. This outlines a perfect love story that many of us are fortunate to have. Unlike what other reviewers may say about this movie, it is not Boring; it isn't only for teenage girls; and someone with ""lucemia"" (which is actually spelled ""leukemia"") COULD sing a song, especially if they are in remission, as Jamie was in the movie.I think it is sad that more people don't appreciate the values, morals , and love that are portrayed in this movie. Jamie is a good example that everyone could be more like. She has her beliefs and stands up for them, even if it means rejection from her peers. If you are considering this movie, don't consider anymore...just buy it!"	5.0	Good morals	2005-04-18	7	6	1
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2VZZUN3DAHCGF	Mandy moore fan!	The best movie i've seen in years.  The movie was very sweet and touching.  I cried when i've seen it, for the 20th time!!!Mandy moore's acting was really really professional.  Shane west's acting was also really professional.  This isn't like any other teen movie.  It's just a sweet love story.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is romantic and enjoys sad and happy movies at the same time!	5.0	Very Very good movie!	2002-09-30	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AVXYKNVXD682E	Manhattan Mom	I had never read the book, so I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  Or so I thought.  This movie has the same plot as about a thousand other movies, and has been done about a thousand times better.  Bad boy meets good girl.  They fall in love against the opposition of friends and family.  Bad thing happens.  Have you seen West Side Story?  Romeo and Juliet?  This movie is nothing but average.  The two stars would be better suited to silent films, because their facial expressions and mannerisms are so exaggerated.  Peter Coyote is totally wasted as Mandy Moore's overprotective father, and Darryl Hannah sleepwalks through her part. If this is best example of what teens of today should be watching, then they should start reading more.	3.0	Been there, done that	2003-11-23	6	0	6

I guess I'll never know since the people I bought them from never sent them. See I'm in Afghanistan and even though I only ordered about $6 worth of stuff, i had to pay around $60 for shipping, that was back in June. Like an idiot I even pay a little more for faster shipping for some of the items. Now I know I'm not important, not a high rank or anything, but I figured that if I got some new headphone and a movie that I might be able to ease the stress of being away from my family and being stuck on a COP out in the middle of no where. The vender that use Amazon most likely figured that since I'm out of the country that I couldn't do anything and he could just keep my money and not send the product, I hope someday that there isn't a soldier standing between him and terrorist that has a life goal of killing as many Americans as he can before he dies. I gave up seeing my son learn how to crawl and risked my worthless life to defend his freedom so the person that sells this product can rip me off.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A225GQXYLH61V9	"Marianne Lawrence ""fruitsbasket crazy"""	This is such a good movie.  When I first saw it I cried the last hour of that movie.  I was just crying and crying.I must admit I was totally blown away not just because it is so good but it was colliding with the book.  I thought it was set in the late 50's not the early 2003 or whenever this movie was made.  I was a little uneasy because it just didnt really parallel with the book.  Of course no movie influenced by a book really follows it.  But there was so many different things added to this or changed.  It never really bothered me until I started wising up.  But I stil love the movie.Now for the positive.  Mandy Moore really shines in this movie with her sweet, compassionate personality.  Jamie Sullivan is young woman who loves God and takes little things, like breathing, walking, or whatever and calls them a blessing.  She is very compassionate and loves life.  She would be a great friend to have.  Just someone to talk to and get advice.  I have yet find someone like that.Shane West really portrays the punk sorta guy who is just getting through life with looks and language.  Throughout this movie you can see a very definite change in his face and his attitude.  In the beginning, to me, I felt like shunning him yet I was drawn to him.  As a Christian, I have those feelings stay away yet get closer.  This movie portrays it well.  Landon Carter is that type of person that makes me want to go out and find people like that and help.All in all, this movie is wonderful and when you see it have a box of kleenex handy because you will need it.  Of course my aunt's boyfriend is real skeptical about the preacher's kid being holy and that's not how usually works but anyways that's a miracle I'm hoping to see.

Unbelievably, some of the negative reviews are dissing the film for lack of foul language.  Whatever they say, profanity does not get my positive attention.  I do my best to ignore it as it is an excuse for something substantive to say.  This film has great dialogue.  Something very much lacking today.Something you will enjoy on the DVD is a pioneering format in the actor's/director's/writer's commentaries.  They really set the example of how it is to be done.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1XWMRORNEC0IY	Martha Moore	I have seen A Walk to Remember several times, and I never grow tired of it.  It is bittersweet but a very beautiful and touching story.  It provides a refreshing and welcome relief from the many movies in which teen badness prevails.  Two high school students of different backgrounds are thrust together, and they soon begin to fall in love.  But it's hard for Landon at first, as he's a cool kid and is afraid of peer pressure over dating a straight-laced, plain-Jane minister's daughter.  But true love soon prevails and becomes stronger when Landon discovers a secret that Jamie has been hiding from him.  Wonderful, powerful performances are delivered by Mandy Moore, Shane West, Peter Coyote, Darryl Hannah, and the supporting cast.  Definitely a movie worth watching and investing a few dollars in.	5.0	One of My Favorite Movies!	2004-06-06	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A36NB20ZMRJV3	Maureen abend	"This movie is trully outstanding for the following reasons:1) It is not your typical teen movie, which mostly showcases foul language, sex and violence, it's a profund spiritual movie about love, faith, setting goals for oneself, and most of all good morals and values (Something that is sorely lacking in teen society today)2) The movie will bring tears to most Carbon-based units eye's, if it dosen't you are trully inhuman and unemotional.3) The love and devotion that Landon shows to Jamie is trully heartfelt, she changes him in such an incredible way, of course he says he loves her...4) Guys, this movie can serve as an example of how girls like ""The Little things too"", the part when Landon brings her to a place where she is in 2 places at once to fullfill one of her things on her list was such a sweet thing to do, Im sure many eyes were tearing at this point...5) The movie really focuses on themes centered around the book, faith, forgiveness, redemption and the desire to fullfill ones goals and dreams...6) The music in the movie was perfectly placed. When Landon proposes to Jamie, the Switchfoot version of ""Only Hope"" comes on.. This is another scene in which you must have your box of tissues ready...7) I was simply paralyzed by Mandy Moore singing ""Only Hope"" Her voice was so angelic, that I was simply unable to change the channel when I first saw it on Satellite TV. She is a far better vocalist than Brittney Spears..8) This move is about love in it's purest form. It forsters itself throughout the movie from a friendship to romantic love between 2 people. The lack of physical intimacy is evident here, it only makes the scenes between West and Moore that much more romantic."	5.0	A true love story, you WILL cry....	2003-02-21	5	4	1

If you've ever read the book; it's more believable and more moving.  Nicholas Sparks is an excellent story teller and brings his characters to life and you can't help but be compelled to finish the book once you've started reading it.  I had hope that the  movie would be like the book but this movie simply borrows the theme from the book and the characters but not much else.  Don't get me wrong, the acting is fine.  However, when you read the book and then watch the movie, you can't help but feel disappointed in the movie.  I recommend that everyone read the book.	3.0	Not even Close to the Book	2013-09-10	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2WKKTVYS5H61M	Mecca Egypt	I must admit, I came into this film with my preconceptions of Mandy Moore and my own criticisms of her body of work, but this film really surprised me. I thought it was going to be a predictable Hollywood lovey-dovey, chick-flick. But it was much more than that. The story kept my attention and the performances were filled with intense emotion. During some parts of the film, it was slow, but it pays off if you stay with the film. Mandy Moore gives a very real and heartwarming performance. Plus, the discovery in the middle of the film is shocking and one that will have you saying &quot;whoa.&quot;The minor characters were forgettable, but Moore and West shine as the two charismatic and attractive leads. Her singing in the film was good and it gave me a new-found sense of respect for Mandy Moore as a valid talent in the industry.Great movie to brighten your day.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I made sure I didn't cry during this movie, although I was expecting to, considering I cried at the movie AND the book of Message In A Bottle. I did get teary though, but not full-blown. Dunno what can be said for my boyfriend, who I was watching it with, who disappeared off to the toilet as soon as the credits rolled! :) (Think I've embarrassed him now?)My mum's had the Nicholas Sparks books for a while now - as soon as a new one is out, she gets it. So far I've only seen the Message In A Bottle movie, and read the book, although I recently bought The Notebook, but haven't had a chance to watch it yet. I definitely hope more of his books get made into movies, as he's rumoured to be writing a sequel to this as well.I was quite shocked seeing Mandy Moore, as I didn't recognise her at first - she looked so young! I'd previously only seen her in Saved, and she had a completely different hairstyle in this, and a terrific makeup artist by the look of things. She looked much like she did when she arrived on the music scene, except she was blonde then. She couldn't complete with the Britneys, Christinas & Jessicas that were around at the time, so she moved into acting, and hasn't looked back! The only quibble I have about Mandy is she seems to sing in the movies I've seen her in, and the characters she plays are always Christian.I wasn't particularly keen on Shane West's character to begin with - he was like every other guy who I've met, who's a complete & utter jerk, and acts differently around their friends, to how they do around you.The movie was shot in North Carolina; many of the sets were from the TV show Dawson's Creek - particularly the school, hospital and Landon's home.I'm definitely going to be reading the book next, and I'll probably read some of Nicholas Spark's other novels, and I'll decide what should be made into a movie next. The inspiration for Jamie Sullivan's character and some of the events in the book/movie; is from Nicholas Sparks' sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis (whom the book and movie are dedicated to). The novel is set in 1958. When Jaimie gives Landon her mother's book she says ""Don't worry, it's not a bible."" In the novel by Nicholas Sparks, Jaimie does give him her mother's bible which has her favorite passages underlined.I did find the ending quite predictable, and although I'm not going to give anything away, I did think it should have finished after they did what they did, rather then five minutes. (Five minutes is a long time when you've been sitting in one position without moving, and you have a dead leg!)The extras on this DVD aren't much to write about, but I'll list them anyway. They include: commentary by Shane West, Mandy Moore and Adam Shankman; commentary by director Nicholas Sparks and screenwriter Karen Janszen and music video ""Cry"" by Mandy Moore.I watched this movie at my boyfriend's, although I'd already had it on my wishlist, I'm definitely going to buy it for myself now! It's one of those movies which needs to be watched again & again - plus my mum now wants to see it.

Anyone who has not seen it has missed out on SO much! i'm a big movie fan and have seen lots of films, but this story has so much depth and love that it could very well be THE Romeo and Juliet story of our time. The characters were superb and the actors were amazing. Mandy Moore and Shane West showed me their true colors while acting in this film and showed me that this could very well be the best movie of all time.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A332XJP6CGOBJY	Meg	When my friend told me about this movie, I was a bit surprised that Mandy Moore was a lead. My friend convinced me to spend my money and see it... So, not expecting much, I sat down to my popcorn and wondered how long it would be.... then the movie started.....I cryed for the better part of the movie!!! It was one of the best teen movies ever!! It doesn't have the crued jokes you find in teen movies, nor the unbelievable love stories. Jamie and Landon are two totally different people who come together in a play, and fall in love.... After the movie I ran out to Borders and grabbed the book. The book, though different from the movie, was just as good, even better!!!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A275WB4PYH6227	"Mian Sukiman ""M Suk"""	A Walk to remember, starring Mandy Moore and Shane West. It is far better thanthe other 2 with similar theme, Autumn In NY (with Richard Gere &amp; Winona Ryder) and Here on earth (Josh Hartnet). Given her first starring role, Mandy Moore shines like a star. She will have a wonderful career both acting and singing.The story is nothing that you haven't seen before about a popular high school student who falls in love with not-so popular nerdy type student who happens to be the reverend's daughter. Both stars make the movie so entertaining. Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah play the kid's parents. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the last 15 minutes or so, which I found a little bit slow which distract the pacing of the whole movie.The DVD itself is pretty good. Two commentaries were provided. One by the director and the stars. The other by the crew. The picture transfer is beautiful and the Dolby 5.1 gives you nothing accept for the loud opening credit. But the surround sound is not the major thing in a movie of this kind. Anyway you like &quot;She's All That&quot;, this is a better. Recommended.	4.0	Sweet movie, Check it out  !	2002-07-10	7	5	2

Story line is better than the acting and it's a typical Sparks tearjerker. But having not read the book, the conflict regarding the heroine's physical situation caught me by surprise. One of the greatest lines is, &#34;Perhaps God has a better plan for my life than I do.&#34; Ya think?Try it - you'll like it, even if (like me) you're not really into chik fliks.	4.0	Typical Sparks	2014-03-06	0	0	0

Rather than just a word, the essence of loves purity, hope, respect and undying commitment is lived out in the lives of the lead actress and actor.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1KWAFVZOV5S0J	Michael Cheresnowsky	This is a love story of two high-school teenagers. They are as different as day and night. The boy is in the in-crowd, and he is headed down the wrong path. The girl is studious, and she lives her life according to her faith (her father is a minister). The boy takes every opportunity to belittle and embarrass the girl. However, she is very self-confident and rebuffs every one of his slights. Eventually, Brandon asks Jaime out, and they become a couple. The story turns sad as Jaime has terminal leukemia. Nevertheless, the end of the story is mostly very happy - although there is a touch of bittersweet. This is a great movie, and I strongly recommend it.	5.0	A Heart Warming Story	2014-01-11	2	2	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A27GTBNUF8DUEF	Michael  P.	This is a sweet movie. The main characters have a relationship that could have been set in the 50s, much more moral than is typical today; I found that very refreshing. I am surprised that someone would even venture to produce a movie that wasn't filled with cussing and sexual scenes. I applaud them.I am a Christian and wish Mandy's faith would have been a bigger part of the movie. But I am glad the movie is still available and hope many see it.  I know it is an old movie, but I just saw it in 2012, and I have watched it a few times since my initial viewing. I like that it has many tender scenes that portray innocence, especially when compared to other movies with adolescent stars.	5.0	A wholesome movie to watch more than once	2013-01-27	1	1	0

However, now that I have seen the movie, I must say that she isn't half bad.Everyone must know the story by now...she's the daughter of a preacher. He's the bad kid off the street. They fall in love, she has a terminal illness...incredible sweetness ensues. But, this movie isn't your typical teen movie of today.  The characters are real...OK, not really, but they try...and are rough around the edges.Shane West does an awesome job playing Moore's love interest; his portrayal actually got me wanting him as my boyfriend. He does EVERYTHING for Moore's character...my boyfriend wouldn't make ME a telescope if I had a terminal illness.  ;pThis is the perfect movie for the hopeless romantic.

At first I resented the many Biblical references (Being a spiritual person who is not religious), but I soon understood that these Biblical insights were necessary to the story. The story was not original; boy meets girl - boy falls in love with girl, but, the treatment is well forth the time invested in seeing this video. Have a handkerchief handy when you watch this movie. You will need it and it will pinch you back to the frailties of being human. One more thing: The lack of &#34;movie-stars&#34; in this movie was refreshing.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR	"Mike London ""MAC"""	"I wrote and posted this review all the way back in 2002.  Strangely enough, looking at my list of reviews, the review is still present but it says ""no title"" and ""unavailable"", and this review is NOT listed in the main Amazon product page for this movie.  Just . . . odd.  Anyway, reposting my review of ""A Walk to Remember"".Mike London 9-10-2012-----------A WALK TO REMEMBER is both a refreshing and down-to-earth romantic movie where innocence has a place and forgiveness actually does happen. Nicholas Sparks, who wrote MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, also wrote this and THE RESCUE.Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, a ""goody-two shoes"" who really gets to know the ""bad boy"" Landon Carter, played by Shane West. Landon, responsible for getting another guy in a bad car wreck on a dare, must tutor students and take part in a school play production. While they knew one another all their lives, Jamie and Landon begin a real friendship together. This relationship becomes romantic, with a few twists that I won't give away here.A WALK TO REMEMBER is actually a radical film. Our culture uses satire and irony as the most prevalent comments on society. Everyone's a cynic. The 1950s churned out this ""family fare"" where no one has any real problems and everyone's basically a good person. The 1950s turned into the 1960s, the polar opposite.This movie takes those virtues such as faith, redemption, innocent, virginity, and forgiveness and puts them in the new millennium by dealing with actual issues. This is not the candy-caned world of Andy Griffith and that generation. This is a world where teenage pregnancy is common, alcohol abuse prevalent, and positive role models hard to come by. This is a world where there's of anger and hate.A WALK TO REMEMBER gives us this world, but it is also a place where couples believe in sex only in marriage. It's where Bible-believing conservatives are real people who love one another and have an open mind, and their values are not given the stereotypical cynical slant. This is a movie that actually uses profanity for a purpose, to give texture and character, which most movies do not do. Most movies now days have profanity just to have it in there. A WALK TO REMEMBER uses profanity because the characters it describes would use profanity. Just as the it uses profanity to describe people, A WALK TO REMEMBER also gives us a young woman who truly believes in Christ, who loves her father dearly, and a young man who is touched very deeply by this young woman. In an age as cynical and skeptical as ours, this is indeed radical."	4.0	4 & 1/2 Stars: Actually, quite a radical film for this era, March 1, 2002	2012-09-10	3	3	0

My sister and I cried so much that we thought the pain would never go away.  Then the last day of his funeral we came home and wanted to watch something distracting and lighthearted.  My sister rented ""A Walk to Remember,"" which I was vehemently opposed to watching.  I thought it was going to be another mass-produced mindless teen flick w/a teen pop star.  But as a favor to my sister I watched it.And Loved It-- Its Christian message was EXACTLY what we needed to hear that day from God and from Dad.  We cried bec it was like God and Dad were telling us everything would be okay, answering our doubts about life after death, about what really mattered in life.  The movie wasn't about that, but it did address matters of Faith in God and in people, Forgiveness and Miracles.  My sister and I had asked God for a sign to take away the pain, and this movie was His Answer."	5.0	Dad's passing	2005-07-27	10	6	4
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3P56WAH96LAQM	mmcakes	"Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. This movie was, though really sad, was better than OK. I would give it a 3.5, though I really thought Shane was a really good actor and is totally hot! Mandy Moore makes a great breakthrough in her first big role (played minor role in ""Princess Diaries"")! This movie was truly sad, and though I often never cry at movies, I have to admit I got a bit teary-eyed at the theater! The climax is a bit obvious and is forshadowed throughout the novel and the movie. Though I love Mandy, she seemed a bit to optimistic about her problems.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A33ZVV4U726KJ5	"M. McElveen ""eclectic collector"""	This shows that a movie can be great without profanity, sexuality, or gore. A beautiful, positive story of being the best you can be. Peer pressure is something that can make you not like who you are when you're alone and the male lead in this discovers that he can live without the approval of the wrong crowd. And teaches them they can be better without doing wrong to impress someone else. The person you've always ridiculed and called names may be your best friend or the love of your life. A lesson to teens or adults who live to follow the crowd. Or just a great movie to relax with, with tissues handy of course.	4.0	Wonderful story	2012-04-30	1	1	0

Though Shane West is undeniably good looking and appealing as the bad boy w/a good heart, the idea of such a character is as fictional as the unicorn. Not to mention, how many movies have the ""nerdy"" girl that everybody picks on, then voila, she's beautiful, just add make up and a new hair do (I wish it was that easy for me in high school)!  I felt the emphasis on Christianity and faith was laid on way too thick. It bordered on preachy. Not to mention they throw in the inevitable tear jerker: ""I'm dying..."". The movie tried way too hard to tug at heartstrings.I give it an extra star for Landon's classic Camaro."	2.0	Oh Please	2002-08-29	8	1	7
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3G7TE1JNVEYX7	mngirl	I went to see this movie on opening day and I have never cried so hard in a theatre in my life!! After the movie I went to the bathroom and all the girls were trying to fix their make-up, which was beyond repair.  I absolutely LOVED this movie.  It was so refreshing and sweet.  Although it was devastingly sad it gave me hope that there are good people out there and teenage guys who will do anything for the girl they love.I bought the DVD today, the first day in stores and watched it twice.  First, all the way through and the second time with the commentary of Shane West, Mandy Moore and Adam Shankman.  I disappointed that they didn't include deleted scenes on the DVD, since there were 36 of them.  I have to say Shane West is the most incredibly hot guy!! And Mandy did a great job acting.I also love the soundtrack and the I read the book after I became obsessed with the movie.  I think that the movie did a good job of taking the values conveyed in the book and translating them to modern situations.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, because no matter if you are the toughest person you can't help being brought into the tragic world of Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan.	5.0	A movie to REMEMBER for decades to come	2002-07-09	14	13	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AO4J90YPX5RU6	Moviebuffer101	A Walk to Remember is a remarkable movie about a young man (Shane West) with a bad boy image, who turns over a new leaf when he gets involved with the Reverand's (Peter Coyote) daughter (a lovely Mandy Moore). The movie really caught me off guard. I never read the book it's based on, or saw any previews or trailers. So why not 5 stars? Well even though it's fresh and alive, it is familiar territory. Actually I'm glad I never heard a lot about the movie before I saw it, this made for a better experience for me. Critic's although helpful at times can make or break a movie. It's a fact your never going to agree with everything others say about movies. We all have our own tastes. And I think most of us have passed on a movie based on what someone else might have thought about it. Then, you end up catching the movie at a later time and love it. My point is I often get opinions about movies, and decide if I wanna give up 2 hours. I'm glad I approached this film as an amateur. I may do this more often. 4.5 STARS	4.0	More movies with Mandy Moore please.	2003-07-09	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3I312N7ISZ960	"Mr. Nicholas Pearson ""Cert HE (Open)"""	'A Walk to Remember' was the film that first introduced me to the brilliant works of Nicholas Sparks, plus also the talent of actress and singer/songwriter Mandy Moore.  Mandy was very young (seventeen I believe) when she starred in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, and it has been interesting to see her progression in various fields since then to the present day.  I stumbled upon this film on YouTube of all places, whilst randomly searching for videos one afternoon, and I was instantly fixed on the various clips that had been uploaded.  Therefore, I decided to purchase the movie on DVD and watch the production straight through, to make up my own mind surrounding the attention it seemed to gather from fellow YouTubers.  I knew the overall story, as I had read some reviews beforehand, and this is what initially drew me to the movie.The film is based on the book of the same name by Nicholas Sparks, being based in the fictional town of Beaufort.  The book is set in the 1940s/50s, whereas the film is set in more contemporary 1998.  This was done, on the recommendation of Sparks himself, so that the movie could generate more interest with a younger crowd, being set in a more contemporary period.  It is, of course, a love story, but also has a resonance of Christian values that aren't too forcibly placed onto the audience, whether religiously minded or not.  The film focuses on a young lad, Landon Carter (played by the multi-talented Shane West), who is pretty much going nowhere fast and losing his sense of identity along the way, i.e. hanging around with the wrong crowd and getting in trouble with the law etc.  A young girl, Jamie Sullivan (Moore), who is also the town minister's daughter, has known of Landon's reputation for years and befriends him in order to help him with rehearsals in the upcoming school recital, in which he was forced to take part following a teenage prank gone wrong.  Suffice to say, a sweet and romantic love story ensues, as is typical of Sparks's productions, but it is engrained in sadness from the very beginning by the fact that Jamie has terminal leukaemia.  The film deals with this revelation sensitively and the ensuing story is a sheer testament to Sparks' creative mind.The character of Jamie was, in fact, based upon Sparks' own sister, who died of terminal cancer in similar circumstances.  This fact also resonated with me in that this was the first film I had seen to deal with terminal illness since I was diagnosed with a bone-marrow debilitating disease known as Aplastic Anaemia, which has effects very similar to leukaemia.  Over the years, it has helped me deal with the strains of living with this condition, which can sometimes be overbearing, to say the least.  Unfortunately, the film didn't garner a plethora of positive reviews with certain movie critics upon its cinematic release, and the Christian community has made a bit of an uproar concerning some 'over-sexualised' scenes.  This certainly should not deter anybody from seeing the movie, however, and I'm sure the experience will leave you feeling uplifted and grateful for life in general.The film was initially released on VHS and DVD in 2002, and the DVD, distributed by Warner Brothers, is a fairly simple release with few heavy extras (undeniably because of the relatively poor box-office performance, they didn't want to invest heavily on the film distribution).  The film itself is presented in wide-screen letter-box format on the DVD release, whilst the VHS is formatted for full-screen presentation. The DVD also has English and French language audio options, as well as providing subtitles for the English hard-of-hearing, and for those who wish to follow in French or Spanish.  The two main DVD extras included are the two commentaries for the feature film.  I found the commentary by Nicholas Sparks and screen-writer Karen Janszen particularly interesting, as there is a lot of discussion about the process of translating Sparks' original novel into a screen-play, and how certain elements of the book had to be tweaked in order to fit into the film's contemporary setting.  The other commentary includes contributions from the two main cast members, Mandy Moore and Shane West, alongside movie director Adam Shankman.  This is also very interesting, as there is a lot of talk about certain deleted scenes that never made the final cut due to the film board and overall timing constraints.  It really is a shame that none of these deleted scenes were included on this DVD Release as extras, as I got the impression that they would have added more background and comedy into the production as a whole.  Also included is the theatrical trailer for the film and film highlights of the main cast.  Mandy Moore's music video for her single 'Cry' (included on her eponymous third album) is also included as a bonus feature on both formats, in which Shane West stars as Landon looking up to the sky to see Jamie in heaven (presumably!).It would be a shame not to experience this film at least once in your life, and this is why I recommend you to see for yourself Sparks' sensitive production about life, love, forgiveness, and teenage angst.  I would also recommend anyone interested in the film to seek out Sparks' novel of the same name, which is in some ways worlds apart from the movie, but serves as a nice accompaniment to the feature production.  It is, additionally, worth seeking out the movie soundtrack, preferably in its re-release special extended edition, which includes music from Moore herself, Switchfoot, James Foreman, and many other noteworthy performers.	4.0	'It all comes down to who's by your side!' - Nicholas Sparks's novel brought to life on the big screen!	2013-05-30	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3U5JCXIXTGSLN	musiclover13	"Unlike many, I had never read the book ""A Walk to Remember"" prior to seeing the film. I must say that I was very impressed wtih Mandy Moore's portrayal of a different, kind-hearted high school student. In the film she encounters a trouble-maker (Shane West) whom has just pulled an illegal stunt with his friends and now must pay the price. He is ""sentenced"" to participate in a play as his punishment. Mandy Moore's character works with him, even though he's not the nicest guy in the world. Slowly but surely she starts to turn his life around for the better and they ultimately fall in love. This would be wonderful ending to the story, but there is a secret that she's hiding that could rip their happiness to shreds.I really enjoyed this movie! There are times when you'll laugh and times when you'll cry, but it's definitely a film you don't want to miss. Pay particular attention to Mandy Moore's performance of ""Only Hope"" during the play. It will move you! Definitely see this film if you're in the mood for a nice, warm, emotionally-driven movie!"	4.0	A Feel-Good Film!!!	2003-06-05	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3DE9GQDO6O6D1	"Nancy R. Katz ""NancyK18"""	Several years ago I read the book A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks.  I found the book rather reminiscent of Erich Segal's blockbuster novel Love Story.  When I thought more about it, I found myself thinking that Love Story was a much better read.  I never did expect to watch the movie but recently found myself borrowing it from the library this summer on a rather dreary day.  It's a given that I enjoy sappy.  I cry at movies, while reading books, while listening to music, even during McDonald commercials.  But considering how I felt about the book, which the movie was based on, I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.Mandy Moore, a well-known pop singer plays Jamie Sullivan, the only child daughter of the local widowed preacher. Jamie is smart, introspective, good-natured and an all-around misfit in her high school.  Now meet Landon, almost the complete opposite.  And if not for Landon's selfish act, he may never have met Jamie but meet they do.  And after a brief period of antagonism, become romantically entangled.  To say anything more about the plot would be giving too much away and that's now what a review should do.  But rest assured, this is one memorable film and the first film directed by Sofia Coppolla whom you may remember from playing a lead role in Godfather III.In addition to credible performances by the lead actors, which include Josh Hartnett and Peter Coyote as Jamie's father, the music chosen as a backdrop to the unfolding events  provide a most sentimental mood and the songs sung by Mandy Moore are wonderful.Yes, the movie is sappy and even predictable but don't see if you don't agree with me once you've viewed it.	5.0	A Memorable Movie!	2002-09-05	6	4	2

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3VY5UA24EZT72	Nathan Dickey	A Walk to Remember is a great movie with excellent plot, character development, and acting. Shane West and Mandy Moore star in this film, portraying the life of two teen lovers journeying with each other on the road of life. West plays the role of Landon Carter, Moore plays as the seemingly ethereal Jamie, the daughter of a Baptist preacher. Landon and Jamie eventually become close friends, and both realize they are in love with each other. After the marriage of Landon Carter and Jamie, the film ends on both a sweet and sad tone.I also enjoy the soundtrack to this film.

So it took me 5 years before I finally found this film after several recommendations pointed to it. I ended up completely falling in love with this film in part because it is sweet, inspiring, and it manages to confront many timeless issues that face teens, friends and lovers. I was in part swept up in the film because it also mirrors some of my own experience and it models love and our human struggle in a way that succeeded in teaching me to be a better person. Quite life changing to watch a film and then have better relationships and appreciate the small things once taken for granted.  I also wish to recommend these other films: Moulin Rouge, Harold and Maude, Science of Sleep, Amelie, Shakespeare in Love, and Love Story."	5.0	4.5 stars	2008-02-09	3	2	1

MANDY MOORE STEPS AWAY FROM HER IMAGE AS A POPSTAR PRINCESS TO PLAY JAMIE,A A CONSERVITIVE PREACHER'S DAUGHTER WHO UNEXPECTANTLY FINDS LOVE WITH LANDON, A COCKY BIG MAN ON CAMPUS,PLAYED BRILLIANTLY BY SHANE WEST WHO GIVES A STARMAKING PERFORMANCE. THIS WAS A MOVIE THAT COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN A ..., SAPPY TEARJERKER BUT BECAUSE OF THE PERFORMANCES AND THE WONDERFUL STORY,WHICH IS SUBTLE AND DOESN'T HIT YOU OVER THE HEADIT BECOMES A SWEET MOVIE ABOUT NOT ONLY LOVE BUT REDEMPTION AND FAITH. NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM MANDY MOORE BECAUSE SHE IS GREAT BUT SHANE WEST CARRIES THIS MOVIE.  IT IS TOLD MOSTLY FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.IT IS THROUGH THE EYES OF HIS CHARACTER THAT WE SEE ALL THE EVENTS UNFOLD. THERE ARE A LOT OF HANDSOME YOUNG ACTORS OUT THERE THAT COULD HAVE PLAYED THIS ROLE BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ONE WHO COULD HAVE PULLED OFF WHAT SHANE DOES--THAT IS TAKE A CHARACTER WHO STARTS OFF AS A CONCEITED JERK AND TURN HIM INTO SOULFUL, THOUGHTFUL GOODGUY WHO NOT ONLY WINS JAMIE'S HEART BUT THE HEART OF THE AUDIENCE. HE DOES ALL THAT AND MAKES IT BELIEVABLE. EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET OR READ THE BOOK  I AM SURE YOU HAVE HEARD THAT ITS SAD OR THAT IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY AND IT WILL BUT FOR ME THIS IS A MOVIE WORTH SEEING OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVEN IF IT MEANS CRYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO PLEASE GET IT!	5.0	A WALK YOU WILL REMEMBER  AND NEVER FORGET	2002-07-21	1	0	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A146QCGOQPZLTG	Nicole	Where can I begin with this movie: great performances by Shane West and Mandy Moore, very believable acting, inspiring music, well done script and a beautiful setting. Mandy Moore's performance as the shy and reserved Jamie Sullivan was both inspiring and believable, her acting proved to be nothing more than perfect, she really made the character come alive. Shane West played the part of Landon Carter to perfection, in the beginning of the movie his character was like this tough, bad boy I don't give a sh** about anything and then he meets Mandy Moore's character and the way their friendship blossoms into love changes him in a way that he never thought possible and Shane does that transformation so well. Shane and Mandy's chemistry in this movie is electric and seeing them together in some of the scenes in this movie such as when she tells him that she is dying from cancer, or when he tells her that he loves her definitely touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. This movie is about true love, faith, and that admist all of those goals we wish to accomplish in our lives the greatest one we can accomplish is finding true love. This movie will make you realize what having faith means, who your true friends are and that one of the greatest miracles in life is falling in love with someone.	5.0	Not another teen movie......	2002-07-28	6	6	0

Mandy Moores singing has improved and any way back to the point this movie is the best!!!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A38UBVJEV1LLS7	NorthofCB	&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was a wonderful film in light of all the teen-flicks that induce feelings of sickness. Moore proves to be a very believable actress in a not so believabe role (especially in the day in age). West's part seems rather forced, but not anyting to cry about. It's adaptation from the novel is wonderful, very few important details are changed, and some are changed for the better because scenes would not work on screen.The DVD itself is good. Moore's video is a nice addative. Also the comentary with Shankman, Moore, and West is actually interesting. A good buy.	5.0	Quite Good	2003-11-09	0	0	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3J32CP7XVRNS8	not telling	This is a really good movie. There's something emotionally wrong with you if it doesn't tug even a little bit at your heart strings!Mandy Moore gives an incredible preformance as Jamie, the daughter of preacher good girl with a heart of gold who is slowly dying of cancer. Shane West plays the bad boy turned good who falls in love with her and wants to make her final days as memorable as possible.This isn't like every other teen flick out there. It has more depth, great acting, and a great story. I really enjoyed it. And yeah, it's kind of a girly movie - but even my husband, who isn't really into chick flicks, liked this one!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A15GTCK2TKSLFY	perry ander	Good story about teens - seniors in H.S.- who meet and gradually fall in love.  Story is elevated in poinancy and intensity when one of the teens reveals that they are dying of leukemia.  Nice script- Many Moore and Shane West as actors make one want to keep watching.  One might say that the two teens initially come &#34;from &#34;different sides of the track&#34;- but, really neither,  in my opinion, give the impression that they are that far removed from being an average teen.  Sure, M.M. is into religion and not that into &#34;being cool&#34; wheras Shane West is all about &#34;being cool&#34; and being &#34;in&#34;- but the fact that they fall for each other eventually shows that they are not thst far apart in values initially.

I can't find enough time to browse every of them, but I'm afraid all that hype was pretty much about pop singer Mandy Moore, and some people might say, ""if it wasn't for her hit songs, this would have been just a so-so romantic film"". Now THAT would be an unfair comment. In my opinion, for all what's worth, ""A Walk To Remember"" deserves to be classified among the best-loved tearjerkers by far -- I mean, those with a somehow related dramatic plot, such as ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948), ""Love Story"" (1970), ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983), ""Steel Magnolias"" (1989). What's most amazing is Mandy Moore really proved that she could carry her role very well by delivering as fine a performance as what Jennifer Jones, Ali MacGraw, Debra Winger and Julia Roberts did in their respective roles. Honestly I didn't believe in Moore's acting a lot when I saw her in ""The Princess' Diaries"". Now I do."	4.0	J Jones, AliMacGraw, Deb Winger, Julia Roberts, Mandy Moore	2002-10-16	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2TVM32V27JACI	"""pinkeyd"""	I read the book the week before I saw the movie,and by far I thought it stayed with plot of the book then most movies today. Ok, I admit I laughed when I heard Mandy Moore was doing a movie, but what got me was the trailers played before the release. She totally fit the part, no one could pull off the innocence. I was so intrigued by the trailers, so I bought the book and 2 weeks later went to see the movie and I was blown away by both Mandy Moore and Shane West performances. You laugh and cry just as much as when you read the book if not more so. This is the sweetest most beautiful story of first true love of innocense. I have the movie pre-ordered so I can own both DVD and VHS. This movie and the book is for all ages. And can I say how wonderful it is to go to a movie that isn't overly done with curse words and just ironically doesn't have any sex, drugs, or drinking to get the plot to make sense. I suggest everyone to read the book before you get the movie. The movie is brought to today's standards set in 1996 instead of '50's. If anything the movie gives more twists and turns but still pretty much stays true to the book written by Nicholas Sparks. The book and movie is a must have for a hopeless romantics to add to their own home library. It will truly take you on a rollcoaster ride of emotions and leave you with a feel good feeling in the end. You can't get enough of it by the end which makes you wanna reread it or rewatch it over and over again. It will leave tears in your eyes by the end and it will truly make your heart skip a beat numerous times!	5.0	One of the Most Romantic Stories of All Time!!!	2002-05-02	6	6	0

While the movie would have been entertaining for people who had not read the book, we found it to bear little resemblence to the book other than for the three main characters.  The entire opening was not from the book at all nor was the salty language throughout the movie and new characters introduced.I guess this is typical for books made into movies.

But I was pleasantly surprised and I think this movie is very inspirational, in that it inspires faith, love and hope without overdoing it and one of the few movie adaptations that actually made me go and buy the book.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2Y1MAR10IKVV9	PreP	Is it just my imagination, or is Shane West really too gorgeous to be true?? I watched the movie a couple of years back with my buddies, and we needed a towel to mop up our tears (no Kleenex for me!) The movie is one of the most touching ones I've seen so far.. and I loved it enough to be persuaded to buy the book as well.Landon Carter is a high school jock- arrogant, irresponsible, immature and wild. He meets one Jamie Sullivan, a quiet, misunderstood, unpopular misfit, who helps him learn to believe in himself and shares her faith with him. I found Shane West's interpretation of the role extremely convincing, he portrays Carter with just the right amount of charm, confusion and trepidation as he attempts to dissuade his growing feelings for Jamie. He is eventually led to become a warm, understanding individual, with new values and beliefs and a purpose in his otherwise aimless existence. Mandy Moore has totally exceeded my expectations of her acting abilities as a pop singer turned actress. The chemistry they have makes this movie a MUST see for soppy-flick fans like myself!While the storyline is pretty common... A Walk To Remember is unique in the aspect that it has presented a typical love story, of the trials, tests and triumphs of young love in a fresh, new and provocative light, and though the film is different from the book by Nicholas Sparks, I found both very enjoyable in their own ways..A movie not to be missed! And just for the road.... SHANE WEST ROCKS!!!	5.0	LITERALLY WEPT BUCKETS!!!	2004-01-04	4	4	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A30P1VXMNZPEIA	"Presley Fox ""MusicFanatic"""	"I was so excited to get this movie when it first came out, and I was so pleased with it.  It was well worth the money to rent it, and in the end, I ended up buying it.  It is about two teenagers, seniors in HS, Landon and Jamie.  Jamie is the ""good girl"" of the town (because she is the preacher's daughter).  Landon is a wild, rowdy boy who is kind of cocky at times.  He is VERY popular, while Jamie is barely even noticed.  In the beginning of the movie, Landon and his immature friends pull a prank gone wrong, resulting in a injured guy named Clay Gupphart.  Since the prank they pulled (too long to explain or type) was on school property, and Landon was the one left in charge, he didn't get suspended from school, but he got the not-so-much-priviledge of tutoring kids on Saturday and participating in the school's Spring Play.  That is when he and Jamie become close.  They start studying together which turns into a budding romance.  Jamie's dad had never really cared for Landon.  Jamie slowly changed Landon from an obnoxious, cocky teenager to a well-behaved man.  All is changed suddenly when Jamie breaks the news to Landon that she has luekemia.  Landon suffers a little, asks her to marry him, they get married, and then Jamie passes away the following year.  A great family movie, this one is worth the rent."	5.0	WOW!!!!!!

I like comedies and teen horror movies, but this was good. I'm not even that big of a fan of Mandy Moore, but she fills the role great. She and Shane West have such good on-screen chemistry. This movie shows what is good and kind in the world, and what people can do. It is a great movie if you are in the mood for something serious and romantic, but it's a tear-jerker, so be prepared for that. It could be a good date movie if your boyfriend can handle romantic movies.	4.0	a cute romantic movie	2003-04-09	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"Mandy Moore and Shane West shine in this unusual teen drama...unusual in that it is mature, heartfelt, and thoughtful, and it doesn't patronize teens or to pander to purient interests.  The story of two ""opposites"" attracting, and the beautiful love story that follows is quite compelling for both men and women...it's not ""just a chick flick.""  Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah both offer understated, but effective performances as parents and the movie actually treats a young person's faith with respect, rather than hostility and caracaturing.  While I can't say it has a *happy* ending, it is a redemptive and hopeful ending.  There is not abundant bad language, sexual references, drug abuse, or violence, so it is a fairly ""family friendly"" movie; at the same time, it's not hokey or stodgy. This film feels real and genuine...give it a shot and you won't be sorry.  Mandy Moore gives a surprisingly nuanced portrayal of a remarkable young lady.

I bought the book for my 11 year old to read first so we would see the movie afterwards.I liked the movie on it's on. If you did what we did you probably will not enjoy it as much because they did what Hollywood tends to do with writing a script from a book. There are a lot of plot manipulations that my daughter nor myself were happy about. Shane West potrayal of Landon was conceivable, (but my thoughts are prejudice when it comes to his acting cuz I've always liked him since Once and Again) Mandy Moore as Jamie.......

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1GPU2JRL7N8RU	Psyche	"I already hated this movie before I read the book. And after I DID read it, I hate this movie even more(if that was even possible). While the book is not perfect, all of the charm and uniqueness that made it stand out in any way was taken out of the movie. All of the most touching moments were taken out, the characters aren't nearly as endearing, and all of the other little things that made the book special are non exsistent as well. We are left with just your typical teenage romance about the bad boy falling for the good girl, and every single teen movie cliche imaginable.What I probably hate most though is that the things the movie DID take from the book, they destroyed them. Like the play. In the book, it was a beautiful Christmas story written by Jamie's father. And Jamie played the angel. In the movie, it was just some stupid cheesy play some student wrote with stupid dialogue, and for some reason Jamie lip syncs in it. And the song didn't even seem like it made sense with the scene that was going on. It was totally out of place and was obviously only thrown in there in an attempt to showcase Mandy's singing and remind us she's a popstar.GOD the characters are so lame. In the book, Landon is actually a pretty good guy, just with a complicated homelife, careless attitude about school, na d tendencies to be a bit mischivious with friends. In the movie, he's just some stereotypical bad boy who almost instantly gets mesmerized by Jamie with no real explanation except ""you inspire me."" Even though prior to that we never saw any real indications of her words or actions inspiring him in any way. I guess we are just to believe that seeing her dressed all pretty on stage with a little make up was enough to do it for him right there. Really, really pathetic. And his friends were all walking talking highschool stereotypes. They were like bad rippoffs of the popular kids in ""She's All That."" EVERYTHING in this movie seems ripped off of another teen movie or other romance dramas. Not one original thing about it.And don't even get me STARTED on the way her illness happened. In the book, it was handled far more realistically. In the movie, it's just ridiculous. First of all, if she stopped taking treatments for her leukemia over a year ago, her symptoms should have been much more apparent then just her fainting later on after telling Landon. You're not just totally fine one day and then totally sick the next. And no, her merely appearing 'pale"" is not the same thing. But what's worse than the lack of build up is the whole wedding scene. Are we honestly supposed to believe that, after being all weak and sickly in the hospital, Jamie was able to walk down the aisle effortlessly and looking totally beautiful and healthy? Whatever the reason for this cop out, I don't care. Just one of the many stupid things about this movie."	1.0	Mind blowingly bad.	2008-02-04	34	13	21

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A21ITRDVUIOLMW	Red Sapphire	"I enjoyed Richard and Diane very much in this movie. Actors are faced with a genuine challenge when a movie rests on dialogue and their chemistry as opposed to action, adventure and CG. If the lines aren't delivered just right, the whole scene falls flat on its theatrical face.  I thought they both did a great job with the dialogue and with the chemistry between them. Some people have said they didn't see or feel the chemistry, but I did.  That scene on the bridge reminded me of two young lovers, suddenly fully aware of and  totally caught up in one another. I didn't watch Unfaithful. I started to but didn't like the movie, so this was my first time seeing the two of them together.The biggest problem I saw with the movie was that it was too rushed, somehow and that one hospital scene was seriously contrived and mechanical. I think the relationship between Richard and Diane should have been developed a bit more before their first kiss. Also, the time and place of their first kissing scene caught me off guard. I haven't read the book so I don't know if that was how it happened in the story  or a Hollywood invention.Still I was so thrilled to see this romance about an older couple, front and center like that, as opposed to running second to some young couple. It's the reason I gave the movie a ""4"" because I am so weary of unfunny comedies and so-called romance movies that have no emotional depth to them at all.I also liked the background and individual storyline of each character.  Characters have to have started from somewhere to get to the place where we first meet them. In this picture, we're dealing with two mature adults,  and they are going to each have their own emotional baggage. The story doesn't asks us to entertain the far-out or extreme, but to look at how these two people have been affected by their history and how they are reacting to the part of that history that has made its way into their present life.  I loved that scene with the liquor and  can goods!  I didn't find anything trite or cliche about it. It was hilarious and fun.While I enjoyed Scott Glenn, I thought his lines were extremely cliche--not his doing, I'm sure. But that whole storyline about his wife's character was so hackneyed. And I don't think he outperformed Diane or Richard.As some of the others have mentioned, I hope this is the beginning of more romantic stories involving middle-aged couples. I have sorely missed them."	4.0	Good job by Richard and Diane	2009-09-07	4	0	4

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AJGP5XYKKBGBG	Reliable Reviews	Mandy Moore is sweet but sharp. She is thoughtful, forgiving, encouraging, with charming personality. She works at her relationships. A romance. Touching. Moving.The intent of the first 10-minutes is for you not to like the reckless teenager's behavior, to establish these characters as displeasing; rather than establish the film as displeasing; which becomes clear only later on. The producer should have grabbed the audience first, with another scene.Mandy Moore is meant to be nice, but not glamorous, and unappealing to these reckless students, because of her thoughtful, Christian faith. However, Mandy still seemed the most appealing girl, any which way.We do not see the guy, not liking Mandy, because he is pursuing another more glamorous, girl for selfish reason or shallow reason. The guy does not like Mandy, simply for puffing up his own image. Really, only one thing, prevents him from being able to value her,... a lack of real love. Sadly, many people never realize their lack of real love, or they do too late; only after their opportunity has come and gone.Many of the other reviews give away too much of the plot. You will enjoy the movie more if you do not read more.	5.0	A Nice Romance	2006-10-17	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3DWXVGOE2XZIQ	Richard R. Carlton	A very unusual film.  The script has the potential to be ridiculously sappy or a romantic hit.....Moore & Co. make it fall in between on this one.  The film teeters on the brink of collapsing in its' own cliches, then redeems itself time and time again.  The strongest part of the script is the final 10% or so when the death in handled with remarkable finesse and care is taken to provide futures (4 years worth) for the primary characters.This is a good romantic film with its moments.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A21U7E0Y7SJMEH	"Riven ""ladyriven"""	This film deserves a 5-star rating, and then some.Although I find most teen movies to be crude, obscene, obnoxious, or some variation of those three terms, this one proves itself entirely different, and a hundred times better. Not only does it prove that teen movies CAN be worth a watch no matter how old you are, it also proves that they can be even better than more 'mature' films in the romance genre.A Walk to Remember is a story about your typical high school romance blossoming between two completely different people... or is it? Not quite. It's better than typical. The female lead is a talented do-gooder daughter of a Church man.... and her male love interest just happens to be the resident school bad boy who hangs out with the type of people who bully and make fun anyone who doesn't fit in with the crowd. Together they learn what it means to be true to themselves and to those they care about, and what it means to fall in love.This touched me in a way that films rarely ever do. I only wish it had come out during my high school years. I truly think that anyone with a soft spot for romance will fall in love with this movie as much as I have, no matter what their age may be... but it's even better if you're a high school girl, searching not only for love, but for a place to belong. Watch it with someone you care about. If the guys aren't nauseated by all the romance (dump him!), then he'll be crying along with you for a good third of the movie.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1CGF9EUDEUQJA	Rodrigo Medina	I've just watched &quot;a walk to remember&quot;. The plot is predictable, but mandy moore is great. I liked the soundtrack, especially mandy's songs, and also some dialogues.The movie is about teenage love happening where it is least expected. Mandy Moore plays Jamie, the daughter of a preacher, who is a total nerd. Shane West is the cool guy, who gets involved in a practical joke with a new student and is punished with community services. After some resistence, they fall in love and everything seems to be perfect until the movie changes completely.The DVD has only a few extra material and I hoped it had interviews with the cast and a making-off. Anyway, the DVD comes with the video &quot;Cry&quot; from mandy moore, which is good.This is actually a good movie and deserves to be watched.	3.0	mandy moore is a good actress	2002-08-15	1	0	1

This really is a movie for everyone from the teens years and older.  If this movie doesn't touch your heart and moisten your eyes many times, you must be made of apathetic stone.  I give this movie 5 stars and wish I could rate it even higher.  I'm of retirement age.  This movie takes me back to my teen years and leaves me re-evaluating choices I made or might have made to be a better person among my peers and with regard to my elders. It shames me that I wasn't a better boyfriend to girls I dated, instead of placing myself first This movie does more than entertain.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AD29KEJMCAD76	Samhot	A very close friend of mine told me a couple of months ago that he saw this film, and by the end of it, he was weeping uncontrollably. I was fairly surprised when he told me this, and soon, I made it my priority to see this film, not just because of that, but also because it looked like something I wanted to see, just from looking at the previews. I finally did see this film, and by the end, I not only wept once, not twice, but three times: twice during the film, and once more after it had already ended. It was that powerful and cutting.I can say right from the start that this film stands apart from most of the typical teen romantic flicks out, and is much more intelligent, emotive, profound and thought-provoking than most. Don't let the &quot;teen romance&quot; title fool you: this film is profound in all cylinders as to transcend a label like that, and powerful enough to win over viewers well into their middle ages, and higher.The story is about a rebellious male youth named Landon (played by Shane West) who gets into trouble with the law due to an act of hazing, and is sent to tutor some kids at a school. He then meets a brainy, goody-goody Preacher's daughter named Jamie (played by singer Mandy Moore), and needless to say, when they meet, both of their lives begin to change. Landon's friends don't think much of Jamie, and make fun of her when she passes them by in and out of school. At first, Landon doesn't seem to think too much of her either, but, he soon realizes the precociousness, maturity, understanding and intelligence she possesses, as well as realizing her ability to see through him: things that he didn't seem to get from any of his friends. As a result, Landon feels a strong confliction within himself, as he seems to be transfixed at the knowledge and perceptive ability of his soon-to-be girlfriend. But, he realizes that if he gets closely involved with this girl, that he may be jeopardizing his bad-boy reputation, as well as his relationship with his bad-boy buddies.There are a vast number of important scenes within this film - some of which give 'slight' (and I mean that in the smallest sense of the term) hints of what the eventual outcome of the story is, and only after viewing the movie a second or third time is when you can detect them. But, other than that, I don't think I ever could have predicted how the story was going to turn out while watching this movie for the first time. (And I've never read the book upon which this is based.)I don't want to give away the biggest turning point in the movie, but I'll list a small few important scenes:(1). Landon realizes that he likes Jamie, and is invited, and willing to study with her at Jamie's house. The next day, while hanging out with his friends, she walks up to him and asks him if he still wants to come to the house, and he humiliates her in front of all of his friends. But, when school ends, and his friends are no longer around him, he sneaks over to her house.(2). Due to jealousy, Landon's ex-girlfriend (and some of his friends) make an attempt (which actually worked) to humiliate Jamie in front of the whole school during a lunch period. Landon steps in, and defends Jamie, which turns into a small fight, and the eventual announcement of an ending regarding Landon and one of his friends' relationship.Later in the movie, things start to change and progress quite rapidly. Things start to unravel, secrets come out, and things are never quite the same: in both a negative and positive sense.To talk about another subject, I was a bit disappointed by the length of the film at first - before I actually began to view it. At first glance, I wanted it to be a bit longer, and I read another review somewhere on this film by someone saying that some of the romantic scenes should have been fleshed out more. I can see where that reviewer is coming from, but after the movie ended, I came to this conclusion: if any of these scenes would have been fleshed out more, I think the emotive power would have been too much to the point of self-indulgence, which in return would have bordered on parody and clich&eacute;, which then would result in the eventual loss of the emotional impact intended. It's that aspect in which I think the writer and director knew exactly what they were doing, as not to compromise the emotional impact, as well as refusing to let the project fall into clich&eacute;d routines. I honestly don't think there could have been much of an improvement over what was already done, without the compromise of some really important elements.Actress Daryl Hannah and actor Peter Coyote give good, supporting roles as Landon's mother and Jamie's father respectively.I heartily applaud this film, the writers and the actors: particularly Mandy Moore and Shane West, as I think they gave an excellent performance. They all helped to make a romantic film that transcends labeling and clich&eacute;s in a market full of each. Highly recommended.	5.0	Heart-wrenching story, intelligent filmmaking &amp; performances	2003-06-06	8	7	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3T7G6748HAO0Y	Sandy Harris	This is the best romance movie of 2001 and 2002,How can someone not like this movie. I watched it for the very first time and fell totally in love with it. Shane West and Mandy Moore did a wonderful acting job. They acually made there characters come alive and at the end you felt so sad that these two were just acting and not realy in love. But they were wonderful together.And I must say that I started pulling out the tissues when Jamie started singing to Landon in the spring play and didn't stop untill the movie ended. This Movie Is the best I've seen in a long long time. And I have to give 2 thumbs up to Hollywood for not twisting Jamie Christian morals around.Because I am a christian and I get so tired of seeing movies with Pre-Marriage relations and foul language But this movie didn't have that. So now I have to read the book and hope it was as good as the movie because it was awesome.	5.0	The Best romance movie ever.	2002-08-31	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A39Q3POYJ535AL	Sarah Beacham	A Walk To Remember is one of the best movies I've ever seen. When I first saw the previews I thought this movie wuz gonna be just another little teeny romance movie that'd be all cheesey and stuff, but one day my dad and I went to the movies and I didn't wanna see Black Hawk Down with him so I decided to give it a chance. That wuz a really good move because this movie is just so touching. I left the theater with puffy, red eyes, and tear-stained cheeks. This movie is very emotional and sweet. Everyone else I know that's seen it loved it too. It made them cry too. And when I went to buy it the Circuit City guy accidentally admitted that it made him cry too. You know this movie's good when it's made a GUY cry. This is definately a movie where you're gonna need a whole box of Kleenex. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately one of my favorites. Believe me, this is a GREAT movie!	5.0	A Walk To Remember is a MAGNIFICENT movie!	2002-07-15	2	2	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A7WIT4FWF7LE7	Sara	Now I didn't see this movie when it came out in theaters cause my friends all said it would be stupid and sappy and it has Mandy Moore in it, but while walking around the video store I saw it and was just too tempted to rent it.  OMGosh!  I cried so hard.  I think with this movie it can connect to people on different levels.  For starters its a love story so thats always good but it also was about a girl who is strong in her faith because she chooses to be and doesn't question her faith even when [stuff] happens.With me right now my mother has brain cancer so seeing parts of this movie was very hard but some things that Mandy's character says and does just totally and completely made me think about thats how I want to act and react with similar situations.  I even caught myself somewhat quoting her to a friend the other day while we were talking about religion.  I guess thats another way that people can connect to this movie.  Not everyone has a good life and this movie showed us a positive way to handle it.	5.0	Get a tissue ready	2002-07-15	4	4	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2ILMYFGTJORP2	"""sassy-k"""	This title of the film says it all! The film is a classic love story with some traditional aspects thrown in. I have read both the book and the film several times and never grow bored of them. They have a complete chick flick tatooed across them but still have the male veiwing because every one can relate to it in one way or another. There is a very strong story line that was adapted from the 1950s novel by Nicholas Sparks. The toryline is kept practically the same except it has been brought up to date. The role of Landon Carter, the tpe of rebel in the town, was given to Shane West who was increasingly believable about his growing and undying love for Mand Moore's character, Jamie Sullivan. Jamie Sullivan is the Ministers daughter who has lost her mother and is ver much the goody-good girl of the town. The more time Landon has to spend with Jamie the moor he likes her and the moor time he leaves his friends to be with her. There is a twist in the stor that makes everone know how Jamie and Landon feel for each other. I personally would recommend that ou read the book first as it gives a better approach to the story and a better understanding and appreciatment of the depth of the story. The film is brilliant and every one should at least see it once and the soundtrack compliments th film although the film is absolutel billient on its own.	5.0	A Film to Remember!!	2004-06-20	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3GEX2Z363SNGE	"Scott B. Perry ""silentscott"""	"Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember is an intelligent, sweet, and attentive love story about two teens from different social classes that meet up coincidently and fall in love.The movie begins with the troubled some teen Landon Carter,(Shane West)when trespassed on public property and pressured a friend to jump into a body of water in order to join Landon's group of friends (he jumped).Landon's friend was seriously injured  and the police caught Landon. He was sentenced to do work for his community(tutoring, drama club etc) .  Obviously, his  popularity gets to him until the geeky ""sweater wearing"" Jamie Sullivan(Mandy Moore) saw something good in Landon. Landon, like his meanspirited self, he shews her off ,but finds a reason to need her help with  his lines for drama club. Before they started Jamie warned Landon that he was not to fall in love with her. Later on, inside of him he does love Jamie. This film tragically deals with the peer-pressure of others, how Landon needs to forgive his dad, and  what Landon is faced with when he does fall in love with Jamie.This movie maybe sad and heart warming ,but for sure is a great uplifting movie that even gives a lot of moral values. surprisingly this movie was well made and it worked without the flavorless raunchy jokes and the teenage sex that would make it a teen movie.Thank God we got a grown up movie and not to much what we've seen before in our culture of raunchy teen flicks(sure they are entertaining ,but they do get old). I liked  Mandy Moore in the movie. She seems real and is great on camera. Shane West is great as well as (lets not forget) Jamie's dad, Rev. Sullivan(Peter Coyote) who was likeable and convincing. The movie is charming and at moments is silly ,but overall was enjoyable and just a fun rental or something to watch on HBO. Grade:B"	4.0	A Walk to Remember... What A Relief!	2002-07-23	1	0	1

Mandy Moore however, takes the cake. The movie came out 3 years ago and I dont really know why I didnt see it then. Probably because they advertised it to death and I wasnt a mandy moore fan... Not anymore Im a good fan now. Mostly I like van halen and pink floyd.Mandy moores' performance in this is excellent!! And the songs are pretty good too. Wonderful movie! I saw it on tv but sadly only caught 10 minutes of it. I was intrigued by its story of a bad boy (shane west) landon carter and good girl (mandy moore) Jamie sullivan.I was very touched and I always like a good story I had to rent this then buy it very good!! I highly recommend this fellas if you want a good flick for you and your girl.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	When the movie first began, I was wondering if I had made a mistake...it started completely different from the book.  As the film progressed, I very much enjoyed it.  It took the story from the book and made it something of its own...they modernized it.  My question is...why?  Can someone not relate to something from the past?  This has to be broken down for people to understand?  Audiences are smarter than that, and many films assume that the viewer cannot understand what is happening unless it is broken down.  Give us some credit.Make no mistake...this was a terrific film, but the story in the book is vastly superior, more touching, and more human.The performances of Moore and West was fabulous...great chemistry between them.	4.0	Still can't top the book	2002-07-15	1	1	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2PYU9L1F4QVTC	Searl GT	I had a hard time rating this movie and had to see it twice to decide. I usually find Nicholas Sparks derivatives over-the-top emotionally manipulative. And usually a tragic end to boot. Who needs it? And this one follows the same formula. The difference is that this film is so well executed. Mandy Moore's performance is simply inspired. She even makes up for a less than stellar outing by Shane West. The sound track is one of those that perfectly matches the drama, and it's well done, especially the school play solo by Moore. She gets unexpected help from Peter Coyote playing Reverend Sullivan. His fine performance gives ballast and perspective in reminding us that these are teens we are watching wage the struggle of their lives. The only off-note is the Belinda (German)/Langdon (West) relationship. There's simply no way to make sense of what we see on the screen, and it's a mistake that carries beyond the illogic of bad screenwriting. It's a botched opportunity that could have given us a much different, insgeniously unlifting ending. Normally such a distracting blunder would lower the rating, but in this case, Moore's performance more than compensates.Of the Nicholas Sparks films I've seen, this one is by far the best.	5.0	Surprisingly Excellent	2013-02-03	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	Hard to believe what a director can do with a perfectly decent novel. Nicholas Spark's book of the same name was rendered so shamelessly into a teen weepie that looks like a research effort on all the teen movies of the 90s; it probably has the about a hundred scenes swiped from them to show for itself.Think Love Story, Carrie, the Grease series, etc etc, perhaps all of the names you can think of contributed heavily to this sachharine drivel about a guy and a girl who start out oh-so-at-odds with each other in high school (she's a nerdy choir girl and he a prankster dude, but of course tides turn) and then perfectly predictable events ensue.To its minor credit, the film at least keeps away from typical teen movie gags and goes about its business with a predictable rhythm. It's probably a decent date movie, but not something you'd enjoy too much if you're over 20 (mentally).	2.0	SYRUPY MARATHON OF CLICHES	2004-04-14	25	8	17

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A4V42I19M1PJH	"""sherlyss"""	So normally I hate tear jerkers and drama, but for some reason I bought this DVD. Perhaps it has gotta do with that cry song.Anyway in the first few scenes i was a bit disappointed cos the movie was not set in 1958 like it was on the book. The scene opened not unlike that of a teen slasher movie. Lots of brats. I thought it was gonna be one of those b grade stuff.But halfway down the line, the movie redeemed itself so well that it manages to embody the spirit of the book itself.Shane West(never realised he's soo fit ;) is an excellent actor. He manages to display angst and easily switches to sensitivity mode. He was so convincing in his role that I actually felt his pain and cried with him everytime that he cried. What i'm trying to say is that this movie touches deep.Mandy Moore is perfect as the innocent and sweet Jamie. I thought that she was still too pretty for the role though. Mandy as Jamie adds a bit of sensuality spice to this movie though.The cast are talented and I hope to see more of them in the future. This movie is such an antidote to the oversexed movies that is in the market right now. I find it extremely refreshing that it potrays pure, sincere love btwn teens.A word of warning though.. this movie, like its book WILL make you cry in many of its scenes, mostly due to the skilful acting of Shane.In conclusion, I'd say that this movie is perfect, just like the book was..	5.0	I was changed	2002-07-19	5	3	2

That's about all I could muster at the end of the movie (embarrassingly, between a flood of tears - after all, a guy isn't allowed to cry, right?) I must admit - my skepticism was extremely high upon first hearing about this movie. I queried myself as to the necessity of watching yet another ""teenage love story"". However, upon a friend's recommendation, I decided to give it a go, and realized that I had actually come close to making a terribly big mistake in my life had I not watched it. The movie was simply INCREDIBLE!Shane West does an excellent portrayal of High School bad boy Landon, and his desire to be popular and cool will surely strike a chord in many of our hearts. After all, during our precocious teenage years, there are arguably few things that are more important than being cool and universally liked by peers. One's self esteem is invariably tied with how others perceive us. And so that is how Landon is, until he meets sweet Jamie Sullivan, the local preacher's daughter played by beautiful Mandy Moore. Moore lends her character a huge amount of depth and surrounds her with an innocent, heartwarming aura, so much so that by the end of the movie, she can do no wrong. In addition, the movie is littered with many fabulous songs that are sung by none other than Moore's beautiful voice. One piece that stands out is ""Only Hope"", a beautiful song that will have your optical water droplets rolling out on more than one occasion. Another great tune that will get your good feelings swirling is ""Someday We'll Know"".As you watch their relationship blossom throughout the movie, your own feelings are inextricably linked and you find yourself cheering the couple on, marveling at their sweet times spent together and secretly envious of the intense love that they have discovered. For guys, I warn you - Jamie is so incredibly pure and unselfish that she will have your hearts fluttering by the end of the movie. As for Landon, he will no doubt reside in many girls' dreams for months to come, and he demonstrates a type of love that transcends ordinary levels, completing Jamie's life in each and every way. He shows her a love that she has not experienced before, and she helps him to discover himself and fills him with a desire to achieve higher things in life. There is a lot of hidden depth, and even when Landon fulfils Jamie's first and foremost desire (which I shall not reveal for those that have not seen the movie), he says it in such an unselfish way that it evokes true admiration of his love for her. By being together, they have both achieved things that were previously not possible.By the end of the movie, the viewer's faith in love and everything pure and good is restored to unshakeable heights. Love is truly the most powerful emotion known to mankind, and this heartwarming story reminds us that despite the challenges we face on a daily basis, there are things in life that make the experience truly worth it. To be able to witness the kind of love that Jamie and Landon shared is truly unforgettable, and as Landon says during the movie, ""We had more happiness than most people experience in a lifetime."" A Walk to Remember is a truly moving story that urges us to have faith in true love and to cherish all the wonderful things that we have in our lives."	5.0	A Movie to Warm Your Heart!	2003-01-26	271	257	14

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3KW4WFCNBA9HK	"""silver1206"""	I didn't expect to be so touched by this movie. In the first 20 minutes, i was kind of studying Mandy Moore's face and acting, but suddenly I started crying, and couldn't stop, I couldn't wait to see it the second time. This is not a perfect movie in every sense, but it's very beautiful, and it moves me in a way I've never imagined.  The screen chemistry between Shane west and Mandy moore is so convinceful and I hope they are dating in real life.I came from a different culture, The way I grew up teaches me loyalty to marriage and family, we really believe one love in a life time. When I first got here, I was very shocked to see so many black jokes about sex and marriages in TV and big screen. It looks like everyone start playing dating game since teenager, and never stops. The violents and drugs in school make me worry about my baby's future. This movie show me the pure love I didn't see in the screen for a long time. I disagree some reviews about this movie is unrealistic. I do believe the love described by the film exists, as long as we have faith in it, and we fight for it. It also let me reexamine my own marriage and my own life. When I started fighting with my husband because of all this work stress and life stress, we are kind of cruel to each other, say so much bad things we shouldn't say. It reminds me of the love we once had. The life is so short, why can't we forgive each other, be kind to each other. Just enjoy the life. The life is beautiful, if we want it to be.The movie want me to be a better person.	5.0	It reminds me that life is beautiful, if we want it to be.	2002-10-29	4	4	0

I was prepared to hate it.But sitting in the movie theater with all my friends, I was pleasantly suprised.Mandy Moore shows us that she is not just an airhead pop singer, but an actress, and a good one at that.  I walked away from the theater with a new respect for the eighteen year old celebrity.I also walked away with a handful of used tissues and tear stained cheeks.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A15TOO94YGYOE	"""soccersweetie02"""	If you ask me some of these teen movies that are coming out keep getting worse in the ways of sex and drugs and drinking.  Being a teen myself I felt that this movie was a real quality movie.  Sure there was some foul language in it but compared to something like Crossroads, where the whole point of that movie was for Britney Spears to lose her virginity, it seems like a totally innocent teen love story.  People seem to think that teens love movies with sex and drugs and think that we think that this kind of stuff is sweet or funny.  But I was utterly revolted.  A Walk To Remember is a sweet movie and it shows that teens don't have to be watching a movie with sex or drugs or violence to keep them entertained.  Besides that Shane West and Mandy Moore really seemed to have a connection on the screen  that just wrapped the movie up into a present of hugs, smiles, and tears.  Needless to say, I really loved it.	5.0	A sweet teen flick that really stands out!	2002-05-12	3	2	1

It is a true love story and although it is filmed with teenagers as the core audience, I think it can be enjoyed by anyone.  It's mature theme is universal and real. It was truly refreshing to see that even though Jaime and Landon are on different sides of the track, he being ""cool"" and her being ""spiritual"", Jaime did not let their love compromise her faith and her spirituality.  Instead, Landon was the one who grew closer to God.  Also, one of the greatest things about the movie is that the writer and the director did not feel the need to demonstrate love and affection through sexual acts which is seen quite often in movies.  Love and relationships are more than just that.  I would recommend this movie to any hopeless romantic but also to those who are cynical.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2U1M5DOGULIQA	"S. Thomas Adelstein ""Tom Adelstein"""	I saw this movie for the first time this year (2007). I didn't read the book. So, you only have my impression of the movie.For anyone who hasn't walked into a sound stage area or studied the Screenplay Paradigm, modern dramatic movies follow the three act model described by Aristotle in his brief but powerful essay called Poetics. As a side note, if you aspire to become a dramatic writer and you haven't read Poetics, shame on you.Shane West and Mandy Moore are the stars of the movie with Shane's Landon Cater as the voice of the play with all action going through him. So, he is the protagonist. You may not have much sympathy for him in the first act, but then you get an impression that he isn't the bully he's portrayed initially. The subtext shows him as more carrying and torn between a kind and gentle nature on his own and the need to associate with the click and bullies of his high school. He also has issues with abandonment of his father acted out in interchanges with his mother played by Daryl Hannah in a dark brunette hair piece.Forced by an incident where he is caught drinking and hurting another boy in a gang related incident, he has to interact with Jamie. First, he associates with her while tutoring disadvantaged children and secondly as an actor in the school's spring play.The interactions between Jamie and Landon are push pull until the second act, which occurs in a major plot point set in the school's screen play. Landon becomes transformed and goes on a path of actions aimed to help Jamie reach her list of goals.The antagonists in the play become his former gang buddies who play jokes on Jamie and take Landon to task for associating with Landon's new love interest, Jamie, the daughter of Reverend Sullivan played by Peter Coyote. (He gives an outstanding performance as a strong, insightful, honest and kind character.)The third act begins with a major plot point that swings the action when Jamie tells Landon she has leukemia. Landon's personal fall occurs as all good students of Poetics know, when Landon goes from a winner having a life changing event. Landon has a great relationship with a beautiful, talented and witty woman that inspires and strengthens him. Suddenly he finds out that everything that raised him to a self-confident young man will disappear. It also throws him back to his primary emotion conflict, the experience of loss that came when his father divorced his mother.Act three takes shape when Landon runs to hid father played by David Lee Smith. Landon feels spurned by his father, while his father actually attempts to help.Act III goes by quickly. The sympathy grows in the audience for Landon and Jamie as she gets closer to death. Resolution occurs when the antagonists come to apologize.In Poetics, the model governing the movie is a tragedy. The audience is genuinely moved. Landon loses Jamie and all the disharmony with her father transforms to love.I've been on many sets, worked in a cutting room, made documentaries and have written screenplays. I recognized every fade, set, cut and shot in the film and it still gripped me emotionally as if it really happened to me.Do I think of its as a great movie? I do, in spite of the sudden disappearance of Daryl Hannah's and David Lee Smith's characters. I can give you a lengthly list of movie making flaws. But, I cannot argue with the results of a budget-challenged movie.Ms. Moore and Mr. West gave performances I thought they had within them to pull off. Instead of musical performers, they appeared as well trained artists from major programs. They met the challenge of Aristotle and passed brilliantly.	5.0	Aristotle's Poetics - A Serious Reflection	2007-12-25	3	2	1

But I'm so glad I did get to see it.  It was refreshing to see a film that had a great storyline and yet had an innocence about it that I find sadly lacking in today's films.  If we wonder why today's teens are so hardcore I think you can look to what's been shoved down their throats by our hollywood media, always trying to appeal to the most graphic animal instincts of teens instead of to their minds and hearts.

I am completely obsessed with it ad I'm not usually into love stories. I thought the story line was perfect, it showed what real true love is and how it should be. I, like many others, cried at the end of the movie. It was tragic but I think it shows people how if you find love you should hold on to it and appreciate it.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1B57JTJ7NXXQE	Ted Washington	I had no expectations other than another mildy entertaining teen sweet predicatble &quot;mushy&quot; movie. Well I was totally pleased to get a very well thought out and very well acted mature approach to a subject that could have left the viewer in groaninig agony. I loved this movie. i loved the job that both Mandy Moore and Shane West did. I was actually floored by the adult treatment of this difficult subject. Now don't get me wrong, this movie is not without its faults. Like the predictability from Landon and Jamie's first encounter, &quot;... promise you won't fall in love with me...&quot; That aside I think that these two did an excellent job of portraying true teen love and how quickly they matured as they realized what they had. Mandy Mooore should stick to acting, and sing on the side. She has a beautiful voice but I get the feeling that she has some pretty good skills at this acting thing too. Kudos to the director for his guts to do it hisd way. Kudos to the casting director for having the guts to go with some unknowns for this flick.And the actors, what can I say other than reiterate my earlier comments, this is a great teenage love story. Although it may not have been a boxoffice smash, it is far better than a lot of the fare that I have seen this year and I am heartily recommending it to all my friends. By the way, I am 53 year old father of three boys , the youngest of whom is 20 and who recommended this movie to me. BRAVO.	5.0	Teen &quot;Mind Candy?&quot; I think not.	2002-08-05	6	6	0

I went to see the movie, and like ALL Nicholas Sparks books....they run everything making it into a movie.  The book is called ""A Walk to Remember"" for a reason.  And the reason why is that Landon had to walk her home after he got in trouble because he didn't have a car and everyone walked back then.  The relationship started on their walks....  I have had to disassociate myself from the wonderful books when I see the movie because I know that they are NOT going to be as good and this one really got off track like Nights in Rodante and Message in a Bottle where they added characters, and took out 1/2 the letters, and The Notebook where they changed the ending and have ruined any chances of ""The Wedding"" becoming a movie."	3.0	Book was Better	2010-04-20	0	0	0

Though I am a hopeless romantic, this movie brought my son to tears, and for me that is a good thing. I think kids should learn young about love, how to be and treat the other person, and how important it is that the love is defined by their actions. Teaching them young maybe they'll get it right from the start thus divorces will decrease.

Though the characters are in their teens, the movie encompasses more than the teen movie genre.  This movie is sweet and heartbreaking.Popular and misbehaving Landon ends up taking notice of the local pastor's daughter, who is not popular and involved in many extracurricular activities.  The movie is mostly about Landon and his experience with her.The acting by the principles is better than the average.  Mandy Moore shines not only in acting, but singing. Shane West manages to keep his rugged, tough composure even at sad moments.The soundtrack is amazing, and the setting is beautiful.I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good love story.

Which isn't exactly the reject table, but is definitely in self exile territory.  You have exactly one sweater.  You like to look at your feet when you walk.  Oh, oh, and yeah, for fun, you like to tutor on weekends and hang out with the cool kids from `Stars and Planets.'  Now how does that sound?""A truly touching love story of two young teenagers, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West), going through many tough times together.  Jamie and Landon have known each other since kindergarten, been to the same school, and were in the same classes throughout their whole life.  But they've always been in `different worlds' at school.  Jamie was more of the quiet and smart type, and Landon was more of the popular and careless type.  One day, Landon got in trouble for hanging out with his friends in private property.  He later was told to go join a play in which Jamie participated in.  Landon had lots of trouble memorizing his lines and asked Jamie for her help.  Jamie agreed to help him, but told him, ""You have to promise you won't fall in love with me.""As time went by, Landon fell in love with Jamie.  ""Jamie, I love you,"" Landon said.  Jamie answered him with, ""I told you not to fall in love with me.""  So they end up going out.  In between the time they were together, Jamie shocked Landon with the news of her having leukemia.  Her leukemia leads Jamie into the hospital where Landon is always spending time with her there.  Watch the movie to find out what happened at the end of this love story.Overall, this story is amazing.  It's a very sad story, but has lots of meanings to it.  I really love this story because it was so sweet and so passionate I watched it so many times and cried during the sad parts.  I recommend everyone watch this movie.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A3D6KZT0QG6UKB	"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press"""	"I am not the movie's target audience. I am a 34-year old male that never had much time for most teen movies (except for the more cynical fare like Heathers) and I almost pride myself on my cynicism and acerbic manner. I edited a book entitled ""Teddy Bear Cannibal Massacre.""Needless to say I did not rent this movie, buy this movie or see this movie in the movie theaters.I saw it on network television, late at night. And I couldn't stop watching it. And it's not a great movie - well I don't think it's a great movie - and its faults are staring you right in the face. Mandy Moore's character is too good (she does have her moments of anger but no self-doubt to speak of), the boy is too easily changed by her. The preacher father is a stereotype. The movie could double for an abstinence sermon. Half the movie involves the biggest cliche in Romance movies (ok, it's becoming the fourth biggest cliche after the montage, the ""don't get on the plane"" scene and the standard romantic comedy plot that involves coupling-breakup-reunion five minutes before credits) and I cried my eyes out.I read an article discussing The Catcher in the Rye and tearing it apart as a bag of cliches (dead brother, cute sister, fake teen dialogue) but its sincerity is so genuine that it overcomes these faults to the point where most readers don't notice them.

Mandy Moore of all people doesn't put any make-up on in this movie and I was ashamed. Although she delivers an exceptional performance, she didn't sing ""Candy""! ""I'm missing you like candy!"" Not heard here! Blasphemy! Pity for Shane West for not getting the John Connor part in the ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" masterpiece. He doesn't have ""whatever it takes"" to be a god like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Oh yeah, back to the movie. Landon falls in love with the outcast Jamie and their connection is true as they look at the stars at night. Oh, it was deeply touching, it's true, it's true.

However, I stuck with the movie, and it is now one of my all time favorites.  It reminds me of how it was back in high school (the jocks and the nerds).  In this movie, the jock learns a valuable lesson in life about Mandy Moore's character who is portrayed as a book worm.  It's a beautiful love story that teaches us lessons.	5.0	Beautiful Love Story That Teaches Us Lessons!	2013-11-21	0	0	0

At first I didn't know what to expect, I figured it would be like any old sappy love story but this one truly touched something deep inside. If have ever fallen in love, this is everything and more. The acting was splendid because it really offers more than what you expected.This is a great movie for people of all ages because there is something about love we can all relate to. You will definately gain a better perspective on life after watching this. Also, don't forget to keep a box of tissues around because you will definately cry!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	I know, I know guys, but I liked it for some reason. I don't know why. With refreshing intelligence, A Walk to Remember offers welcome relief from the recent onslaught of teen-movie crap. The movie is an adaption from the novel by Nicholas Sparks, and it is transplanted from 1958 to the present day, this admirable teen romance recognizes that two 18-year-olds, Landon and Jamie, can be smart, mature, and sensible about the very real love they share. He's a popular kid in the cool crowd. She's got a goody-goody reputation as the dowdy daughter of a local minister, her values and priorities aren't rooted in peer pressure, and Landon feels blessed by her self-assured nobility. Their mutual affection inevitably heads into Love Story territory, but the movie is honest enough to survive its own schmaltz, and its attractive cast embraces a tone of sincerity and mutual respect. Finally we see a teen movie with teens you can admire, and believe me with the trash out there now, this is a breathe of fresh air. It's just a great movie. Teens who can act? You bet. Hey anything is possible. Further proof in the existence of a divine creator.	5.0	Yeah, it's a chick flick, so what?!	2003-10-23	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A14Y8JMFETAP3P	Tracy Brownell	I didn't read the book and I totally dismissed this movie when I saw the previews.  The only reason I watched it the first time was because it was the only thing on HBO at the time.  I feel like I should send the people at HBO a thank you letter.  This is the BEST movie I have seen in such a long time.What I feared when I heard about the movie never actually happened.  I thought it was going to be preachy and one of those movies that try to shove religion and morals down your throat.  That wasn't the case at all.  There is religion and morals and all that.. but it's not trying to preach to anyone.  It's just about what this girl, Jamie Sullivan, believes.  No matter what you believe personally you will be able to relate.The love in this movie is so beautiful and touching that you will be changed after seeing it.  It's the type of love we all want to feel and the type of love we all want someone to feel for us.  I've watched this movie about 10 times now and I cry a little more each time.  Now I've found that I start crying BEFORE I get to the sad parts... because I know what's coming.I honestly recommend that everyone see this movie.  It's not like the normal hollywood teen/love movie.  It's so much more and so worth seeing.	5.0	A must see movie!	2003-07-14	0	0	0

Mandy Moore (Jamie) and Shane West (Landon) give a great performance as two teenagers from different ends of the popularity scale who, when thrust together by fate, find out how well they compliment each other.  Jamie helps Landon become a better person and Landon helps her come to terms with what is happening to her in her life.  It was nice to see a teen movie based on something other than sex.  It will make you laugh and cry.  So get your tissues ready!!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A13XBZD2N6W6WF	"""trebo12"""	This is THEE best love story I have EVER seen and probably the best movie, period.  I admit that I could so easily pick up on the cliches and the corny parts involving the interactions between Landon and his friends (which could be painful at times) but because of the chemistry between Landon and his woman, this was very EASILY overlooked and forgiven!Shane West is an amazing actor who should be recognized for his extraordinary expertise at taking his character on a journey - a 'walk to remember' if you will.  Those closeups of his emotions as he is riding in his car from his dad's that fateful night he is 'informed' (see movie) is absolute and utter PERFECTION.  It is consummate acting at it's best! Shane had the unbelievable task of taking us alon with his character from one extreme to the other and did so, absolutely believably, and in about 90 minutes! He is superb and I loved him and will be watching closely for his next movies. (can you say 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' in July!)I have NOT seen 'Once and Again' and I haven't even heard of any of Mandy Moore's songs before this movie, but these two really work together.  His face displays so much emotion when he looks at her that it seems almost implausible that it was just an 'act'.  Just the way he would look at her was enough to get me started tearing. Their romance was so believable that I would've definitely bet they were a real life couple and was surprised to hear they were not.  They had to be feeling SOMETHING for each other, at least while filming! Not to be overlooked, Mandy Moore is also to be commended for a very believable performance.  While you knew she wasn't an expert actress, (Who would be up against Shane, he is excellent) she was a very lovable character who got the job done effectively.  The reason for his growing affection was very easy to see and it would not have worked, if it wasn't for her performance as well.I have not cried this hard at a movie, ever, in my life. I was totally blown away by the series of sucker-punch events (I couldn't believe they were doing this to me!) in the last half hour of the movie. Totally unexpected, and while this may seem to be a formulaic movie, it's contagious to so many because it's what appeals to the HEART.  Even though critics lambasted it, (with one of the exceptions being my homeboy, Roger Ebert, whose opinion I ALWAYS respect) to me, this is real life, it COULD happend and does all the time, not like all that 'American Pie' type stuff.  Though that stuff happens too, we've seen way too much of that and not enough of this. People have gotten too cynical and have forgotten that true love STILL exists and triumphs.I never got sad in this movie, that's not what made me cry, it was how HARD Landon fell, his 'transformation' and the true genuine love between these two characters that did it to me.  It knocked me off my rocker! BTW, this movie has taken up permanent residence in my DVD player....	5.0	Shane, Shane, Shane.....	2003-02-20	4	4	0
B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	In Beaufort, North Carolina, a prank on a student goes terribly wrong and puts the student in the hospital. Landon Carter, a popular student with no defined plans for the future, is held responsible and forced to participate in after-school community service activities as punishment, which include starring as the lead in the school play. Also participating in these activities is Jamie Sullivan, the reverend's daughter who has great ambitions and nothing in common with Landon. When Landon decides he wants to take his activities seriously, he asks Jamie for help and begins to spend most of his time with her. But he starts to develop strong feelings for her, something he did not expect to do. The two start a relationship, much to the chagrin of Landon's old popular friends and Jamie's strict reverend father. But when a heart-breaking secret becomes known that puts their relationship to the test, it is then that Landon and Jamie realize the true meaning of love and fate. This isn't your typical love story, because when it comes down to it, the love is only part of the whole scheme. It is the movie's very simplicity, lack of pretension and strong supporting actors that also serves it so very well. Highly recommended.	5.0	A Walk to Remember	2010-02-26	4	3	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"[My rating is actually 3.5.]  Mandy Moore and Shane West are Jamie and Landon, a girl and a boy in a high school, both having nothing in common.  Jamie is a kind of a girl whose father is a local minister, and who obeys her father without complaining.  Landon is a boy who would drive a car at midnight, trespass into a factory only to get into trouble.  Then, however, they get interested in each other's lives, and soon fall in love.  The premise sounds very familiar to elder generations who have seen ""Love Story"" (check out young unknown Tommy Lee Jones), or ""Endless Love"" (check out young unknow Tom Cruise).Yes, the story of Nicholas Sparks (one of whose books is turned into film as ""Message in a Bottle"") is very simple and nothing new, and definitely not for the cynical, who would suspect something is wrong when the good-natured teenagers do not get killed or bullied on the screen.  But ""A Walk to Remember"" offers those teenagers, who believe in love, faith, friendship, you name it.  If you don't buy the idea, forget anything about the film and this review.The film is too sweet, reminding some of you of the sugar-coated titles of those oldie songs like ""Teen Angel.""  Sure, ""A Walk to Remember"" is about a good will that prevails, and is too good to be true.  But the actors are playing their roles sincerely, and both leads are incredibly good, so you should forget about the cynical attitudes, and just watch their characters.  Mandy Moore completely succeeded in changing her images, inside and outside alike, giving a convincing character of Jamie.  Shane West is equally good, rebellious and sensitive both at the same time.  Regrettably, the supporting parts are too weak, but those two young talented players hold the entire film to the end.I cannot give more stars than 3 because I have seen this kind of film too much, and I cannot endure to see the inevitable finale of the film with more interest than other younger reviewers would have.  But if you're sick and tired of recent films made for young people -- in other words, if you want no gross-out gags or dead bodies of drunk teens, ""A Walk to Remember"" is recommended."	3.0	"Not For the Cynical: Good, Old-Fashioned ""Love Story"""	2003-01-16	7	4	3

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	While working at a church camp this summer, I heard a lot of talk from females (both staff members and campers) about the movie A WALK TO REMEMBER. They went on and on about how good it was, how it portrayed love in a realistic way, about its positive image of Christianity, etc. They also said it's a very sad movie that made them cry. Well, right away I knew a major plot point (think big black dude with sickle).Anyway, I've been curious to what all the hubbub was about and when my sister left for school I borrowed her copy of the film and watched it. The film is just about what I expected. It gets a lot of things right that Hollywood usually get wrong. For instance, it:1. Portrays a very realistic love and romance.2. Portrays Christianity in a positive light; both Jamie and her father seem like average, normal, real Christians.3. The situations the teens find themselves in are very real and easy to relate. Landon and his friends swear and like to pull dangerous stunts, etc.However, with all the positive elements the movie fails in one major point: it tries to pretend to be something it is not. The movie is simple a teen chick-flick with a positive, realistic look on life. When the film keeps true to this, it is charming. However, when it veers away from it's true identity and pretends to be something else: such as the cheesy scene where Jamie uses the apologetic explanation about faith--nothing against that argument, I believe it, but in that scene in the movie it's just out of place and doesn't fit; it loses its charm and beauty. I was also bothered by the school in the movie: Landon punches another student and there are no adults around, the students keep leaving school in the middle of the day without family or school officials knowing, what happened to their graduation? I don't know why, but that stuff bothered me and kept me from suspending my disbelief.Overall, a better than average teen-weepy that has a positive look on life. Even though I don't fully understand, I see why all those girls this summer were so enthralled with this movie.	4.0	Better Than Average	2003-02-16	1	1	0

His punishment is to work on the drama club and tutor children on Saturdays.  While he is doing both of these, he gets to know Jamie Sullivan. She is the goody goody preachers daughter who does charity work for fun.Eventually the two end up together.

When I saw that the DVD would be coming out, I was really excited to get to see all of the deleted scenes and commentaries; however, I found the DVD has no deleted scenes on it at all.I listened to the commentary by Adam Shankman, Mandy Moore and Shane West and was very shocked to hear Shankman say he had 36 deleted scenes from which to choose for inclusion on the DVD.  Several times, the three would joke about a scene that had been deleted and tell the DVD listener that they may be able to see that very scene on this DVD.  It was fun to hear them talk about them, but why can't we watch them?I still can't give this DVD a bad rating.  &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is too amazing of a movie to do that, but as DVDs go, this one falls short.	4.0	Great story, but the DVD is lacking	2002-07-17	3	2	1

A great movie that remind me of genuine love, away from all the sex-crazed of today's society. The music fits perfectly and adds to the mood in the movie. A great exposure to Switchfoot, whose music is great. Happyness and sadness in this movie, and it's one of those movies that doesn't have such a happy ending.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A5L44X9QKSU0F	Venturin	I am astounded that the critics have been so negative toward this film. This is one of the most inspiring movies I've seen and is a clear favorite of the vast majority of those who have fallen in love with the story and the characters. It seems apparent to me that the critics are so biased against this movie because of the traditional values the film espouses. But what is wrong with wanting to change yourself and become a better person when you find and fall in love with someone who inspires you? What is wrong with loving someone so deeply that you would go to the ends of the earth with them, be there for whatever lies ahead? What is wrong with taking the path of light over darkness?Open your heart to this movie and you will find inspiration and be touched by the love we all would wish for anyone.BTW; Listen to the words Jamie sings in the choir at the beginning of the film. She is asking God for help, for someone to see her through. God answers.	5.0	Ignore the critics and Open Your Heart to this Gem	2013-03-26	1	0	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A38TC59GM2WW1X	"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts"""	I just saw this movie for Mandy Moore, and was prepared to ignore how bad it was going to be.  Fortunately I didn't have to resort that.  I fully expected &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; to be one of those ridiculous chick flicks about the &quot;bad boy&quot; that all the girls seem to fall in love with, and how a good girl changes him.  Well, yes this movie does have that, and a bunch of other glaring cliches and absurdities.  However, surprisingly as a whole the movie worked for me.  I can't explain it, I guess the best way to put it is, the movie's heart was in the right place.  There was a lot of genuine emotion expressed, and Mandy Moore shared some very real and believable chemistry with co-star Shane West.  Mandy proves she can not only act, but also pull a chameleon on us; she is surprisingly believable in her role, in stark contrast to her usually glamorous image.  Yet despite her playing an unpopular &quot;daddy's girl&quot;, Moore is beautiful, adorable, and shines throughout the film, making it no wonder (to me at least) why Landon (West) fell for her.  And I gotta hand it to West; me being unpopular in high school, I tend to hate these cool &quot;bad boys&quot; in movies, but West's charactor earned my respect by the end of the film.  All in all, this is one of the better teen movies, although a sad one.  By the way, I detect not a little similarity between this movie and the much worse &quot;Here On Earth&quot;; I wonder who copied whom?	5.0	4.5 Stars; pleasantly surprised.	2004-02-17	0	0	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AXOJWNWISOBKE	Victoria	I loved this movie; I saw it with my two best friends and we cried almost the whole time.  I didn't think it would be that great because many singers have tried the whole acting thing and weren't very good.  Mandy surprised me though; she couldn't have chosen a better movie to debut her acting skills.  I could relate to a lot of her feelings being in high school myself (when I saw the movie).  Shane gave a good performance also.  His portrayal of a bad boy turned good, because of a girl, was very smooth.  He didn't do it in just one day; he gradually did it.  I think Shane and Mandy fit the parts perfectly.  I also liked how the director took almost everything from the book and used it.  So many movies made from books don't follow it very well.I wanted to see the movie because I read the book and I loved the it.  In fact, I couldn't put it down; I finished it in one day.  So, if you have seen the movie or if you haven't seen the movie, I suggest reading the book.	5.0	Mandy Moore gives a spectacular debut	2002-07-07	1	1	0

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A8V5EYSKLP3VW	V. Jancic	"Very Disappointing.  If you have read the book, please do not spoil the lovely impression by seeing the movie.I guess that a movie that's ""based on a novel"" really has a lot of leeway. Regardless, if you forget the fact that they ripped the plot to shreds, reinvented the characters, and placed it in the wrong time period, this movie was just plain bad. Of course, the novel itself was not a masterpiece, but the things that made it charming and entertaining were missing from this film including the heart of the story, which focuses on how West and Moore's character's relationships effect each other; the movie fails to show how this relationship is established and instead skips ahead to the hand-holding and terms of endearment. The appeal of Moore's character Jamie rests in her ability to be completely naive, believing that everyone is inherently good and devoting herself to helping everyone she can. Of course, since no one is really like that, Jamie's personality was tweaked to make her seem more believable. The viewer is already in a fictional world, so why do the characters have to be changed to seem more real? Mandy Moore, while talented in other realms of entertainment, comes off as a mediocre actress. The role doesn't stray far from her image as a sweet girl-next-door. West, a regular in teen films, did a decent job with the material he was given. The thing that probably bothers me the most about this movie is that, like other pop stars in their first starring role in a major motion picture, the first words that come out of their mouths are sung (i.e. Lance Bass in On the Line and Britney Spears in Crossroads.) They rave about how they are trying something new that is separate from their music careers and all they end up doing is singing."	1.0	A dissapointing adaptation of the book.	2005-07-29	24	7	17

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A2GRK2UONNYH0A	Wayne H. Warren Jr.	"This is a truly remarkable film.  A great film is characterized by the message that it leaves with its viewers and with the impact that it has on the ""soul"".  This movie scores on both accounts because it is inspiring; it is sad, yet fulfilling; it restores faith in human dignity, while at the same time extolling the beauty in life and in the power of love, the most powerful of all human emotions.It is important not to abandon this film in the beginning, when it appears that it is just another of those uninspiring and ridiculous teenage movies.  At the outset, the film depicts the hero, Landon Carter (Shane West) as just another hare-brained teenager headed for lifelong  problems.  After getting into trouble by pulling a childish initiation prank on a ""friend"", he encounters the school nerd, a preacher's daughter, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), who is tutoring (voluntarily) problem kids at the same school that Landon is sent to for disciplinary reasons.  Landon has actually been assigned three duties by the school principal for his misbehavior:  janitorial work every day after school, the tutoring, and participation in the school's Spring play.  He encounters Jamie again in the play, where she is a singer.  As the lead male part, Jamie sings to him at the end of the play, her voice and beauty providing another step toward his transformation.  Landon begins to realize that the things that Jamie represents are far loftier than what he has been exposing himself to by hanging around with the ""cool"" kids.  This transformation really blossoms when his ""friends"" prepare a poster depicting Jamie's face on the body of a porn star.  Landon then rejects his old friends, even to the extent of punching his former best friend in the face.After convincing Jamie's pastor father (Peter Coyote) that he should have the faith to allow Landon to take Jamie to dinner on Saturday night, love really begins to bloom after they spend the evening together and take the ""walk to remember"".  Jamie had helped Landon with his lines in the play only on the condition that he not fall in love with her, which was a joke to him at the time.  It is not a joke anymore, especially after Landon admits to Jamie that he has fallen for her and Jamie reminds him of their agreement.  Of course, she must eventually admit both to her father and to Landon that she has also fallen in love.Part of the power in this movie is that, not only is Landon Carter changed by Jamie's love and outlook on life,  but his friends are changed as well, mainly as a result of his transformation.  They come to realize that Jamie's and Landon's love is true and that Jamie's way is far superior to their own.  Jamie's father also learns some important lessons about his daughter's (and thus his own) happiness and that it is worthwhile to have faith in someone who haschanged for the better.  Landon's relationship with his estranged father is also reversed as a result of Jamie's influence.  In other words, Landon's transformation develops into a chain reaction that carries through to almost all of the characters in the movie, all this being ultimately attributed to the influence and positive attitude of one very special young lady.There are many lessons to be learned for young people from this film.  I only hope that many of them will see it and let its message help them to change their attitudes and their lives.  At the minimum, I would like to see many young people be as profoundly affected by this film as I was.My congratulations to the Director, Adam Shankman, the principal players Mandy Moore, Shane West, Peter Coyote, and Daryl Hannah for the superb jobs that they did in making this film into the masterpiece that it is.Changes:  There are a few changes that I would have made in this movie to make it more accurate.  As a professional astronomer, these changes are all related to Jamie's interest in astronomy and telescopes.1. Jamie's line about Pluto should be extended to read ""Pluto rises a few minutes before the Sun and, at magnitude 14, is too faint to be seen by this small telescope anyway.  When I have a larger telescope, it will be possible to see Pluto.""2. In her line about building a larger telescope to see Comet Hyakutake next Spring, the word return should have been omitted because that comet was a first-time visitor from the outer Solar System, at least in recorded history.  Comets are usually discovered and known to become bright far before they reach  the inner Solar System where we can see them clearly.3. I can imagine that the Director felt that the star naming business added a romantic touch to the story, but this practice is a scam and has been strongly discouraged by the International Astronomical Union, the world organization of professional astronomers.  Perhaps some gift along similar lines, such as a Comet Hyakutake necklace or pendant, would have been more appropriate."	5.0	A Film to Remember for All Time	2006-05-09	3	2	1

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1YOD7JN6RT90Q	Wendy	"Opposites attract. Bad boy Landon and reverend's daughter Jamie embark on a romantic journey in the heartfelt film A Walk to Remember based on the book by Nicholas Sparks.The movie, released in 2002, features Mandy Moore as serious and faithful Jamie Sullivan, and Shane West as popular and cool Landon Carter. When a harmless prank goes awry, Landon is forced to participate in the school play and tutor students with mental disabilities, all activities that Jamie enjoys. Even though they start out disgusted by each other's values, Landon finds himself falling for her.Jamie opens his world, showing him what he is missing out on in life. Little does he know that Jamie's passion for life was influenced by the fact that she has cancer.This film portrays the pure and innocent experience of first love based on truth and respect. The beginning may seem like the usual teen romance movie, but as it progresses, the captivating chemistry and strong attraction between the two characters distinguishes this movie from others.The director, Adam Shankman, made a great decision with the cast. The appealing teen pop star sensation Mandy Moore acts her heart out, and displays her vocal skills in the touching musical number ""Only Hope"". She manages to pull off a completely opposite role from her last movie as Lana, the mean girl from The Princess Diaries.However, the tragic twist of the film is completely unexpected and out of place. The ending ruined the movie, and began to seem like just a remake of ""Love Story"". Set in North Carolina, the director seems to have forgotten some of the logical details, such as accents.Overall, this film is definitely a walk that is hard to forget. For people of all ages, this movie will trigger many tears and touch on the deeper meaning of life, reminding us that true love occurs in the least expected places."	4.0	A movie to remember	2009-12-01	4	4	0

Otherwise, it is an uplifting movie about a main character who is Christian. Instead of totally ridiculing Christians as most films do, this one shows the importance of faith in one's life.

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AGVWHBDMCG1TX	wlp325	"A few weeks ago, I caught the last 45 minutes of A Walk to Remember, shown on TV from 8-10pm.  I was completely captivated by the story and presentation, and noticed the movie would repeat again from midnight until 2am.  So I decided to watch the beginning until the moment I would ""catch up.""  I ended up watching the entire movie, then laid in bed at least another hour thinking about what I had just experienced, both visually and emotionally.  As I would need to wake up by 6am, get my son fed and off to school, then get to work myself, at age 62, the night of little sleep and contemplation would ""take its toll"" on the ensuing day.  During my lunchbreak, I went to Best Buy and bought the DVD (it was still being sold), and later ordered the VHS version on Amazon.com (yes we still use our VHS player), as well as the book of the same name by Nicholas Sparks.  Having watched the movie on these mediums several times, I discovered just how much of the movie's TV version was cut, no doubt to fit into a 2-hour time-slot with an ""avalanche"" of commercials.  Having watched the complete movie and read the book, I felt compelled to review the movie as, for the first time in my life, I actually preferred the movie version of the story to the book, although both are excellent.  Also, both brought me to tears, also a first for either a movie or book.I have nothing negative to say about A Walk to Remember.  Its few ""cons"" are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film, perhaps one of the best ever to come out of Hollywood and Warner Brothers - a monumental feat given its relatively low production budget.  The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it again and again. It's a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever.  It shows how deeply loving someone so totally can transform you to gain the strength to forgive, to accept, to respect, and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider.  This movie conveys what true love really is, how it can affect people in life and death, and how absolutely beautiful it can really be for those lucky enough to experience it to its deepest level.The movie is so caring and sincere, it subtly draws you into it. It shows a popular in-crowd teenage boy discovering that there is much more to life than reckless, carefree, aimless behavior. When a stupid prank turns harmful, a perpetrator, Landon (one of the lead characters played by Shane West) is ""sentenced"" to perform community service activities, and these bring him into close contact with Jamie, a non-cool, non-popular nerdy religious girl (the other lead character played by Mandy Moore), who performs the same activities -- by choice.  Landon has heretofore always treated Jamie with ridicule and disdain.  Though he's known her all his life, through their interaction he suddenly discovers her passion for life, with interests and a depth he never knew existed.  He begins to find a new path for his own life, and the ensuing transformation is wonderfully portrayed.  The performances of Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote (Jamie's minister father), Daryl Hannah (Landon's single mother), and Lauren German (Landon's former girlfriend), in particular, are extremely touching, beautifully performed and totally genuine.Although the picture's main theme is about Landon and the transformation he undergoes, Jamie is clearly the ""anchor"" of this movie.  She's exceptionally sweet, genuine, innocent, highly intelligent and passionate.  She was so interested in astronomy, that she built her own telescope and would venture into their small town cemetery, in the middle of night, to pursue her celestial passion.  She did this, not to impress, but for its own sake.  Her beliefs in herself are solid and she never changes.  She wears no makeup and wears the same low-key, non-fashionable baggy clothes from the beginning, throughout and to the end of the picture. She actually likes who she is -- the way she is.  Unlike Landon, her self-image is not based on what others think.She has just enough attitude to not take any disingenuousness from anyone - and when being ""toyed"" with would often ""fire"" right back.  When Dean (a friend of Landon's and leader of the in-crowd ""pack"") mockingly asked her why her ""Higher Power"" could not get her a new sweater (she always wore the same one), she responded, ""He's too busy looking for your brain.""  When Landon humiliated her in front of his peers, she coolly walked away at the time, but when he later came to her for help she calmly slammed the door in his very surprised face.  She's a strong figure that ""sees through"" the behavior and demeanor of her peers and slowly influences them to value her way of existing, more than their own self-centeredness.  Her role clearly shows how one individual of virtue and faith can so positively influence those around her, not by preaching or forcing her values, but by example, by simply living her life true to her own beliefs with a positive attitude, and not succumbing to peer pressure forces, no matter how difficult.Landon's role clearly demonstrates the power of forgiveness and how its redemptive qualities can bring about caring unselfish behavior.  Landon's in-crowd peers, treating Jamie cruelly at every opportunity (and eventually ostracizing him when he defended her), were eventually forgiven by Landon, and when tragedy struck they were all there to offer their support for him (and ask for forgiveness each in their own way).  And in what may be the film's most touching scene (though there are many), Landon essentially forgives his estranged father for leaving his family for another woman, and thanks him for his considerable support in making it possible for Jamie to return home.One leaves this movie with a number of messages.  The movie teaches to always be open to new experiences and to never ""judge a book by its cover,"" but to get to know people before judging them. The strongest message, however, is that of being a better more passionate person yourself, and to cherish those around you and the time you have with them.  You're left with a sense of true love being so deep and pure that just being with the one you love brings such wonderful joy to your life.  You would do anything for that person, even putting your own happiness aside for the sake of theirs.  Jamie was able to change an arrogant, self-absorbed teenager into a tender, loving person who was willing to do virtually anything for her - and did!Don't be surprised if you end up falling in love with both Moore's and West's characters. The enduring innocence, sweetness, evolving chemistry and eventual deep love between the movie's leads is genuine, totally heartfelt and compelling - unequaled in any other movie -- period.  In the middle of this film are a series of the most incredibly romantic scenes you will ever see in an American firm.  They easily flow from scene to beautiful scene, showing two intelligent, thoughtful and sincere people slowly falling for each other.  From Casablanca to Love Story to Titanic, no other on-screen pair conveys such an honestly felt passion for each other.Despite the considerable sadness surrounding their romance, the movie leaves the audience with optimism for life, love, faith and the ability for everyone to change, the possibility to become a better person -- at any age. It is a movie with this clear, beautiful and optimistic message.  I watch it repeatedly with both joy and melancholy.  Perhaps Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert (renowned longtime TV and Chicago-Sun Times film critic) said it best when he concluded in his film review, ""A Walk to Remember is a small treasure."""	5.0	Absolute Hidden Treasure	2011-12-01	3	3	0

It is one of those movies that tend to stay with you through out a lifetime, such as; The Godfather, Gone With The Wind, Fireproof, The Notebook... and so many others have stayed with me. I can usually figure out the entire plot of the movie before the first quarter has even played, BUT not this one! It had a surprising twist in it that left me in tears. This movie pulled at my heart strings til the very end! Great Cast, Great acting, All around a Great movie!

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	AMPHEOA6XD6S9	Zeke	"There isn't enough great things that you can say about this movei. I took my Mom(who loved the book) to see this one rainy friday night & I walked into it thinking that I would be either sitting through another typical teen movie or a chick flick. Man was I wrong! I absolutly loved this movie!!! Mandy Moore blew me away with her awesome performance as the sweet & spirit-strong ""Jamie Sullivan""! She truly has an incrediable talent in both music & acting & I can't wait to see what happens to her down the road. As for Shane West he played his part as bad-boy ""Landon Carter"" with great acting. I liked how his character changed his perspective on life throughout the film. He was also great in this & I would expect a bright future down the road for him too. Basically these two young actors carry the film with great ease & are one of the many reasons to see this flick. The story is awesome as well! Filled with some humor, happiness, & major sadness, this movie leaves you with something special after it's all over. Something special that you will never forget. I went again to see it by myself & loved it even more then the first time. Im not into pop music at all but the soundtrack to this is amazing. Especially the two tracks ""Cry"" & ""It's gonna be love"" are my faves. There are other good ones too by Mandy & Switchfoot. This movie changed my perspective on life & its an extrodinary walk to take. I hope you choose to take it & I hope it gives as much to you as it did for me."	5.0	Shane & Mandy Rock!!!....

B00005JKVZ	A Walk to Remember [VHS]	A1DSXU0RB0DUPP	"Zoey ""CIMWAY"""	"I love this movie.One Sunday afternoon last fall I stumbled upon this movie on one of the cable channels.  It touched me so that the very next day I ordered the movie from Amazon.  Each time I watch it, I feel good.  Others who have watched it at my suggestion have enjoyed it as well.I am a middle aged woman who saw ""Love Story"" when it was first released.  I have also watched ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Beaches"". The difference between those movies and ""A Walk to Remember"" is the spirituality of the terminally ill character.  Jamie stays the course of her christian journey in the face of extremely difficult circumstances in her life.  I think the ""Walk"" is not only her marching down the aisle for her wedding but her 'walk' in her short but well lived life.  The development of the Landon character was perfect.  I especially like the montage scene where Landon changes position each time the Paula character hits him but near the end he is able to maintain his stance with confidenece.  At this point he is ready for the blessing of the Jamie character.Shane West and Mandy Moore are excellent.  Peter Coyote was great too.I will admit that I felt the chemistry between the two main characters was so powerful that I would love to see them get together in real life. But that is not my business and only they know what is best for them.This is a very good movie.  Yes there are some technical inconsistencies and a few corny lines and Eric's lines were sometimes over the top.  The few mishaps are not enough to cancel the very powerful message of this movie."	5.0	"I love  ""A Walk To Remember"","	2007-01-11	5	5	0
