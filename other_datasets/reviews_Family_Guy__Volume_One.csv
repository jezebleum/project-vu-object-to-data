B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AEWZD9P0D5M4F	Aaron	"Anyone who thinks this is better than ""Blue Harvest"" is kidding themselves.  Unfortunately, the powers-at-be who write for Family Guy were more infatuated with themselves when writing this than with Star Wars.  With ""Blue Harvest,"" the focus was on creating a true parody of the movie using the Family Guy characters.  With ""Something Something...,"" they completely lost focus.  If you're going to buy it, buy it used and as cheap as you can, and then it should be worth the price."	3.0	Such a disappointment	2010-02-03	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A35R8PJSEURHHF	Aaron Merkel	I was a very big fan of Family Guy. This was Very boring, I had to force myself to stay awake to watch it.  The jokes were very bad and the characters seemed very bland.  This is not movie quality.  I laughed only a couple of times.  If yoiu watch THE CRITIC you can see how it is like family guy but better, in my opinon. Avoid this unless you need help sleeping.	1.0	What????????	2005-11-01	15	5	10
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A26PN7O602PZDP	Aaron Shoun	...But there are no extra features like there are on the dvd. This, as with all Amazon Unbox downloads, is a very high quality Windows media file taken from the DVD apparently, as all curse words etc. are intact, but with one audio track and no subtitles or captions. Digital downloads are no substitute for DVD, so save your money; if you are looking for the best value I suggest getting the DVD here on Amazon or on ebay, possibly even your local discount superstore. I long for the day when Digital downloads will contain all the features that a DVD does, it's mighty convenient.	3.0	Love Family guy and this is a great price but...	2008-11-04	1	1	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1VRDZ5HMESQA1	"A. B. Crain ""&#34;SydCrainBop&#34;"""	Not since South Park has an animated show been so honest, edgy, ballsy, and out-right hilarious! The Griffin family deals with situations that even The Simpsons dare not touch. If you are sensative and easily offended, this is not a show for you. On the other hand, if you like jokes straight from the hip, no holds barred, and characters that say everything that you wish you could say in public without being jailed, shot, or run-over, then this is the show for you! Also, for those 40 and over, Family Guy makes endless hilarious referances to pop culture from the 60's, 70's, and 80's! Check it out!	4.0	Funny, rude, edgy, and freakin sweet!	2008-02-08	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AQPWHXNTXZBUU	"A. Bitetto ""Tony/Ris"""	I bought this video not so much because I really like Family Guy, but because I have all DVD releases and I feel it isn't right to exclude any.  Now, I did like Seth McFarlane's interpretation of the next story of Star Wars, but I find it hard to keep buying these releases when they are so overpriced (come on, this is just 2 episodes afterall).  In the beginnning, a box set was a season, now it is only 13 episodes, or about half a season, and still at the regular list of $40, sooner or later I'm gonna call it quits.  But, not any time soon.  So far.	4.0	Goin' through the motions	2010-02-10	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A34HQBT3HVPVLC	"""abones80"""	"I bought these DVDs with high expectations, and they were not met. If you want clever humor, or even jokes that make sense more often than not, look elsewhere. First of all, the cast and premise are shamelessly lifted from the Simpsons. Its almost pathetic, a fat dopey dad, a nagging wife, a brother sister and a baby...where have I seen that in cartoon form before? The majority of the plots are just pretext for Peter's stupid mugging and most of the jokes either fall flat, make no sense, or get a couple of cheap laughs. The show tries to ""push the envelope"" but it just comes out boring. The episodes usually contain some totally inane cut scene that has nothing to do with anything other than trying to get a few more laughs out of the morons who thing MTV is substantive. People who watch this show and think it's coherent need to turn off the TV and read an actual book with an actual plot. That being said, Stewie is the shows only saving grace, since he is the only character who is not either a total retread of something we have already seen 100 times or a cardboard cutout. His espisodes are actually clever since they don't focus on Peter falling down, getting drunk or farting. If you want a show with clever jokes, watch The Simpsons. If you want a show that has a semblence of a plot or an attempt at an actual message, watch South Park. If you are a dope with zero attention span who likes meaningless 30 second sound bites, this is the DVD for you."	2.0	Occasionally  funny, mostly just stupid	2004-03-07	32	5	27

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2O8RIDCJ0H83V	Acoma	"This is as close as it will come to having a Family Guy motion picture. I'm not an original Family Guy fan, but started watching it when it was on Adult Swim. It always makes me laugh and great to watch before going to bed. This ""movie"" centers around, as the name suggests, Stewie and finding his real father which is hilarious as Stewie is probably my favorite character next to Peter Griffin.It has a lot of elements from the creators really thanking fans for bringing the show back to life. Overall, if you like Family Guy and wondered what it would be like uncensored with swearing in it (although not much..it's rather tame) then this is a must buy."	5.0	The Family Guy Movie...	2005-10-17	2	1	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1AMCL0JLE88A	"""adcock311"""	This is a show for people who enjoy pop culture. It will not be for everyone, as some people will not get the jokes. Some of the reviews on here state that there are only 2 episodes per disc, this is wrong. There are 7 episodes a disc. Also, some reviews complain about the missing Osama bin Laden joke, this was taken out by Seth because he was supposed to have been on one of the planes on 9/11. It is a complete injustice that this show was cancelled TWICE! Fox just didnt realize what they had, as shown in the great DVD sales and it beating out Leno and Letterman in ratings since being put on Adult Swim.	5.0	Genius	2003-08-04	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	"This show is one of the funniest on Adult Swim. It now shows on Fox, and another channel, The CW, formerly known as the WB, which hosted some of my favorite tv shows: From Animaniacs and What I Like About You to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter and Jerry Springer (Yes, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I was once a fan for a few months or so. But don't remind me!).The main characters are Peter Griffin, Chris Griffin, Lois Griffin, Brian  (the white pup), Stewie Griffin and last but not least, Meg Griffin who is tortured and put down by nearly everyone, especially her main family! Oh, joy!This cartoon comedy takes place in a fictitious place in Quahog, Rhode Island and the script was finished in 1999, by the uberly awesome, Seth Green, and originally produced for Fox.Peter is very funny, but he holds a somewhat considerate and compromising character, especially when it comes to his dear wife, Lois. Chris Griffin is a douche bag, to be put lightly. He's pretty clueless, likes to play with his pathetic little ""paddle ball"" thing, and thinks about how sad his non-existent sex life is! LOL He also has hinted at being confused at best with his sexuality. I think this has been made clear in 1 or 2 episodes. Once in a while though, when he's not being threatened by the Evil Monkey that scarily points to him from his closet, he manages to spew some thought-provoking knowledge to his parents, and sometimes to Meg.Meg is the unlucky sister of Chris, and the daughter to the hilariously heavy-weight, Peter and the level-headed and overworked mother, Lois. She spends her days trying to fit in and be ""one of the guys"", but seldom does it work! As far as we know, she has had one boyfriend, and it probably lasted a short, short time. He was a loser anyway! She's relatively smart, but is highly ignored and unaccepted. Next is Stewie, the baby. He is pretty evil when it comes to the way that his brain works. If he's not plotting plans to dominate the majority of the world, he's conjuring a plan to kill his mother, Lois. Stewie talks, but for the most part, it seems that no one really understands him. Lastly, Brian is the intelligent white dog, who also happens to be a smart-mouthed drunkard. It's sad how he falls out of chairs, and falls onto the floor half of the time, but strangely, any human, especially Stewie, understands every word he manages to mumble.This show is number 2 in comical relief to very few Adult Swim shows. The only one that I favor over said show is probably The Oblongs.4 stars."	4.0	Great for the WHOLE family!! d>_>b	2007-10-13	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2LPJD19MGBNXJ	"Adrian Jenkins ""southerndudeman"""	"I'm wanting and awaiting a release of the third season of ""The Simpsons"", and yet, here is ""Family Guy"" in all of its humorless glory, still (trying to) ride Homer's coattails. Yes, if you buy the Simpsons, you can get a discount on this second- (or third-) rate knockoff.I tried to give this show a chance, despite its already horrible premise. You have a fat, overweight, lackadaisical Everyman, his semi-reasonable wife, a smart daughter, a dumb son, a super-intelligent baby (with a disgusting 40-year-old voice) and a talking dog. The family would get into, and out of, ludicrous capers (which isn't necessarily bad - the Simpsons is often at its best in these moments; I mean, Homer becomes an astronaut?).However, where the family guy really runs afoul is in its horrible writing. Whereas the Simpsons often times tweaks popular culture and current events, the Family Guy runs over them with a sledgehammer. In fact, this show seems to want to be more South Park than the Simpsons, but is afraid to jump over the cliff in the profanity aspect. So instead, we are treated to mean-spirited jokes about Oprah Winfrey or the NBC network, which fail to amuse.I am surprised by the reviewer who claims this show is just ""too witty, shocking and satirical"" for American tastes. In fact, the Family didn't fail because of its shock content; in fact, most of America hardly batted an eye during its two (or maybe three, but who's counting?) season run. I remember reading a TV critic who lamented the Fox network's choice of ignoring a gold mine in Futurama, while continuing to run episodes of the sad-sack Family Guy. Indeed, I lament those of you who shell out your hard earned money for this tripe."	1.0	Ugh.	2003-04-07	97	17	80

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	"Don't let my subject line fool you. Yes, the DVD art was right, that this ""movie"" has never actually been ""seen"" before, but damn, a lot of jokes sure seem familiar, eh?""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" revolves around who else, but Stewie, the youngest member of the Griffin family, and arguably, the most popular. So it would make sense that if they were to do an hour and a half ""Family Guy"" movie (or just a really long episode) it should star Stewie! Remember the epsiode ""Road To Rhode Island?"" Deja Vu! After about a half an hour of going almost nowhere, with only one funny joke (""Ew! A band-aid!""), Stewie spots a man on television who looks remarkably like himself. Assuming this man must be his father, as someone like Peter couldn't be the father of such a genius, he takes Brian out on the road with him, on a cross country trip in Quagmire's RV, to find who he thinks is his long lost father. When he finally tracks this man down, however, he discovers it is his future self. Realizing what a loser he will become, Stewie rushes to try and fix up his future life, so he won't end up a 35 year old virgin with only one testicle.Now, aside from the fact that the movie moves at a snail's pace and takes forever to get to it's point, it just isn't half as funny as the show. Not quite sure why that is. Even the new, fourth season is still funny (although not quite as good as the ""Family Guy"" we knew in the past), but this ""movie"" just doesn't live up to the show. The best thing about ""Family Guy"" is that, if you don't like a joke, it doesn't matter, because there's another one coming around the corner. Here, they are few and far between, and often, quite unfunny. There is a lot of recycling used in this movie, a lot of jokes that have been done long ago, it makes me think that this movie is meant to appeal to people who have yet to pick up on the show. I honestly don't think this movie was a bad concept, but they easily could have compacted it into a normal 22 minute episode (afterall, nothing really happens in the first 22 minutes of this movie). Of all the jokes, sight-gags and whatnot, I'd say there are half a dozen funny ones (love that Stork gag). I think you really have to be a hardcore ""Family Guy"" fan to pick this DVD up."	3.0	Nothing You Haven't Seen Before...	2005-09-27	0	0	0

I never thought that I would see a show rival that of the Simpsons in my lifetime, but here we have Seth MacFarlane's exceptional series, The Family Guy.  The epitome of the American family, Peter helms the show with the goofball humor that you normally finding yourself laughing at in your own film.  The rest of the characters truly give 100% for each episode, with young Stewie emerging as an ultimate favorite.  It is impressive when a television program can take social issues and realistic moments and twist them into humorous antidotes about life and family.  I think that is what is most important about this program is the ""wholesome"" family values that it promotes.  While it may not demonstrate at the beginning of each program, by the end it really drives home the power of the American family.  For those that may not see this, I loved this show.  I couldn't get enough of it when it was on television, so I went ahead and bought the series, and it is the best purchase I have ever made.  I just finished watching this first compilation for the tenth time and cannot wait to rewatch again.  I encourage all that have ever heard of this series to rewatch and enjoy, and for those that are experiencing this groundbreaking series for the first time, I can only say this.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3BA78AFYTVEJ2	"A highschooler ""Al"""	Family guy is by far the funniest and intelligently written cartoon comedies, no no, television show out there.  I first discovered this gem on dvd... I had previously watched one or two episodes on fox, but because of the edgy material fox put the show on at crazy times, and never stuck to a schedual.  But since the show has been released on dvd a huge fan following has appeared over night and rightfully so!Family Guy has the normal cartoon (simpsons) make-up the oaft of a dad, loveable as always is Peter Griffen.  Peter is one of my favorite characters.  Lois Griffen is the glue that holds the family together.  Chris Griffen is the troublesome son.  Meg Griffen is the self-conscious daughter.  But family guy has some unique characters as well Brian, the talking dog, is absolutely hilarious and is Peter's complete opposite.  Funnily enough, Brian is the intellectual character and always has some profound comment on any subject!  And of course Stewie.  How can you forget Stewie.... the bond villian like baby who is obsessed with killing his own mother!!  All of these core characters and of course the numerous other hilarious ones Joe, Loretta, Clevland, and Quagmire--giggidy giggidy make for one hilarious, edgy, and just flat out funny television programNo review would be complete without mentioning the one element that makes family guy what it is.  The cut scenes.. that time when a character says remember when... or I've been there... and then the viewer is swooped to different scene often with an hilarious outcome!!  Every episode is great... there is no way to pick a favorite... there is a moment in every episode where I was laughing so hard it hurt!!  Every time I pop one of these dvds in keep thinking why couldn't I have come up with this!!  The writers on this show are the best around!!!

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A17I8VPENY204F	"Alan M. Farnsworth ""just here to read the meter"""	"Family Guy only had a three season run (I think after a year of silence it's safe to say there won't be anymore).  These two DVDs make up over half of the 50 episodes in the series.  Despite what you may have heard, these 28 episodes entail every episode that aired in the first two seasons.  Because of Season 1's late start, a lot of season 1 episodes were pushed into season 2, which in turn pushed some season 2 episodes into season 3.The series starts of very strong for a first-time viewer.  The episodes are packed tight with jokes and often go off on wild tangents.  The early stories are a little weak, but they pick up in the second season where the series gets even more creative.  Definately something that keeps getting better through the second season.  The third season was a little weaker, so if you were only getting one of the two sets, I'd recommend this one.If you've never seen Family Guy, then be warned: it's not for everyone.  It's got crude humour, and isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything, despite what popular opinion might be.The DVD set also comes at a relatively cheap price, considering you're getting 28 episodes of Family Guy goodness.  The third season set would most likely entail the other 21 episodes (22 if they include the unaired ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"") and thus in two purchases you can have all of Family Guy."	5.0	All the episodes that aired in seasons 1 & 2	2003-04-09	53	45	8

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ	"Alex ""47"""	"I've always been against Family Guy. An unfunny show, with jokes that aren't relevant to the plot. Give me a break. The writing is terrible. Every joke in this show comes from something else; Family Guy can't come up with any jokes of its own. This show is just terrible. Like I said, no originality, horrible story writing, and pathetic episodes are what a show needs to suck. That's what Family Guy is. A real show is a show like The Simpsons, where their jokes ARE relevant to the plot, the stories ARE interesting and creative, and the originality is GREAT. Sure, the show may have gotten a little less awesome, but the show is still great. Family Guy just needs to stop. This is a Simpsons rip-off with a few more dirty jokes. Who cares? Anybody at any age can easily make up a joke like that and make anybody laugh. The Simpsons on the other hand has sticked to its roots since episode one and still does well; proving that a show doesn't have to be funny by swearing or using sex jokes. Family Guy is a pathetic show. A show that sucks beyond all belief. A show that in no way at all should be used in the same sentence as the phrase ""The Simpsons"" and ""Great"". Family Guy is a terrible show. A terrible show. The Simpsons is an amazing show. An amazing show.0/5"	1.0	Lack of Originality ( 0 out of 5 )	2006-08-28	41	12	29
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A88VL944BP9T8	Alexander Tandy	If you like family guy, you should definetely see this movie. If you love family guy, you need to own this movie. I have seen it about four or five times now and as always, I recognize things I didn't the first few times. The jokes come at you during the whole movie, and there is enough material to even make grandma laugh. I do think however, that if you love family guy you will enjoy this more than someone who just watches it every now and then on TV. There are some jokes that people might not get if they haven't seen Episodes I, II, and III. For 15 dollars, this movie is worth it to any family guy lover :)	5.0	It is in fact all that it is cracked up to be!!! A+ to A Movie	2005-09-15	7	5	2

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3FVIFL4HGI5CL	Alexiel	"Nobody's going to like this one bit, but I have to admit it. I'm one of those evil people who carps and moans about how Family Guy is nowhere near as good as it was before it went off the air. Sorry. It's decline reminds me somewhat of the Simpsons' decline but much faster.I loved the old Family Guy episodes. Episodes like ""And The Weiner Is...,"" ""Love Thy Trophy,"" ""Thin White Line/Brian Does Hollywood,"" ""I Am Peter Hear Me Roar,"" and ""Peter Peter, Caviar Eater,"" among a ton of others, are among the funniest things I have seen on TV. So when I started watching it after it came back from cancellation, I was amazed at how the quality had sloughed off. When watching episodes like ""Blind Ambition,"" ""Breaking Out Is Hard To Do,"" ""Don't Make Me Over,"" and especially the painfully unfunny ""8 Simple Rules For Buying My Teenage Daughter,"" it's almost difficult to believe you're watching the same show.However, this movie is a respite from that disappointment. It's probably closer in quality to the old episodes than the new ones. As Martha Stewart says, ""That's a good thing.""So rejoice! This is something of a return to the good 'ol Family Guy in my opinion. Not the best of the best, but I'd rank it on the same level as older episodes like ""He's Too Sexy For His Fat"" and ""I Never Met The Dead Man.""The movie starts out with everyone in Quahog attending the premiere of the Family Guy movie. For anyone who says Family Guy can't be hilarious anymore, look at the joke about Stewie's ""failed political career."" Just as a visual gag alone it's hilarious. The joke with Lois and Peter ""get on!"" is more of the crassness they've been using lately that I usually don't like, but I actually found this funny. One guy I do with seeing a little less of is The Greased Up Deaf Guy. Losing his funny. However, the Evil Monkey gag (posing for the cameras) was great. So far, so good. Then we get into the actual movie.At the local community pool Stewie has a very funny near-death experience (Tom Allen channel-surfing - 'nuff said) that causes him to re-evaulate his behavior and become annoyingly nice. In the meantime, Peter gets angry because the local video chain has been taken over by Lackluster Video and has removed all the porn movies from the back room (which in itself is funny satire, I think; everywhere in the U.S. I've lived the local video chains have pornographic back rooms, but of course Blockbuster does not) and Tom Tucker hears him ranting about it, so he gives him a spot on the news where he can tell the public what ""grinds his gears.""From here of course, hilarity ensues and Stewie sets off on a cross-country trip when he sees a man who looks exactly like him (his real father?) being interviewed in San Francisco.Without giving away any more plot details, I have to say, to me, the beginning of the movie all the way until Stewie meets the man who looks like him is pretty good. The trip to San Francisco is quite amusing. And there's a very funny B story in which Peter and Lois teach Meg and Chris about dating and love (the funniest moment comes when Lois teaches Chris about dining out at a fine restaurant. You'll see, oh, you'll see). But the plot and the jokes when Stewie ""goes on his journey"" with the man kind of falls flat for me. The, ahem ""place where they go"" (trying not to spoil anything here) is not anywhere near as comedically fleshed out or full of the depth you'd hope. The twist with Meg really seems like pointless pandering for the legions of Meg haters. In short, when Stewie and the ""man who looks like him"" go to the ""other place"" I think the movie stalls badly. Brian's conversation with a few famous figures at this point is the high point.When Stewie returns the movie picks up again, and has it's most hilarious moment easily, the Ferris Bueller parody. Having been a child in the 80s, that really resonates with me. That's the funniest thing I've seen from Family Guy since they went off the air, hands down. Interestingly enough, in the commentary they note it was written for the episode ""Peter Griffin, Husband, Father, Brother?""After the movie, there's the after-premiere party, which isn't as funny as the beginning. It feels like they're trying to stretch the movie out to fit the minimum time for a movie.So, overall, I enjoyed the movie. Like with other Family Guy DVDs, the extras are nothing to write home about, at all. The commentary is fine, and I like the chaotic feel as commentators arrive and leave during the recording, and you get several interesting insights about the process of making the movie and what was going on when Family Guy was on hiatus, but it's a fairly standard Family Guy commentary.Overall, unless you're a die-hard Family Guy fan, I would recommend this for a video rental. After you've watched the movie, twice, with and without the commentary, and perused the few extras, in my opinion, you've gotten everything there is to be gotten out of this DVD - which is a good, enjoyable experience. But, unless you're a FG fanatic, I don't think this movie lends itself well to repeated viewing like the old Family Guy episodes you can watch 10 times or more."	4.0	A lukewarm but generally positive response.	2005-11-13	2	2	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A275HMOASH2BVX	AlienZ	The first two seasons of family guy were awesome, Edgier than the simpsons and funnier than everything on televison.  There was nothing sacred to Peter and the clan but the star of the show is baby Stewie, his multitude of attempts to kill Lois or supervent her authority are priceless, in later seasons this running joke has been deminished as has peters war with the chicken.  All appearing for the first time in this volume.  There are only 7 episodes for the first season as it was an experiment that they didn't think the world would love.  The second season is 21 episodes long and make up tapes 2-4 of this box set.  Watch it with the subtitles on to discover phrases aren't what you think you hear, especially from stewie.  The jokes are crude and sometimes tasteless but the majority of them are pop references that everyone can relate to.  Family Guy Rules!	5.0	Stewie Rules	2011-10-01	1	1	0

It's better to watch it with an open mind, and realise that it was the stuff like the Simpsons that opened the door for animated comedy like Family Guy, but that in no way means that this is a copy.Family Guy is endearing, eccentric, ridiculous, over the top and quite offensive. The baby, Stewie, who is hell bent on...well...just hell bent in general, is one of the show's funniest characters. Brian, the cultivated dog with the power of deduction and human speech is always the white elephant in the room, or rather, the white dog.It pokes satire at the media and American life, as well as New England in general. It isn't inane, repetative, or un-original. In fact, it is often funnier and more refreshing (as Bart Simpsons is actually turning 62 next week) than all other comedies, animated or otherwise.Plus, sitcoms at the moment are completely inane and pandering in the lowest, most played out and predictable format, so watch this and you might find some actual wit, AND without the 1950's canned laughter.Don't take my rant for it. Buy it for yourself, or a friend if you're worried that for some reason you won't want to keep it.	5.0	Excellent	2003-10-22	1	0	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2PUYMR4W89GUY	Amanda	"I used to think that ""South Park"" was the funniest, most original, most offensive show on television. And then, I saw ""Family Guy"". I remember watching it when it was still on the air and thinking how refreshing it was. You'd laugh for a full 22 minutes, and most of the time you'd feel guilty about it. Why? Because it pushed the envelope, most often just a little too far, and you couldn't help but think to yourself, ""I am going to hell for laughing at this."" But that's why it was so great.Unlike ""South Park"", ""Family Guy"" was a lot more mature. It didn't rely so much on potty humor and potty mouth, because it didn't have to. Just take, for instance, the family that we have here, the Griffins. There's Peter, the father and husband, who is a lot like Homer Simpson, only less yellow and with a bigger love for beer. He is lazy and not that bright. Then again, neither was Homer. Then there's Lois, the mother and wife who seems so normal and nice, you wonder why she's married to Peter. Then, there are the children: Chris, who is a bit chubby but kind-hearted and loves to draw; Meg who is a typical teenaged girl who wants to drive and get plastic surgery; and Stewie - the most complex character of all. He's just a little itty bitty baby, yet he speaks in an English accent, using big words, has a huge football-shaped head (probably to fit his large brain), likes to build complex machines such as time travelling ones, and - oh yeah - he wants to kill his mother. The biggest mystery about Stewie (one that's even been addressed in a couple of episodes, but never answered) is, can anyone hear him when he talks, other than the audience? The question goes unanswered, but we at least know that the family dog, Brian, hears him. Brian is another interesting character. He looks a bit like Snoopy, but that's where the similarities end. He likes to drink martinis, and he talks (he often is giving Peter sound advice - which Peter never takes). Every episode seems to find Peter trying to undo something bad that he did, but it never gets old. In fact, each of the 28 episodes are brilliant - there isn't a dud in the whole set.I remember the feeling I had when I found out that Fox had pulled ""Family Guy"" from their line-up. It really truly was the funniest show on television at the time, and it angered me that people were claiming it was offensive. But it doesn't matter now, because all of the episodes are coming out on DVD. Even if we aren't getting any new ones, the ones on the DVD can be viewed multiple times before they even start to get boring. You don't get much for special features here - pretty much just two commentaries each on each of the four discs. But you really don't need special features with a show this good. If you ever saw at least one episode and found yourself laughing, I strongly urge you to buy this DVD. The price is great for all that you get, which is hours of pure enjoyment. I guarentee you will not be disappointed."	5.0	It Really Doesn't Get Any Better Than This	2003-07-19	4	3	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	APTA4K10LDA6W	"Amazon Customer ""fat_hand"""	The Simpsons undisputedly cleared the ground for cartoons to make waves on television, especially in prime time. The Family Guy steps into that mold and redefines it. When the Family Guy came on the air, The Simpsons had been doing so-so work leading to its now fairly &quot;blah&quot; stuff. Meanwhile The Family Guy has taken over the innovative and funny role, but to a higher level. The Family Guy includes racier jokes, more over-the-top references and hilarious satire of current events or hot shows. The writers always hit the mark, leaving you wondering how they got some of these shows on the air. I don't know where the show has gone, except to the Cartoon Network late nite. There is talk of new shows to come, which will be a welcome addition to some of the poor TV out there right now.

I'm a long time Simpsons fan, but when comparing the first two seasons of the Simpsons with the Family Guy, I would have to note that the Family Guy was consistently hilarious right out of the gate, whereas the Simpsons took time to grow.  Good thing, too, since Fox went out of its way with scheduling snafus to doom the show into oblivion.  I watch a few episodes each night and am consistenly reduced to tears.  It is nothing short of genius.  Buy this DVD set.  It is better than a petition for letting the Fox Network know what they have.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A18C77SUCF6MXX	Amazon Customer	"I am only a casual fan of Family Guy, but a big Star Wars fan.  Like other reviewers, I REALLY enjoyed Blue Harvest, so when this one came out, I was really excited.  The first half was great, and I laughed constantly.  However, it felt like the writers either lost the will to keep that level of humor going, OR rushed to meet a deadline that they had to finish work on it, because the second half of the show honestly just wasn't that great.  I thought both the Yoda and Lando characters were terrible and added very little comedy to the overall effort.  I was disappointed that the golden four-letter ""F"" word made it into the DVD at least twice (I'm sure other reviewers will criticize me for this, but I had hoped I could watch this with kids around).  The lightsaber battle was less than stellar, and in my view Stewie just didn't fit as Darth Vader once that began.  And I could really do without the completely useless banter at the end between Family Guy and Robot Chicken, no matter how funny the two Seths think it is.Like Blue Harvest, you really have to hand it to these guys for the animation.  The ships, the space combat, and even the imperial walkers are really well done and - if you took some of these scenes and interspersed them into the actual movie - I truly don't think anybody would notice the difference.  Great job, animators.Unless you are a die-hard fan of either Family Guy or Star Wars, you may want to wait for this to either show up on TV or start selling at bargain bin prices before buying it.

I think the third season, when they were about to get cancelled was the funniest.  The show got funnier as it went along, and even though this DVD has 28 episodes, only a few of them rate as a top 20 episode in this series' short run.If you've never seen the show, but think you'd enjoy it, I'd get the ""Freakin' Sweet Collection"" which is an inexpensive five episode sampler, make sure you like it, and then go ahead and buy Volume 2 instead of this DVD.Don't get me wrong, this DVD still ranks 5 stars.

Seems like the Family Guy team ismore interested in making their story as close as possible to the movie, but hey,dont forget, its suppose to be funny, and with all those involved in these projectswe would assume the end product would be better than what they have given us.First the episodes should be way long and at least 50 % more jokes and situations.Its like a bare bone product....just enought for a few laughs ...but we all knowmuch more could have been done.So when they show you table readings....there's all these people with scripts andideas and they are all having a hoot of a time....hummm there having more fun thatwe had watching their DVD....they must have left out lots of stuff..Hope the next one is 500% better...they owe it to us...the viewers.	3.0	good....but should have been better ...off course	2009-12-29	1	0	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1ZOF747O5EB6R	Andrew Desmond	"""Family Guy"" is like a breath of fresh air in the world of modern television.  It's quirky, idiosyncratic and, best of all, funny.  Television is all the richer for the experiences of the dysfunctional Griffin family from Quahog, Rhode Island.It is inevitable that the Griffin family will be compared to the similarly dysfunctional Simpson family of Springfield.  Yet while there are similarities, the ""Family Guy"" product is simply edgier, more irreverent and better focussed to the adult viewer.The characters of ""Family Guy"" are wonderful.  Brian the talking dog sounds simply stupid when explained to someone unfamiliar with the series.  But Brian is clever, witty and possessing of a very dry sense of humour.  His repartee with Stewie, the one year old evil genius is magic.  In fact, all the characters interact in a thoroughly manic but enjoyable way.""Family Guy"" is American humour at its best.  For too long we have been subjected to such dross as ""Friends"" or ""Seinfeld"" as cutting edge.  Let me assure you that these programmes are pygmies when compared to the clever wit that is ""Family Guy"".Anyway, enough said.  If you doubt my words, check out the product.  You will not be disappointed."	5.0	Not Good but Great!	2006-08-03	2	1	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	I open this review with a question:  Why in the world did Family Guy have to get canceled?  They had reruns on TBS for awhile, but then they stopped playing those too!!!  What is this world coming to?!?!  Anyways, for all you out there who share in my irate anger over the lack of Family Guy in your life, this one's for you... Seasons 1 and 2 are now on DVD.  Now you can get your fix any time you want.  The characters are hilarious (this part's for those out there who have never seen Family Guy before [if you fall into that category, beware; you should be shot]); from Brian, the talking dog with an incessant craving for martinis, to Stewie, the verbose young'un bent on world domination and assassinating his meddling mother (who has only found his giant weapons stash once), and from Quagmire, the kid who has worse problems than me trying to pick up girls, to Peter, the fat-ass drunken father who provides many a laugh in the show, Family Guy and voice-actor Seth MacFarlane (who provides the voices for Peter, Chris, AND Brian, among others) really show us what life shouldn't be like -- and do it in good fashion, making us both wonder what'll happen next and laugh our asses off at every turn.--Andy Olson	5.0	He's Our Family Guy!!	2006-02-21	5	4	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1LS17O6NKUGE3	Andrew P. Schwab	"I would have never heard of the Family Guy if my friends didn't let me know about it. Ten minutes in the first episode i ever saw i was hooked! This is the wittiest, non-stop, smartest humor I have ever seen or heard and you'll know immediately why it had to be cancelled. I'll get the 2 bad things about the DVDs out of the way:1) It's true: the DVDs are poorly packaged (however decently boxed) and dont look like they even have a disc in them.2) These episodes contain many unnecessary and continuous flashbacks, that, although they're still funny (o.k., hilarious), they get old really really quick and they soon start to become obnoxious.Now for the good stuff...1) Everyone and everyone involved! Especially Stewie and Chris whose genius lines and absurd comic gags come in at just the right times, even when you least expect it. (Evil Monkey! ""Bon Appetit!"") Lois, Peter, and Brian are great too, but dont seem to have as much of the comic flow as those two. As for Meg...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ2) THE MOCKS, RIP-OFFS AND SARCASM!

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	While I did watch Family Guy occasionally when it was first on TV, I was never a fan until after it got cancelled.  In the interim period between the third and fourth (uncancelled) seasons, I discovered Seth MacFarlane's hilarious work.  It really pushed the envelope in terms of what the censors would allow as well as coming up with some of the most out-there plots imaginable (one of my favorites involves Peter seceeding from the Union).  When FOX decided to bring the show back, due to enormous DVD sales, I along with fans everywhere rejoiced at the news.However, when the first new episode aired, I was somewhat underwhelmed, and as the new season progressed, I found myself losing interest in the show.  So when the movie came out, I found that, while I did genuinely want to see it, I never rushed out to get it.  Finally, one of my neighbors held a small screening of it, and I found my faith in Family Guy renewed.One of my biggest problems with the new episodes is that they take jokes and concepts that worked in the original run and use them ad nauseum.  There are cutaways every minute now and jokes are drawn out for minutes at a time.  In the movie, there aren't any jokes that go on for too long (don't get me wrong, I do love it when they draw something out, but lately, they've gone on for too long), and while there are a lot of cutaways, they are all very funny (though there is one with Ray Charles that is a little distasteful, but then again, what isn't in good taste on this show?).Basically, the movie is three episodes that was going to be a three-parter in the series, but I guess that when FOX asked for a movie, they decided to slightly redo them and make them into a movie.  Also, they are bracketed by the characters attending a premiere of the movie.  The story begins with Stewie having a near-death experience in a swimming pool, and, thinking he ended up in Hell, decides to change his ways and be good.  When that doesn't work out, he wishes that he could find someone else out there who is like him.  All of the sudden, this guy appears in San Francisco who looks exactly like Stewie.  After being interviewed on television, Stewie and Brian set out to find the man Stewie believes to be his true father (after all, how could the dim-witted Peter share the same genes with maniacal Stewie?).  Of course, wackiness ensues as the pair hitch a ride with Quagmire and his (and I can't spell this the way it is in the movie) Cross-Country Tour.  However, when Stewie finally meets up with the man he is seeking, he is amazed to learn his true identity.While there are a few things about the movie I didn't like, overall it is great.  All of our favorite characters are here, but MacFarlane also introduces a few new people, including the Waving Arms Inflatible Tube Man in one of the funniest scenes of the movie.  This movie is sure to please Family Guy fans everywhere.  If you have never seen the show before, I reccomend this, but I want to issue a warning as well; the humor is extremely raunchy, so be expected to be caught off guard by a few things.  If you can get past that, be prepared to laugh long and hard.	4.0	Funny, Raunchy, Fresh	2005-10-29	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3NQ9RB9JFHF04	Andy A	"This was classic FAMILY GUY.  I absolutely loved BLUE HARVEST, and SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE is just as great... except for the inclusion of a few ""choice"" words.  I have a 10-year old nephew who is a Star Wars fan and who loves BLUE HARVEST, but I'm not recommending that he see this one due to the foul language (about 4 f-bombs and 1 use of bulls**t).  Sure, Family Guy has always been filled with ""shock value"" humor, but usually it's situational (which I prefer over a flippant use of a Richard Pryor comedy tactic of throwing in a useless swear word).  Anyway, for adults (and especially adults who love Star Wars & Family Guy), it's a must see.  But be sure to use discretion when letting your kids watch it (who shouldn't really be watching Family Guy in the first place)..."	4.0	Something Something Something Review	2010-01-07	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1H0O0TJG76ZY8	Andy Dabydeen	Finally saw Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story! -- a Family Guy movie. TV's not a regular thing for me, so I haven't seen too many Family Guy episodes. What I have seen has been funny, in an offensive sort of way. It's definitely not sitcom for the Brady Bunch crowd -- and takes the Simpsons to another level. The Stewie Griffin movie tops the television show, being more offensive, and probably funnier than the television episodes -- which I would know if I had seen more of the TV show. The movie happens to be three episodes strung together to make a movie -- the episodes having never been aired -- with some new material added at the beginning and the end. If you're a fan of the show, and would like some new material to hold you over until the new shows are aired, Stewie's advertures will certainly fit the bill.	5.0	Hilarious Movie!	2005-09-05	12	4	8

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A33UCQJ1QHU8B	Andy Radke	"First off, this DVD set is incredible.  I've been a huge fan of ""Family Guy"" since the post-Superbowl debut episode back in '99.  I was hesitant about buying the set however, because after reading a number of reviews, I had learned that the un-aired episode ""When You Wish Upon A Weinstein"" was not included.  Nonetheless, I made the purchase, and I'm glad I did!I just read an exclusive interview with Seth McFarlane on TVSHOWSONDVD.com and the ""Weinstein"" episode will DEFINITELY be on the upcoming Volume 2 set which will be released September 9th.  I suggest you check it out if you require confirmation.Now, back to this set.  I guess there's only one beef I have with this, and that would be that the Bin Laden joke was removed from the episode, ""Road To Rhode Island"".  I guess the execs at Fox deemed it inappropriate.  Aside from that, I couldn't ask for a better set.  2 episodes on each of the disks have been laced with optional commentary by McFarlane et al which provides insight into the making of the show which I found to be very insightful.It's a shame the show was so short-lived, but for those of you who want to re-live the episodes again and again, this is the perfect set to buy.

At one point I was considering buying this on VCD and or what they call DVD on eBAY but I'm glad i waited. I was disapointed though in the lack of features but then agian its a tv show.

Man was I ever pumped when I heared it was coming out.For those of you unfamilier with the show it is easily the most underrated cartoon of all time and in my mind is funnier than The Simpsons or South Park (both of which I am a fan of). It is also the most laugh out loud show you will ever see.As a previous reveiwer pointed out the show and its charactars are very well created,drawn,and voiced over. Drop them into hilarious situation and you have yourself a comic gem.Although it may be crude, unsensitive and entirerly random the show strikes a chorde with the funny bone of every person I know.  The great storylines and allusions to modern day culture make this show what it is.  Each and every character is unique and flat out funny.If you have never seen Family Guy or have and disliked it I urge you to buy this set and find out what you have been missing.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	"The reason for my title was to assure folks that this is not just one elongated epsiode.  Although, you could make an argument that any television series that makes an hour-and-a-half offering is simply making a long episode, I suppose.  Still, there is a consistent plot running throughout, and as fans of Family Guy would expect, there are also numerous side stories and tangents throughout the movie.It seems that from what I can gather from people I know, they either love it, like it a lot, or hate it.  There isn't much of a middle ground.  One of the biggest reasons for hating it was the ending.  I will not spoil anything, but I will agree that I believe they try to wrap things up too quickly, when they certainly had time to drag it out for a while.  Then again, and this isn't a spoiler as you know from the beginning, the entire movie is set in the theme of the Griffins actually making a Family Guy movie, with a hilarious mock premiere opening and ending.  So, it is book-ended nicely, thereby attempting to explain any problems within the movie.I promised no spoilers, but I will say this: the film revolves primarily around Stewie (which makes sense, since he tests as the show's highest rated character).  You could probably guess that with the title ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.""  Don't worry, some of the other characters get a good treatment throughout, although there really isn't a heck of a lot involving Chris or Meg.  The constant tangents and side stories and cameos from previous bit players fill many gaps that might have been in there from a lesser story.  Fans of the series, though, come to expect these vignettes and they will not be disappointed.I would like to also say that if you are reading this, you probably have heard something about it.  Well, I cannot change your opinion on anything, nor can I change your friends' opinions, but I will say this.  You should give it a fair chance and make up your own mind about it, especially if you are a fan of the show.  If you are nervous about buying it outright in case you won't like it, then go ahead and rent it first.  Most of the people I know who are true fans ended up buying it, most of them loved it.  Fans of the show, unless you are super-picky about a long drawn-out ending, you will love this movie!"	5.0	Definitely a Family Guy Movie, and a good one at that!	2007-01-04	0	0	0

Quality is excellent as far as Blu-ray's go, but gave this a 3 out of 5 for these reasons.1.  1 star taken off for not having a 16 x 9 Animorphic ratio for HDTV's. This is shameful for any Blu-ray out there that does not do this automatically. Instead it is cropped in Pan & Scan format.2.  No uncompressed audio.For those who know, Blu-ray's have plenty of room to spare and this was only an hour long video, so nothing should be spared. Instead, it seems like movie companies only wish for our hard earned money and dole out these movies because we are too eager to wonder what the faults are.Other than this, it is hilarious and very funny.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A29Y34ALWJUGB5	"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment"""	Family Guy is known for not really caring what people think. They say what they say and hope that people don't take them serious enough to laugh at some of the offensive things they do say. And this is what I love about the series. So when I heard the movie was coming out, I was excited, figuring that it would go beyond everything the series ever achieved.I was disappointed. Not only is this movie mild compared to the series today, but it's edited. You don't expect curse words to be edited in an unrated DVD. To add to that, it's not a true movie but actually a three part series connected only the by fact that they're about Stewie and his future. Before and after these three parts is a mostly pointless frame story. They didn't take advantage of the freedom of DVD releases. It was a disappointing effort. They should have taken the cue from the Southpark movie, and just have at it.I can recommend this to people who are true fans of the series, and only then if you're willing to accept this as an extra episode of Family Guy and not an actual movie. Also, I recommend it to people new to Family Guy, so that you can get a taste of what the series is about.	2.0	"""Mildly Entertained"""	2006-01-19	6	2	4

Many of the jokes seem forced.  The timing is often mediocre.  Almost everyone goes inexplicably out of character at one point or another.  The references to past episodes seem self-congratulatory rather than clever.  And most of all, it's WAY WAY WAY TOO LONG.The middle third, written by Alex Borstein, is significantly better than the rest, but even that isn't up to the level of the best episodes.  As for the outer thirds -- well, there are brilliant moments everywhere, but they're usually buried in second-rate hackery.	2.0	A big disappointment.	2005-11-30	3	1	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3BEJOL2X8PS8I	ATHF Fan	What's TV's best Cartoon? The Simpsons? Of course not. Beavis and Butthead? No. South Park? Close but no. It's Family Guy, a show that FOX first aired in 1999, Family Guy has been cancelled twice, last in 2002. Thankfully though the genuises at Cartoon Network cancelled that horrible show, ''Home Movies'' to make room for Family Guy reruns (it currently airs Sun-Thur as part of Adult Swim). When Family Guy was on FOX it was constantly being compared to the Simpsons, and in many cases called a Simpsons [imitation], but I don't think so. Since about 1998 (coincidentally the year before Family Guy aired) The Simpsons were running out of plot ideas, episodes started to get [weak] and relied on, ''The Simpsons go to (insert city) with special celebrity guest (inser name)!'' Family Guy took what The Simpsons started and brought it up a notch, for instance, the baby in the Simpsons has no personality and just sucks on a pacifer. The baby in Family Guy is an ... Genius bent on taking over the world. Another thing that makes Family Guy better than the Simpsons is all those hillarious flashbacks (you'll know what I mean after you see an episode). Also Family Guy has a funny New England flavor to it that makes it great to watch. The only complaint that I have is that not every episode has audio commentary, but at least this is better than South Park's season one dvd. In conclusion buy this DVD.P.S. My favorite Episode is, ''Lets Go to the Hop'', but look at the titles of the first four episodes to find a hidden joke by the writers.	5.0	A great DVD adaption of my favorite show of all time!	2003-05-03	0	0	0

You really have to know ESB to get all the humor in this movie.  Even though I didn't get all of the jokes, this was still hilarious.  Way funnier than Blue Harvest, which to me was not bad but not great.  We were all rolling, and when my Star Wars ""fanboy"" loved ones explained the really inside jokes it was even funnier (for example, when Leia/Lois tells Han/Peter she loves him, and his response (won't spoil it), my friend was like, ""oh my god that's what it always seemed like he was saying in the movie!"").

Often times, in my opinion, television series get better with each new season.  This might make a newcomer -- someone who may have only seen the most recent season -- reluctant to purchase an earlier season, for fear of it not being as funny as the others.  However, with Family Guy, the first season is just as amazing as the fourth.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	Some people just don't know a good thing. This is why this hilarious cartoon never got much attention. It was horribly reviewed by critics, and shuffled around on the schedule by FOX, who didn't seem to know exactly what to do with it. I have never seen a show, much less a cartoon, that pushed the envelope that much and that far. It's amazing with some of the things they got away with. The show comes from creator Seth McFarland, and it's a doozy of a program. The show centers around the wacky Griffin clan, who hail from Quahog, Rhode Island. Dad Peter is a round man who works for a toy company. The wife is Lois, and she is voiced by Alex Borstein, who folks may remember from her five seasons on &quot;Mad TV&quot;, where she had characters like Ms. Swan. Son Chris is rather rotund like his father. He isn't the sharpest kid either. He is voiced by Seth Green. Daughter Meg is short and wears glasses. The smart one of the family. She was originally voiced by &quot;Party Of Five&quot; star Lacey Chabert, but was then replaced by Mila Kunis, from &quot;That 70's Show&quot;. The family dog is Brian. He talks, behaves like a human, and is the most intellectual one of the  bunch. Finally, there is baby Stewie. Never has there been a character such has him. He is a maniacal little tot plotting world domination. I am constantly amazed by this character. There are a number of recurring characters in this zany cartoon world. Their neighbor, Quagmire, is one for the books. A real ladies man. There are a few more. Seth McFarland also contributes the voices for Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmire, and a few others. The show is knee slapping, fall down funny. This is something very rare in television comedy these days. It can be quite offensive at times, and you feel guilty and ashamed for even smiling at it. This 4 disc collection contains 28 episodes from the show's first first 2 seasons. Some of the gems you will find are - &quot;A Hero Sits Next Door&quot;, which has Peter planning a bank robbery for him to foil so he can be a hero like his wheelchair bound police officer neighbor. &quot;Brian In Love&quot; is another hysterical episode where Brian starts having accidents in the house. He goes to see a therapist and finds out he is in love with Lois. &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; is another riot as Lois takes over the local community theater and plans to do a production of &quot;The King And I&quot;, but then disaster strikes when Peter takes the show over. &quot;Road To Rhode Island&quot; is another classic. Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and the two have an adventure trying to get back home. There are a lot more great episodes here, but those are some of the best. Every one is funny. What is also cool about the show, is how it really stays spot on with pop culture. Either recent or in the past. Some of their references or visual gags dealing with this are brilliant. The characters are also incredibly well developed. Each one has their very own personality, tick, and demeanor. McFarland is incredibly talented in this area. He does the voices for so many of the main characters. Each one is different and there are no traces of familiarity in any of them. Very well done. The show can be rude and crude, but it is always consistently funny and entertaining. It's too bad it never got a fair chance. Check it out.	5.0	Welcome To Quahog!!	2003-05-27	4	2	2

First off, no show, short of Sout Park, makes me laugh as hard.  Not so much for the language remarks, but other hidden symbols that you may not pick-up the first time you see an episode, that is why you must buy the set.I would have loved to see Family Guy go for at least five seasons so Seth could show his true span of genius.  Aside from that, many people say, ""Oh, I don't want to watch that show because it is just stupid toliet humor and dirty jokes.""  Well, partly yes, but when isn't a dirty joke funny?  I find this show funnier that the Simpsons, for instance, because it uses more references towards others incuding celebrities, politicians, and actions that many of us do day by day.

Meg, Chris and Lois are exceedingly average and hence uninteresting.  Stewie the baby and Brian the dog are easily the funniest, most interesting characters on the show, but tragically they are underused most of the time.At it's worst, Family Guy is still miles above the worthless King of the Hill, and at it's best (the occaisional big laughs) it's even better than the Simpsons.

I actually saw the finale on TV before seeing the DVD and, while there are a few extra bits at the begining and end, it is essentially the same as what I saw for free on TV (albeit with comcercials - but isn't that what Tivo is for?).This to me seems very lazy on the part of the Family Guy crew, and smacks of false advertising - nowhere on the DVD packaging does it say anything about this being broadcast on TV, and at no time during the TV broadcast was it mentioned that this was the censored version of the DVD.Bad, bad, bad.	3.0	False advertising, false marketing	2006-05-25	9	7	2

Still, I plan to buy this DVD when it comes out.  Family Guy is by far more witty and raw than the Simpsons (although also more crude and distasteful.)

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AT6QFWV49SV3E	"Ben Yamen ""kseguy1"""	"I can't even begin to explain how perfect this show is. but all I can say is that one episode made me laugh more than all the simpson's episodes combined. and I am a huge simpson fan so that isn't to easy for me to say. The characters and the flashbacks are what makes this so very memorable. the characters are; (in order from best to worst)Stewie- my personal favorite. he always tries to take over the world, but fails. he also hates his mother and talks about killing her constantly. The best things he says are Blast! and Damn You!Chris- Chris is the retard of the family, which makes him very, very funny. My favorite line from him is when he sticks a an army man up his nose to tickle his brain and says ""Now I don't know math.""Peter- Peter is alot like Homer in that he has no common sense and does whatever he likes. my favorite line is when he wets himself (in the third season, last episode) and don't forget he is grown man and says ""Uh Oh!""Brian- Brian is a talking, alcoholic dog. Now where else would you find that? My favorite line is ""How about a little less questions, and a little more shut the hell up?!""Lois- Peter's wife, and see really is just like marge. No favorite lines.Meg- Meg is really nothing special, she is definitly the Lisa of the family. No favorite lines, but it is funny when the rest of the family makes fun of her uglyness.So in final, this show may seem like a rip-off of the simpsons, but it is really much better."	5.0	best show ever	2004-03-28	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ADXY2YKIZSC1G	BHogg	Ok, not gonna lie, Family Guy is one of the worst shows on television.  Why?  Well, to start things off, its unoriginal.  Let's think of the concept: a dumb, drunk, and irresponsible father, an insightful wife, a dumb son, a smart but unpopular daughter, a dog, and a baby, and a bunch of wild neighbors.  Doesn't sound anything like the Simpsons, now does it?Also, it's not funny.  I recently watched an episode cause my friend made me, and half the episode was taken up by Peter randomly fighting a chicken.  Why?  Because it's funny?  No, because it takes up half the episode, and the writers are not clever enough to fill up a 30 min. time slot w/ commercials with jokes that are relevant.  Which brings me to my next point: have you noticed how none of the jokes have anything to do with the plot?  Thats because they're stolen!Another thing is that the show is so intent on being offensive that it loses any humor it does have.  I'm not someone who is offended easily; the only thing that does is when something is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, and Family Guy is indeed.  By the way, American Beauty is my favorite movie.So please do not watch this show.  Watch the Simpsons instead, something that has a brain!	1.0	If you're gonna slam me, at least take the time to read this	2005-11-25	54	9	45
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AEBOD21JROJ4G	"Bighairydoofus ""-"""	I haven't owned a television since I left home for the military back in '85.  When I got out, I just never got into the habit of watching again, as I decided that I had better things to do.  Besides, most of the TV shows that I saw at other peoples houses pretty much sucked.  Every once in a while I'd see something that tempted me, but those were few and far between.Along came computers with DVD drives.  I do love the internet, and I now watch movies on my computer.  One of my friends loaned me this set and for the first time in years felt like I'd missed out on something.  Intelligent, biting humor with cutting edge satire, no sacred cows, obscure cultural references and a cast of characters that puts all other animated sitcoms to shame.  That's about as high a recommendation I can possibly muster.  I'm buying it and season 3 as well.	5.0	If there was more on TV like this, I'd actually own one...	2004-09-23	6	5	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A24M2KN27MDEXO	bill_the_great	The Family Guy has to be one of the most blatant TV shows to come down the line that rips off The Simpson. Aside from the Dog, it almost a character-for-character rip off of that classic series. The &quot;hook&quot; for this series was supposed to be that &quot;The Family Guy&quot; would push buttons that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; could only dream about, and they succeded at it. However, while &quot;The Simpsons'&quot; wit and great writing have prevented the characters (for the most part) from devolving into stereotypes; &quot;The Family Guy&quot; desperately tried to be more shocking with each episode and eventually collapsed under the weight of its own hype. In addition, simply because a show &quot;pushes buttons&quot; doesn't automatically make it funny. The true redeeming value of the Simpsons (and more recently South Park) is that the shows make you think and have dynamic characters that the viewer actually cares about while either dancing (or sometimes trampling) on &quot;the line&quot; of what's socially acceptable. &quot;The Family Guy,&quot; while containing some genuinely funny moments, simply could not compete with either the Simpsons or South Park. The deathblow to the show came with Fox's juggling of the time schedule (which ironically hurt the Simpsons ratings when they put it up against The Cosby Show in the 2nd season). However, the cult that surrounds this show still continues to be resilient online, thus resulting in the DVD's that have been recently released. My guess is that while &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will continue to age like a fine wine, &quot;The Family Guy&quot; will age like a can of Natural Light that goes flat when you open it and finally be tossed on the ash heap of history with the several other shows that were either good or ok and that were in some way or another Simpsons knock-offs (such as &quot;Duckman&quot; and &quot;Dinosaurs!&quot;).	2.0	Simpsons knock-off	2003-09-09	77	10	67
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AH86BBWYK5I8S	Billy McIntyre	With characters ranging from Death to a boy with an upside down face, Family Guy is the edgiest and funniest show to ever be on TV. Every episode is solid gold all the way from I Never Met the Dead Man down to Family Guy Viewer Mail #1. If I could only have one DVD to watch the rest of my life, it would be Family Guy Volume 1. It has over 600 minutes of entertainment, and I'm finding new jokes in every episode, because I missed them the first time from laughing so hard at the previous joke. Did that make sense?

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1JEWNBAYDSQBO	Bonnie Burton	Let me get one thing straight right off the bat: &quot;The Family Guy&quot; was one of the best animated comedies on the telly. It takes more risks at upseting the mainstream than &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but isn't so blatant in shock value as &quot;Southpark.&quot; In fact, I seriously loved this series when it was on the air and I'm thrilled that now that it's available on DVD, I can watch my favorite episodes whenever I want. If you're a fan of the show, you need these DVD box sets.However, if you want really cool added features, keep looking. Unlike the commentary for DVDs like &quot;The Simpsons&quot; it's almost as though Seth and gang have no idea what DVD commentary is for. In fact, for many of the episodes that actually DO have commentary, they sit in silence instead of actually commenting -- which kinda begs the question -- why is this called an audio commentary track when you barely comment?Also, many of the comments really aren't that entertaining at all. Occasionally Seth M. or Seth Green will speak in their characters' voices to comment (which would have been sooo much more interesting if they continued to do so) but for the most part they just don't say much.Highlights of the commentary do include the actress who does Lois' voice (she is damn funny).... but some of the other voice actors/actresses that are on the commentary seem to have been brought in at last minute. One of supporting voice actors even asks in geniune astonishment: &quot;Brian the dog has a martini?&quot;  Which makes you kind of wonder if some of the actors even bothered watching the series they were in while it aired.There's only one documentary (if you want to call it that) which is simply a long commercial for the show.I was disappointed in the bonus material, but the episodes themselves are worth the price of the box set. I just hope in the future, more people who bother with DVD commentary do something other than just sit in silence.	4.0	Amazing TV show -- sub par DVD bonus material	2003-09-02	4	3	1

Seth is one of the worst sell outs around. Not only is the humor lacking from the good old days, the writters seem to not even understand the characters from the first three seasons. With a steady decline of quality spoofing is now the lowest form. Remember the first spoof on star wars they did. Terrible. This is bound to be worse. I am so discusted that I wish they would cancel it. The fact they try to make fun of the Simpsons is funny, I make fun of Family Guy for the same thing. Lets hope this will be the end of it.

Family Guy works because it never sheds its roots as an offensive show with unique characters that is the king of obscure references. To be honest, I don't get many of the jokes because I didn't watch as much TV as Seth Macfarlane growing up. Regardless, everyone with a pulse can find at least one brutally funny character on the show. Also, the running jokes on the show work amazingly well, something you rarely see in today's era of TV. It is a shame that Fox cancelled this show after only three seasons (especially considering the first season was only 6 episodes). I'm so happy it's coming back thanks to people buying this exceptional DVD.I encourage everyone who is breathing to pick this up- you will not regret it.	5.0	The best comedy show of all-time.

I cannot believe people have written such scathing reviews about this cartoon. Those people just didn't get this type of humor. I make myself stay up late at night to watch this show, it is that funny. Some believe that this show is a complete rip off of shows such as the simpsons. Obviously these people have never heard of a parody. Although somewhat similar family guy is nuch different. How can people connect stewy and maggie?!?!? One of my favorite aspects of the show are the hilarious flashbacks. One of my favorites is the one where peter does a flashback to a free tibet rally and calls china to inform them that he has taken their &quot;free tibet&quot; and he wants all the tea too give it back. Although i consider the simpsons one of the best shows ever and the earlier seasons are absolute classics, in recent years it has gone downhill and the humor is  somewhat cheesy. I hope that the rumors are true and that family guy will be back for a new season in January 2005. Although i find the Simpsons a great show, especially seasons 9 and below and i think it has very funny social commentary it is not nearly as funny as family guy. Family guy is the kind of show that if you are eating something while watching it you're either going to choke or have it coming out of your nose. This is a great show and i think that if south park has been able to gain acceptance this show should be given a chance too. If fox would only give family guy a chance and present it to a wider audience than its cult following it has a chance to become a very successful show. Family guy is a show that does not take it self seriously, a problem with shows these days, and is for those who aren't out to judge but simply to watch a great show.

But for fans, you will definitely appreciate the attention to detail in recreating key scenes from the original while enjoying the twisted dialog from the Family Guy characters. My only regret was that they ran out of the more memorable characters when they got to Yoda. But that is a minor problem and one that was somewhat out of their control since the second two installments were an afterthought based on the success of the first show. Yoda does have one of the best lines in the Trilogy when he describes the tree that is strong with the dark side of the force as basically a strange element from the original story that &#34;stops the show dead.&#34;	5.0	Great fun and highly recommened	2014-01-03	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A38J0EBT9XKNXA	Bret M. Herholz	I don't think Fox had banked on Family Guy being the success it did when it came out in 1999. They had banked on Futurama being the hit show and Family Guy just being filler material until they decided to pull the plug and put another show with an awful concept in it's place.Even in the beginning, Family Guy got a bad wrap of being told it was nothing but a rip off of the Simpsons. And the Simpsons, who were obviously threatened by Family Guy's success took a shot at the show placing Peter Griffin in with Homer's reject clones.Fox obviously thought Family Guy had no chance of being a success.But they were absolutely wrong. Family Guy was a hit and Futurama was not the success they had hoped for. But they couldn't be wrong, so they did their best to sabotage Family Guy by placing the show in various timeslots where people would not watch it because of more popular shows on other channels. Until they decided to pull the plug on Family Guy and keep Futurama, despite the fact Futurama really was not that funny.I felt it was the Critic all over again.But Fox's loss has proven to be Cartoon Network's gain as they are now showing all the old episodes of Family Guy. And at it's 11:30pm timeslot (incidentally right after Futurama), it's beating out both Letterman and Leno in the ratings.And now I am very pleased to see that all of the first and second season have been released on video. With the last season to be released very soon.If you think the first two seasons were good, Family Guy only gets better by the last season. Funnier than the Simpon's have been for the longest time.But I am very happy to see Family Guy enjoying the success it deserves on Cartoon Network.I would highly recommend this DVD set. If you haven't seen this series as of yet, you really must watch was has to be the funniest and smartest primetime cartoon ever to be on television.	5.0	Funniest primetime cartoon ever made.	2003-07-19	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A8TM0MI3D9T29	Brett Corkins	Everything I expected Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story to be, it wasn't. I figured there'd be a lot of cussing due to the box screaming 'Uncensored', but no. I expected it to be funny every single second, but no. But what it all boils down to is whether you came in a Family Guy fan or not. If you'd never seen it then yes, you'll most likely love it. But if you're already a big fan then you'll probably see this as simply mediocre. I however, came in being a huge fan and came out liking Family Guy even more. I think if you go into watching this with no expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised. Afterall, The Untold Story merely plays as a three part episode. The first part revolves around Stewie's trials and tribulations with swimming and a near-death experience. The second follows Peter when he gets his own segment on the local news called 'What Grinds My Gears.' And the third part follows Stewie as he tries to find his long-lost father, with an added twist. But don't think that it stops with those ideas, no, we get to see Meg as a guy named Ron, Chris as a cop, Peter in all his idiotic glory, Lois as a drunken sex kitten, Stewie get drunk, and Brian, well, be himself. This movie should be everything a Family Guy fan would love. The jokes are more raunchy and you get to hear your favorite characters cussing, what more can you ask for?I for one loved every second Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story had to offer. I thought every joke was right on with what would've been in a regular episode and even at times surpassed what would've been. It was even refreshing to see the characters you know from the show make fun of the movie once it ended. So basically, if you can laugh at dumb comedy and aren't easily offended, you will most likely cherish this movie.	5.0	Don't judge me, I'm just doing my thing	2005-12-10	15	6	9
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2FT8E250P1IVM	"Brian Byrne ""Brian Byrne"""	"The episode starts with - you guessed it - another power outage. Peter and the rest of the Griffins are once again left sitting in their living room, with nothing to do. Chris then suggests the retelling of another Star Wars story; and thus the 2nd spoof begins. I felt the writers could have mixed things up this time around. Did the exact same series of events have to lead to the story being retold? It just seemed lazy not to change things, even a little here. We see a similar occurance at the very end of the episode, when Peter once again insults Robot Chicken. However, on the upside, this time he takes a dig at Seth Green's Without a Paddle too.The story essentially picks up where the first one left off; the death star has been destroyed; Darth Vader (Stewie) chases Luke Skywalker (Chris) on the planet Hoth; Luke has a vision of his dead mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who tells him to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Yoda (Carl). Luke then has a vision of the Empire capturing his friends. Believing this to be true, Luke forgoes his Jedi training in order to save his friends and confront Vader. Meanwhile, Princess Leia (Lois) somehow manages to fall for Falcon pilot Han Solo (Peter). Basically, the galaxy is at war and we're along for the ride.The writers seem to utilise the Family Guy characters extremely well in these specials, and here is no different. The casting of Mort Goldman in the role of Lando was inspired; he adds something special to the character, and I'm not just talking about the fact that here, he's a black jew. What you'll actually notice is that this time around, the writers have been forced to re-cast some characters into different roles; in the opening scenes, Joe is seen as one of Darth Vader's probe droids, while further into the episode, Meg plays the role of a space-slug, which is perhaps even uglier a creature than what we saw her play in ""Blue Harvest"". She does however get to speak this time around, which is an improvement of sorts. Still, I can't complain about these changes, as they certainly do ""work"". Consuela's scenes in the episode will remind viewers of her recent appearance in the season 8 episode ""Dog Gone""; she is just as stubborn and ignorant as ever, and not even Darth Vadar can get her to do what he wants. My only gripe I have with her however is that her scenes would have felt far fresher if we hadn't seen it all already so recently.As for actual guest star appearances, we also see the first appearance of James Woods since ""Back to the Woods"" in season 6; but those looking forward to his cameo may be disappointed to learn that he features in just a single ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"" scene. While James Woods is the only visible guest star to appear, we do see Ryan Seacrest (albeit with a different voice-artist) during a short American Idol gag involving Darth Vader cutting him to pieces, among others.While all of this is going on, Peter also puts his own unique spin on Han Solo's relationship with Princess Leia. His constant attempts at winning her over are presented in true Family Guy fashion, but while some of the jokes surrounding this work, others simply fall flat on the ground. These scenes are probably some of the episode's weakest.Like ""Blue Harvest"", this episode is packed to the brim with Star Wars references, which fans are sure to love. For me, these gags always seem to work. However, probably out-weighing these are references to gags from previously aired episodes of the show. All of these call-backs to old episodes, while they do utilise the Star Wars universe well (Peter's injured knee scene is redone using an AT-AT, for example), make the episode seem less fresh; perhaps the inclusion of more original jokes would have made more sense.Fans will either be intrigued or irritated to discover that Stewie's homosexuality is in full reincarnation in this episode; Darth shows questionable interest in a revealingly-dressed Storm Trooper; even (and quite disturbingly) showing interest in being more than friends with Luke Skywalker, his son. I personally loved these scenes. While Stewie's sexual confusions are a common annoyance for many, many fans, here, we're given the best of both worlds. In this episode, ""old Stewie"" and ""new Stewie"" co-exist perfectly. The evil Stewie from earlier seasons of the show is reformed under the guise of Darth Vader, while the sexually confused Stewie that is the Stewie of today is still fully represented underneath.The epic closing battle between Luke and Darth is handled brilliantly, especially Luke's line ""I would give my right hand for this day to just end"". The episode closes with a Back to the Future reference, which, if I'm honest, feels quite unnecessary, and out of place.All in all, this episode achieves what it sets out to do - parody a Star Wars movie, and poke fun at it at every possible opportunity in the process. While a lot of the non-Star Wars related gags are recycled from previous episodes, the episode will once again please most avid Star Wars fans; the fact that it manages to stick to the original movie's plot so well means that even non-fans of the original movie series shouldn't become too lost along the way. Still, as aforementioned, the gags make this episode seem less fresh than ""Blue Harvest"" did, and with that, of lower quality. While the novelty has definitely worn off, the episode is still entertaining, and the vast majority will be pleased with this adaptation of a classic science fiction movie.Review originally posted on Family Guy fan site Freakin' Sweet News [...]"	4.0	Family Guy Strikes Back...	2009-12-21	8	5	3

Simply put, if you enjoyed Blue Harvest, rest assured you're likely going to enjoy this episode as well. My initial impressions rate this as comparable in quality to Blue Harvest, with enough ""freshness"" to keep it from feeling like a stale rehash, yet enough references to the first episode to hold the story together.If by chance you haven't seen Blue Harvest, I'd recommend you see it first, as much like with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, this episode continues the story and references previous jokes and plot points.The Blu-ray edition comes with a digital copy of the episode, and is presented in 1.33:1 ratio (regular/full screen/standard/whatever you prefer to call it). The run time is between 54 and 55 minutes (the digital copy shows as 54:41), putting it 7 minutes, 8 seconds longer than Blue Harvest."	5.0	If you liked Blue Harvest, you'll like this too	2009-12-23	22	18	4

That said, ""Stewie Griffin- The Untold Story"" is one of the least funny attempts at comedy I've ever seen. It makes ""American Dad"" seem funny.  I don't know what happened. My guess is a contractual obligation forced MacFarlane into banging out a script over a weekend. I'd bet a good fifty percent of the material was pulled from the bag of jokes that didn't make it into previous episodes. And the storyline about Stewie and his dad/older self/brother was entirely horrendous. Sloppy, boring, and amateur.I could go on and on but I've wasted enough time this one.

An animated series building a similar cult following to The Simpsons and Futurama, Family Guy employs its own unique brand of humor distinct to its other animated peers...Family Guy follows the life and exploits of Peter Griffin, an idiotic family man flanked by his intelligent and loving wife, Lois. The couple have two children - Chris (an overweight, mentally challenged teenage boy), Meg (a neurotic teenage girl with low self-esteem), and Stewie (a super-intelligent infant who believes his mother is his enemy).

Granted, the ""uncensored"" propaganda was a bit much, considering all they did was drop a few BLEEPED f-bombs and portray Lois as being a little sexier than usual.It's everything we (the fans) have come to know and love about Family Guy.  Considering its usually hypersonic speed of storytelling, it IS a bit strange at first getting used to a single story that drags out for 88 minutes, but once I was settled in I actually found myself laughing out loud more often than not.FINAL VERDICT:This one is definately a BUY if you're already a fan.

But one of the things I noticed watching them in their original form was that the more the show needed to be censored, the less funny it became.  Like most shows, excessive sexual innuendo leads not to laughs but to snickers about them doing something naughty.  SOUTH PARK is much more suggestive than FAMILY GUY (well, most of the time), but I never laugh at SOUTH PARK because it doesn't offer much in the way of genuine humor.So, somewhat censored, but who cares.

What I mean is that it doesn't seem that these movies were originally made to be packaged together.- The quality changes from disc to disc.  Expectedly, this first (the oldest) is the lowest quality, but is definitely the funniest.  It is worse than watching family guy on HULU on my TV.-  The  second makes a big leap in picture quality, but the actual content is not as entertaining as the first.-  The third has a slight visual improvement over the second which makes it's picture the best, but i couldn't even finish it after I went 30 minutes without so much as a chuckle.  The third film was certainly an afterthought; its only purpose is to complete the trilogy.-  As many people have said, all three movies come with a second disc for installing a digital copy.  The first film even comes with a DVD version. This inconsistency again makes me think these discs weren't manufactured for the purpose of selling together.Seeing as the BluRay version was only $4 more when I purchased, i guess there is not much room for complaint.	3.0	So-so entertainment, So-so quality	2011-01-27	5	3	2

When South Park and the Simpsons became subjects of controversy, patrons of the shows theorized that it was unfair to criticize because the shows were &quot;equal opportunity offenders.&quot; Well, I beg to differ.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3H3Y28IPED5GU	C. A. Davidson	While the new Family Guy release wasn't what I thought it'd be, it was a clever endeavor right in line with the show. Often when a TV series makes a movie it tries to encompass the whole run of a series, or provide some over-arcing storyline. Not true with the Family Guy movie. It was basically just a really long episode (3 to be exact- and all from different writers), but it flowed together just like a regular half hour show- which means random stories regularly interrupted by irrelevant montages and asides- you know, what makes it so great.Its also no worse than what they show on regular network TV- I'm not sure what the big UNCENSORED deal is.My favorite part was the opener- the news leading up to a red carpet opener. Very fun.The Special Features are lame previews and of course, the now standard commentary. But they did include a neat trick where you can watch the whole thing as a sketched cartoon side by side with the fully animated version. That was cool for about... 5 minutes.I definitely recommend watching this, but if you're debating between buying this and buying a season of shows on DVD- buy the season.

I have such good memories of Family Guy before it was taken off the air, and although I have missed the new episodes, it is always good to get a laugh, especially when a show does not assume that the audience is ignorant.  If you KNOW that you don't like ""offensive"" material in your comedies, and I think every adult has already made this choice long ago, then why the heck would you bother to even watch it?

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AHF2LUMRDH6UP	Charles	I almost never review anything because I typically agree with other reviewers, so why bother?  But I see so many great reviews for this that I have to step up.I'm a huge fan of Family Guy.  I never miss an episode on Sunday.  I own all the seasons they've released.  I'm pre-ordered for Season 4.  I've even been tempted by the action figures.That being said, I'm very disappointed by this garbage.  Most of it is just plain not funny.  The parts that are supposed to be funny are so forced it turns my stomach.  At best, it's three of the worst Family Guy episodes they've made, available on one DVD.It is however Family Guy.  And if you're as big a fan as me you'll have to check it out.  Please rent it though.  It's not worth the money.I'll say this though, I'm shocked and amazed by the number of actual guest stars they got for this.  I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with Fox's influence, but still, it was cool to see... not that the guest stars were very amusing, just interesting to see.I'm also begining to think that the unaired Family Guys are unaired because they're sucky.  First that terrible Jewish episode they released with Season 2/3, now this.  Let's not forget Family Guy is only on the air now because of the fans buying so many DVDs, I guess the DVD is where the Family Guy's trash gets dumped.	2.0	Unimpressed	2005-09-29	15	6	9

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT	Charlie Brooks	To give you an idea of what Family Guy is like, imagine the Simpsons but without that small veneer that keeps it grounded in reality. Family Guy has the same old-fashioend sitcom core that has worked for generations - a stupid but well-meaning dad and his zany family - but adds a huge dose of ridiculous unreality to the mix. The show makes heavy use of random cutaways that exist for no other purpose but to be funny. It also holds nothing sacred, willingly making jokes at anything, even itself. Admittedly, this humor is not for everyone. If you can appreciate a dose of the ridiculous, though, Family Guy is solid gold.This volume contains the first two seasons of Family Guy, which gets the show off and running quickly. You'll get a feel from the very first episode, where we start off with a talking dog, an evil maniacal baby, and a cutaway to a joke about Hitler's low self-esteem. If you can see how that can be fun, this DVD volume is for you.While I'm usually not keen on commentary or other goodies in a DVD, the commentary tracks on this set are very good and worth listening to if you're curious about the history of the show. Family Guy had a tumultuous relationship with Fox, leading to some severe censoring and eventual cancellation. The creators give some insight as to what was going on behind the scenes but are thankfully unbiased, taking as many shots at themselves as the network. Such matters are merely footnotes, however. This volume is one of the best bits of American animation you'll see and is well worth the price for the episodes alone.	5.0	One of the silliest, funniest shows ever	2009-11-10	2	2	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3KKMIAD6QM9LH	chaser118	I have nothing but good thing to say about this show. I have read some of the reveiws for this seiries and I can't beleive some people can claim that it is a Simpsons rip off. First of all, I think this show can't even be compared to the Simpsons because they are both two totally differant shows with differant senses of humor. I respect everything Groening has done with the Simpsons, I mean any show that can stay on the air for 15+ years obviously has a formula that works. I don't think that the Family Guy didn't have that formula, on the contrary, I thought it had many things working for it. I don't beleive The Simpsons pushed the boundries the way FG did, which may explain FG's short-lived airing on FOX. I think right-wing-conservative America just wasn't ready for this kind of humor on national television. I highly recommend this DVD.	5.0	You're a McDonald... Not a whore	2004-11-09	7	5	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3SNTOJYHAQU80	Chester Jezz	I wanted this to be released in theaters, since I strongly support Family Guy and I consider the new season to be pretty darn good, but this 'movie', which streets at the end of September, is pretty lackluster.I say 'movie' because they decided to make the three acts of the movie divisible so that they can air each one on television, minus a few not-so-TV-friendly moments, mostly an unrelated intro and outro, which are actually funnier than the movie itself.The problem with the movie is that it just isn't very funny, or at least not Family Guy funny. The cut scenes that have become the trademark of Family Guy seem more unfinished. This is not to say none of the cut scenes are funny, but I'd say only one in four will have you laughing out loud.The plot is loosely based on Stewie trying to find his real father after having a near-death experience, but its not that simple at all. It seems that he has the near death experience in the first third of the movie, and since its a 3-part movie, they can't have the plot progress at all for the next twenty minutes, instead Stewie just goes off on a pointless drinking binge of a plot that seems more like a typical subplot rather than a movie's plot.This is where the film dead ends. I can appreciate 22 minutes of stupidity every week, but once you extend that to 90, you need more than just idiocy to get you by, you need something to keep you wanting to watch, even after you've take in a bit more of the Family Guy formula than you like to in one sitting. I could imagine it would actually be more enjoyable as three separate episodes, so if you purchase the DVD, watch the first 'episode' in the movie and stop. Then pick up the second the next day, and don't worry, it's not difficult to figure out where each episode ends. The reason it is so easy is because the rest of the family's sub plots conveniently change every 22 minutes, which entirely makes the film seem less like a movie, which is what I thought they were trying to make.It is not a coincidence that the last act (or episode) is the best in terms of plot and being a movie, but the least funny, while the first third is the funniest, but seems the most like an episode. Perhaps Family Guy can't be a movie. Perhaps Family Guy is episodic, and it is pointless to even attempt a full length movie. I, personally, don't think so. I think it is possible, but the two are independent and you have to choose: Do you want this Family Guy story to be episodic or in a movie-style? You can't have both. This is what MacFarlane and gang didn't realize, they went for both, and got nothing. Perhaps if they tried for only one, they would have succeeded.	2.0	They tried for both: Got Nothing	2005-08-25	41	15	26

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1ZJJL01LVZQGU	ChiefSanch	Family Guy is quite possibly the best new show of the last ten years.  No offense to such award winners as The Sopranos, The West Wing and Six Feet Under to name a few, but this show had everything.  It was comical and satirical, sardonic and irreverent.  It made fun of everyone and I mean everyone.  It used sight gags The Simpsons and Futurama are afraid to use and goes beyond.  Quite simply it is under appreciated.Season one was short but sweet.  Peter cheats the government, feigns Homer Simpson with TV withdrawal, Stewie thwarts a cult leader, Peter punches a woman, builds a bar in his basement and turns Lois into a famous lounge singer, Peter exploits the handicapped, Lois pulls a Marge Simpson and becomes a gambling junkie and finally Brian steals the show.  It sound a lot like The Simpsons, but it had more guts.  It wasn't afraid to make you laugh by offending anyone and it did it so well.Season two only got better.  Peter's piano talent is accesbiel only through imbibing alcohol, he turn the King And I into a cyborg kill fest, breast feeds Stewie in the shows funniest sight gag to date, leads his family in rebellion and it thorws in plenty of other song and dance numbers, the signs of a great cartoon.The dialogue is superb, just the right amount of plot advancing script as making fun of someone script.  The characters are hilarious. Quagmire is easily one of the best supporting cartoon characters since Moe, Brian is the smartest of the lot and he's a dog, martini sipping, chuck wagon chasing, golden voiced Brian.  Better than Astro, Dino and Santa's Little Helper combined.  Stewie is hilarious.  He easily eclipses Maggie as the best baby from a cartoon series.  Move over Pebbles and BamBam.The Griffins as a whole are like the Bunkers on steroids.  They're like The Simpsons on crack.  They're the King Of The Hill meets South Park.  They were a perfect hybrid of everything that makes a cartoon successful.  It had great writing, great voice talents, perfect matches for the characters, simple story lines made complex by the dynamics of the characters in them.  Stewie can turn even a simple love story at a day care center into a mature story line with witty dialogue delivered with adult emotion, but then expose the cold hearted Janet for just wanting his cookies.  Great symbolism!In the end, this show got the short of the stick.  It got a raw deal when television needed a show like this.  It is wildly popular, thank God for this boxed set and it's revival on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim.  I know many people that want to see this show back on Sunday night amid The Simpsons, Futurama and King Of The Hill, where it belongs.  But now it can live on forever and thank the Fox Corporation for giving us this treat.  Buy it and watch it as often as you can!  I give it my highest recommendation possible.	5.0	Great and sadly missed show	2003-04-23	11	10	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AAOMG1YP0VNP9	Chris 'raging bill' Burton	Take the toilet humour and political incorrectness of South Park. Then add the satire of The Simpsons, only with balls. Finally add the randomness of Monty Python, not to mention some original characters, and you have Family Guy. By far the best comedy I've ever seen from America, Family Guy has tons of laugh out loud moments and some genuine comments and wit hidden amongst the ridiculous situations and sometime basic jokes. Whether you're laughing at the sometimes witty but often stupid one-liners or the wondorful use of visual and situational humour, Family Guy simply won't fail to provide you with a good show.I normally review music so this is going to have to be short and sweet, but I'll end with this: if you havn't seen Family Guy then you're missing out on one of the funniest shows of the last decade.	5.0	One of the funniest comedies I've ever seen from the USA	2004-12-21	5	4	1

It's a follow-up to their previous ""Star Wars"" effort, ""Blue Harvest"". How does it stack up compared with the first one?It's entertaining, but not quite as much so. It's funny, but not quite as much so. It looks great, and some of the jokes are wonderful, but there's something missing, and I'm not sure what. It just didn't blow me away like ""Blue Harvest"" did.I did enjoy some of the jokes, especially when it's pointed out that the Rebels fleeing Hoth could go in any direction, but charge straight at the enemy fleet anyhow, but other jokes (like one about robot camels), went on a little long and just didn't work. Fortunately one of the great thing about ""Family Guy"" is that if you don't like one joke, just wait a few seconds and another will be along.Overall there's just something lacking from the first effort. It's still good, and funnier than the vast majority of entertainment options out there, but it's not quite on the same level of ""Blue Harvest""."	4.0	A long time ago, when gays weren't all in your face about it...	2009-12-31	3	2	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A22D6OJ8RA0387	"chris_theimaturemovieexpert ""chris"""	Family guy debuted in 1999 and immediatly started an unstopable cult following.  Family guy is a very fast paced show that uses sudden suprise jokes to throw it's audiences into a fit of uncontrolable laughter.  This show went places that no other show ever dared, and i believe simply that family guy paved the way for the new more explicit risk taking shows today.  Family guy will be returning on fox for a fourth season in june 2005, and with the recent attacks by the FCC on the more risk taking shows, it looks like it's going to be one hell of a fourth season.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1OTT1WRI3H2V8	Christina Roberts	There are two reviews here: One for the old Boxed Set. One for the new Slim Set.BOXED SET:This box set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy. The front cover shows the Griffin Family together having a fun time. The back cover shows and alternate Stewie photo and a description of the Volume One boxed set with bonus material and such. Inside there three thin plasitc cases for the discs. The front of each case has the main cover photo of the griffins on a different colored background. The backside of the cases have Episode Descriptions and what features are on the disc. Each disc has different artowork with different characters on them.SLIM SET (you get this if ordered from Amazon now):This slim set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy, just like the original. The front and back cover's artwork is unchanged. However, the inside is much different. The inside has no episode descriptions. Just the disc number and episode title. There is little to no artwork inside. The discs artwork is the exact same, though.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you would prefer to get the boxed set with artwork and such go for it. But order it from another site. Amazon only ships the slim sets now. If you don't mind. Go for the slim set. The outer appearence is still nice overall.Thanks for reading.	5.0	Family Guy, Volume One	2010-06-25	3	3	0

Basically if you haven't seen and appreciated The Empire Strikes Back, you will have little love for this film.  A female friend of mine who loves Family Guy, but who never has seen Star Wars (right?!?!?!?!?!) hated it.I appreciate the witty humor and the crossover of the Family Guy characters into their Star Wars roles.If you like this you should also check out Shin Chan, a Japanese anime spoof of star wars.

The jokes aren't as good, but there's tons of good references to pop culture and the usual Family Guy quirks.  I give it a 3.5 out of 5 for the show itself.But, if you get it, just get it on DVD.  The Blu-ray is more expensive and just not worth it since upscalers in BD players will do more than enough to make this work on your HD TV, especially since it's not wide screen but the usual 4:3 SD ratio and the graphics don't have high levels of detail.  This is the first BD I've received that really doesn't add absolutely anything to the experience compared to the DVD and I'd drop a whole point just for the added cost/lack of worthwhile features over what's on the DVD.	3.0	Not worth it on Blu-ray	2010-01-04	3	0	3

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ABK0V7DLYO5NU	Christy Smith	"You may be dead. However, if you're reading reviews for this I guess you know what you're in for. For example, at one point, Trisha Takanowa humps David Bowie's leg; another has Stewie blackmailing Brian by putting kiddy-p0rn pictures of himself on Brian's laptop. Overall, I could not have been more offended or happier. Because, when Family Guy stops offending my wife and I then it will be time to move on. By the looks of this DVD, that is a long time off.I have only one qualm with this DVD, and that is, if you sit through the whole thing, it seems to run on forever. I would suggest that you watch the movie in three parts, on three separate occasions. That way, you won't become desensitized by the idiocy (as I did) and extremity (as I am) by the last third of the movie.Favorite Quote, from Peter to Meg, on teaching her how to attract men, ""when I'm done with you Meg, you'll be beating off boys with both hands"" ha! jay."	5.0	Check your pulse, if you're not offended:	2005-09-28	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	A Family Guy uncensored is just like an Alien or Predator movie with gore: they just have to go together. Since Family Guy is so edgy and controversial anyways, an unrated movie would really tear the roof off by its fingertips. Only for some reason, the film(not really, it's more like 3 episodes bunched together) is funny at times but not on a massive consistent level. In other words, there's certain jokes in the show that I literally had to pause the DVD cause I was laughing so hard. Here? Just a good little laugh.The episode starts out average enough with Stewie going swimming only encountering a rival. Wanting to get even, his plan instead backfires causing him to go to hell with a disturbing encounter with Steve Allen. Back on Earth, he vows to be more nicer which doesn't last long until he sees someone on TV which looks remarkably similar to himself so it's another Brian and Stewie road trip to find his father, or is it?Many of the jokes fall incredibly flat or you just get a good chuckle or 2. The biggest one for me was actually this spoof on overzealous salesmen on TV with a really long product name. Very well done. Others don't fare so well such as Elmer finally getting Bugs in the most un-Warner Bros. way possible.Extras are a bit disappointing. You get an animatic comparison and a full length commentary with writers and actors. I would've liked to see something similar to one of the season sets featurettes where the actors detail inspiration for voices and characters.For Family Guy fans this is a must-have although I think Fox is planning to air these episodes in typical weekly fashion but at least we get it uncensored. Speaking of uncensored, parents with Family Guy fans for kids will be relieved that there's a censored version and a uncensored version in the Set Up menu.	4.0	To paraphrase Tricia Takanawa, it's mildly disappointing	2005-10-07	2	1	1

Some of the jokes seemed to be stretched too long, like the tripping of the walker.It's a trap was just horrid. they did that ready joke 2 times and with the past episodes of the chicken VS Peter in the series being funny fights they missed a great opportunity to make that real funny.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2RTA6PN7OCLOM	ClydeNut	A full length Family Guy movie might sound like a good idea, and definitely a good financial move, considering how popular(and overrated imo) Family Guy is nowadays. But when I saw the results of this idea, I completely realized that Family Guy is not a show to make a feature film out of. Aqua Teen Hunger Force even worked better as a movie than Family Guy did. The whole thing is just 3 modern episodes tied together. And if you read my other Family Guy review, you'd know that I'm not a fan of alot of recent Family guy episodes. And many of the great flaws and negativities of recent episodes are all present in this movie. And even worse, I did not laugh even once throughout the whole movie. I laugh occasionally in every new family guy episode, but not once in this whole movie did I laugh.	1.0	one of the worst movies ever.	2007-07-25	9	4	5

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1W0PWKIBTSDBT	congestedthoughts	I am a huge SW fan, it is perhaps one of the first movies I can recall from my childhood and although I've watched FG for a long, I think Seth could've done a better job in formatting the characters. It's not that I hate the ones that are chosen but there couldn've been a better choice for a couple, besides that I enjoyed Blue Harvest and I'll probably enjoy this. One thing that is kinda getting old is when people come on and write negative views on the show itself or a bad opinion just because they don't like it, if you don't like it, quite wasting your time talking about something that you can't change and change the channel, nobody is forcing you to watch it. If you think you can do better than get up and start your own cartoon. Obviously this show relates to people that enjoy not only the show but the movie that inspired this special homage. It's even more pathetic when people write a review on something they haven't even seen and if even if they did, they'd still think it wasn't that good because they already have the mindset that it's not as good as another cartoon that others say it's a rip off from which is total bs, grow up already and keep your negative opinions to yourself.I just hope one day that people will stop judging things and enjoy things that can actually put a smile on lots of faces. Besides I don't think it's as bad as those like to make it if the man Lucas himself approves of it. It's alot better than the majority of what is on there on MTV, VH1, E, Bravo, ect.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AGXCPXFBU40QF	"Courtland Bueno ""Enligh10ed1"""	Family Guy must be the single greatest animated comedy show ever made. There is not one episode that is not funny.The creator, Seth McFarlane, is a genius. His humor is witty and he makes use of every scene to bring out laughs. He has a unique style in his writing that incorporates flash back sequences. This tactic gives him the opportunity to put in hilarious (and often ridiculous) scenes into the show without disturbing the flow.The characters follow the basic formula for a sitcom family. Peter is the fat, stupid father. Lois is the smart, sexy wife. Chris is basically his father with an adolescent twist. Meg is the daughter that is desperate for attention. These characters alone are enough for a hit show, but McFarlane adds a few twists. He includes a cultured and facetious dog and a one year-old boy that is bent upon world domination; that is after he kills his mother, Lois, first. Each character is guaranteed to make you laugh and those are only the primary characters. The secondary characters (for example, the sex obsessed friend of Peter's, Quagmire) are pure gold.One thing that is found in the Family Guy series that is not found in many other comedy cartoons is the quality of animation. Don't get me wrong, the animation does not look anywhere close to realistic, and I am not advocating that it is. I am saying that the animation plays a role in the comedy. It is entertaining watching the look on Lois's face when Peter tells her something crazy.It is a shame that the show was cancelled, but there is news that every Family Guy fan should hear. Since Family Guy started to air on Cartoon Network, it has gotten better ratings than Jay Lenno and David Letterman for the 11:30 time slot in the 18 to 35 demographic, which is the most valuable demographic by the way; and the DVD sales have grossed more than they could have ever hoped for. As a result, Fox is bringing it back on the air sometime in the beginning of 2005. The will also be sporting an unheard of 15 writers to be on their team. Not only that, but Seth McFarlane is also creating a new show that will be on Fox later this year. Spread the news. Not all TV shows have gone to the dumps. Salvation is on its way.	5.0	Nothing short of comedy genius!	2004-08-09	10	9	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3VK5RYGU94X5Q	Critical Grad	Family Guy is back with a second Star Wars Episode.  Honestly, it shouldn't matter if you are a fan of The Empire Strikes Back or not (I don't care much for A New Hope but loved the FG episode).  Here is what you need to know:  Is it funny?  Sure, there are some laughs.  Could it be better?  I think so.  Was it as funny as the last one?  In my opinion, no.Is it funny?-The fact that the episode had me laughing in the first few minutes was a good sign (the probe droid scene was probably my favorite scene in the episode).  They do well to incorporate characters into funny yet familiar roles in the most random of times.  You will laugh at this episode, so that should be worth something.Could it be better?-Well...that is kind of my whole point here.  There are so many missed opportunities in this episode to poke fun at Star Wars or other actors/actresses that are not taken advantage of.  No Luke kissing Leia jokes...no Lando crossing his friends...no jokes about the Ugnaughts (pig people)...come on!  Is it too predictable?  Maybe...but it still deserves a shot.  Besides the missed jokes, some parts were just not too funny, like the AT-AT jokes on Hoth.Was it as funny as the last one?-I have my criticisms about Blue Harvest and they transfer over to this one too, but Blue Harvest just seemed to have the classic Family Guy humor to it whereas this one didn't.In the end, I am glad they made this one, hopefully learned some lessons for when they make Return of the Jedi.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2E9SXL0K37UO5	Critic	I never really watched Family Guy until my sisters started taping every episode and I've been a huge fan ever since.  I think Family Guy is clever and humorous, and I've gotten all my friends to watch the episodes, and now they are also hooked.  It's a shame that a number of people have something stuck up their behinds, and put such a great show off the air.  Whatever happened to freedom of speech?  On the bright side, I heard that if enough people buy the Family Guy episodes, they might make a movie.  So if you want to laugh hysterically, I highly recommend buying these DVDs.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3MBLTTF1XASA3	"""cykillrenegade"""	The best animated comedy show ever made. Screw the Simpsons, screw South Park, and though I hate saying this, screw Beavis and Butthead. This show delivers the most shock value humor, the funniest characters (Peter, Quagmire, News anchor Tom Tucker) and an endless amount of wit that comes in smaller portions in the other cartoons i mentioned. Plus I've never seen a show that breaks so many obvious copyrights from other movies and programs, and gets away with everything. This show is unique, lightning fast and extends the boundaries of cartoon comedy to a new level. The best thing is that thanks to dvd sales, now we can expect more.	5.0	More like 100 stars instead of 5	2004-01-20	5	2	3

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AEQFYOI6YJ83Z	DanD	"""Something Something Dark Side"" is a delightfully uncouth parody of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" a strong followup to ""Blue Harvest"" (though I wish they'd have gone with a better title this time around).  The episode (I won't call it a movie; at under an hour, it's not a movie) is more or less flawlessly executed; there are a few too many insider references, showing how aware of themselves ""Family Guy"" and Seth MacFarlane have become, but overall it's hilarious and non-stop laughter, the kind we have come to expect from these guys.True, the marketing campaign is horrible (or wonderful; depends which side of the cash register you're looking at).  If I were to include the marketing campaign in my rating, I would give this DVD two stars, simply because we have to fork out another $15 for a fifty-minute episode.  However, I didn't sink that low; I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD only.  I will acknowledge that, to some viewers, it may not be worth it.  ""Something Something Dark Side"" is not a must-have addition to your ""Family Guy"" collection, but it's certainly an enjoyable one."	4.0	Hilarious uncesnored entertainment.	2009-12-25	1	1	0

Added to this, there's an originality to ""Family Guy"" of its own which makes it a very special show.Thanks to the greedy executives from FOX, ""Family Guy"" was cancelled, but at least we have this upcoming DVD, which includes audio commentaries and the banned episode ""Wish Upon a Weinstman"""	5.0	"The least FOX could have done for all the ""Family Guy"" fans."	2003-01-21	13	9	4

Funnier than the Simpsons. Funnier than Seinfeld. It constantly exceeds your expectations, skipping over the obvious joke, past the not-so-obvious joke, beyond the extremely subtle joke to hit a joke more surreal and offensive than you ever imagined. And it does so over and over.The DVD itself has a few shortcomings. There are some fairly obvious compression artifacts, and there aren't a great deal of bonus features. However the packaging is quite slick, and really, when you have this much great comedy in one package (28 episodes!), what's a few glitches?A great collection of a hilarious, delightful, and sorely missed program.

This means they made it as a project, they weren't even sure it would be published.  The jokes are great and the plot isnt overly dragged out.  Ex.

Their kids Meg and Chris are both losers, which makes them all the more relatable. Brian, the talking dog, is more of a father figure than Peter, even with the dog's love of booze.Stewie, the baby of the family, is by far the funniest character.

The &#34;first three&#34; would be &#34;Episodes IV, V and VI&#34; in the convoluted reckoning of George Lucas. Those films really were something special back in their time, but popularity and familiarity does take a toll. Hence the spoofs. &#34;Family Guy&#34; fans will appreciate these - wait a minute. &#34;Family Guy&#34; fans will have already seen these and everyone else won't care one bit. Thus my review is superfluous except for the important and cranky things I have just said about George Lucas.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2CYJNYH53JMKD	David Group	First the good news: This is one of the funniest shows on in a long time.  I was a big fan when it was on TV and, after watching Volume 1, I had to go out and buy Volume 2.  The jokes come fast and furious, and the guest stars are as hilarious as they are surprising (Ed McMahon?!?!?).Now the bad news: Some cowardly poopyheads have deleted at least one scene from the original broadcast (the airport security/Osama Bin Laden one) and possibly another: does anyone remember a scene (possibly a dream sequence) where Peter suddenly finds himself on a plane full of useless celebrities and runs into the cockpit to try to crash the plane?  This scene does not appear to be on either set.The commentaries (about one every three or four episodes) are also pretty worthless.  Though they have their moments, such as pointing out instances where there are continuity errors, the commentaries usually A) lapse into silence as the creators watch the episode and occasionally laugh at a particularly funny joke, B) veer off into subjects totally unrelated to the episode, or C) provide uninspired info like &quot;This part used to be something different&quot; or &quot;This was less offensive than what we had originally wrote.&quot;  There is no mention of the controversy surrounding some of the jokes in many of the episodes.  Until a better version comes out, fans will have to settle for these DVD sets which, for most people, will be enough.	4.0	DVD sanitized for your protection	2004-05-16	2	2	0

However, as you have noticed I did not give it 5 stars and here is why.Peter (the father) is a complete idiot, but funny. Does not really care about anyone but himself.Lois (the mother) is a typical house wife. Nothing really interesting or particularly funny about that character.Chris (oldest son) is a bigger idiot then his father, but is not funny. This show without him would have been just as good.Megan (the daughter) is an unpopular kid at school, who is always ashamed of her family. Typical daughter who is sometimes funny.STEWART (YOUNGEST SUN) IS THE REASON #1 WHY I LOVE THIS SHOW AND THINK IT IS FUNNY. 1 YEAR OLD WHO TALKS WITH A BRITISH ACCENT AND SPENDS HIS DAYS FORMULATING THE PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND WHEN HE FINDS TIME AWAY FROM THAT, IS PREOCUPIED WITH MURDERRING LOIS. IN WHICH HE NEVER SUCCEDES, OF COURCE.AND BRIAN, THE TALKING DOG, WHICH IS THE REASON #2 WHY I LIKE THE SHOW.

It also has fox.com promos on disk one and a behind the scenes show on disk 4 (aprox 15 min).

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1U6WZPUMNLQ9D	D. Crowley	"Throughout most of the 90s, ""The Simpsons"" pretty much was the only show of its kind.  An edgy cartoon that was actually geared toward adults instead of kids, it surprised many with its cultural, political, and religious satire all done with an eclectic and sometimes bizarre cast of characters.  The show obtained a large, devoted cult following, with many hardcore fans (myself included) who have watched nearly every episode and know dozens of ""Simpsonisms"" by heart.  As good as they are, the Simpsons' glory days have long passed, and as the show heads into its 14th season (it's the third longest running comedy series after ""Ozzy and Harriet"" and ""My Three Sons), it's starting to get stale.Enter ""Family Guy"" in 1999.  Created by Seth MacFarlane (who also does most of the show's voices) (Family Guy took the basic Simpsons formula of satire and dysfunctional family humor and spiced it up with even more innuendo, lewdness, and hideously un-PC jokes.  Despite its excellence and extensive praise from critics, the show had a largely unremarkable run, with FOX juggling the show's scheduling until it was finally cancelled.  Then, FOX released the family's exploits on two DVD sets, one of which this review is about.  The DVDs sold like hotcakes, and the sales were so strong that FOX recently bought it back for another season.A show is only as good as its characters, and Family Guy excels in this regard.  The basic family upon which the show centers is remarkably reminiscent of the Simpsons - Peter Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane), middle-class, dim-witted, overweight, arrogant, yet charming father of two teenage kids and a very unusual baby (more on him later), and his more intelligent wife Lois, who keeps him in check while providing much needed support for the kids as a stay at home mom.  While comparisons between Peter and Lois and their counterparts Homer and Marge are unavoidable, Family Guy's leading couple have a style that is very distinct from their Springfield cousins (not literal cousins, of course, although that would be an interesting family reunion...)Perhaps the one (and only) area where Family Guy fails - especially in comparison to the Simpsons - is in the family's kids.  Chris and Meg Griffin are, for the most part, stereotypical teenagers, and their place in the show sometimes feels a bit forced.  Granted, they have their moments, and once in a while the plot will take advantage of their characters, but the Griffin kids are nowhere near as multi-layered and animated (no pun intended) as Bart and Lisa Simpson.  If Chris and Meg were as good as the other characters, this show would top the Simpsons easily.Strangely, the show's best characters are the ones that make no sense whatsoever.  Specifically, Brian and Stewie Griffin.  Brian (also voiced by MacFarlane) is the Griffin's talking dog who is, in fact, the smartest member of the family.  Despite the fact that he's a dog, Brian's character is intelligent, witty, and very multi-layered.  Brian more so than anybody on the show has to deal with difficulties.  He has to deal with being the only intelligent member of an unintelligent family, along with the fact that he seems to be the world's only talking dog.  He's a smoker and borderline alcoholic, binging on dry martinis whenever he gets a chance (his drunken scenes can be quite hilarious, in a perverse sort of way).  He has psychological problems, thanks to his difficult past and repressed sexual urges (which is why he has a therapist who is a semi-regular guest on the show).  Many audience members can sympathize with Brian's frustrations, ironically making him one of the most human characters in the show.  The episodes that take full advantage of his character, like ""Brian in Love"" and ""Road to Rhode Island"", are often the funniest and most interesting episodes in the series.  While part of the humor comes from the fact that he is a dog, it's obvious to any viewer that there's a lot more to Brian than that.  Despite all these layers, his main role is the same as all the other characters - a punch line for the show's outrageous, offensive humor.But the real star of the show for many is Stewie Griffin.  Even though he's only one year old, Stewie is the most maniacal and sadistic character on the show.  Voiced once again by MacFarlane (albeit with a British accent), Stewie is bent on taking over the world and destroying anybody who gets in his path - including his own family!  If Stewie were a few years older, he'd probably be a twisted serial killer on CSI or Law and Order - that's how evil he is.  Stewie is one of those characters where either you get him, or you don't get him.  Those who don't understand his appeal will be a bit confused as to why he's so popular, but the few people like myself who recognize the sheer brilliance of Stewie will start laughing whenever he speaks.  Once again, it sounds confusing, but you have to see the show to understand.This is probably Family Guy's biggest strength and its biggest weakness: the show is very situational.  In the Simpsons, most moments have a witty quote or two that sums up the event, like the famous Homerism ""just because I don't care, doesn't mean I don't understand"".  In Family Guy, the writers take full advantage of the situation, making for moments that, while hilarious, can't be done justice with words.  For example, in one scene, Brian is driving a car through the countryside after deciding to get away for a while.  He hits a man walking on the road, gets out and says to him, ""Oh my God!  Are you Stephen King?!"" The man says, ""I'm Dean Koontz!""  Brian says ""oh"", obviously extremely disappointed.  He proceeds to get back in his car and purposely back over Dean Koontz again, then runs over his body once more and drives away.  It doesn't sound funny here, but when you see it, it's hilarious.  Every moment in Family Guy is like that.  It's what makes the show so funny, but on the flip side it makes it hard to explain the appeal to your friends who haven't seen the show.This particular DVD set, Volume 1, contains 28 episodes from seasons one and two.  The second volume is season three, which is also excellent, although I recommend you get this first simply because there are more episodes. I haven't watched the special features yet, but I was never one to care about special features on DVDs in general.If you're still not sure if you'll like or not, watch Family Guy on FOX Sunday nights or on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" on Thursday nights.  It's not for everybody, but if you've ever shown even a remote interest in the Simpsons, Family Guy will be an instant new favorite."	5.0	"""Family Guy"" Can Go Toe-to-toe with ""The Simpsons"" anyday"	2005-07-10	3	2	1

Simpson's folks - there is no comparison.The two shows are too different.This is not a copy; its more creative and hard edged.The Simpson's is more polished; but Family Guy isfunnier. (Sorry, its the truth.)3. For a 2 1/2 season show; I'll let DVD salesand Cartoon Network ratings speak for me.It has been reported in TV Guide that Adult Swimis beating the ratings of Letterman, Leno and Kilborn(each) in 18 to 34 males. (Amazing)4. I watch a lot of TV but I never knew Family Guy existeduntil it was already cancelled and they were showingthe last episodes on Thursday.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ASWKB9SYC7D3S	DERVISH888	I am a huge fan of The Family Guy and have been looking forward to buying this DVD ever since I heard it was coming out.  I just finished watching this DVD and am in shock at how Un-Family Guy it was.  It didn't even seem like I was watching The Family Guy.  It appeared as if it was a different show with The Family Guy characters.  It seemed as if it was written and thrown together over a weekend.  I honestly think I laughed once.....maybe.  I can't even remember at this point.I am a loyal Family Guy fan and will continue to love and watch the episodes on Fox.  I have never missed one episode.  Alas, my advice to you is to put this in your Netflix queue right now.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AD7IBJCYSJ9EE	Destitute	"INTRO: When FG was cancelled, Seth thought about making a movie. Well, now that the show's back, this is kind of a comeback movie.BASIC PLOT: After a near-death experience, Stewie tries to be...good, even though he fails at it! While watching TV, he sees a man who looks a lot like Stewie. Stewie thinks he might be his real father [After all, how could dumb Peter be his father?] and decides to go on a journey to find him.OPINION: This movie was pretty pirated before its release. After all, people couldn't wait. For a guy who had to wait, I say it was worth it.This movie's HILARIOUS. About an hour and a half of random gags, and tons of FG fun. It's also quite funny hearing the characters dropping the F-bomb. I won't spoil anything for you, so I suggest you to buy/rent this right away!SIDE NOTE: Make sure to go to ""Language"" on the main menu and choose ""uncensored."" Otherwise, it will beep the swear words out."	5.0	Family Guy's new movie is freakin' sweet!	2005-10-03	3	2	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A243MCJ2DZSH6H	Devin152	I watched Family Guy from when it first came on in 1999 until its premature cancellation a few years later. It was a very funny show and i bought the DVD shortly after it came out. The show itself is excellent, it is a more offensive, edgy version of The Simpsons with it's own style of random humor.The extras are not great. The commentary is terrible and a waste of time to listen to, because they don't say anything particularly funny. The promos are okay, but I saw them back in 98-99. The behind the scenes featurette is pretty good, even if it is rather short.Don't try to watch to many episodes at one time, because you will get sick of it. Watch a few at a time.	4.0	A Very Funny Show	2004-03-20	0	0	0

Ferrari	I'd probably actually give this 4 stars, but I need to give it 5 to make up for the ignorant people who posted 1 star reviews based on a misprint of the run time before this was even released.I imagine this must have been kind of tough to do because when they did Blue Harvest they didn't know if they were going to do the other episodes, so they kind of got in all the Star Wars jokes they possibly could in that one.  They did a great job though.  It is an awesome satire.  If you are a fan of Star Wars you will love this.  If you are a fan of Family Guy and know nothing of Star Wars then you'll probably get a chuckle out of it just because it is classic Family Guy humor.

If hundreds of reviewers have praised this cartoon, and tens of thousands of viewers have signed petitions to keep it alive, why is it off the air? This is where Fox's cunning sense of viewership comes in. The knuckleheads over at Fox have consistently taken their most highly rated (and thus controversial) shows off the air. I cannot wait for the day when Family Guy makes a resurgence to television (as it is already starting to do on channels like Comedy Central). For now, however, all us FG addicts will have to satisfy ourselves with the DVD of old episodes. I assure you, these are high-quality, not like the ones we all have ripped on our computers.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2R8P69MQK92KY	"Edward ""familyguydude"""	Family Guy is one of the funniest shows ever created and is probably the most underrated comedy that was ever on tv. It is so funny, with so many different jokes in every single episode. The Simpsons is the best cartoon ever, no doubt. But Family Guy is funnier! The Simpsons just have better storylines (after 16 seasons, you should). Family Guy's cast of hilarious and idiotic Rohde Island residents will keep you laughing until you can't breathe. From Quagmire, a sexy beast, to Stewey, a brialliant young mind, determined to murder his mother, you'll never be without a laugh. It also has the most one liners from any show ever (except for the Simpsons, of course). With some especially hilarious episodes exclusively on this dvd, this is definitely a must-buy!	5.0	So fun funny, so mindless, so awesome!	2004-12-14	2	1	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2WOU1RRSBCAQR	Edward J. Resnick	"I had been looking forward to this release since I first saw Blue Harvest.  The only thing I can say after watching ...Dark Side is ""disapointing"".  There were so many opportunitites to show the same wit that was used in the Star Wars spoof, but instead they took the easy way out with way too many gay jokes (OK Darth Vader is gay, Obi Wan is gay, half the storm troopers are gay, Chewie is gay, enough already).  How about some jokes about a city in the clouds, what does it float on?  Why was Lando not drinking Colt 45 (that should have been a lay up), how about when the Falcoln is hiding by sticking to the back of the star destroyer and the empire ""lost them on our scopes"", why no scene with a guy looking out the window, which is now blocked by a large spaceship?  Too many missed opportunities. This is definately a rental and not a purchase."	2.0	Disapointing Follow-Up	2009-12-28	3	2	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A36UIMCWTU1PS	"Ege M. Ersoz ""ege02"""	Ok let's face it. The Simpsons is running out of ideas. I have been watching them since the first day they came out, and to be honest with you, they don't make me laugh as hard as they used to. I can guess every coming joke and the themes are too cliche.I believe Family Guy has the potential to surpass The Simpsons, both in popularity and funny-ness. I mean, if people stop being so touchy about racial jokes and all that stuff that got some episodes banned, and give it a real chance for several seasons, they will see the true value of this show.First of all, just the fact that it has so many references to pop culture is a good enough reason to play it over and over. You don't get all the jokes the first time you watch it, either because you miss the joke while laughing at the previous one, or that you don't know the commercial, movie, event, etc. that the joke is referring to and you don't get it.Second of all, the jokes are beyond hilarious. I can't find the right word for it. I get belly cramps after every show from laughing so hard. Even though the USA is so touchy about racial, religious, and ethnic jokes, it's impossible to laugh at these! For instance, here's a dialogue (the way I remember it).Reporter: Now we turn to Ali for the blackie weather forecast. What can you tell us, Ali?Ali: It's gonna rain!Reporter: Thank you Ali.Or that one episode where Peter converts to Jewism so that his son is more successful in school (the episode got banned).This can go on forever.THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU WANT TO GET BELLY CRAMPS FROM LAUGHING, THIS IS YOUR BEST BET. AND YOU CAN PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT'S STILL FUNNY!	5.0	Awesome Show, Guaranteed to make you laugh for hours at end	2003-11-05	13	1	12
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3BQCZNB97XUNY	"Eggplant ""Eyehateamazon"""	All of the Griffins, none of the commercials, and we now have access to 28 great episodes whenever we want. VICTORY IS OURS!Family Guy is easily one of my all-time favorite shows, with politically incorrect humour, great writing, fun stories, lovable characters, a multitude of parodies, flashbacks and references, and one-liners that you and your friends will be quoting for days. It's a mystery why FOX canceled this (and Andy Richter, of course) and continue to show unwatchable dreck like Fastlane and 24 (yuck). But by September, we'll have EVERY single episode ever made (including When You Wish Upon A Weinstein), so victory truly is ours, fellow Family Guy fans. If your idea of essential TV watching is The Simpsons, South Park, and King of the Hill, Family Guy is just what the doctor ordered.Also worth noting is that FOX is taking notice to the large number this DVD set is selling...and that can't be bad, right?	5.0	&quot;Oh, this is so good, it just HAS to be fattening!&quot; - Stewie	2003-07-12	1	1	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3JFM1JCYXW772	"Elena Case ""myyogini"""	"Family Guy is a raucous irreverent animated comedy propelled back into production due to fans (like me) who appreciated its incredible daring satire of, well - everything and everyone!  This DVD is a no-holds-barred masterpiece of iconoclastic humor, not for the faint of heart.  The censors have had a field day with Family Guy episodes since its first broadcast, and that is a recommendation in its own right!  All our favorite characters have their moments - Brian the alcoholic intellectual dog, Stewie the evil mastermind infant, Meg the homely teen girl, Chris the overweight underachiever, Peter the buffoon who enjoys the guilty pleasures in life, Lois the former party girl from a wealthy family turned Mom, and Mayor Adam West (played by the 70's classic Batman, Adam West) as a paranoid Mayor of Quahaug RI.  In the very beginning, you see Lois tumble ass over teakettle on the red carpet from the limo to the ""opening night"" of this film, tanked from the champagne in the limo and wanting to do Peter then and there - and it sets the stage for the rest of the film, which is a bawdy fun tale of Stewie seeking the ""mysterious man"" whom he believes must be his biological father.  Stewie is inspired by the concept that Peter, a simpleton, could not have produced the DNA which created such a brilliant sinister genious, and decides to find the mysterious man he glimpsed who resonated with him so strongly.  The revelation of the mysterious man's identity drives the plot, as pop culture references, quips, and the never-ending insult duels between Brian and Stewie keep the laughs going.  We all know a Quagmire (clich? ladies' man ridiculous to all but himself and the conquests he ensnares with his lifelong experience of chasing tail), a Cleveland (sweet stable guy-next-door who is the calm in the storm and the voice of ethics and helping our fellow man), a Joe (while he is in a wheelchair, his personality as an overly macho jock is abundantly clear) and all our favorites.  We know people like these, and this is an unabashed portrayal of them that is only a slight exaggeration!  If you are easily offended, Family Guy isn't for you, but it should be.  If you can't laugh at your own beliefs, they are dogma not truth - truth is strong enough to handle the challenge of humor.  The pop culture references and laughs are sharp social commentary and the humor is edgy to say the least.  I agree with another reviewer - this was more like a few episodes put together, rather than feeling like a feature length film, but who cares when it is as good as this?  Enjoy a few good laughs, get this!"	5.0	Great Laughs, Incisive Social Commentary	2006-04-26	1	0	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A137QJXNEWH7MR	"""elxalraj"""	As someone posted here, this set contains 28 episodes (entire first and second season by air dates) and the unaired episode When You Wish Upon a Weinstein (which would've been part of the 2nd season by production number). Despite no pages having this information yet, if you check the front cover you can clearly see it states 'Seasons 1 & 2'. These are the seasons according to air dates.Eight episodes total will have commentaries, and word has it there are other features. These features don't count towards the running time of the set.All in all an excellent series. Family Guy packed as much humor as it could in every episode without ever overdoing it. It's comedic style is very different from the Simpsons and South Park (more pop-culture oriented), but i personally find it superior and more clever. The production quality is excellent and constant from the very first season (unlike the Simpsons). Probably best of all is Seth Macfarlane's outstanding job giving the voices of Peter, Brian and Stewie. Excellent story lines with a remarkable and memorable cast of characters. Definitely my favorite animated TV show of all time.This set is the first part of a two volume collection. Unfortunately Family Guy was only three seasons long when it got canned by Fox.	5.0	Excellent series.	2003-01-08	34	29	5

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A26ZHW8OHW4VUG	E. McNeill	"A couple of friends convinced me to watch this movie with them and I was pretty hesitant because Family Guy has essentially been pure garbage recently.  Anyway in the spirit of friendship I decided who cares, as long as I'm not watching it alone.  The first thing that gets me, is that its a 4:3 ratio.  The majority of cartoons have made the jump to 16:9, including the spinoff Clevelend Show which is....somehow worse.  I'm not sure why they even bothered putting this on bluray when it doesn't even fit your HDTV.  Anyway onto the actual movie itself (hard to even call it that at around 55 minutes), in short its the stupidest thing Ive ever seen.  I actually used to enjoy this show but the content is almost all filler.  Most of the ""jokes"" are simply random allusions to other movies and TV shows that have no relevance whatsoever.  The writers still seem to think that its funny to rehash their old classic jokes, and make them take up long periods of time.  The ""its funny because the joke lasts way longer than it needs to"" isn't funny at all and is only put there to fill up the time.  Its hard to even consider this a Star Wars parody when almost every single joke has nothing to do with Star Wars.  Seriously they just branch off of the story and have their characters rant, and apparently they think thats brilliant.  Anyone can write like that, 5 minutes of plot with 50 minutes of random scenes featuring cultural references.  What happened to Subtlety?  Cultural references are meant to be subtle, to the point where you can easily miss it because it works with the plot so well.  Every reference on Family Guy is blatantly obvious because they almost always just copy a scene directly, and usually tell you what it is as well.  I guess that just tells you how stupid the writers think their viewers are.  There isn't anything clever or funny about this show anymore.  I'd say it was good for a couple chuckles, 55 minutes of a comedy and I hardly laughed.  My friends and I agreed that Family Guy needs to end soon, its just embarrassing."	1.0	How did they let it get to this?	2009-12-28	24	11	13

I got my hands on a sneak preview of this movie and laughed so hard in the first five minutes that the next day I bought the Family Guy Season 1&2 DVD.Truth is, this show is limited by the fact that it's on Fox.  This show would be spectacular if it aired on HBO or somewhere the characters would be allowed to swear more.The movie starts with a mega preview and takes place a year or so after the original series got cancelled.  We see what sorts of things the clan has been up to, then it all focuses on Stewie.The plot is too good to spoil but it does involve Stewie's fears about other kids, may or may not confirm peoples' thoughts that Stewie is gay, and gives us some of the funniest moments this show has produced.If you like Family guy, you'll love watching it totally uncensored.

I've enjoyed most of the new episodes of the show but this movie bored me to tears and I'm glad I didn't spend money on it. The premise is uninteresting and the ending is incredibly lame.

A word of caution though, some of the jokes are very crude and in some cases racy, but its all done in good fun. However, if your not easily offended, you'll be laughing from the very first episode to the last one on this set. An example of the crazy humor in you'll find in Fmaily Guy is a scene where Peter (the father) fights a giant chicken for 5 while minutes. The fights takes them from the sidewalk, to a truck, to a helicopter, then on top of a skyscraper. In the same episode, Peter is informed of Y2K by a man in a chicken costume. After the apocalipse that is Y2K, Peter's family then goes off in search of the Twinky factory because as everyone knows, only roaches and twinkies can survive a nuclear blast. Crazy enough for ya?Guest voices include, Adams West and Norm MaDonald (as Death). About the only thing I didn't like about this DVD set is that there weren't more commentaries on the episodes. They were hilarious and I felt that the commentaries really added to the whole experience, however, Seth MacFalane (the creator) should really have provided commentary for a few more episodes.	5.0	Pure Genius	2003-06-27	0	0	0

Peter goes undercover to Meg's high school but ends up as the icon of ""cool"". This one is oneof my favorites, it is funny and trippin'. - 10/10.15.- ""Dammit, Janet!""Stewie falls in love with a ""toddler"" at a daycare named Janet, while Lois, a stewardess, and Peter take advantage of free trips, until they board a hijacked plane to Cuba. Great episode and great story. - 9/10.16.- ""There's Something About Paulie""After the ""MOB"" helps Peter get his car repaired, he tries to avoid paying the favor to them. In the process, Lois accidentaly offends the Nephew of the ""Don"" and a contract is to take away her life. Great episode and funny talks. - 9/10.17.- ""He's too Sexy for his Fat""Chris rejects the idea of liposuction in his effort to lose weight, but Peter becomes addicted to plastic surgery and Lois is more attracted to Peter physically than she ever was. This episode is funny, and has a valuable lesson. - 10/10.18.- ""E Peterbus Unum""Peter starts a new independent country called ""Petoria"" and starts an abrasive behaviour towards the neigbors. Thanks to this action, Peter get in to lots of trouble with the Federal Goverment. Not too crazy about this one either. - 8/10.19.- ""The Story on Page One""Meg writes a newspaper article about the mayor Adam West, but Peter Inmediatley replaces her article with his claiming that actor Luke Perry is gay, but then Peter tries to seduce Luke to prove the validity of his article. This is one of my favorites, it is so funny and full of surprises. - 10/10.20.- ""Wasted Talent""Lois tries to win the State Piano Competition with one of her students, but they are no good. Then she discovers that when Peter is drunk, he is a piano-playing genious. This is a great one with lots of laughter. - 10/10.21.- ""Fore, Father""Peter unsuccessfully teaches Chris to be responsible on a camping trip and then on the golf course. Meanwhile, Brian convinces Stewie that the booster shots he just recived are part of an attempt to control his mind.Well there you go.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A32O2PUY8OEA0	"fats ""al"""	"Let me just start by saying that I thought this DVD, upon hearing about it as rumors way back last year, was going to be a piece of garbage. Allow me to explain. I assumed that the producers of Family Guy were going to slap together three episodes and call it a movie, with no flow, and use it to make cash. I also thought that this movie wouldn't be funny, as it would have been slapped together while the show was being brought back into production, therefore diminishing its quality.Gladly, I was proved very wrong.In fact, I believe this DVD is actually better than most of the episodes from the brand new season of Family Guy. The three episodes are linked together quite nicely, with ""commercial"" skips used to separate the individual parts instead. Book-ending the parts are two little segments: The Red Carpet, where we see the Griffins go to the premier of the movie, and The Party, where the Griffins go to a wrap-party after the premier, and enjoy some Pawtucket Patriot Ale, as well as talking about what they have done in the time between Seasons 3 & 4. Truly amusing.On to the movie itself: the movie attacks pop culture, per usual, and does it in themost tasteless way possible....yay! The complaint I have had about Season 4 was the WAY too many asides, where they say ""this is like the time where..."" and go off on a dead end. Thankfully, the movie has some of that, but isn't packed to the brim with it like in Season 4- in other words, its more in the style of old-school Family Guy, and, as fans know, thats a good thing. The movie isn't totally dedicated to Stewie and Brian either, something I feared as I think Peter is the best character and that Brian and Stewie are overrated, and would therefore get an unfair share of screen time. Fortunately, the screen time is evenly distributed, and makes for double the fun as you see two separate stories unwinding, with Stewie's naturally being at the forefront.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON:The thing I especially dug about this movie, aside from the usual goodies of Family Guy, was the way they talked about really dark subject matter. We get a look at Stewie's dull future, talk about Brian dying, and see Chris abused by his cursing-wife, and Peter and Lois moving into an old-folks home. Meg has a sex change, but that is actually not as much dark as it is funny and disturbingly expected. I especially liked the twist ending, and was not expecting what happened. A+ for movie content.Now, for the special features. The commentary, unlike the TV-DVDs ones, is actually informing. Sure, we get the clever banter we all know and love, but we actually get some hardcore information in this commentary, and have our questions answered. A+ for that, its a great time.As for the sneak peeks, they really aren't sneak peaks as much as they are clips from the show interspersed with an announcer talking about how silly the characters are. I was disappointed here, as I had hoped to see maybe a look at the DVDs, or maybe a look at episodes that were coming up. Alas, you can't win em all.The animatics are like those on Volume 2, and are interesting as always.The things to watch: UNCENSORED audio track, then play it with commentary to enjoy fully.5/5, quite a great DVD. Can't wait for Season 4 to be released."	5.0	Untold Story Revealed At Last	2005-09-28	4	4	0

""Whoah is this really the blood of christ? Geeze he must've been wasted 24 hours a day eh?""Lois griffin is the level-headed ""stick in the mud"" house wife and mom.

I've seen each episode several times, but I still laugh constantly when I see one.  The humor is both stupid, and high brow.  There are a couple of jokes that are made that I still don't get, and I'm fairly well educated.  It's an amazing, hillarious series though, and you should definately check it out.A few things to note about this series is that season 4 is in the works and will begin to air in May 2005!  This marks the first time in history that a cancelled TV series has been ressurected by phenominal DVD sales.  This is a testiment to how great this show really is.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AEJ0EGQ79Y0KK	Gareth Mc Bride	"The classic animated series ""Family Guy"", follows up the success of its return to the Prime Time lineup, with a DVD movie, ""Stewie Griffin, the Untold Story"". The film is a three part story wrapped around and intro and wrap up that parodies a Hollywood premiere and party.The jokes fly fast and bawdy and pull no punches. Every pop culture reference no matter how obscure and some of the more controversial issues of the day are tossed in, and for the most part, work.The story follows the evil genius Stewie, who after a near death experience decides to change his ways as Hell does not hold much appeal for him. After the family gets Tivo, Stewie spots a person on television that is a spitting image of him. Convinced that the man is his real father, Stewie and the family dog Brian, join the hormonally driven Quagmire on a cross country trek.When Stewie reaches the coast he is shocked to discover the true identity of the man which will propel the remained of the story.While the show has a few misfires, it is mostly filled with one effective joke after another. The laughs were constant and I found myself enjoying every moment of the film. The laughs are very good, and if you are a fan of the show and do not mind some biting, and crude humor, this is a great escape.Fans of the show will love the usual interplay of the characters and the familiar style and pacing as the film plays out like a regular episode of the show, as it was initiated as a three part episode. The inclusion of segments that would not have likely made it past the networks Standards and Practices department only ads to the enjoyment of the show as it is nice to see a shown known for pushing the envelope taking steps that it would not otherwise be able to take.4 stars out of 5.Gareth Von Kallenbach"	4.0	While it started as a simple three part episode, it ends as one of the best Family Guy outings ever.	2005-09-07	208	170	38

Even though it is an Unrated film ( Rated it would probably be R), curses were bleeped out. Even though I wasn't entirely dissapointed, seeing that the movie was great, it was annoying that the box clearly states, 'All-New, Outrageous, Uncensored!'.

The original purpose of Stewie is back: to kill Lois and anyone else who stands in his path to the top--or anyone who just annoys him. The movie's packed with some of the most funny Family Guy moments ever, such as:--Stewie drunk off his a**--Trisha Takanawa ""setting her people back a thousand years.""--Peter and Lois's dating tips--""What really grinds my gears.""--Stewie with Steve Bartman at the infamous Cubs' playoff game--Quagmire's cross-country tour bus (""Isn't there an ""O"" in country?"")--Black-u-weather meteorologist Ollie Williams ('nuff said)--President Douchebag (and his opponent, Senator Date-rape)...just to name a few. I won't give away the plot, but I'll just give a hint: I bought this thinking it would be about Stewie realizing he was gay (Seth McFarlane said they had created an episode on the topic that was unaired), but I couldn't have been more wrong.In short, if you are even a mild Family Guy fan (if there is such a thing), you need to buy this DVD.

It has everything you love about FG: random references to media from the past & present, lowbrow humor that makes the Simpsons look tame (which it sort of is), and creator Seth MacFarlane doing half the voices.The story, folks, is simply this: Stewie is crushed under a lifeguard tower and nearly dies. He discovers life is precious and turns ""nice"" for a while, until he sees a man on TV in San Francisco that looks just like him. Thinking it could be his real father, he and Brian head out in Quagmire's Winnebago, tackling obstacles until he reaches the man and discovers it's really a future version of Stewie, a pathetic virgin who works at a Circuit City-like place and lives by himself. After helping Stu, as he goes by now, get his life together (sort of) and seeing a future version of the family (Peter and Lois are just older versions of themselves, Chris is a henpecked cop, and Meg is a man named Ron), Stewie races back to prevent his near-death experience so he won't grow up to be a mess.Thrown in here are jabs at Ray Charles, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Johnny Quest, Lethal Weapon, Indiana Jones (Temple of Doom AND The Last Crusade!), Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Shield, and more. It's no worse than the show in terms of content (Officer Scrotes, maybe, but that's awesome), unless you listen to the uncensored track with full-on F-bombs that are usually bleeped (most provided by Chris's wife).

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A33EVD614SYD2R	"George H. Mcallister ""George McAllister"""	In reading the several negative reviews that this show has gotten on amazon.com - and it got a lot more from professional critics when it was first released - I can't escape the feeling that its detractors misuderstand its intentions. It's quite valid to point out that the animation is not particularly interesting, that the voice acting lacks emotional subtlety, or that the jokes are usually not deeply witty reflections on the nature of modern family life. These things are all true. But they're simply not the point.If you'll forgive a sexual analogy, Family Guy is masturbation, while what its critics want is sex. Family Guy exists to make you laugh as much as possible, period. To criticize it for not having deeper significance - social, artistic, other - is like criticizing masturbation because it doesn't bring you closer to your wife. Well no it doesn't, but that's not the point.This is, of course, why it's a cult classic and not a wildly successful TV show. It will either make you laugh or not. If you're one of the people who finds it funny, you're likely to become slavishly devoted to it. If, however, its particular brand of humor doesn't appeal to you, it will look like an utter waste of time. That doesn't mean it's bad - contrary to popular belief, something needn't be universally loved by the intelligentsia to be worthwhile. (Trends come and go among critics as much as among laymen; Christianity was silliness to educated Romans, right up until it conquered the Western world.)

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A16UUJJD9OYOHU	"""gigoat"""	Not too many extras: some commentary on a few episodes,some promo ads, nothing too specialIn the episode &quot;Road to Rhone Island&quot; from disc 3, about 40 seconds of footage is cut out. Stewie is in the airport and wants to smuggle weapons onto the airplane so he sings to distract security while his luggage goes through the x-ray. After he goes through he says &quot;I sure hope Osama Bin Laden doesn't know showtunes.&quot; Soon after a Bid Laden looking character comes and starts singing showtunes.Sure, they can include the unaired and controversial episode &quot;When you Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot; on volume two, but they have to cut out this scene.

And anyway EVERYTHING COPIES THE SIMPSONS!Southpark did an entire episode on how every story they come up with has already been done on the Simpsons. So stop complaining!Family Guy is pure comedy.

This show was underappreciated and deserved this collection.  The hardcore fans that followed the show areound the tv schedule were owed this glorious compilation of the first two seasons.  My only complaint is that the theme song gets old after a while, but hey small price to pay for the comedic genius that this show delivers.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3G3DN6ODH3RXR	Graham V. Foy	"Here's the honest truth, America: ""Family Guy"" is the one show that tops ""The Simpsons"". Honestly, can you IMAGINE what this show could have been if it had been allowed to continue? Unfortunately, it was just too witty, satirical and shocking for the American palate.Now, here is why I think ""Family Guy"" deserves to be ranked among the best shows ever. What ""Family Guy"" really is is a facade of outrageous humor that masks a secret agenda: to show our American life for what it really is. The absurd situations in which Peter consistently finds himself are indicative not of a crazy made-up world, but our America and our way of life. You'll notice that while the adventures of the Simpsons unfold in the Springfield of a state that is never revealed, the very first episode of ""Family Guy"" informs us that the Griffins make their home in Rhode Island, though the name of the town itself is fictional. I believe that this points to an undeniable ""realness"" of the show as a whole: the characters do human things, and more importantly they exhibit characteristics (and problems) of the real modern world. Peter is dense and absorbed by TV, Meg is run-down by the pressures of being a girl (she has a friend who encourages her to throw up to get thin), Lois is underappreciated by her family, Brian is a recurrent problem drinker, and Chris is a typically overweight adolescent who leaves the house every day ""to go get wasted"". Those are just the main characters! However, to really appreciate this show and its VERY well-written storylines, you'll just have to watch it. I guarantee you you'll be shocked, surprised and, if you have even the slightest predisposition towards laughter, on the floor before the end of the first episode. All hail ""Family Guy"", the best show of all time!"	5.0	BETTER THAN THE SIMPSONS!	2003-03-29	44	31	13
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1DFQCYOKQ64CU	grandmamamama	Although I was never much of a fan of The Empire Strikes back, this parody changed that probably permanently.  From the time it started till the finish I was laughing all the way through it.  A Few of the scenes became obnoxious and made me wonder why they placed it in there for such an extended period of time, but overall a great addition to the Family Guy Star Wars trilogy.  Too bad it ends on such a sour note with It's A Trap (That DVD Sucked!)  But that is just my opinion.	5.0	As good as Blue Harvest -- Maybe better.	2010-12-16	1	0	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2E6FBL4CT7JVD	G. Rascati	I have not yet bought this DVD, but I have seen a whole bunch of the episodes.  Just like The Simpsons and South Park, two of the funniest shows ever, it has funny characters and hillarious plots. Seth McFaine can make any situation seem funny, and unlike The Simpsons and South Park, every scene in the episode has something hillarious.  I think this is one of the best shows Fox has aired and since they took it off Fox, I am now watching it every night on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.The characters are just one reason that this cartoon is one of the best out there.  There is Peter Griffin, the beefy, borderline alchoholic, dumb father and husband,  Meg Griffin, the drama queen daughter of Peter, who seems like Peter's least favorite of them all, Chris, the second image of Peter,  Stewie, the talking, evil, baby genious who wants to enslave the human race and kill Peter's wife, Lois, who is the most normal of the Griffin family.  And we can not forget Brian, the articulate talking dog.This show is one of my favorites, and one of the most random comedy shows of them all. (That's what makes it so funny)  Let me just tell you one thing, if you know how to laugh, you'll love this show.	5.0	Better than any other comedy cartoon	2003-09-10	8	7	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1X15AQVSCKKRG	GreatMovieCriticForever	"Wow, this movie was great, finally something that livesup to its franchise (not Crow series),but Family Guy series.This movie was so funny that I died laughing!!!!Really, so many laughs, so many highlights,Fox finally has churned out a good one for theloyal  fans of the tv shows.The basic plot, is that is Stewie Griffin,is doing his usual devious deeds as an infant, whilePeter Griffin lands a job with those wisecrackingpolitically incorrect reporters Tommy Tucker and DianeSimmons. Tucker is a lot like Ferrel's character of""Anchorman"", hes a male chauvonist pig. Of coursethese character provide insight and jokes into thecorrupt mass media world where people will doanything for a story. Continuing on, Stewie, findshis life unfilled despite his evil history untilhe sees someone that looks like his father, orsomeone just like him. He then becomes obsessedwith finding him.One of the highlights and there are plenty are acouple of steroid jokes, more jokes poked at themass media, Tom, Peter's reporter rival, Stewie andBrian (The Talking Dog) getting drunk and arrestedand much more Seen Stewie do his usual gags and gettingdrunk was a riot.Of course, there are thousand more jokes, which I cantlist  them all but what I can say with an honest faceis that this film really does justice to us Family Guy fans.Any fans of the series need to watch this, and you willprobably watch this several times  because it is that damn good.Shows like Family Guy dont dummy anything down, theyexpose the  problems of America, abuse of power,conservative corrupt media all through the magical powerof comedy and satire.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1816I5GESTEPZ	G. Ross	"I have just finished watching the dvd. Let's get some things out of the way. First, this is not on Fox, but on an unrated dvd. What that means is that this is not for kids. There is a lot, and I mean a lot, of sexual innuendo, and the F word pops up more than once. I'd recommend this for kids at least 13-14 and up, but not suitable for young children. Second, this is not even close to as good as the first Star Wars parody, Blue Harvest. I bought this for $10, and seeing as how Blockbuster charges $5 for a rental, you're best off renting, not buying, unless you plan on watching this multiple times. On to the review of the plot. Seth has done his homework again. The menus closely resemble the actual Star Wars dvd menus, and obviously, the storyline closely follows the plot of Empire. However, condensing the 2 hour Empire, down into 54 minutes, some things get cut. Nothing too important, such as some of Luke/Chris's training on Dagobah, stuff like that. It begins just like the first, w/a powerfailure, and Peter telling the story. Seth makes sure to point out various plot holes, like all the electrical cables running thru the ice planet of Hoth, and how the rebels, with the vastness of space to chose from, flee Hoth right towards the Empire's blockade. The jokes come fast, and random, just like the episodes on tv. Some are hilarious, and others just stupid, such as the ""banged shin gag"" familiar to fans, befalling an Imperial Walker, or that a Walker is pregnant. There is a stupid musical number that did not work. There are great cameos tho, such as James Woods, and James Caan. Meg pops up briefly again, and has something to say about that. Nothing beats Chevy Chase's cameo from the first film tho. True to Star Wars tradition, Seth throws in a Wilhelm scream(Google it if you don't know). Consuela, the maid who recently gave the Griffins a hard time, shows up to give Stewie/Darth Vader the what-for. I enjoyed the Dagobah training montage, which incorporated actual footage from Rocky IV, although I did not like Yoda. He was dry, and boring, and didn't attempt to imitate the actual Yoda at all. The Evil Monkey is there as a Minok, and look for a great appearance by Joe early on as an Imperial Probe Droid. The Bounty Hunter scene aboard Vader's ship had me rolling on the floor, and look for the Giant Chicken as Boba Fett. Unfortunately, TGC was just sort of there, he didn't actually do anything. Of course, neither did Boba Fett in Empire, but this is a parody right? The ending was pretty good, incorporating the messenger from Back to the Future II. Then, cut back to Spooner St. so that Peter can take another dig at Robot Chicken, just like in Harvest. So, that's it. It's not as good as the first, but worth watching at least once, especially if you're a fan. As for the extras, you have the ability to watch the entire thing w/a commentary from Seth Mcfarlane, Seth Green, and a few others. I usu don't bother as you can't hear the dialogue. They disclosed a few interesting facts, but for the most part, they were just talking randomly. There's also a ""pop-up video"" version, ala VH1. That was pretty funny. There's a 10minute Poster Art short that was both informative, explaining how the artwork for the parody came to be, and disturbing, featuring the artists frequently removing their shirts, and trying to parody Blair Witch. Umm, right. Either way, 10 minutes is too long for this. There is a 50minute ""table read"" of the parody, where you watch all the voice actors sitting at a table, and reading the script. I watched a bit. It's interesting to see the actual people as they do the various voices, but beyond that, I can't see why you'd want to spend 50minutes watching that. There is also a 2 minute read from the upcoming parody, We have a Bad Feeling About This. It takes place in Jabba's palace when Han gets freed from the carbonite(in Darkside, it's not his face that shows. Let's just say the full moon is gonna be out at Jabba's palace. Nice.) Mostly, these table reads exposed the actors finding their lines a lot funnier than I did, and laughing constantly at stuff that just didn't seem that funny. Oh well, bring on the next parody!"	4.0	Probably best rented, not bought	2009-12-22	6	4	2

Stewie Griffin is the little baby bent on world domination, and also killing his mother Lois. This movie will have you laughing from start to finish. It doesn't have anything censored (but there is an option to) so parents don't need to fret too much. However, Stewie does get drunk in the movie, among other things, so this movie would not be for the younger generation.This is one of my favorite movies and definitely the best out of all the family guy series. This is funny and has teh same flavor as the tv series.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2C4PVXPLPQSL8	he-guy	Let me start off by saying Family Guy's take on Episode IV was hilarious - one the best Star Wars parodies out there. So how does Seth MacFarlane fare with ESB... not as good IMO. Expectations were high as many fans consider Empire to be the best film of the saga - but this spoof suffers from too many Family Guyisms, and not enough Star Wars. The lack of familiar Family Guy cut-aways is one aspect of why Blue Harvest's story kept moving along. (Only the one scene with Watto was out of place) Many modern product endorsement spoofs kept taking you out of the movie - as well as the drawn out AT-AT injury and Tauntaun scenes.Another thing that bothered me is the adult language. The original debuted on Fox, then later came to DVD. This time around, its the uncensored version we get to see first, and some of the cursing just seemed over the top. Not that Family Guy is a kid's show by any means, but Star Wars is for all ages to enjoy.One last gripe, is the Region 1 availability of the Deluxe set with Boba Fett t-shirt. I certainly was ready to throw Fox a few extra dollars via Amazon by getting the best version, but am unsure if it was released in the US.Overall, the show was very good, by spoofing many aspects of a film saga that our household has seen time and time again. While the negatives in this review keep me from giving it 5 stars, I will be watching this again, and eagerly awaiting a ROTJ spoof in the future.	4.0	Not Quite Blue Harvest...	2009-12-20	7	2	5

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A457S8SW690NM	hi	"Most of the people posting negative reviews for this hilarious show are kids. They are using their kid's review form. I guess that little kids are too young to comprehend most of the jokes on Family Guy. I'm going on 15 but I understand all of them and this show is by far the funniest ever. Family guy was most definitely influenced by the simpsons but it's now WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the simpson. Peter ressembles Homer, and Lois ressembles Marge. But Chris is a lot more awesome than Bart with the evil monkey in his closet and his jokes. ""THEY GIVE YOU 4 QUARTERS FOR 1 DOLLAR!!!!"" Meg is hilarious with her weird hat and she beats lisa barely. But, then who's better, Stewie or Maggie? I menan come on, Maggie doesn't even talk! Stewie is absolutely hilarious with his catch phrases (Dam*!)and no one even realizes that he is a genius. He wants to kill Lois and has picture books of him trying to kill her (a la psycho shower scene, poison drink, etc..) and Brian is a billion times better than santa's little helper. He goes to a psychiatrist, no one seems to realize that he can talk, he smokes and is always drunk! You just got to love him. And even though the simpsons has a lot more characters, Family guy has better ones like the sex pervert Quagmeyer, Cleveland, Joe, Tom Tucker, Trisha Tackinawa, etc..While the Simpsons just seems to the most of time just tell an interesting story, Family Guy tells an interesting but hilarious story. Family Guy makes me laugh, and that's something that I like doing. But, I have to admit that sometimes it does go over the top, and when it does, I feel that it's innapropriate. Nevertheless, it's usually hilarious with only certain parts that are over the top. But, if parents are worried for their young children about watching this show, I do admit that it's probably better for 13 year olds and so forth due to some unnecessary over the top stuff that comes along every once in a while. It still is my favorite TV show because I'm a guy that prefers watching a show that makes me laugh every week and not be nervous that there might be a robber in my house. But that's just me. I love you Seth McFarlane, keep up the awesome episodes! Can't wait for the movie! September 27th, I'll be there!"	5.0	BEST TV SHOW EVER	2005-06-22	3	3	0

It's a cartoon sitcom like no other, hitting on politics and all different aspects of society and keeping it extremely funny and entertaining. For all those who enjoy the show, you know what's up. Well, there's not much to say other then that if you like the show, this is essential. It is exactly what it says, the first two seasons, some of the funniest episodes ever. On top of that it's packed with special features and more than enough to keep you Family Guy fans entertained for hours and hours. This set is well worth the price and I don't have any complaints, great sound, great picture, and just all around great quality. You're missing out if you don't get this, and that's the bottom line. I'm lookin' forward to completing the collection when Season 3 comes out in a few months. I give a big thumbs up to all that made this DVD happen because it was needed in my view and the idea of the set was executed perfectly.	5.0	A Must Buy	2003-05-28	7	6	1

Back then, I couldn't believe that a show could possibly be this hilarious. Nevertheless, I still feel the same way. Family Guy's humor is very random and off-the-wall, so I don't expect everyone to like it, but saying that you hate this show because it's a &quot;Simpsons rip-off&quot; is completely stupid. First off, Family Guy is funnier than Simpsons could ever be. And secondly, Family Guy only has one or two similarities to The Simpsons, so I'd hardly call it a ripoff. Don't listen to those ignorant idiots who claim stuff like that.In conclusion, this is the funniest DVD collection ever. Highly recommended.	5.0	The funniest show ever made.	2004-01-03	2	1	1

I remember when Family Guy first debuted on TV thinking that the idea of a talking baby was ridiculous so I never bothered to watch the program.  Then one day I was on YouTube looking at videos and saw a hilarious clip of Family Guy featuring Stewie.  I started watching the program after that and was completely hooked after a couple of episodes.  I own all the volumes of this show and look at them often laughing hysterically.  I would love to choose my favorite characters but that would be impossible since they are all so funny.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1865MB0KN26D6	"Jack Dantes ""John G"""	"This DVD set of the first two seasons is absolutely hilarious. Every episode is a ten with the exception of a few, which are 8 and 9s (on a scale of 10).This show is for people who enjoy random and edgy comedy that makes fun pop culture. All the characters are funny in their own way, Chris the son is probably the least likable, but he has occasional one liners. You can't really compare the show to The Simpson's, they're just different shows. The ambiance of each is so different that they're incomparable. I mean they have a talking dog in this show, common!Usually, babies talking as grownups don't work, but in this show, Stewie is hilarious. The writers have done a wonderful job of showing the world through baby's eyes and made him multidimensional by making him a matricidal anarchist. He has some classic lines in the show that are absolutely memorable. He is the most articulate person/baby on TV (I'm aware of Frasier).""It seems with death incapacitated my matricidal efforts are futile.""""Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but you're a total bitch.""Lois: ""Oh, I haven't been on a college campus in years. Everything seems so different.""Stewie: ""Really? Perhaps if you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears that would ring a few bells.""Seth McFarland, who does most of the voices on the show is a true genius. You can hear him on the commentary on some of the episodes, he is probably one of the funniest people you'll ever hear commenting.It is just a refreshing break from normal TV, and I think that is why it is so successful, because it's one of a kind.

This is BY FAR one of the funniest animation shows ever put on tv - with so many pop culture references, sight gags, plays on words, and spoofs, it appeals to every level or humor from slapstick to brainiac.Peter and Lois Griffin head a family (unhygienic son Chris, social-misfit daughter Meg, plotting-to-take-over-the-world-after-he-kills-his-mother baby boy Stewie, and their pet -- a talking dog named Brian who's also an intellectual alcoholic) that is as dysfunctional as it comes.  They live in Quahog, Rhode Island, and seem to often know they are a sitcom family, even if the situations they get into are usually more outrageous than most.This show is for adults, make no mistake - the humor often borders on raunchy - but in watching this show there were times I would laugh so hard I thought I was going to lose bladder control; it is THAT funny.Fox may have been stupid in not giving ""Family Guy"" what it deserved while on the air - but my VHS tapes of it that I recorded while the show was on are so worn out with overuse, GOD BLESS FOX for releasing this on DVD -- and not soon enough!!If you haven't seen ""Family Guy,"" at least rent them when they are released - you will become hooked on this show right away, and wonder (like the rest of us) why Fox didn't treat it better --or fight harder to keep it on the air."	5.0	Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus!!	2003-02-03	2	2	0

Peter Griffin is a hero among all of my friends and myself and he is so irrelevant and dumb that his comments at times almost sound smart. His adoring wife Lois is incredibly tolerant of Peter's stupidity and controlling way of life. Peter and Lois' children, Meg, Chris and Stewie are incredibly entertaining. My personal favorite is the World Domination bent Stewie. He is hilarious and is always trying to come up with new tactics to kill Lois. This show ROCKS.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1JV3OZZVLHW85	Jaime Rafael Vazquez	"Let me start my review off wih some good news:  Seth MacFarlane revealed in an interview with Cinescape.com that he is hashing out a budget with FOX to create more Family Guy episodes (on tv or dvd, I don't know) and a feature length movie (direct-to-dvd).  The projects should take bewteen a year and a year and a half.  Now before I decided to write my review on this great show I decided to read the 1 and 2 star reviews (at this time a combined 12) and the 4 and 5 star reviews (at this time a combined 311, mine not included) and alot of the 1 and 2's had kept saying that this show is just a blatant rip off of The Simpsons.  Well I'm sorry to tell you this 1 and 2's but it's not.  Family Guy is better.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, I remember watching their first episodes when they were airing on Thursdays I believe.  But after about 13 years the show can get a little stale.  This will eventually happen to King of the Hill, Futurama and of course Family Guy.  But since Family Guy is the new baby in the house maybe it's about time for the Simpsons to bow out gracfully and pass down the torch.  Now alot of the 1 and 2's said that the members of both families were exactly the same but this is not true.  And I'll prove it to you by playing Simpsons vs. Griffins.  I will take the same member of each family (mom vs. mom, dad vs. dad) and I will compare them.  We start off with Homer vs. Peter: Same height, same colored hair (if Homer still had his) but Peter is fatter.  Now one worked at a toy company making sure they were safe to play with.  The other works as a safty inspector at a power plant.  Different jobs, same responibility.  But while Homer learns from his mistakes, alot of the time Peter learns nothing, like in the episode ""He's too sexy for his fat"".  But in the end: Homer and Peter might have been long lost brothers.  Marge vs. Lois: Lois is around 5'2"", Marge is around 7'5""-8' (with hair).  Both are house wives.  One became a flight attendent for a while and ones father was a flight attendent.  Lois was born rich, Marge was born just below middle class.  Marge and Homer like to do it in public.  Lois and Peter do it with whips, chains, leather, and Peter dressing up like the Gimp in Pulp Fiction.  In the end: Both are kinky and at times can be as bad as there husbands.  Now when it comes to the parents it's almost identical but the kids aren't alright.  Take Bart vs. Chris:  Both have blond hair, but that's all.  Bart is a little chunky, Chris is just fat.  Bart is a smooth talker that can get himself out of almost any problem.  Chris is kind of an idiot and might be ""special"".  Bart rides a skateboard. Chris can barely walk staight.  Bart fears almost nothing.  Chris is afraid of the evil monkey in his closest.  Sorry but in the end:  They maybe two Jacks but their of a differnt suit.  NO MATCH.  Lisa vs. Meg:  Lisa and Meg are both whiners but Lisa whines about social issues, Meg whines about her social life and not having the things her friends have.  Lisa is basicly an intellectual loner that doesn't really care what others think about her, all Meg ever cares about is what poeple think about her.  In the end:  One is a political and environmental activist, the other is just a brat (of course to some people that's two of the same thing).  NO MATCH.  Maggie vs. Stewie:  You can't get more opposite then this.  Both are the same age but most of the time Maggie acts her age.  Stewie acts like a gay, british Lex Luther hell-bent on taking over the world and getting rid of his mother once and for all.  Maggie loves her mommy and her bo-bo (pacifier).  Stewie talks eloquently and creates weapons and devices for world domination.  Maggie creates drool and the only word I ever heard her say was daddy.  In the end: they may be a pair quarters, but ones facing heads and the others facing tails.  NO MATCH.  When I said you couldn't get more opposite then Maggie vs. Stewie I was wrong beacuse I forgot about Santas Little Helper vs. Brian:  S.L.H. eats dog food, drinks water out of his bowl, barks when he wants too and is basicly a stupid dog (stupid as in not smart not stupid as in he sucks).  Brian eats whatever the Griffins are having for dinner while sitting at the dinner table.  He drinks martinis, gin and tonics, jack and cokes, and other forms of alcohol.  He speaks, not like when you ask a dog to speak but he talks like a person (english and bad spanish).  He is almost always out-smarting Stewie so he is very intelligent.  In the end:  Sorry but S.L.H. isn't fit to be near Brians martini glass.  NO MATCH.  The neighbors are different as well.  The Simpsons have Flanders (extremely religous guy), Reverend Lovejoy (not as religous as Flanders) and an old couple.  The Griffins have Cleavland (smart black guy), Joe (suped-up cop in a wheelchair) and Quagmire (sex-crazed weirdo).  On the political side you have Mayor Quimby and Mayor Adam West (yes, Batman).  One is an embezzler (never proven of course) and the other is insane (proven everytime you see him).  Some people say that Family Guy is sexist, racist, misogynistic and a little bit anti-semitic but that's what makes it funny.  Its political incorrectness is what gives it its edge.

For the easily offended or for those who think political correctness is a virtue this show is a nightmare.BUT....For the rest of us, for those who value a tear inducing belly laugh over the tender feelings of others, it's hard to find a funnier show.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2XZMO6OAZ9YXG	Jamie	Although I don't think the show was better than the older episodes of the Simpsons, I do think that during the time it was on the air it was better than the Simpsons. The show is really fond to pop-culture junkies or just people in need of a good laugh. Unfortunatly, FOX cancelled it and it's not coming back. To all of you angry fans that hate FOX for cancelling it, don't. It wasn't FOX's fault. The show stopped because the cast and crew split up. Luckily (in my opinion) South Park has been getting funnier. But still I'm thankful that the FOX production companies are immortalizing this classic series on DVD.The thing I like most about Family Guy is the range of inteligence that it appeals to. Whether your a know-it-all super genious with high standards or a complete moron the show is sure to please because it's funny on so many levels.For fans of the show this is a must buy. For newbies, find a friend who is a fan of the show.

I don't know if it's because it's based off The Empire Strikes Back which I feel like is the worst of the trilogy, or is it because it feels like every joke has been done before. This felt like a Seth MacFarlane's version of Star Wars rather then a spoof. Unlike Blue Harvest, This one sticks closely to the plot of the Empire Strikes Back only throwing in a few already seen Family Guy jokes. Blue Harvest kept to the plot but also ventured outside the Star Wars theme to make some jokes(steeling couch from the trash, Robots getting high, etc.) This one tried, but didn't strike any home runs in my opinion. I'm not saying skip this movie, because I'm glad I watched it, but just don't expect too much. This movie was pretty predictable. I'm sure I could predict the next Family Guy movie mocking Return of the Jedi. If I had to guess, Meg would portray Jabba the Hutt. The sand trap that they try to throw Luke Skywalker into would have the voice of the ""hey ya'll"" gay guy saying something like ""Hey ya'll, I'm going to eat your hairy little leg."" And Ewoks might resemble Jessie the old dog belonging to Herbert the pervert.

It combines elements from ""The Simpsons"", ""The Critic"", and ""South Park"" into an incredibly funny, sadistic show about a family in Rhode Island.  Parts of it border on the absurd, such as the evil monkey that lives in Chris' room.  Other parts leave you going ""I can't believe they did that!"", such as the Hitler jokes in a few episodes.This set includes all 28 episodes from the first two seasons, some of which have commentary, which really doesn't add much, since those doing the commentary are busy watching the show.

However, now that it runs on Comedy Central at night I have changed my mind. This show has/had no chance of reaching the pinncle like the Simpsons but its almost obscene comedy is without a doubt funny. Though most of the characters are pretty one dimensional, they all work together sort of playing off of each other to make the show entertaining. Personally, the only character in the show that i actually like is Stewie, the maniacal baby bent on world-domination or maybe just the death of his mother.Either way, if you enjoy shows like South Park this is worth your money.	5.0	hilarious	2004-07-30	2	1	1

I sat through the entire first two seasons on this DVD and kicked myself for not doing it earlier! I laughed so hard all throughout the entire DVD set! Seth MacFarlane has some of the best vocal talents in the entire industry, and has broken at least a few records with his young age. Amazing what he can do to bring so many different characters to life in such a profound way. The DVD set could have been a little more dressed up in the way of extras and quality, but just having this piece of cinematic history to be enjoyed forever is something to make us all smile about.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AC99RKT3OW7CO	Jeff Crosley	"It's so very rare that we find a ""comedy"" on TV that sets out to make us laugh and actually acomplishes that.  It's even more difficult for a cartoon, due to the absence of a laugh track.  Of the five major and semi-major cartoon comedies (The Simpsons, Futurama, King of the Hill, South Park, Family Guy), I find Family Guy to be by and large the best.  Peter Griffin is essentially a synthesis of Hank Hill, Homer Simpson, Eric Carman, and Bender, and is funnier than any of them.Here, in all of their glory, are the first two seasons.  From the very first joke the show ever did (which was a Brady Bunch parody followed by a pun involving Aunt Jemimah) to ""Brian: Portrait of a Dog"", every episode is priceless.Family Guy is funny because it's so brazenly irreverent.  The show tosses political correctness out the window (which Fox was upset about regarding ""When you Wish upon a Weinstein"", which can be seen in the second DVD set later this year), taking jabs at pretty much everyone and everything.  The cutaways and quick flashbacks are the show's trademark, and they are usually funnier than the main action.  The show is also a brilliant mix of universally funny jokes to pop culture jokes of yesteryear.  Seth MacFarlane said that the show uses older culture references because if the jokes are funny now when the subjects are dated, they'll be funny twenty years from now.  This is why Family Guy never did a Titanic or Matrix parody.  You can judge a persons relative cultural awareness by how many Family Guy jokes he or she gets.  I have two favorite examples of this.  The first (I forget which episode, it may even be in the third season) is when Peter says ""While I may not agree with what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it.""  This is a quote from Voltaire, an eighteenth century French satirist and writer.  Very few people got that joke, but for those who did, it was very funny indeed.  My other favorite culture joke is in the episode ""Brian in Love"".  Brian is driving down a country road when he hits a man.  He stops the car, runs back to the man, and goes ""Oh my God, are you Stephen King?""  ""No,"" the man replies.  ""I'm Dean Koontz.""  ""Oh,"" says Brian.  Brian then proceeds back to his car and backs it over Dean Koontz.  It has to be seen to be appreciated, but I thought I would die laughing when that happened.  In order to get that joke, a person has to be familiar with the writings of both Stephen King and Dean Koontz, which is, again, appealing to a limited audience.Every single character from Peter and his family to the neighbors to Tom and Diane, the newscasters, to Mr. Weed to Death (who has made three appearances on the show at various times), every character is well defined and funny in their own special way.  Peter has his stupidity, Stewey has his evil genius coupled with his age, Lois has her standard housewife attitude coupled with her rarely seen sensual side, Meg has her insecurity, Chris has his immaturity and childishness, Brian has his intellect coupled with his alchohol problem, Joe has his wheelchair and macho personality, Cleveland has his race and droll speech patterns, Quagmire has his perversions, and Tom and Diane have the irony of their typically outrageous reporting coupled with their droll and deadpan delivery.Is it as influential as the Simpsons?  Deffinetly not.  Is it funnier?  Deffinetly so, especially when compared to the last few seasons (The Simpsons really is running out of steam).  By the way, don't listen to the nay-sayers who claim it was taken off the air because no one liked it.  Just look at these reviews for proof that that isn't true.  It was taken off the air because it kept switching schedules, and even the hardcore fans had difficulty keeping up with the various changes.  Remember, the show was cancelled after two seasons, but enough people wrote to Fox that they signed MacFarlane on for another season.  The outcry for a third season was unprecedented.  There is a place for this show in television history, and I hope that it lives on in these DVDs that others may hear that wonderful title theme: ""It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV, but where are those good old fashioned values on which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a Family Guy.  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry.  He's a Family Guy."""	5.0	I'll take Peter over Homer any day.	2003-07-08	5	5	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1ZX5QUFIETLQD	Jeff in Madtown	I like Family Guy, and I like the Star Wars series.  I really enjoyed Blue Thunder, and I hoped that this episode would be at least moderately entertaining.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  Sequels tend to take the two or three most entertaining ideas from the original and then run them into the ground.  Judging by that philosophy, the best parts of Blue Thunder must have been profanity, gay jokes, and Consuela the maid.  This was a dark episode in Star Wars, so it would be more challenging to make a humorous spoof, but this one sure missed the mark.

This is less a parody and more like a remake of Empire Strikes Back with a Family Guy comedic twist. Shot for shot, there's no deviation from the plot of the original. There are a lot of callback jokes and recycled jokes and they didn't feel funny, but the Family Guy mold is to be completely random and catch you off guard. It made me think... wow I remember when that joke was funny when they first did it 10 years ago. There are still laugh out loud funny moments in this movie. Its better than the Blue Harvest movie, but does it really justify its own DVD? Pick up the boxed set of all 3 Star Wars remakes for $10 more or wait until Fox plays it.

Now that that is out of the way, on to the show.  As a huge star wars and family guy fan, I was really looking forward to this.  It was okay.  Not as good as I expected, but decent.  I know what to expect from Family Guy, but I really wish that they would have toned down the profanity and sexual references in the Star Wars episodes.  My son is 12 and likes to watch family guy.  I let him watch it only when supervised and there were a few times when I felt uncomfortable watching this with him.  I'm really shocked that George Lucas allowed it.  I found the profanity and sexual references, for the most part, to be unnecessary and unfunny and felt like they were thrown in just to shock.  Other than that, it was a decent show.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A22LJBZFVD5O1N	Jeremy Raymondjack	"I have found, in general, that the reincarnation of Family Guy this year is somewhat less funny than the pre-cancellation shows from a few years ago.  While the new shows certainly have some unbelievably funny moments (Peter in a ""Dueling Banjos"" farting contest with Michael Moore comes to mind), I feel that they lack much of the subtlety and smartness of the earlier episodes.  And I also have found that the violence portrayed against women is significantly higher in these new shows, often uncomfortably so.This direct-to-DVD release continues that pattern.  The first time through, I wasn't too impressed.  The second time through was a little better.  But none of the newer material comes close to the brilliance of ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,"" or ""To Love and Die in Dixie"" (the owl knocking over the outhouse with Peter inside is the single funniest Family Guy moment, in my estimation).But still, everyone even remotely interested in Family Guy should and probably will buy this.

The jokes are riskier than those of the television show, the story goes a little more in depth, and it is just a longer version of what Family Guy fans enjoy already on television.  If you are a fan of Family Guy, then you definitely owe it to yourself to purchase this film and watch it.**Words of caution:  Before watching this movie, make sure you select the ""uncensored"" option from the setup menu provided on the DVD.  If you don't do this, then you will get bleeps throughout the movie at particular points."	5.0	Uncensored, ninety-minutes long, and commercial-free Family Guy at its best.	2006-06-24	2	2	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2DN8YLYC5CG13	"Jeremy Zimmerman ""Booj"""	I admit I do like this trilogy, though it falls far from what Family Guy used to be. Sadly Family Guy has lost its spark during it's long life as a series, but this stab at one of the greatest trilogies of all time allows for a small giggle from time to time. While it's not a gut-buster, I would say at least check it out. It's not the greatest thing I've seen... not even close... but I have indeed seen worse, so I wouldn't just toss it aside.	3.0	Amusing, though a bit silly	2011-04-06	3	1	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3DAKF6PIRWS74	"Jesse C. ""glacialerratic"""	purchasing this dvd box set was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Even as I sat in front of my laptop watching episode after hilarious episode, I could faintly hear the sound of all my ambitions and dreams come tumbling down around me. Within fifty-two hours of the fateful package from Amazon.com arriving in my university mailbox, I had watched all 28 episodes at least once, the eight with commentary twice (once without, once with) and all the special features. that's roughly 14 hours, or ten hours more than I ended up sleeping during that period. If you have anything important to do, I urge you, do not buy this product.  However, if you love non-sequiteur, surrealist comedy and you won't be too saddened by, say, flunking genetics, buy this box set.

My best friend bought it and we just watched it for the first time today.  We immediately had the same reaction after it was over.  It was ok and funny in parts but disappointing.  A lot of the gags weren't funny and there were so many things that could have been a lot funnier.  Glad I watched my friend's copy because I'm not going to waste the money to buy this now.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A11ZD62OTPN5XC	J. Grabowski	Obviously by now if you haven't heard about Family Guy you have been living in a cave. And like it or not, the briefly underground cult hit has risen from its ashes like the mighty phoenix to find its popularity surging.Like most modern animated shows of its type (The Simpsons, Futurama, etc...), you either love it, hate it, or are a devoted fan of a select few seasons. I would very easily fall into the first category (chalk that up to living in New England, or growing up wathcing most of the shows FG references) ever since watching the first episode way back in 1999 after the Super Bowl.The show relies more on a string of very random jokes and obscure refrences than it does profound, moving, or even compelling stories. But, then again if you really are looking for politically correct, high-brow comedy with complex characters or intellectual stories and situations you can relate to why would you look to an animated show with a talking dog or a 1-year-old who is trying to take over the world. When I sit down to watch Family Guy, I know what I am going to experience; a lot of random flashbacks and randomly cutting to things not even remotely related to the show and over-the-top wacky characters and their wacky adventures. And if you didn't catch my emphasis there, the show is WACKY and RANDOM.(The family visiting Peter in the hospital after experiencing a horrible trauma caused by his own vanity and selfishness):Lois - Well Peter, I guess you learned a pretty valuable lessonPeter - Nope!If you want something to throw in the DVD player and not expend too much mental energy, if you just want to sit back and laugh until your sides hurt, buy this. Most people I know (and by the looks of most of the reviews here, others that have purchased this) have not regretted the investment in Family Guy on DVD.	5.0	And by the end of the first episode I was hooked	2005-10-15	3	3	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A15TGJVTMNH0MW	"J. Moon ""terrapinjer03"""	Think of the dry cool wit of the Simpsons, combined with the provacative humor of All in the Family, and I think you'll have a pretty good idea of Family Guy. There are parts where you'll laugh out loud and immediately feel guilty about laughing at the joke. Stewie is by far the utlimate evil genius and closet drag queen, always foiled by Lois, his mother. Brian, the talking dog, seems to provide balance, despite being an alcoholic and recovering cocaine addict. Then of course there is Peter, the dad, who is your stereotypical stupid father and would be strongly compared to Homer Simpson on his worst days.This is perhaps the funniest two and a half seasons of a show that has ever been. However, with this collection you only get the first and second seasons. Adam West as the mayor is a great touch too. I think you can tell that I'm a huge fan, since this review is all over the place. Before you sit down and purchase this, it might be a good idea to check out the Family Guy on television, I believe it's on one of the Cartoon channels at night sometime. The show isn't for everyone, and some people might be a bit offended by the humor.	5.0	Dark humor, hope this helps.	2004-03-25	2	2	0

Meg (poor thing) is the monster in the worm hole of the meteor and the monster in the garbage dump on the Death Star, which is somehow hilarious.  You need to know some background (having viewed) on the Star Wars theme, and be familiar with Family Guy humor.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	"Often one will hear the phrase tossed about that a show was ""too edgy"" for TV.  Usually, this is just apologia for a poorly conceived product, but in the case of ""Family Guy"" it is absolutely true.  This is a show that was every bit as radical as ""South Park"" but in a much more sophisticated, droll manner.  The odd thing is that at the same time it's skewering every sacred cow imaginable (more on that latter) with brilliantly satirical writing, it was also producing some of the most hysterical physical (for lack of a better phrase for a cartoon) comedy I have ever seen on any show.Much like ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" revolves around one family, in this case the Griffins.  That's pretty much where the similarities end though.  Whereas the Simpsons interact with a huge cast of characters, and will frequently tackle an overarching theme, ""Family Guy"" involves a cast that is largely replaced from episode to episode (other than a few neighbors) and manages to turn utterly inane pop-culture references and mundane household events into major plot points.  A particularly good example of this would be when Peter (the father) has his choice for the town parade theme selected; the fact that his theme revolves around an obscure reference to the `80's TV show ""Who's the Boss?"" barely even registers as odd within the context of the show.Also, whereas ""The Simpsons"" operate within the context of a `world' that is relatively similar to our own, the Griffins have a talking, booze-swilling dog and a psychotic, super-genius baby bent on killing his mother.  Furthermore, there are constant flashbacks, pop-culture references and super-natural visitors (Death appears in several episodes).All those details aside, what makes this show so brilliant is that it's willing to tackle any subject.  Bathroom humor?  Done.  Abortion?  Done.  Politics, the handicapped and sex?  Done, done and done.  There is absolutely nothing ""Family Guy"" won't tackle, and it does so in such a pragmatic way that one can't help but laugh.  I suppose if you're really sensitive, this isn't a series for you, but since everyone and everything is a target, it's hard to get too upset (especially since you'll be too busy laughing yourself sick).In the end, ""Family Guy"" is the perfect blend of satire, physical comedy, pop-culture send-ups and excellent animation.  It is a genuinely raw show that on more than one occasion left me thinking, ""Can they say that?"" and that's probably why it's not on the air anymore.  But it's also hysterically funny, and well packaged on the DVD's in this set.  While the extra's are nothing to get worked up about, the episodes alone are more than funny enough to justify the purchase.Enjoy!Jake Mohlman"	5.0	Insanely funny!	2003-05-07	5	4	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Joanna Daneman	"This cartoon was SO good it was cancelled. It was even funnier than the Simpsons (and I am a long-time fan) and funnier even than ""South Park"", which had me gasping for air and flailing helplessly the first time I saw it.No, ""Family Guy"" is, in my opinion, the funniest cartoon TV show for adults ever. The Rhode Island setting doesn't hurt either, for this former New England resident. (Rhode Island is as naturally funny to New Englanders as words starting with ""K"". See ""Me, Myself and Irene"" or the cartoons of Don Bousquet if you want to know why Rhode Island is funny.)What's so funny about ""Family Guy?"" It's hard to list the best points because it is all so good, but really, the high point for me are the escapades of Stewie, the infant-terrible with the football-shaped head. He is cleverly done--the writers seem to have read Freud and other psychological theorists who believe that babies have both a megalomania complex and at the same time, fear their mothers as some kind of dreadful, all-powerful but necessary being who cruelly controls their happiness and even survival. Stewie's conniving to rule the world and dispatch his despised mom are hysterical.Not that Peter, head Family Guy, Brian the Brown-educated, dipsomaniac pet dog, and Lois and her dysfunctional kids aren't funny, too. They are. Sometimes it is so funny, I can't even laugh--just have to gasp with astonishment. If we are feeling low or bored, we put these on. In fact, we save them for special occasions as they are so good they are a real treat."	5.0	Better than South Park! Well, ok, as good as!	2003-01-23	2	2	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A11WPE30KZ2NG8	"Joe P. ""Root Beer Enthusiast"""	I had already owned the first two movies on DVD. But when i saw this set for only 22.99 here on Amazon on Blu Ray, I thought that the deal was too good too pass up. Based on the Amazon description, I wasn't expecting much. Just the BDs and the Bonus features listed which were for the new film. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when i got this today! Every film includes a digital copy, something not listed by Amazon in the description. In addition, it looks like all the bonus features from the past releases are still there, something that was also not listed by Amazon when I purchased. All this, 3 great BD titles plus digital copies plus tons of bonus stuff..... all for under 8 dollars per title. Can't beat that. Here is a full rundown of the bonus features listed for each title:Blue Harvest:*Audio Commentary from Seth Macfarlane and director, producers, writers, and editors*A Conversation with George Lucas*The Making Of Blue Harvest*Animatic Version of Blue Harvest*Family Guy Star Wars Clip Show( my favorite bonus feature from the past releases)*Uncensored audio trackSomething Something Something Darkside:*Audio Commentary*Fact Up Version of the feature( kinda like those old VH1 pop-up videos, with fun facts popping up throughout the movie)*Poster Art Featurette*Sneak Peak at the next feature with Table readIt's a Trap!*Audio Commentary*A very Special message from Dart Stewie*Star Wars Trivial Pursuit: The ultimate Challenge*Drawing with Peter Shin*Sock Puppet Outtakes*Animatic*Making The Scene featuretteThat oughta keep you busy for a while, eh? And then there is the feature itself. Well, I'm not gonna review that in depth, simply because I think since this hasn't been broadcast yet, many people who buy this will be seeing it for the first time and I don't want to give anything away. But I will say I thought it was just as good as the first two. Really enjoyable. Family Guy fans will not be disappointed with this set. It is a little sad to see it end, since from what i understand there are no plans for making Episode I, II, and III parodies. Hopefully they do something similar, maybe with Back to the Future or Indian Jones, two franchises they are constantly referencing. Can't you just picture Peter and Francis tied up to the chair in The Last Crusade!EDIT: The It's A Trap Digital Copy Disc also features a DVD of the movie.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A21519P9B7ACHJ	"John ""alphajc"""	Back when I was in high school a cartoon show starring a fat man and a baby shaped like a football debuted after the Super Bowl (I believe it was Rams vs Falcons).I didn't find it all that funny at the time and watched a few episodes here and there for the next couple of years.  Then it was canceled.  I didn't miss it all that much because I wasn't really hooked on it.But then my roommate got the whole DVD set.  Then when I started watching the episodes I couldn't stop laughing.  It was so good that we breezed through all the episodes in about 2 weeks and wanted more.  Unfortunately, thanks to Peter Chernin and FOX-TV it was cancelled.  I don't believe it was due to ratings (because King of the Hill gets horrible ratings and it's still on) but more because of its crude humor that offended the conservative television viewers.Anyways, after the Simpsons I believe Family Guy was the best animated cartoon series ever made.  It is funny, and not in the way you would expect.  Young kids perhaps won't get the humor and will find it bland.  But older kids and adults won't be able to stop laughing...I guarantee it!	5.0	Six Stars!!!!  Even better now than it was before.	2003-12-14	1	1	0

Larsen ""Larso"""	I'm a fan of Family Guy but I've by no means seen every episode and as for Star Wars - well it was The Lord of the Rings of my generation - I loved it! This The Empire Strikes Back parody has some great features, some of the graphics were fabulous and even looked like copies of the original - it took me back very nicely. As for the new take, a lot of it went OK but it was by no means consistent. As is Family Guys want, there were several `out there' moments where a scene diverted into something completely different. Some worked well, others less so, or they went on too long. This is part of Family Guys thing, taking things too far and then taking them further again. I like the way the show makes fun of itself like this but too much and you begin getting bored - in Darkside this happens a bit much. One of the main problems is that a lot of the focus is on Chris/Luke Skywalker. He's just one of the less funny characters and it's hard to make scenes he's in hilarious. Conversely, by sticking so close to the original story, Brian, regrettably, gets very little to do. There are still some great laugh out loud moments (the Imperial Walker with the leg injury!), most of which occur in a rush near the end, so it's a worthwhile watch but not one that I think will bear repeat viewings.	3.0	More Brian needed	2011-01-06	1	1	0

As I read some of the past reviews, I noticed that some viewers didn't think of it like the TV show, and I could understand that viewpoint. It was a little slow in the beginning, but it ends with one of the best Family Guy endings ever. As far as special features go... I think there could have been a lot more features but I can only hope the producers hope to make this up to us in Season Four (Volume 3) of Family Guy coming out on DVD in late November. Finally, (as I was one of the first reviewers that mentioned this), to select the ""uncensored audio track"" go into Language Selection and select it from the menu. The edited audio track is the default one, and personally I believe that is a good idea for those younger viewers out there. Overall, I thought the movie deserved 5 stars and to Seth... send out more of those direct-to-DVD movies/specials from Family Guy!!"	5.0	I luv family guy	2005-09-29	1	1	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2IFYGHT2V9K8D	John Hedley	A consistently hilarious and original series that produced characters every bit as funny and memorable as any in the last 20 years. Comparisons to The Simpsons are inevitable, but where The Simpsons takes sharp jabs at a variety of cultural icons Family Guy beheads them with a guillotine. Many of the jokes are truly unique and no doubt horribly offensive to the sacred cows they are aimed at, but unlike many over-the-top animated series that seek laughs strictly from their ability to annoy, the satire, non-sequiturs and  insane plot-twists of Family Guy are spot-on and brilliant. Owning the DVD is especially handy for catching many of the more subtle jokes that often fly by so quickly and mixed with so many subtexts at the same time that a single viewing won't come close to mining all the gems this show has to offer. In fact, the release of this series was my own primary motivation for buying a DVD player in the first place! I'm serious, it's that good.	5.0	Not to be missed...	2003-09-08	2	2	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	"This animated comedy show debuted in early 1999, definitely pushed the buttons on values and taste with great laughs. It's about this dysfunctional family who are called "" The Griffens"", Peter Griffen is the lovable dummy of a father whom loves his family very much & never enjoys too much fun even if it's on his mind. Chris is the 13 year son whom is also dumb like his dad, Meg is the teenage daughter that seems shy around her friends when she's with her family, Brian is the talking walking human-like dog, Lois is the gorgeous woman of the house and Stewie is the highly intelligent talking infant who has a plot for taking over the world.This show is most definitely one of the funniest and most outrageous animated shows on TV! it did got canned in 2002, but luckily Adult Swim on ""Cartoon Network"" has gotten big time ratings with some new episodes coming out this year and has gained a huge cult following for it's wackiness, deadpan humor and satire.This Boxset contains the first two seasons with three of my personal favorite episodes ""Death is a B*&^%&"", ""Road to Rhode Island"" and ""Waste Talent"" on this 3 Disc set that contains original Internet spots to promote the show, audio commentaries by the show's makers and a featurette behind the scenes on the show.I highly recommend this excellent animated comedy series to animation's fans and is definitely worthy to be in a animation lover's DVD collection alongside ""Futurama"" and "" The Simpsons""."	5.0	Best animated comedy on TV on a great DVD set!	2005-01-18	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A153MVFR0FTI6O	John Nelson	"You can chalk FAMILY GUY up with The Job, The Young Ones and Greg The Bunny among others as a great show that were cancelled for no good reason or ended way before their time.  Not to mention that they were all some of the funniest shows to grace TV.On the surface, FAMILY GUY isn't the greatest show due to the mold it was in which was a wannabe Simpsons mode; Peter the dad, Lois the Mom and Meg the daughter could be modeled after Homer, Marge and Lisa from the SIMPSONS.  Homer and Peter are both fat, insensitive dumb fathers, Lois and Marge are both suffering wives who stay with their husbands for no good reason.  Meg and Lisa suffer through unpopularity through school.  Chris is the only original character of the mainstream family, and by himself is annoying.  Too bad he wasn't modeled after Bart.  Only the shows two standout characters were of any sort of new ground; Brian the Dog who imbibes cocktails, smokes cigerettes and dispenses advice to his dolt owner and baby Stewie who at the age of one builds laser weapons, blow guns and other weapons to destroy the oblivious Lois and later on became a mean prankster.  At the end, lessons would usually be learned that would only make the SIMPSONS creators roll their eyes and think ""You know we used to do that too, remember when Bart cut off the statues head?""  One episode even has a character have a hallucinitory dream the way some Simpsons characters did early on.With all of that negativity out of the way, the shows brisk writing is what saved it and made it hilarious and broke it out of the mold.  Plots could start out on one topic and end on a completely different story (one episode has Peter planning on spending his tax money, after he is audited plans to build his own pool, to get a permit though he discovers his house isn't part of the US and forms his own country.)  Jokes sparkled with glorius lines (Peter tries potty training Stewie by offering him beer, since it makes you pee.  Stewie responds by saying while they were at it they could ""light up a doobie and watch porn"".  Peter considers it.)  The show was sprinkled with nonsequitors throughout that would be right out of the blue and hilarious.  (Peter sneaks out to go to a school function but falls off the roof, he is saved by Spiderman, who promptly leaves.)  The shows best part though came from the surreal flashbacks that characters would have for the purpose of telling a joke and I can't even start on those.The show also had the same kind of cutting, harsh, shock humor that the Simpsons used to have and South Park still achieves at times.  It was sadly the shows downfall.  One show (not on this DVD set but has been reported to be on the next release) was banned by Fox due to such content.  Religon and Race would be the butt of some jokes and other times the humor would get too blue (Lois and Peter dress up in Bondage gear during a casual conversation).  The show took chances, was funny and sadly was ended but it's place as a cult show has been cemented and will live on in the fans.If I may coment on the commentary of the show on the DVDs, even though only a few discs get commentary, they are all hilarious and the shows creator who provided the voice for Peter, Stewie and Brian does voices and it's great to hear (especially with swearing, and the voice of Lois during the first episode commentary is a standout).The only demerrits are not enough special features and that my favorite episode (Road to Rhode Island) has a scene cut out which featured Stewie sining showtunes to distract a airport guard so that he can smuggle weapons on the plane and even mentions Osama Bin Laden.  However the pilot episode did gain a scene, so it kind of evens out.Bottom line is that if you love South Park and the Simpsons, FAMILY GUY is a must own.  There is no excuse for not owning it if you like either of those shows.  If you decide not to get it, then as Stewie would say, BURN IN HELL!!!! (remember, he's one years old and wants to kill the mom.)"	5.0	Family Guy: dead before it's time, but finds life on DVD	2003-04-23	1	1	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3VTCJCX8YQSK0	"Johnny ""John"""	In 1999 creater Seth Mcfarlane created one of the funniest animation shows ever. Family Guy is about loving family that lives in Rhode Island. The father named Peter is a loving dad who is always jolly and always does something hilarious and over the top everytime he is on the screen.The mother's name is Lois and works at home raising her 3 children while also being a great wife to Peter. Their son Chris is a 13 year old who is not that smart but brings laughs everytime he is on the show. Their daughter Meg is the odd one out in the family. She doesn't have many friends and just wants to fit in with he crowd. Their other son Stewie is a 1 year older toddler who is bent on world domination and highly inteligent and is also always trying to kill his mother. Their pet's name is Brian. Brian is a talking dog that is very sacastic and  is always drinking martinis. This show is very funny. You will be laughing for hours. Peter is very entertaining to watch.He is way funnier than Homer Simpson. If you love comedy and just want to laugh then this is the DVD to buy. You will love every second of this show.	5.0	Funiest Show	2004-09-17	5	3	2

And let's assume that FG's network was moved by the commercial successes of Simpsons and South Park.So what do we have?A personal vision, carefully created, by an inventive, if crass, individual.  I've not seen a show in the last ten years that seemed so welded to it's creator's personal sensibilities.  This show is funny straight up, but once you take the time to get more familiar with the characters, it's jsut amazingly funny.Minor carp:  what's up with Meg Griffin?  It's almost hard to understand why she was even created, given how little she has to do.  She is, really, like an uninteresting Lisa Simpson.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2DU061PO9VCPV	John Whaley	Quite possibly the most underrated comedy ever devised, The Family Guy enjoyed three all-too-brief seasons before getting the axe.  Fortunately, the ratings in syndication were so high that the show will be back, starting in 2005.Which means that it is time to get this DVD and get caught up.Featuring 28 episodes from the first two seasons, this collection will introduce you to the borderline-insane Griffin family and their dysfunctional neighbors, all of whom contribute something unique to the comedic mosaic.  The standouts are Stewie, the megalomaniacal toddler, Brian, the sarcastic, martini-sipping family dog, and Quagmire, the womanizing swinger who is funny when he scores, and even funnier when he doesn't.Comparisons will be made, justly, to the Simpsons.  While there are some similarities, Family Guy is far more extreme and over-the-top, and will appeal to anyone look for a seriously politically incorrect comedy.Highest possible recommendation.	5.0	And you thought that YOUR family had issues.....	2004-06-12	3	3	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A11XKY4EIU2KNR	"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist"""	This show was so funny, I had always wondered what happened to it. It would be on, then on at a different time. Then it would skip a few weeks, be back on the air at another time. You never knew when it would be on.Now I don't have to worry about it. The Griffins are at my fingertips for all time.What a deal this is too, 28 episodes for under forty bucks is a steal.If you are not familiar with the show, be warned. It makes the Simpsons look like the Teletubbies. It is crude, rude, and outrageously funny. You will have an offensive joke thrown at you no mater who you are. White, Black, Southern, European, Jewish, Mexican, American Indian, etc. It doesn't matter, this was a no holds barred show that even FOX couldn't handle. Peter Griffin makes Homer Simpson look like Hugh Beaumont from Leave it to Beaver.This show will shock and offend as it laughs at the rules of political correctness. When you have a talking alcoholic dog, a murderous one year old, a sexist man, a retarded teenage boy, an insecure girl, and a sexy woman all in the same family, what the heck would you expect?This cartoon series blows away Kng of the Hill, The Simpsons, and Futurama.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1D2GEP07I0VSS	"Jon M. Lepine ""jaycatt"""	Great series, but not many people talk about the commentaries, so I will.  First off, not all the episodes have commentaries.  I imagine this was to save space to include more actual episodes on each DVD by not commentary'ing everything.  There are numerous spots in the commentaries where no one says anything at all, but most don't last more than 3-4 minutes each.  I wondered if they had stopped entirely at one point.  The voice actor who plays Lois is in most (if not all) of the commentaries, and she's very funny (as is Seth, of course).  They do pick on the show (&quot;See that? It means Peter is REALLY STUPID&quot;) and on each other (&quot;No, really, just give me a Yes or a No, Seth, and don't explain, so we can sit here for 20 minutes in silence.&quot;) but occasionally Seth or Lois's voice actor will do a character voice cursing or saying something funny (that's quite a laugh).  And, of course, there's mention of which scenes were considered riske at the time and which they had trouble getting past the censors.  I wish the commentary was on all the episodes, though.  Also, I kind of wish it was as full of info as the Futurama or Simpsons commentaries are.  I got the feeling they were obligated to do the commentaries for Family Guy, and that perhaps it wasn't by choice.	5.0	Commentary review	2003-04-16	1	1	0

This cartoon could have gone on for many more years, but unfortunately, FOX was too weak to keep it on the air.  If only Comedy Central or some other cable channel had picked it up... Anyways.. the show's humor is a mixture of South Park and The Simpsons, and will keep you laughing.

At a pool, Stewie had a near death encounter that did not seem to severe.  After he shakes this off, he feels misfit in his dimwitted family of losers, and wonders if his father Peter is his real father.  As he lives through Peter being a news anchor, him telling Steve Bartman to grab the foul ball, and being involved in an Indiana Jones movie, he encounters his biggest journey yet.  On a news show he sees a man who looks exactly like him but older.  Stewie wonders if this could really be his birth father.  The next day he leaves with his Human-like dog Brian, and travel in their neighbor Quagmier's trailer.  After crashing the trailer in the desert, the finally make their way to San Fransisco, which is where Stewie thinks his father is.  Once he finds him in a trolley that he was riding on, he finds out it really is not his father, but it is him!The man is Stewie from the future and Stewie travels with his future self back to the future times.  Stewie definitely was not impressed.  He was living on his own and had a very bad apartment and worked at a convienent store.  Stewie wonders why his life was so bad and why he did not have world domination, until his future self explains.  He says that ever since he started having dreams of his near death experience at around the age of 20, he didn't want to take any risks.  So Stewie goes back in time and stops his near death experience to save the rest of his life.	5.0	Stewie Griffin-The Untold Story	2005-10-25	6	4	2

I have been watching this show ever since it's Super Bowl night debut.  I had to endure FOX moving it's time schedule and not showing it for weeks at a time.  The exploits of Peter Griffth and his dysfunctional family are a real hoot.  A show filled with pop culture references and very odd movie, music and historical name dropping and information as well.  T.V. has become boring and stagnant.  Family Guy strecthes the limits of taste and sanity. What makes this show even funnier is the fact that this family is all too real.Seth MacFarlane must be commended for creating such a constantly funny show.  His political views and ideals are refreshing as well.  After having to tape the show constantly due to it's ever changing schedule (1999  to 2002) I am so glad this show was released on D.V.D.  I started to turn people on to this show when it first came out and now they all own a copy of this box set.  May this show never go off the air.

The dad is a big idiot, the mom is the normal one, the daughter is an average teen trying to fit in, the baby (my favorite) is a power-hungry freak who hates everybody, and the dog (the smartest in the family).  Overall these crazy characters in funny, psychotic predicaments add up to a side-splittind good time.	5.0	Blew My Mind	2003-04-01	2	1	1

It felt like McFarlane was using the foul language just because it was a straight to DVD release and he could. I am not a prude by any means but using foul language just because you can does not make for a better film.

The main point of the writing seems to be to allow people of average to low IQ to feel smug and superior by presenting them with a oafish strawman, easily dismissed, and easily mocked.  Want to be an off-the-shelf elitist? Want to be faux-clever?  Want to have an ersatz and vague sense that you are an insider?  This just may be the show for you.  The humor is artless and unsubtle.

This show is for people who love jokes that come out of nowhere. The characters, mostly Peter, say things that you would never expect to ever hear.  Not because the jokes are so sick or weird, but just because they are off-the-wall. When Peter said that he couldn't call his new country Peterland ... I was dead. Thankfully, it cut to commercial right then, because I cried for ten minutes. This show does make fun of everyone in the world, but I feel that this is good because it means we are all on the same level. No one is above or BELOW being made fun of in a joking way. If you have seen the entire series, you know all of the ""groups"" I am talking about. If you know someone that doesn't like this show, pity them. These are the same people who don't understand the appeal of movies like Ace Ventura or the Evil Dead Saga. It really is sad that the only new show left on TV I could watch besides the NFL or the NBA was cancelled. I think all of the other 25-year-olds in the USA feel the same way.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	APWKSH4XINI0Q	Kevin Artinian	Family Guy is a smart show.  It lampoons American culture mercilessly, just as The Simpsons, South Park, King of the Hill, and Futurama do.  The humor is sophisticated and outlandish, as you'd expect from this kind of show.  Overall, it is extremely funny, and often requires repeated viewings.So why doesn't it get five stars?  Why doesn't it receive the same kind of praise I would give to the four shows mentioned above?  Well, the real problem is the characters.  Despite the funny situations they get themselves into, Peter, Lois, Meg and Chris are overly dry and sterile.  Yes, Brian's fun, and Stewey could very well be the most brilliant character ever created for a prime-time cartoon.  But the other four, plus practically every non-family character, is a piece of cardboard.  This doesn't take too much away from the enjoyment of Family Guy, but it is a significant disappointment.  There are also a few minor flaws in concept and such, but they are not too important.  All in all, an awesome satire/parody/caricature/lampoon, despite the shallow stars.

I guess I set my expectations a little too high because I didn't find it all that funny. Don't get mw wrong, there were times where I was laughing so hard, I was crying. But overall, it was kind of disappointing. There were a lot of ackward points in the plot that didn't really work. It seems like some of the plot could have been edited out and the DVD could have been condensed down. For me, the first 30 minutes or so were marginally funny, but I almost turned it off. It gets better after that. It starts to flow a bit better in the middle and finishes strong. The beginning almost ruined it for me though.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3UV1T0QN4R40Z	"Kevin ""indiebass"""	First of all, I have been waiting for this series to be released since it was off the air.  The title of my review is no mistake: this really was the funniest show ever put on television.  It may not have been the most intelligent from time to time, but intelligence does not always dictate funny.The set is worth owning if only for the commentary tracks alone.  Seth Macfarlane and various other cast/crew members comment on making the series and the past of the series and even if you aren't a die hard Family Guy Fan they make episodes you may have already seen 6 times fresh and even funnier than before.The only reason this set doesn't get the full 5 stars is because I noticed they've changed some of the jokes, which apparently were too offensive for even the DVD.  I say they should have gone all out on the DVD, I mean they can even swear in the commentary tracks so why censor what was already on the air anyways?Despite that disappointment (and I'm sure if you don't remember the original series as vividly as I do, it won't be as big of a deal) this show remains a rare gem in the manure pile of modern television.  Always edgy, *most* of the time extremely intelligent (I'm thinking of the cameo of Benjamin Disrailli) and contantly reminding you of things you didn't know you remembered, The Family Guy can now serve as inspiration to the next generation and for those who weren't lucky enough to catch it when it was on the air.	4.0	The Funniest TV Show Ever	2003-05-08	0	0	0

I don't mind telling you, I was more than willing to buy the ""Something Something Something"" DVD.The last Family Guy Star Wars spoof special Blue Harvest was a great retelling of the classic, this time the DVD heralds the special's first (legal) appearance. The power is out in the Griffin household and Peter shares the story of Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back. Familiar characters from Lucas' movies are portrayed by Family Guy regulars...Peter is Han, or Carlos Spicywiener as he likes to be known, Brian as Chewy, Lois as Leia, Chris as Luke. Also returning Quagmire and Cleveland as C3PO &  R2, and Stewie is a natural as Vader. New recasting include Chris' Boss Carl as Yoda, Lois' Dad Carter P. as the Emperor and as the only black guy in the galaxy,  Mort as Lando (disappointingly replacing Magic Johnson), Consuela as herself, James Woods, James Cann, and more.The Empire Training video is good, the Dagoba Rocky IV training sequence is better, and worth the price of the DVD, actual moments of the Rocky montage are included, AWESOME and hilarious. Strange true facts about TEEN WOLF are revealed, Raggedy Andy and Tom Selleck, less revealing. I only wish Adam West could have been squeezed into this one.Lotsa callbacks to the series for Family Guy fans to enjoy, Star Wars fan will recognize to shot blocking from the originals as well, many of the ship scenes look as good or better than the original.  Lotsa, well a few ""F bombs"" because this is a DVD. The usually shots at pop culture Ryan Seacrest & Idol, shots a ""link films"" like Back to the Future II.Most of the bits work without fail, maybe not the pregnant walker.Without being a spoiler, here are a few of my favs:Han remarks in the asteroid field, ""We have 4 of the 5 main characters on this ship, I think we'll be fine.""Stormtrooper remarks to their blasters, ""Have we ever hit anything with these things?""Leia says at Bespin below Cloud City, ""Luke if that's you wave your right hand.""Good news, the next spoof is on the way for Return of the Jedi.

I really hope this is the case and they show up on the next box, because they are among the funniest: a 2 parter where Brian goes to Hollywood and winds up being a porn director; Peter tries to prevent some Brits form taking over his favorite bar; Peter goes to Washington to testify that his company's new smoking doll is safe.The stuff on the current box is hilarious, but someone messed up the synopsis of ""Mind Over Murder""...

I'm not sure that people take this show serious enough as a stand alone show, not a Simpsons knock off.  Though there are parallels Family Guy did things as a cartoon that the Simpsons would never touch, in subject matter and satire.  The witty approach that Matt Groening uses to weave his characters while making you feel attached yet amused by the characters, where as McFarlane suceeds in making characters only suitable for those with the comedic tastes of a two-year olds, such as my self.  Everything about these DVDs is great except for the commentary which I found to be quite lacking in every since.  Somehow this commentary stuck me as the commentary for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the special edition, just not very enthralling.	4.0	great show	2003-05-05	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2ZMGCPXK618YX	"Kevin W ""pacers721"""	Enthusiast will deny and discourage it, but similarities between Family Guy and the Simpsons are most definitely there. And since everybody I know likes at least one of these shows, it saddens me that there are fans of one show who insist on rebuking the other. Instead, people need to realize that it is these similarities that make both of these shows so great. Family Guy's humor may be a bit more abrasive, but it's just as successful at striking the right chords to make you laugh. Another comparison I can make with Family Guy is with the movie Airplane! Both feature quick pacing jokes which allow room for the hits and misses, and many many spoofs of different movies and tv shows (like my oh so favorite show, the Simpsons).Overall, when looking at the great animated comedies, Family Guy and the Simpsons come in with the one-two punch (and don't forget King of the Hill). I know that the memories of both of these shows will be embraced far into the future.	5.0	Hilarious, Exhilarating, Uproarious, Enlivening, Gay	2005-07-26	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ANG0K4TVQQGQP	"""keyser325"""	One reviewer states that there were 37 episodes in the first and second seasons.  Another states it was only 28 (the amount on the dvds).  They are both correct.The way the episodes were produced, there were 37 episodes according to the network's episode classification.  However, they aired them in different sequences, and only ended up with 28 episodes.  The remaining 9 episodes were attributed to season three.  So, depending on which source you check, you will see either 28 or 37 episodes for seasons one + two.I suspect the second volume will have all the rest of the episodes.  Aside from the technicalities, this show is absolutely brilliant.  It is, by far, the best written cartoon, and possibly TV show, period.  I used to be a simpsons fan, but after starting to watch Family Guy, the simpsons seemed much less entertaining.I would definately recommend this dvd to anyone, it's well worth it.	5.0	For those who are wondering...	2003-04-17	7	7	0

I actually enjoyed that episode in my hotel, though I don't know what season it was from.  So, I decided to buy Season 1 and 2.Pros:1. I loved Stewi with his funny thinking and his British accent, I think he's the best character in the whole show.  I also like the dog and Lois.  Peter Griffin was not the best character (dumb, has a stupid laugh) and his son has the same problem.2.  The show has some good jokes now and then.Cons:1.  I agree that the show was insensible in discussing many issues, like people with special needs or other religions.2.  There are many scenes with nudity and violence in this show, which I do not appreciate, especially for this ""family"" cartoon.  I also did not notice that this show brings many of the values for our society, despite what the song says (It seems today, that all you see, is violence in movies and sex on TV) !!

The entire program felt a little rushed, taking too long for some of the gags and speeding through others.

Nothing is funnier, more original, or cutting edge than early Family Guy.This show was WAY ahead of its time and didn't garner a big enough audience to stay on the air.  Only from re-runs on Adult Swim did the campaign start to get it back on the air.The rest is history and Seth MacFarlane has become a very famous, wealthy man.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2MSSJOJ24V7XR	"Kimberly Lazarski ""Kimberly"""	I ordered this trilogy, anxiously awaiting it. I selected this on Amazon over buying it locally (I've bought Something Something Someting Dark Side by itself locally when I found it in widescreen but the other two in stock were full frame) solely because it is listed as 1.77:1, which is 16:9 widescreen.When I received it, there was nothing indicating aspect ratio on the outside of the packaging, so I was skeptical. I opened it and sure enough it is 1.33:1, FULL FRAME aspect ratio. So, tried the return option and it was eligible for exact replacement only. Really? You're going to engage in fraud and ignore consumer protection laws and not make good on a bad description?I called customer service and explained the situation to a rep and they assured me they would replace it with the correct item. She put me on hold and made a couple of calls. She informed  me they would open up the replacement and make SURE it is the advertised aspect ratio.Well, today I received it, opened it (it was still shrink wrapped, which tells me they did NOT inspect it!) and of course, it's 1.33:1 FULL FRAME. The product listing very clearly states the following:# Format: AC-3, Animated, Box set, Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC# Language: English# Subtitles: English, French, Spanish# Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only. Read more about DVD formats.)# Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1# Number of discs: 3So, either Amazon is willfully engaging in Fraud, or their staff is comprised of illiterates.I'll be trying a third time and if they will not resolve it, there will be a chargeback!	1.0	Misleading product description WARNING!

After seeing quite a couple episodes of the previous seasons I came to Canada again and got the DVD from a friend. The movie was just HILARIOUS!!!!  The Griffins were funny as usual and I was entertained throughout the entire movie. Lots of jokes in this show relate to North American subjects and people (makes sense since it's an American show) but this does make it quite important to know a bit of the culture and the language of course. Having subtitles on the Dutch DVD would also help of course but most of the time that still doesn't translate everything with the same humour.I read that the movie was quite similar to the last episodes of the third season but to be honest...I couldn't really care less cause I haven't seen those episodes!!!!!!!!! I guess that's the only good thing about the show not being on Dutch television....But nothing bad about this movie and I would recommend it to everybody that has or hasn't seen it yet!!!	5.0	Hilarious	2006-06-06	1	1	0

First, I'd like to say that the other reviews were Too Right!!!  There is little I could add ... but, I'll try.  Yea; the closest analogy would be the illigitimate love child of the Simpsons and South Park, but as has been stated, there is so much more to it.  The show's format is not so much a structured program, as a train of thought.  As in a daydream (or, I'm told, a good trip), it wanders from one random subject to another, swinging back to a psudo-reality only when absolutly necessary.

Rice ""Sarkazein"""	"I'm old enough to have seen the original Star Wars trilogy as a first run in the theaters, and these things bring back memories.  Family Guy is unique in that it riffs on a lot of pop culture references, but they aren't all recent pop culture.  Somehow, these meld together in an enjoyable parody of what most consider the best of the Star Wars movies.Without going into a lot of detail, they nail what needs to be nailed.  The filler parts are a little hit and miss, and you can tell how drawn out this process is by watching the table reads.  The famously ad-libbed scene from the original where Leia tells Han she loves him (after being so stand-offish the entire movie) is incredibly funny for pretty much anyone, while show-specific references (Stewie's confused sexuality, Cleveland falling off of something saying, ""No, no, NO NO!"", and so on) are geared toward Family Guy fans.There are a few dry spells that seem rushed.  I get that Yoda is Chris's boss from the show and he has memorized every naked person scene from every movie, but why didn't he reference those with Yoda's unique sentence structure?  The Juicy Fruit ad seemed more suited to a regular episode rather than a movie parody.  The exact same ""electricity is out"" seemed to exist just to give them another 20 second spoof of something on TV.As a whole, though, the package delivers.  For those not familiar with Family Guy, it may seem bizarrely tasteless at times.  For those that don't know the original Star Wars trilogy, the story references and the plot in general will probably be a little confusing as it's part two of a trilogy.  For fans of both, it's well worth the price of admission."	4.0	54 minutes of Star Wars and 2+ hours of extras is a good value	2009-12-23	9	7	2

TV shows and movies, singers, other cartoon characters, Indian casinos, the mob, Y2K, drugs, the Pope - nothing is sacred! Peter Griffin is totally addicted to TV, drunk and stupid, but he's hilarious. His family is really dysfunctional, the dog Brian is an alcoholic, baby Stewie is hell-bent on destroying mother Lois, Chris thinks there is an evil monkey in his closet and Meg is...there. Plus lots of funny supporting/recurring characters like Cleveland and Loretta, sex-addict Quagmire, Joe (""holy crip, he's a crapple!""), the Pewterschmidts (Lois' parents) and Death. Mind Over Murder, Brian in Love, Chitty Chitty Death Bang, I am Peter Hear Me Roar, E Peterbus Unum are all hilarious. My favorite episode is ""Wasted Talent"", it starts with a parody of Willie Wonka and at the end they spoof an old episode of Twilight Zone (""No, it's not fair, there was time now."").

Ever since this aired there has not been an episode to go by that didnt leave me laughing histerically and grasping for more. From its inuendo's to the blunt truth of everyday life, family guy is a winning show for the stressed out college person. Can't wait for the 3 season to come out. I just wish it was still shown on air. However I am upset that the other work Seth Macfarlane has done is not on this set.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AXOEJR457N61V	Lance16	I love Family Guy and the major reason I bought this DVD was the fact it was on at the oddest of times on my cable (11:00 PM Cartoon Network and 2:00 PM TBS)The show is hilarious and is just about as good as the Simpsons.  Peter is like Hank Hill, Homer Simpson, and Cartman combined. It has its own sense of humor and is different than the rest of the crap that is found on TV anymore.All the characters have their unique personalities (especially Stewie) and each are funny in their own ways.  There are also a lot of cliches that show up which can't help but be laughed at.It is truly a shame (if not a travesty) that FOX Networks took this show off the air due to the fact that so many people were offended by it.  They ought to put it back on.Please...There is so much offensive things on TV anymore, they are hard to count.  Interesting how a reality program that has 10 people living together having sex and getting drunk finds a way to stay on the air while a great and funny show like Family Guy (in which there are two married parents and two kids with a dog-the nuclear family) is thrown off.  Amazing how the shows that set the poorest examples stay on the air.  Some sensitive people are upset about a few comments on Family Guy when all of these reality shows are so trashy and risque.The writers of Family Guy are very clever and deserve a lot of credit for this excellent program.If you have an extra forty bucks lying around that you can't find anything to do with, go and spend it on this DVD package.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Every semester in my Introduction to Popular Culture class the students make nominations and vote on what they think are the best shows on television today.  This semester the vote for the top spot is a battle between ""Lost"" and ""Family Guy,"" which is, of course pretty freakin' sweet.  The same can be said for ""Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story,"" which is a theatrical film version of the television series to the extent that three yet to be aired episodes linked together by a continuing story and bookended by an uncensored prologue and epilogue can be said to constitute such a thing.  Ironically, the biggest complaint is that the freedom of being a ""movie"" rather than a ""television show"" does not translate into the same sort of freedom that we say with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.""  I wanted to say that this is because eventually ""Family Guy"" would be able to run the three parts of this one as episodes on television whereas that was never going to happen with the ""South Park"" movie, except that Comedy Central shows it uncensored all the time now.The prologue has the ""Family Guy"" gang showing up for the premier of this film as they return to television after the hiatus forced upon them (Lois had the worst time of it, far and away, which explains why she shows up totally sloshed).  The continuing thread here is Stewie's search for his real father, an idea that begins by simply looking at Peter and trying to figure out a genetic connection, but which goes into high gear when Stewie sees a man on television who looks and talks exactly like what we would expect if Stewie was all grown up.  But before Stewie and Brian go on their cross-country journey, the littlest Griffin has a near-death experience that motivates him to try and change his evil ways.  Of course the main narrative thread is just an excuse to toss in as many jokes as possible, and there is certainly something to be said for not really being concerned with coming up with logical segues to throw references to Sacco & Vanzetti, ""Star Trek V,"" and Ziggy Stardust.  If I were going to point to a sequence that is emblematic of this movie I would pick Peter's ""What Grinds My Gears"" segment on television in which he attacks Lindsay Lohen (""What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want?"").  I totally appreciate the sentiment, but if this is an ""uncensored"" movie then I expect there to be a lot more blood on the floor from start to finish (and more cartoon nudity).  So I was certainly entertained, but I really was expecting this to be really special and not just a collection of above average (future) television episodes.I can make an argument that the three funniest shows on television today are ""Family Guy,"" ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons"" (who would have ever thought that ""The Simpsons"" would be considered a ""conservative"" cartoon show?).  What they have in common is what is being called ""flexible reality,"" which is simply the ability to go anywhere and do anything.  Obviously an animated series has an advantage over more realistic television in that regard.  Of those three series I think ""Family Guy"" clearly makes the best use of the practice, not only in terms of Peter's constant channeling of unseen lives, but also in the basic roster of characters.  Having either Stewie or Brian around is pretty good; having both, and constantly teaming them up as happens in this film, is pure genius, evil or otherwise.  Plus, the vocal talents of Seth MacFarlane, who does Stewie, Peter and Brian in the Griffin household plus Glen Quagmire and Tom Tucker, is as good as it gets for making diverse sounds out of one man's voice.  It also does not hurt that Lois Griffin (voiced by Alex Borstein), is the sexiest cartoon mom of all time, which is another reason to bemoan the fact that ""uncensored"" in this film did not mean everything we were hoping it might mean..."	4.0	"Not everything you would want an uncensored ""Family Guy"" to be, but still worth watching"	2005-12-10	6	5	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A32SAAGAIB6KYG	Layne Catherine	"I enjoyed Something Something Something Dark Side. I was actually surprised to see so many people saying that this was a phone it in and sell out movie. I enjoyed this movie more than any Family Guy episode I've seen in a few years. I may be biased because I've seen The Empire Strikes Back more times than most anyone besides another Star Wars fanatic.I saw people turn on The Simpsons after South Park came out and it was no longer the new hip thing. Maybe that's all that's going on with other negative reviews. Maybe it's the cool thing now to trash Family Guy. Or maybe it's just people upset because they feel the quality of the tv show went downhill like me. But it's not fair to trash this movie because of the tv show.The jokes are aimed at the Star Wars crowd so if you're not familiar with lines from the movies you're going to miss what the joke is about. It would be like watching them make fun of Paris Hilton if you've never seen her before. Having a skinny blonde ditz stand around and say ""That's hot!"" at every little detail doesn't make any sense at all if you don't know who she is and how she behaves. I think it's the same with these Family Guy jokes, but Family Guy has always been this way. How many jokes about 1980s tv shows and events are in every episode of the show? Maybe the movie is a bit more of an inside joke for Star Wars fans than the show is with its 80s jokes.In a nutshell I'm a huge Star Wars fan, have been losing interest in the Family Guy tv show, and I still loved this movie."	4.0	Fun enjoybale spoof	2010-01-06	3	1	2

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1ETI3AUQ0GMB4	Leslie R. J. Crowley	When I first saw ads for the Family Guy, I thought it sounded good - except for Stewie. Just goes to show how wrong I can be! When I watched the show, I discovered it's not good - it's GREAT! And Stewie? Well, he &amp; Brian are my two favorites. I love the way they play off each other. Which may be why &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot; is my favorite episode. (Like a masochist in Newport, we're Rhode Island bound! Classic!)Two quibbles. I am so bummed that they cut out the scene where Stewie smuggles weapons past airport security and says &quot;Let's hope Osama bin Laden doesn't know show tunes.&quot; What a gyp! I haven't made it to the very end yet, so maybe it's in the deleted scenes. I hope! That bit was hilarious! If not, well, I have my memories.The other quibble is with people that do write ups with no apparent sense of what they are talking about. In the description of &quot;Mind Over Murder&quot; it says that Meg becomes an acclaimed lounge singer. Hello? On the planet Reality it's LOIS that becomes the lounge singer.Gentle griping aside, the Family Guy is the best thing to hit television since, well, since nothing. It is THE best thing - bar none.My husband and I look forward to many, many hours of side-splitting hilarity with our Family Guy dvd set.

A lot of the episodes start at the main theme and not the opening scene that is listed in the scene selection. I know it can't be the malfunction of one disc, because they all do it. Also, viewing in &quot;Play all&quot; mode is extremely difficult as it doesn't seem to know which chapter it wants to play next.

The character Stewie is a figure that can give you hours of belly laughs as well as ""sleeping with the lights on"" night terrors all in one package.But this ""Untold Story"" just doesn't do right by him.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2DSEH5SX1SMOX	"""maniacjypsi"""	While there are certainly some striking similarities between 'Family Guy' and 'Simpsons,' really...there is simply no comparison. Bart, Homer and the gang - who preceded 'Family Guy' by, what...an entire decade? - relish their angst and humor, and the daily family beatings, and that is what has made them a special, welcome sight on our TVs. But this 'Family Guy'...now, here's something that will actually make you laugh!Banished to late nights, and ultimately, to Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and released onto their own DVD, 'Family Guy' is a step bolder, a step farther, a step into 'Simpson'-free laughter, where the dog drinks but never chases a cat, there is no 'sideshow' to rely on for an occasional laugh, and the flashes to alternate realities are actually funny. Peter Griffan really loves his kids (except for the daughter, whose name he seldom remembers), and there is a bond through them, through all the troubles and problems they face, that makes this defiant, daring show a real treat to watch.Compare it to the 'Simpsons?' *Please!* Itchy and Scratchy are the only funny things on that show, who, despite this, will never hold their own with a spin-off. 'Family Guy' may be forgotten before the Simpsons, but that is their punishment for taking their humor to this new, daring, truly amusing level.	5.0	Compare to Simpsons? *Please!*	2003-12-16	4	1	3

Have you  considered  South Park?Still, this show serves as a good bridge between those other,superior shows, and it is sometimes funny, even blatantly so.But Stewie Griffin is never going to be Eric Cartman, and Peter, while definitely stupider than Homer Simpson, is less a joy towatch as a result, which might not have been the intention of the creators.	3.0	Funny, but not terribly original	2004-12-11	11	3	8

Each individual character has a creativity and charisma of his own but it's the dynamic that exists between them that breathes life into the show.  For example the dialogues between Brian and Stewie are just hilarious!  And Peter's idiocy is magnified 10 fold simply when contrasted to the reliability of Lois.  Other characters such as Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe and especially Tom and Diane provide the unpredictability and enrichment that makes each Family Guy moment a unique experience.There are only a few shows that I would not hesitate to spend $ for.  Family Guy is most definitely one of these shows.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1D1EBU3HGV4WT	Mark Santo	When I heard about this movie I was a little concerned because I didn't feel Family Guy was due for a movie. The show can barely carry itself for 22 minutes without using one or two tactics(the famous skinned knee) to fill that time.While they did manage to toss in a few not-safe-for-TV moments, it was probably due to the weak content that this one was tossed straight to DVD. The movie's plot is no deeper than one of the episodes, and the gags seem a bit recycled. It's a stream of obscure pop culture references, visual gags and a bit of gross out humour. This will appeal to anyone between the ages of 13 to 25, and anyone else with a sense of humour.My low score is because I'm rating this as a movie, and as such it fails. The pacing is wrong, the plot is boring and the movie brings nothing new to the series. This 90 minute let-down would of been better suited as trimmed 1 hour special, and if it were in that format my rating would be higher. Check it out if you're a fan of the series, but if you're new, stick with the third season DVD.	2.0	Unsatisfying	2005-08-01	55	9	46

However, purely in terms of entertainment, I would like to add my opinion that FG is by far the funniest and cleverest [animated] show ever written.The fact the show was taken off the air is a further reminder of the semi-democracy and paralytic freedom we are forced to endure. (Apologies, didnt expect to get political).Anyway, as a deranged paranoid city mayor did once say, 'How do you know my language?'.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A30CB33NAE4HMO	"Matthew Hayhurst ""America First"""	By far one of the best shows to hit the airwaves in the past twenty years. I have never laughed so hard. This show, as mentioned by Justin, was ahead of it's time. Not only that, but it arose from the comedic pits to pull every animated show of the time from their plummiting lack of creativity. I remember the Simpsons at the time before Family guy, and I have to say it was not up to par with it's former quality. Once Family Guy hit the air, Matt Groening, not to mention T. Parker & M. Stone, realized they had to get off their assees and write some funny. So, to anyone who likes the Simpsons or South Park I hope you thank Seth Macfarlane every Wednesday and Sunday night that Homer and gang are still around making you laugh. I say bring Family Guy back (The Simpsons / SP need a shot in the arm). Our kids will realize the importance of this show and the impact it had on calling the world as it is, not how our PC establishment wants it. I toast to Seth Macfarlane for his ideas and wonderful sense of humor. Thanks for the hours of laughs, and now with the shows on dvd, I  thank you in advance for a life time of Family Guy.	5.0	Family Guy: Setting the Bar and Stretching the Limits	2003-02-17	16	12	4

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2YJ9DT9YZ0DUN	Matthew K. Minerd	This collection of Family Guy, containing two of the three seasons of the show, is an excellent compilation of the show.  However, the show leaves something to be desired in its humor at times.It appears that nothing is too sacred to the writers of Family Guy.  While some of their spoofs are truly funny in themselves, many jokes take advantage of situations, instututions, and individuals.  In addition to these kinds of gags, Family Guy also utilizes much &quot;potty&quot; humor.  The comedy of the show, while sometimes extremely funny, can leave the watcher thinking, &quot;Did they just make fun of that?&quot; and, &quot;That was a stupid joke.&quot;If you are a fan of the series, this is an excellent compilation of the show.  For that, I give it 5 out of 5 stars.  However, since the humor is not all that great at times, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.  Think what you will; it is a funny show at times, going overboard at other times, but this is an excellent collection of the episodes.	3.0	A Good Compilation of an Okay Show	2003-05-13	24	3	21
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1S9LJRG1HKX80	Matthew M. Allan	This is the best cartoon i have ever seen. its genuis, its so original i wont even compare it to the simpsons(the only similarity i see is they re both funny cartoons). An example of the extreme laughter you will expirence when u watch this is when peter finds a scroll in a beer bottle to visit a beer factory. He runs home and falls and hits his knee. He sits on the ground for a while going ahhhhh oohhhh. it goes for so long u think the dvd is skippin, then it ends. Does this make any sense, NO. But it sure is funny as hell. Thats the thing with Family Guy they can make jokes out of nothing.  Every eposie is funny and absolutley hilarious. They are not afraid to joke about any topics and its a shame it was cut form Fox. I saw many eposides on fox and when  i heard it was out on DVD i immedialtey ran out to purcahse it. buy this and support the funniest cartoon ever (and its set in Rhode Island)!	5.0	funnier then funny	2003-12-09	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AAF5WKYQLG7CJ	Matthews	This is one of the funniest show's that was ever shown on T.V, more clearer Adult Swim and also originally FOX. This whole series is about a big fat guy named Peter Griffin and his family he has a sexy wife, one unsatisfied daughter, one huge son with an intrest in art, a killing baby son, and a smart talking dog. This box set has more than 20 episodes which take up season's 1 and 2. Funnier then the simpsons and futarama, and I do not suspect that this is for children unless they know anything about puberty or at least went threw it. With it's unlimited line of humor this is by far the funniest series/show's on earth. If you can't get enough of this show there is also season 3 thats out right now. And also heard that season 4 is coming out in the year 2005 so wait until then to see some new episodes.	5.0	FUNNY times 2.	2004-06-25	2	1	1

Family Guy is so funny its ridiculus, but im sure you've seen it and dont need to be told that!As for it copying the simpsons...There ARE a few jokes that are completely taken from the simpsons, best example:The Simpsons:When homer tells Chief Wigem about the aliens (I think) and he just says &quot;Suuuure, ill just type it up on my invisible typewriter&quot; then another guy comes and says &quot;I just torched a building and im afraid to do it again!&quot; and the Chief once again says &quot;Suuuure, ill just type it up on my invisible typewriter!&quot;Family Guy:Stewie goes to the irish cop (also sitting at a desk) and reports his stolen bike and the cop says something like &quot;Awww look at the cute little baby, are you looking for your mommy?&quot; then another guy comes up and says something about kidinapping someone and the cop says the same thing &quot;Awww look at the cute little baby, are you looking for your mommy?&quot;Now THAT is a simpsons rip-off!

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	I started out like many people, discovering &quot;Family Guy&quot; reruns late at night on Cartoon Network's &quot;Adult Swim.&quot; I was never familiar with the show during its actual run, but seeing it late at night on television seemed a fresh breath of air compared to most of the unfunny crap and ridiculous reality shows that have infested TV lately. I immediately got ahold of the first season of &quot;Family Guy,&quot; and ran across a rather sad realization about the show: people, it's funny at times, but it's not all it's cracked up to be. &quot;Family Guy&quot; is often brilliant in the way that it comments on political and popular issues, and occasionally hilarious when it's REALLY irreverent (a foul-mouthed Big Bird that berates Chris Griffin comes to mind). The big problem with &quot;Family Guy&quot; - it can't survive on its own momentum and finish an episode. I find that most of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes 'last' with me for about 10 or 12 minutes AT MOST, and then the episode falls stale and none of the gags work anymore. &quot;Family Guy&quot; is an obvious spawn of the ultimate of all animated shows, &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Thank God, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; doesn't have anything to worry about. &quot;Family Guy&quot; lets most of its show coast on Simpsons-esque flashbacks, and YES, they're usually funny and often a riot. Sadly, &quot;Family Guy,&quot; despite its occasional spot-on irreverence, can only rely on those flashbacks and outrageous humor and can't actually carry a plot to the end. Some people find &quot;Family Guy&quot; to be one of the most brilliant and hilarious shows of all time. Some moments attest to that, I'll admit. There have been times I've been in stitches over certain moments on the show. Then again, most of those can't really save the fact that the humor of &quot;Family Guy&quot; can only carry it so far. After a while, it becomes obvious that shock-humor and flashbacks are just about the only things going for it. Sorry, but I'll take &quot;The Simpsons&quot; over that.	3.0	Often funny and irreverent - too often uneven and lackluster	2003-10-06	23	7	16

About 20 minutes an episode, so you get A LOT. Plus, the dvd is only 35 bucks, while most other animted dvds and such are 30 dollars. Like dbz, which has you pay 30 bucks for 3 episodes. This movie though gives you your moneys worth, with almost a dollar and 50 cents an episode. You also get tons of laughs from Peter, and uhhhh, tons of laughs from Peter.Most still love the Simpsons, yea. Anyone can agree that the Simpsons have lost their touch.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"And watching it as a movie, is excellent. I don't really see why people complain about it so much being 3 episodes, OK, it may have started off that way, but why complain about Family Guy? It's not that noticeable, when one episode ends and the other begins, because it does run that smoothly.This may be Stewie The Untold Story, but it doesn't really focus on Stewie as much as I thought it would. Unfortunately, it doesn't really focus much on my favourite character (and probably the character I'm most like, even though I hate the colour pink) Meg. She seems rather overlooked in this movie, with no funny scenes or stories.Stewie is definitely my other favourite character in Family Guy. He has me in fits all the time. So funny. He's funny in this movie, when he sees a man who could possibly be his father, and leads to a rather interesting storyline.There's a lot of other movies referenced in this movie, including Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. (Apparently, since I've only seen one Indiana Jones movie.) As normal, the references tend to go straight over my head, as I haven't seen the films, or don't get the humour but still enjoy it. I did manage to find two references in this, which my boyfriend didn't get, and I had to tell him, that they were referencing Sound Of Music & the infamous ""Turn Back Time"" video by Cher. I was quite happy with that!This is definitely a movie to be seen, and can be watched alone, even if you haven't seen any of the episodes before hand. It will make you want to see the episodes afterwards though!"	3.0	I could watch Family Guy all day	2005-10-18	2	0	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1F2XWIJO3SGJR	Meghan	"The premise of the movie is that Stewie goes in search of who he believes is his true father, a man he sees on TV, but in fact is actually himself, from the future. He follows his future self to see how his life turns out and it is a very pathetic life, no world domination, he's a virgin at 35 and works in an appliance store, all due to one near death experience that scared him so much he decided to become mild-mannered.I am a huge Family Guy fan since I saw the very first episode. The humor is usually non-stop, some might consider it offensive at first but that's really its charm, as it is offensive to everyone and every stereotype. I was so excited at the thought of a totally Stewie video (as he is my favorite) but I must say it was quite a letdown. Yes there were a lot of jokes, but honestly in the first 5 minutes I didn't laugh at all- which I've never had happen before while watching Family Guy.It just seems like there was so much more they could do with this movie.  There are a few good jokes but most likely you've already seen them on the previews, who didn't love the sex scene- Stewie saying ""That's never happened to me before"" girl saying ""What the 8 seconds of sex or the 40 minutes of crying?"" And PLEASE, just come out and say it, Stewie is gay! We get it, so stop beating around the bush already. At any rate, while that was indeed funny the rest was just not that great.You spend more time watching Stewie run from scene to scene instead of hearing jokes. If I didn't know any better I'd say they just made a normal episode of Family Guy and stretched it out into a movie by adding a bunch of scenes where Stewie runs or drives.It is still Family Guy so you'll have a few laughs but I'm sorry to say: rent don't buy."	3.0	funny but not the best	2005-10-15	1	1	0

I listened to the commentary also, and learned this is just three episodes thrown together. That didn't really throw me off, but I was expecting it to be an actual movie of Family Guy, I mean, they could have just took out some ""bad"" parts and made it a continuing three-part episode like they did those ones where Brian goes away.If you would like the DVD to be uncensored then go to set up, or special features, either one (sorry my mind is going blank). But they didn't lie on the cover when they said uncensored because you CAN make it uncensored, some people would prefer the F words to be blocked out and I think that was nice of them.All in all, this movie was pretty good, but I would much rather to watch my Family Guy DVD Set instead."	3.0	3 and a half Stars	2006-01-23	2	2	0

FART JOKES AND CHOKING GET OLD AFTER HMMM, 15 YEARS!!!! AND STUPID DRUNKNESS AND YELLOW PEOPLE GET STUPID TOO!!!! this show is clever, incredibly funny, and random. the humor is completely randomness, and stupid, which makes it so funny. The best episode is the Y2K one with the peter vs. chicken fight.  or the episode where death sprains its ankle, and there technically is no death until peter takes the sickle. Screw the simpsons, it is stupid and getting routine and too stupid and predictable nowadays, especially with special guest appearances. family guy is much much better.	5.0	I LOVE FAMILY GUY	2004-04-16	5	0	5
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A4YSCY78QNV73	"M. Havlik ""Happy"""	Been a Family Guy fan ever since they first came out and through the cancellations. This set I had to get because it had blue harvest on Blu-Ray even though I have the movie on regular DVD. The last one wasn't as good as the first 2 but you have to do the last one since they did the first 2. I would recommend anyone to get this as an upgrade for their set if they are a family guy fan.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A10CJINP7KBR4W	M. Herzog	I have to start this review by noting if you're into family guy, or spoofs of star wars, you'll enjoy this.  Now is it worth buying is the real question, especially given that it'll probably end up on tv at some point.  Well, the answer really depends on your love of the subject matter.  As with the other reviews, there's been criticism for this one being less funny than the other, but that's not surprising given that Empire Strikes Back, the movie parodied, is such a strongly made movie.  In some ways, it leads the movie to being more of a retelling of the film, rather than an actual parody, and so its not as funny as blu harvest, which is so easy to parody. Its not bad, just not as funny as before.So, you're desire to own this depends on your level of devotion to the source material.  Its funny, but not as funny as before.  Also, please note: the DVD version does NOT contain a digital copy, like blue harvest did.  That is only available for the blu ray version apparently.  So if you're expecting two copies, you're only getting one.	4.0	Funny, but could have been better	2010-01-15	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2M3YWCDI3890U	"Michael A. Magliulo ""Film Studies Graduate"""	"Family Guy is, bar none, the best animated series that has ever been broadcast on television.  Beating out the Simpsons in almost every aspect, the show had an unusually large amount of political and racial satire, parody, and pop culture.  The most politically incorrect series out there (which is probably why it was cancelled), Family Guy is also the most ingenuous.  Crazy humor fills every episode - not a croaker in the bunch.  If you're a big fan of the Simpsons, or really any sitcom, Family Guy is the show for you.  Don't miss your chance and pick up your copy of the Family Guy Seasons 1 & 2 today.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"This was something I had been waiting for ever since they started putting TV shows on DVD.  One of my favorite and short-lived comedies is now available to own on DVD.  That series being Family Guy, in a very nice package, ""Family Guy: Volume 1.""  All I can say is it's about freakin' time!!Yep, it's the family that was too rude and offensive for Fox to handle.  This very witty and extremely hilarious cartoon series takes comedy and satire to a whole different level.  I actually think this is much more offensive and outrageous than South Park.  With South Park, the offensive and crude humor is in your face and ""straight-to-the-point.""  With Family Guy, the offensive and sick twisted humor is very subtle in a shocking way.  The results: one of the funniest TV series to pollute your television set since Married with Children and The Simpsons.With this DVD collection, you get all 28 episodes from seasons 1 and 2.  (Not a bad deal, if you ask me!)  Relive your favorite moments with the Griffin Family as they get into the most chaotic and unbelievable situations that will have you laughing in tears.Here are the episodes:Death has a Shadow, I Never Met the Dead Man, Chitty Chitty Death Bang, Mind Over Murder, A Hero Sits Next Store, The Son Also Draws, Brian: Portrait of a Dog, Peter Peter Caviar Eater, Holy ***, Da Boom, Brian in Love, Love Thy Trophy, Death is a ***, The King is Dead, I Am Peter: Hear Me Roar, If I'm Dyin' I'm Lyin', Running Mates, A Picture's Worth a Thousand Bucks, Fifteen Minutes of Shame, Road to Rhode Island, Let's go to the Hop, *** Janet!, There's Something about Paulie, He's Too Sexy for His Fat, E Peterbus Unum, The Story on Page One, Wasted Talent, and Fore Father.The 4 DVDs also include commentaries, Internet promo spots, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.  It would've been nice to see some more extras, but I'm still pretty satisfied.The only major drawback is the picture tends to be shaky at times (you really notice it on the first episode).  Now, this isn't a major distraction and it doesn't happen non-stop, but it does happen every once and awhile.  (At least it does for me.  It's possible that it's the set that I bought or my DVD player that's causing the problem, but I'm pretty sure I read that someone else was having the same problems as well.)All in all, I am so happy that Family Guy is finally out there for everyone to own and enjoy once more.  It might've been a short-lived series, but  it's one that almost everybody has heard of and loves.  If you are down and feeling like you are having the worst day ever, pop in these babies and I assure you that you will forget all your troubles.  A very worthy purchase, indeed!Now, you can either have this nice Family Guy DVD set, or... what's in the Mystery Box!  I mean, a Mystery Box can be ANYTHING!  It can even be a freakin' Family Guy DVD set!!  We'll take the box!Get your hands on this set as soon as you can!  Trust me, it is very much worth it."	5.0	The DVD Set, or....

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3FOCW2R5LP3X4	Michael Kent	"First of all, I'd like to say that I love this show.Having said that, there are a few things that come to mind, one being the comparisons between Family Guy and The Simpsons, which others have elected to point out.Some of which include:1)Both fathers are morons who like to hang out with their friends at the local bar or sit in front of the TV.2)Both feature evil sons, though Stewie is more of an evil genious while Bart is just evil.3)Both feature mothers with annoying voices...though Lois will use her sex appeal...and both wear green.4)Both have outcast daughters...at least Lisa is smart...Meg is just a drag with her whining and her ""woe is me I'm unpopular"" attitude.5)Both feature a mix of regular and semi-regular supporting characters.6)Both families have dogs...and this is where Family Guy scores, as Brian is vastly superior in intellect and everything else to Santa's Little Helper.Without Brian and Stewie, this show would probably go nowhere and would certainly not have been resurrected as a series through its DVD sales. Do I see the show lasting sixteen years as The Simpsons has done? No, and this is the main reason... with The Simpsons, it took several viewings of episodes for me to become bored with certain ones...with Family Guy there were a few I would skip after viewing a couple of times.It'd be nice to say that these episodes stand up to the test of time, but certain ones don't hold up.Among these are:Chitty Chitty Death Bang - not that funny to begin with (with the exception of Brian's line ""I SAID runt."")the whole cult, let's drink some poisoned punch thing.DA BOOM - Too much like The Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror episodes and not consistant with the remaining episodes.THE KING IS DEAD - Just not much to offer in this one at all in the way of humor.I AM PETER, HEAR ME ROAR - Not that this is a bad episode, but that nipple sucking scene with Peter and Stewie gives me the creeps.RUNNING MATES - Just shows what a jerk Peter can be towards his wife...much like THE KING IS DEAD.A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND BUCKS - I guess I just find most episodes revolving around Chris or Meg boring and this one is right at the top.E PETERBUS UNUM - Just the title alone makes it worth skipping.Having said that, I would recommend the following as episodes worth repeated viewing:DEATH HAS A SHADOW - The first and one of the better episodes of the first season.MIND OVER MURDER - Lois becomes a stage attraction after Peter opens a bar in his basement after being placed under house arrest.BRIAN: PORTRAIT OF A DOG - Brian faces the death penalty after running out on the family after misbehaving at a dog show.BRIAN IN LOVE - Could Brian's carpet wetting problems have anything to do with his love for Lois?DEATH IS A BITCH - Death is injured, so Peter has to take over his duties (this is one The Simpsons blatently ripped off in one of their Treehouse episodes when Homer kills death, then becomes him)IF I'M DYIN', I'M LYIN' - Peter says Chris is dying so they can get their favorite show back on the air, then becomes known as a healer when Chris is ""cured"".ROAD TO RHODE ISLAND - Probably the one I watch the most. I like the song Brian and Stewie sing and the interaction between the two on the road. Brian shows once again how he is at once the most adult and the most flawed character on the show.LET'S GO TO THE HOP - Peter goes under cover to infiltrate the toad lickers at Meg's high school. Great musical number here, too.DAMMIT, JANET! - The first of the ""Stewie In Love"" themed shows.WASTED TALENT - Who knew Peter could play the piano...as long as he was wasted?If nothing else, it proves the whole Family Guy pattern that some shows hit the mark while others just splat against the wall and slide to the ground. I would still recommend this box set, for it has some very entertaining episodes, but don't be surprised if you cross some off the list along the way."	3.0	Some Episodes Stand Up To Repeat Viewing, Some Don't	2005-08-06	6	4	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2JU4FUSW1PBEC	Michael Pappalardo	I am a long-time Simpson fan...ever since the Simpsons first came on the scene back in the late 80's I would watch the show every chance I got.  But over the years the Simpsons started getting a little stale.  And that's when Family Guy came in.Family Guy is, by far, the funniest animated television series since the Simpsons were in their prime.  We're weighing in alot of shows here...Ren and Stimpy, Futurama...but there's something about Family Guy that just warrants gut-busting laughs.  Maybe it's Quagmire's ridiculous attempts at picking up women, Peter's wealth of ignorance, little Stewie's attempts at world domination, or just the random silliness thrown in to all of the episodes, such as appearences by the Kool Aid man, the 'Two Scoops' sun from the old Raisin Bran commercials, references to the old Incredible Hulk television series...and alot more.Family Guy is definitely not for the kids...all of the situations are adult and sometimes are borderline risque (which got the series cancelled, unfortunately).  The network censors and committees have no idea what they've done...they threw away a gold mine.While it could never truly replace the Simpsons, Family Guy was well on its way to becoming the new dominant animated series on Fox.  The Simpsons have been stale the last few years...Family Guy breathed new life into prime time animation that you just don't see anymore.  It's too bad, really.  In any case, don't pass up the opportunity to own every episode on DVD!!Fans will love to have all episodes on dvd, I know i'm looking forward to it.  And even if you've never seen it, then take my advice: Pick it up anyway!  You will not regret it!  The extra features are a little bare bones, but it doesn't matter.  The show has enough laughs to keep you coming back...even watching the same episode twice won't lessen the amount of laughs you get from it.  Definitely a great idea to put this classic but short lived series on DVD!	5.0	The Funniest Animated Fox Show Yet!	2003-01-25	97	78	19

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ANSAM4DY715QS	"Michael W. Schwader ""MICHAEL Schwader"""	Family Guy is one of the greatest shows on television. It's random, funny and original (but somehow makes no sense to BHogg). It's funny in two ways. 1.)It's random and comes out of nowhere and 2.)Alot of it actually comes from somewhere. Take that chicken fight for instance. Every place they end up fighting is taken from somewhere. I honestly can't remember everything 'cause I havent seen everything that they were refferencing, but the ending scene where they're fighting near the propelled airplane was from Indiana Jones. Another episode, in the scene where they invited the actress who played Lois Lane in Super Man II to dinner, the actress flips out when they mention that movie and goes into a tantrum and flips out the window. They were referrencing to the fact that she actually did go crazy during the making of that film. As for the crude and offensive language, they did this specifically for dvd.Now, why does anyone compare this to the simpsons? Peter is irresponsible and fat just like homer, but he is by no stretch of the imagination lazy like Homer and can also run without running out of breath. Homer's out of shape but Peter isn't. Meg is smart but unpopular? Since when did they ever hint her being smart? Also Meg strives to be popular her so called counterpart Lisa does not. A talkin dog, Brian who went to Brown, how does that at all compare to Santa's little helper or Snowball? The intelligent einstein, Stewie, whom always tries to make Lois' life miserable is not at all like Maggie whom loves her family and is not close to developing her motor skills. Then there's Chris, a complete moron who is unpopular and a good boy who tries hard to do what's right. This is like Bart? Um, no! Lois is 40 yetstunning and every man who meets her, wants her. She's sensible but is not at all afraid to take risks and get her hands dirty. How exactly is she like Marge?The point is is that it's funny but even funnier when you know what they're refferencing to.	5.0	In response to BHogg	2005-12-14	0	0	0

On the plus side, this film was so poorly done that it is not worth putting on your iPod or iPhone.  The jokes were simply not there--this time around they simply did a half-hearted rendition of ESB with a few dumb jokes thrown in there.  There was no real effort to actually make this funny in any way.  In short, I felt ashamed that I went out and bought this movie, because the logic seems to have been : if I enjoy stupid humor, then I must be stupid enough to laugh at anything and to buy it.

There were some jokes I felt were forced.  Again, this might be becuase it wasn't doing anything new.  Blue Harvest broke the ground, and this one is just following it.I'm not saying this was bad, hence my 4 star rating.  There were plenty of hilarious parts, but the first one was 5 stars.  It also made me a little more patient for the third one, and not as excited.So, totally worth it if you love Family Guy and loved Blue Harvest, I would just calm your excitement and don't expect the same.	4.0	Funny, but not as much as Blue Harvest	2010-02-18	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A34CJLMR1IH6G	M. Prather	"I love ""Family Guy"" and really enjoyed ""Blue Harvest.""  ""Something... Dark Side"" is another solid, well done spoof of a classic film.  However, the writers missed a lot of comic opportunities.  The jokes are either quite clever or pretty lame.  I got the feeling that ""Robot Chicken"" used a lot of the best bits in their SW: Episode 2 parody.  The good news is ""Dark Side"" looks fantastic.  Particularly the Hoth battle & asteroid field sequence.  Unfortunately, as with ""Blue Harvest"" the editors let the special effects & John Williams music do much of the work and too much of the dialogue is a word for word copy of the ""Empire"" script.  Simply, this comic parody needed more jokes!  As for the characters:  Peter Griffin is pretty annoying the whole film as Han Solo.  Lois doesn't have much to do as Princess Leia.  Seth Green is excellent as Chris aka Luke Skywalker.  Stewie is hysterical in everything.  Can't wait until the ""Jedi"" parody when they include Vader & The Emperor in more scenes.Best bits:  The Cookie Snow Monster, Dack taking on the entire Empire himself, Wildest Police Chase through the Asteroid field, Stewie & the Emperor on ""Richard Marx,"" the Meg Cave monster, Dog the Bounty Hunter, Han tortured by a Paula Cole song, the Stewie/Chris duel, ""C'mon, join the darkside dude.""  the Storm Troopers misfire ""Have we ever hit anything with these?"" ""Tom Selleck!"" and some more I can't remember.  I get the feeling ""Jedi"" aka ""We've Got A Bad Feeling"" should be even better.  Since that movie was the weakest of the original trilogy and had the Ewoks, which are a comic goldmine.  Seth and co. should just limit their reliance on special effects and put the comedy first.  We don't need to see a shot for shot re-enacment of the asteroid field chase.  Everyone's seen the original a thousand times.  Copying the effects & music that closely just makes you wish you were watching the actual ""Empire Strikes Back"" instead."	3.0	Good -  Could Have Been Funnier	2009-12-23	4	2	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3J029KBNG5MNP	Mr. Bey	The Family Guy is the funniest cartoon ever. Peter is a fat moron who doesn't have a clue about the Earth and he loves drinking beer and watching Tv. The rest of his family include Stewie the little baby who wants to conquer the world. Brina he martini loving dog, Lois his wife who tries to keep him in order, Chris who will probably grow up to be just like his dad, and Meg, the teenage drama queen. This family get sinto all sorts of predicaments but it's so funny. Peter always gives up time that would be spent with his kids to go hang out with his friends.

Not since the Simpons has a show, a cartoon nonetheless, captured the hearts of Americans everywhere ... then thrown it in their faces.This DVD features some of Seth MacFarlane's greatest work on the show, including takes that were too, ahem, outrageous, for FOX. All the characters are there, including the tough and manly Peter, his comical wife Louise, their two sons, an alcoholic, talking dog (shall I repeat that?), and a baby, with an English accent, who wants to take over the world.

Since Empire is the best of the 6 films.VERY DISAPPOINTED this did NOT air on TV 1st.  Should have.  Just because it was straight to DVD being able to cuss did NOT mean they should have & did when not necessary.Empire edition is well done but not quite as good as Blue Harvest.  Yoda fell flat.  They could have done so much with Yoda.  They did NOTHING on how the character speaks.  They could have done all sorts of things with that.WE DID NOT NEED JAMES WOODS.You will never look at the Cookie Monster the same way again.I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they waited until Christmas week to release.  Yes, I know for Christmas presents but I did NOT appreciate having to go out to VERY BUSY stores to purchase.We know, from the extras, they will be doing a Jedi edition.  I think we know what character choices they have for Meg.

I thought it was a wanna-be Simpsons. Well I, like many other people, have become a fanatic of this daring show. Since I've played the deuce out of volume 1 and 2, anything new is very welcomed. The creators really pulled out all the stops in making this DVD. It is treated like a feature film. It has a red carpet premiere with guests like the greased-up deaf guy, Kool-Aid Man, and, straight out of Chris' closet, the Evil monkey (who strikes a pose for the cameras), previews, an intermission, and a ""rap-up"" party at the Drunken Clam where the Griffin family discuss what they did during the show's cancellation (Meg did a Cher take-off for the troops and the troops took off, Lois' life really went in the sewer as one would expect. She does remind me of One Day at a Time's Bonnie Franklin). The movie is like a triple episode with all the side references one would expect from any Family Guy show. My favorites: Peter as Richard Dawson on Family Feud, what blinded Ray Charles, Stewie and Brian playing a Pac-Man game ""I'm not going to get the fruit there's a ghost right there!,"" a twisted Sam Adams commercial and Bugs Bunny finally getting what's coming to him; even the National Diabetes Assoc gets it. The wacky, waving, inflatable, arm-flailing tube man is one of the worst and most annoying. Oh, yeah, and the movie...Stewie takes swimming lessons and, in an attempt to eliminate a rival, has a near-death experience. This scare is seen as a sign for Stewie to change his ways. First, he becomes nice to the point of inducing vomit. Then he takes to the bottle (not the baby bottle) which really induces vomit. Brian takes him to a bar to make him so sick he will never drink again. Horrace the bartender asks of the baby ""Hey, is he 18?"" Brian responds, ""Horrace, the drinking age is 21."" Horrace then say ""Oh"" and leaves. After a hangover and automobile mishap, Stewie decides he needs to find himself and hopes to find someone just like him who understands him well enough to guide him. While watching the news, he spots a man in San Francisco (where else?) who looks just like him. Just a coincidence? His real father? An even closer relation? Stewie and Brian take Quagmire's ""Cross C*ntry"" RV to find out. In his quest to find himself, Stewie learns things about the future that are not at all pleasant. The DVD runs about an hour and a half and includes uncensored audio track, commentary from Seth MacFarlane, the cast and writers, and ""animatic comparison."""	4.0	"""Soon be in the $3.99 bin at your local car wash""---Tricia Takanawa"	2005-10-03	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2FAYH6JQY8I03	"Naive Pegasus ""bobawedge"""	"If anyone is a fan of animated cartoons with a certain amount of adult-based humor, this is the set you have to get.  There are currently two volumes out, but this is the best to start off with.  Whereas the 3rd season set has 21 episodes, this first set gives you the 7 extra episodes from their short first season.  So- same price, more episodes.That being said, this set is hilarious in every aspect.  I could spend pages of text describing individual bits of hilarity from each scene of each episode, but that would just be mundane and unneeded.  The humor ranges all over the spectrum, and some of it isn't quite suitable for younger children (if they see it, just hope they don't understand the sexual innuendo).  The commentary is funny as well, although it is only for occasional episodes in the set.  They also did an interesting thing with the commentary- it is actually rated R.  There is a warning saying that the commentary is not suitable for people under the age of 18, since they made the decision to allow profanity for the commentary.This does not bother me, but some people may be more sensitive to those kinds of things.  But if that offends you, I doubt that you'd appreciate Family Guy's humor.  The show is like a combination of The Simpsons' family based wry humor with South Park's outrageous lack of inhibitions.  All in all, it equates into hours of laughter.This DVD set is simply hilarious, as has been stated repeatedly.  If you've ever seen an episode of the show, you'd realize that.

Rumor has it, it IS coming back in spring - HOORAY!  Peter Griffin, Brian the Dog, and Stewie the homicidal baby genius are a riot.  If you are easily offended, or slow to grasp a joke, don't bother.  The jokes fly out of the characters one after another, and are hilariously crude.  Family Guy easily beats out The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead as the very best humorous cartoon.  We have both Vol 1 &amp; 2 and watch them constantly.

Telling more would ruin the fun for fans of the show who haven't seen this yet, but in between all of it is the same kind of irreverant humor that fans of Family Guy would come to expect, making good on it's promise of being uncensored (to watch the uncensored version you must go to the Language Selection on the Main Menu and select it) and also being something you'll not likely forget.  All in all, whether you're a die hard or casual fan of the show, consider this DVD a must have; it's just a shame that there weren't more extras thrown in for the price.	5.0	A must for Family Guy fans	2006-01-13	0	0	0

No wait, one would have to have a mind, and the knowledge and/or the experience of pop culture, and pop world history to get most of the jokes in the show. The title alludes that it is a show for the family but it is certainly not. And guys, your chick, your wife or any female around when you turn this thing on will not like it. They will find something better to do while you watch it alone or with your guy friends. Now is that what you want? Oh. You say you're a collector and know the value of such things in the future market? Perhaps Fox saw the writing on the wall when the Family Guy writers took the path they took. It's Peter, Peter, Peter. The Simpsons is a slightly better show because it sometimes has stories focused on Marge, Lisa, Maggie and not only Homer or Bart. Maybe the Family Guy guys should consider writing more for Meg and Lois--the poor things always lose. (I don't think The Simpsons draw a big female audience either--gals don't care for animated shows as much as guys do.)The rolling commentary given by whoever worked on the show was disappointing because they go silent when some of the show's grossly odd scenes show up, begging to be explained. It made me cry ""What were they thinking of here?""A final thing: we've all gotten used to the way this show puts its humor across: the out of control cut-to vignette that has nothing to do with the main story line and usually summoned when one of the characters says ""just like the time when Peter, celebrity's name, historical figure, or pop culture name did 'something.' You'd think it would get tired after the run of this show but we've have gotten used to it to our detriment. On a recent viewing of the current broadcast run Stewie summons up a vignette and pauses. After a good 10 seconds he looks up at the ceiling, rolls his eyes and says, ""Oh, I thought we had something to come in here.""Tag this DVD a guilty pleasure that you can watch now on reruns in major markets instead of purchasing."	4.0	Perhaps Fox was correct to cancel this show in the first place.	2008-06-18	5	0	5

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A35P7ED76HLI94	Nicholas Walters	The Griffins, what can I say.  They are all freakin demented.  Peter, Lois, Meg, Chris, Stewie, and Brian are all escapees from a mental asylum, and are all hilarious.  The first season was good, and rife with plenty of jokes and wrong humor-( ex Scooby Doo meets CSI, Sesame Street meets NYPD Blue, and other other sick homages from Seth McFarlane).  Peter is the stupidist, but the funniest character.  Lois is good as the housewife with a wild streak.  But the best is Stewie, the maniacal 1 year old who considers himself free of his mom- Ovarian Bastille.  The Griffins are at their best being chased by Death, PEter going to sensitivity training/trying to breast feed Stewie himself, and of course dealing with Chris and Meg's issues.  Brian is good as the alcoholic but sharp tongued and strangely intellectual family pet.  The Family Guy is well worth the price.  Watch the old unedited versions as long as you can. Since Fox is returning them to TV, they may water down the Griffins.  I have to give McFarlane kudos for being warped and twisted enough to place Adam West (TV's Batman, as Mayor Adam West of the Griffins' hometown of Quahog, RI.)  Although one unsettling thing is this- why the crap is Peter naked every other episode?  Or in a thong?  Ugh, what's next Michael Moore nude photos?  Jeeeez.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1QWGA44V1B1E8	"Nick Lombardi ""Nick_Name"""	"One thing history has taught me is that oftentimes people will defend to the death something that is horrible, and that the more horrible that thing is, the more those who oppose it are attacked either physically or in character.Enter Family Guy.This show is a piece of crap. I figured I should be straight up about my opinion now, before I start this review. I hate, hate, HATE this show. I hate the characters, I hate the laziness of the writing, I hate the voice work, and as for the animation...okay, the animation's not bad.I tried to like this show, I really did. And I tried not to judge it unfairly either as I did with South Park, a show which I originally passed judgement on without watching, and which I later recanted my opinion that it was stupid. I know when I'm wrong. And when South Park later referred to Family Guy's writers as a bunch of manatees floating beach balls filled with random non-sequiturs around in large aquarium tanks, I knew at once that I was right to recant my prejudice of South Park. Admittedly, I did the same thing with Beavis & Butthead, and upon giving that series a second chance I realized that it wasn't dumb, but that it was MAKING FUN of dumb.Family Guy, on the other hand, is just dumb.I watched about eight or nine episodes of Family Guy because, like I said, I really wanted to like it, and I wanted to be fair about it. I also made sure that the episodes spanned many of the show's different seasons, because I recognize that the first season of a TV series is never as good as the subsequent ones, and I REALLY wanted to be fair. And I did not laugh once, not once. The only time I even came close to cracking a grin was at Norm McDonald's performance as Death. Then never again. And that's because Family Guy is a truly bad show. The writing is so worthless that it defies us to laugh, and that's because the writers don't understand parody. Nor do they have to, because the fans don't care. ""Hey, you remember the time Gary Coleman and Bruce Willis went to a wrestling match and ran into Lady Gaga"" is not a parody of anything. It is not a social commentary, it is not contemporary criticism, and it is probably not even plot relevant. It's just ""stuff"" that happens, and then the episode continues on as if it didn't happen, which means every script of this show is likely a mishmash of scraps of ideas the writers fished out of the garbage and glued together.Now comes the part where defenders of the show will come at me. ""You're just too dumb to get it."" Okay, fine...then you, with your infinite intelligence, can explain it to me. Give me the SparkNotes rundown of Seth MacFarlane's genius, because not only is Family Guy terrible but the spinoffs are too. Here's another one I've heard: ""You hate the show because it's so popular,"" which of course is the dumbest defense imaginable. Here's another one I've heard: ""Family Guy is just like the Simpsons."" No. That's like comparing Coca-Cola to sugar water.I'm not asking for deep meaning in my cartoon shows. I don't tune into a TV show in the hopes of seeing Dostoevsky Theater. Sometimes I'm not even asking for meaning at all. There's no meaning in Wile E. Coyote falling off a cliff after the Roadrunner escapes him.

An entire remake of the original Star Wars trilogy in an animated format using the Family Guy characters and sense of humor?  Brilliant! Yeah, there were parts that felt like they were reaching a little bit, but overall a lot of fun.  If you have a special Star Wars section in your movie collection, it make a really cool addition even if you don&#8217;t like Family Guy.

However, I wish I would've gone with the DVD version since Blue Harvest and Something, Something, Something, Darkside weren't originally aired in HD and weren't re-mastered in any way for their blu-ray release.  I would've liked to see the animators take that additional step since they decided to release on both formats.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A195IC9EIH4M5V	No Bollocks	"A little off-beat and funny without being very deep. It has become quite popular since its original failure as a primetime cartoon on Fox. Family Guy is one of the few shows to be dropped and then picked back up by the same network after a hiatus. It has been successful in the past few years on Fox's Sunday night lineup and nightly on the Cartoon Network. Futurama looks to be following suit by returning to tv next year.I bought this because show is entertaining, but I am becoming more cautious about purchasing DVDs like these because I don't necessarily like supporting blatant liberalism in my entertainment. Family Guy has exhibited more political bias as it has gone along. I love political humour in small doses, but I'm sick of all the anti-conservative stuff that has not been very original or funny.The best word to describe the show is ""irreverent."" You do not want to watch this with your grandmother or even your parents - they may not approve.There are not tons of extras - fine by me. The episodes are all there and you can ""Play All"" in order for hours of entertainment. The commentary is pretty interesting."	4.0	Very Funny	2007-07-03	2	1	1

I loved Blue Harvest.  I've watched it over and over again, its hilarious.  Something, Something, Something, Darkside was very disappointing, not nearly as funny as Blue Harvest.  The jokes were flat, and rushed through.  I get the use of all of Quohog's residents playing their various parts, but the Yoda character was really bad. Could the dialoge have been any lamer? There was nothing funny whatsoever in that entire sequence.

Honestly these first seasons are absolutely terrible, these seasons illustrate how they were trying to borrow from the Simpsons too heavily and not very good at it as well. It was only after they found what works for them (cheap cude and over the top) and flash backs later on which make them worth watching.  I suggest to skip these first few seasons as they add little to the plot and really make for some aweful comedy.	1.0	These seasons were terrible	2008-08-06	15	4	11
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AIREXPIGM9L5P	nycybergal	These two DVD's, for season one and two, tell you why.  The repeats on cartoon network for those who couldn't or didn't appreciate or catch on the first time it was around only bolstered Family Guy's triumphant return to -- the very same channel that cancelled them, FOX.  *snicker*  Man, I would've loved to have been a fly on the wall for that second go-around meet between MacFarlane and Fox - I'm sure McFarlane had to hold his sides in so he wouldn't hurt himself from laughing so hard.  Sweet justice, my friend; something you see very rarely happen for creative people who are truly edgy and not trying to play it safe spoonfeeding the American public with the same old garbage.While American Dad is trying to find its feet, I LOVE Family Guy and if you have an American sense of humor (read visual, bold, cheap, brassy, crassy and ballsy) then you'll get the jist of the show with no problem.  I love the Simpsons too, but the shows display two distinct flavorings of the same thing - flawed stupid American families put under the mircoscope, roasted over the flame and lampooned in their own original offbeat American way.	5.0	Family Guy - the ONLY cancelled show to come back	2005-05-20	5	4	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3JG72P0KY27HW	Open Mike	My theory about Family Guy is that Seth MacFarlane (creator, animator, producer and most of the voices) ought to continue making Family Guy episodes EXCLUSIVELY to be released on DVD. That way he does not have to worry about the monkeys at the FCC or any other censorship board crawling down his throat. Family Guy is the torch bearer of adult cartoon comedy: it picks up where the sixth or seventh season of The Simpsons left off (anything after season seven is garbage, or at least inconsistent) and carries us into the 21st Century with an evolved sense of humor - infinitely more political and subversive than anything you have ever seen.The show is roughly based on the Simpsons format, or rather on the post-Reagan sitcom format consisting of a dysfunctional blue collar family, circa Rosanne and Married with Children. The father is an oaf, the kids need therapy and the mom is a classic product of the repressive 1980s model of the nuclear housewife. Add one acholohic dog and a closetted homosexual baby bent on conquering the world and you have a cast made in comic heaven. Unlike the Simpsons this series is far less realistic, with talking dogs and babies and slapstick that is totally outrageous; but similar to the Simpsons, Family Guy takes real-life scenarios such as welfare fraud, racism or sexual harassment and places them within a totally ludicrous context. Take Peter, for example, who with a 100,000$ welfare cheque purchases Michaelangelos David. I cannot get into the details of each episode, but for what this series is worth you will not be dissapointed investing in this series. Each and EVERY character is priceless and manages to make you laugh until your stomach hurts. Unlike the Simpsons, where Lisa is rarely funny and extremely irritating, Family Guy is virtually amoral (void of morals) and therefore does not rely on any characters to act as a moral anchor to compensate for the rest of the casts antics. If you like watching or listening to George Carlin, whose comedy can make your stomach turn as much as it can make you cry laughing, you will love the confrontational-meets-hysterical comedy stylings of Family Guy.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3GFB0GQI8G87	Oscar Wilde + Hemmingway = me	First of all, you can NOT say that Family Guy isn't original. Yes, it resembles the Simpsons because it is a cartoon, but there's a lot more to being animated that lets Family Guy have its own type of humor much different than that of the Simpsons.The writing is completely different from the Simpsons. Being a fan of both shows and having watched more than 90% of the Simpsons and 100% of Family Guy, you can clearly differentiate between the styles of writing and the jokes that are thrown at the audience.Simpsons has their own way of approaching humor wheras Family Guy is almost all slapstick. Simpsons has in depth writing that make you dissect a joke to actually get it (sometimes having more than one or two meanings) whereas in Family Guy, it just happens on screen for you to watch and laugh.You can't say that the plotlines are the same when they are completely divergent. Yes, I'm sure you can make many connections about the two, but you can also make many connections to any other show about a family on television. Married with Children resembles both shows. They're both shows about families that make you laugh. Oh, they're also all FOX shows.You have to give Family Guy the credit that it rightfully deserves. For a show that came on, captured audiences (while constantly being moved around during the week), getting taken off the air AND coming back on because of their unbelievable DVD sales does in fact mean something.It means that it's grabbed and audience that watches it for a reason; because it's just funny. from Peter's stupidity and laughter at poty humor, to Quagmire's unrepressed sexual urges, to Joe's serious moral and violent tendencies, to Mayor Adam West's shouting matches, this show is downright hilarious.If you want to laugh when you were a kid (you know that squirting milk out your nose, pee your pants, laugh till you can't breathe and passout from lack of oxygen... almost) well this is the show for you. I'm a fan of both simpsons and family guy and they both have a place in my heart, but all in all, I think Family Guy's risque approach to humor will win over more fans from the Simpsons and from South Park if you actually sit down, have an open mind and enjoy slapstick humor. It's a mix between The 3 stooges, Simpsons, South Park, Married with Children. It has numerous flashbacks to the 60's 70's 80's (whenever) and talks about anything from music, to race relations, to world domination. Give it a shot. Oh, Gumble 2 Gumble was awesome.

Family Guy was as funny as the Simpsons was in it's prime. Now the Simpsons has gotten to be pretty bland humor. Family Guy had fresh jokes even though much of it was directly copied from the Simpsons. But Family Guy took things to the next level. Many people might be offended by jokes about Stewie egging on OJ Simpson to kill Nichole but it's not meant to be taken seriously. The star of the show really is Stewie even though most of the time the stories are about Peter. One of my favorite lines is when Peter says ""Was that supposed to be a joke?

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2YKAT76SKAP4C	Paul Byers	"I never truly understood the brillance of this show until I bought this DVD. This set contains 28 episodes, which is quite a bit for $$$. ""Family Guy"" features mostly low-brow humor, but it is usually pretty funny. But the thing is, it constantly throws gags at your face with dream sequences and other bizarre stuff. This sheer over-the-topness is what makes watching all these episodes great.Technically, thsi disc is up to par with the other fine FOX TV cartoon DVD releases. The color is sharp and their are no problems with framing or ""jiggling"" with the picture. The animation is a bit crude but that relates to the source material. Audio range is above-average as well using both speakers solidly but nothing too overpowering.However, the extra features are not exactly what you would expect. First up is several promos running 15-30 seconds long that were used on Fox.Com to promote the pilot of Family Guy after the Super Bowl. They are in excellent condition. Next is commentaries. Fox has put two commentaries on each disc, but they shouldn't have even bothered doing that. I found, like a previouis reviewer also found, large gaps in-between comments and not much meat on them. Even with 3-4 people, it is very boring and no one has really much to say. It is very disappointing. Finally, there is a four minute featurette on the fourth disc. This was another promo tool used by Fox to promote the pilot, and while there is a bit more information on this extra than on all the others, it still is limited to a quick four minutes. While there was some effort put into these extras, they are a far cry from the quanity (or quality) of other FOX TV DVD's, mostly notably ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"".I recommend this ""Family Guy"" DVD not because of its extras, but its episodes. While I was never a big fan of this show when it aired on FOX, I am a fan now. All episodes are clean-up for the DVD and this is a must-buy for fans and some non-fans alike.

When it was taken off the air, I downloaded every episode just to remind me of what a great show it was. Now, to think that I'm actually going to be able to own it on DVD blows my mind! Call me crazy, but this was the best thing to happen to television since the invention of color. I think the first season is the best. It is a little more edgey and less censored. I've never met a person in my life who didn't enjoy this show. Peter Griffin for president!!	5.0	Family guy is the best	2003-04-13	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1AM62NSDXJ3F7	"Peter Griffin ""Go Cardinals!!!!!!!!!!"""	"In response to the kid's review from May 15, 2005, I didn't care for Family Guy either when I was younger. But as I became more aware of my surroundings and world, I found Family Guy a more juicy and edgy show than The Simpsons. In no way am I saying that I don't like The Simpsons, but I just feel that Family Guy has an edge to it that The Simpsons lost in 1995. This is not a case of one show being better than the other, but it's a part of the cycle of television shows. The Simpsons is sadly, slowly drying out and dying and Family Guy is full of life, strong political undertones, and juicy storylines which have yet to have been exposed.And personally, The Simpsons has become too streamlined to the public and Family Guy has more of a ""cult"" following, if you will. The dry wit and humor of FG creator Seth McFarlane have put him and his show head and shoulders above the rest."	5.0	Very Funny, Yet Also Wryly Intelligent	2005-05-17	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3VIHZUSNOGWFY	Peter Olafson	... drop back a bit and check out this feature length one from 2005. If not as sharp edged as seasons 1-3, it represents the post-cancellation show's apogee to date: brightly written and often achingly funny. (Glaring exception: the spectacularly unfunny gag at Brian's grave.) My only complaint is that the linking dialogues that hold the thing together -- unlike The Simpsons Movie, it's transparently three episodes that were stitched together -- are done with entirely straight faces. You'd think they might have inserted some self-referential parody here. But apart from these shortfalls, this is top-drawer stuff. (And though later unstitched for broadcast at the end of Season Four, this is the only place you can find them on DVD.)	4.0	If you're disappointed by the pedestrian episodes that dominate recent seasons ...	2012-08-28	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3IOA5W8GX6YZ9	"Pete Sayek ""PeteRFNY"""	"""The Family Guy"" is without doubt the funniest animated series to air on TV. It makes the Simpsons look like the Power Puff Girls. And it is more consistent (and less finger-pointing preachy) than South Park.If you have never seen the show before, but love anything FUNNY, you will NOT be disappointed. If you saw the show, and miss it, BUY IT.Notes: I have read that the missing ""Weinstein"" episode will appear later on Vol. 2 in September. As for the missing scenes, I don't know the reasons for the ""JFK"" scene being edited, but the ""Bin Laden"" edit MAY (and I emphasise ""MAY"") be due to the fact that series creator Seth MacFarlane was supposed to be on one of the planes that left Boston on 9/11 but missed the flight. Who knows.Anyone know of any other missing scenes? Those were the only two that jumped out at me. Still, edits or no, order this set. NOW."	5.0	Forget the rest - try the best!	2003-04-30	2	2	0

Family Guy happens to be one of my favorite animated shows besides South Park and The Simpsons. There are lots of gags in this 3 part movie. At the begining of the movie they have movie trailer parodies. Like The Littlest bunny (A disney parody) The movie has a ton of laughs. The only i'm sad about is that they don't have Special Features. I bet if they brought this movie to theaters insted of releasing it directly to DVD it would have been a box office hit.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2EJP1CB7YGPNK	Philip B. Yochim	"I just got turned onto the ""Family Guy"" this summer, and I'm hooked. So I was pretty eager to see this little flick. It was worth the wait. I could have waited longer too.Everyone's favorite evil baby genius, Stewie Griffin, takes off with Brian, America's greatest Brown University-educated, alcoholic, talking dog to San Francisco after Stewie sees a man on television who looks just like him. Stewie assumes this man must be his real father.The story initially looked like it was going to be another ""road to"" send-up with Stewie and Brian, but for the most part, Stewie goes it alone.Stewie finds the man, but discovers he's not Stewie's father, but another, even stranger, relation. (No spoiler here.)For the most part, the humor is on par for the usual Family Guy stuff, but many angles really seem to drag on after awhile and go nowhere. The only runway red carpet party ultimately made no sense at all. Drew Barrymore was involved, and that explains much of it."	3.0	"Did you make an ""F"" joke?"	2005-12-08	8	4	4

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A11WK2RC35V11P	Phillip Wells	Okay, so I went out and bought this on blu ray the day it came out because I LOVED Blue Harvest. I am a moderate fan of Family Guy and like it's creator I also grew up with Star Wars. Maybe I had my expectations too high but I thought this was crap compared to the first one. I knew it was 54 minutes going into it, that didn't bother me. It just lacked the comedy of Blue Harvest. It was almost boring to watch. The table read on the bonus features was hastily shot and you cant even see all the cast members. This disc was not worth the 20 bux I paid for it on sale. Wait for it on TV unless you are a die hard Family Guy or Star Wars fan.

However if Fox gets it's hands on this one it will get watered down quite a bit.  Why not put it on the Cartoon Network where the execs are more concerned with making a series work? I'd like to see more DVD direct releases because they cater to the audience more than the TV show ever could!This isn't for kids, however I hope that Futurama does come back in the same format.	5.0	Is Stewie really Barry Ween, Boy Genius?  .	2005-10-02	1	0	1

I feel that there are several scenes within that would not stand suitable for television, which pertain towards racial exploitation and some subtle sexual references. However, the scene with Brian and Stewie getting drunk together is charming, and especially the spoof with Wilford Brimley in the diabetic commerical is absolutely priceless. More proof that Seth McFarlane can come up with wittier lines as well as catchier pop-culture-hook spoofs than Matt Groening and other comtemporary satiricists.	4.0	A gem for any Family Guy fanatic	2005-10-09	1	1	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AB1UMC7SB9D7Z	"PolarisDiB ""dibness"""	The idea is simple: if you like the show, you'll like this.  If you don't like the show, you won't like this.  It's just that simple.A bootlegged copy of the movie is shown during the local newscast...  Stewie's Untold Story!  In it, Stewie and family go through the usual set of adventures, including some incidents at a pool while learning to swim, and then suddenly Stewie sees a man with the likeness of himself on television...  and now he's preoccupied with the thought that Peter is way too stupid to be his father, and he must find this man who is obviously his real father.Since it isn't a televised show but a straight-to-DVD movie, this thing should have been done a little differently methinks.  The creators now had an opportunity to go in and make the gags and stuff go way beyond the reserve they needed for the television censors.  Thus I was disappointed to see mostly that really nothing changed except maybe a few more curse-words.  Later I learned that it IS, in fact, intended for television.The idea is that they went and released this DVD before the televised special, which is how it should be seen.  This doesn't make sense to me, so it's either stupid or brilliant, marketing-wise.  All I know is that I have no reason to watch it when it comes on television... I already own it.Still, it had some very neat laughs and the usual allusions to other works--my favorite part--plus we get to see the Scary Monkey outside of the house for once.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3JYW6GWR9CS5P	"purerockfury ""Gorillas"""	Family Guy is the funniest show ever made. Period. This is a show that while maybe infantile and crude was firing on all cylinders at all times and never ceased to be hilarious. Every character from any sitcom ever made from Ralph Kramdan to George Jefferson to Jack Tripper to Homer Simpson to Eric Cartman is represented here in some way, shape or form...only with the volume turned up way past ten.Everyone and their grandmother was ready to jump all over Family Guy from the moment the first commercial aired with the inevitable &quot;Simpsons-rip off&quot; comments in tow. However, NO ONE expected the barnburner of a show that they received when Tom Tucker stated upon Quohog's TV tower on the fritz &quot;I'm gonna go get drunk and beat up some midgets.&quot; followed by his co-anchor Diane stating &quot;And I just plain don't like black people.&quot;. Where the Simpsons took its time and built it's momentum, Family Guy jumped out from the start with racy humor that was offensive, brutal, outlandishly strange and most of all, absolutely hysterical. Family Guy pulled no punches, left no stone unturned and left you in tears with it's uncanny pop culture references that seemingly came out of nowhere and left me with trouble breathing and a bright red face from uncontrollable laughter.Despite Fox's idiotic cancellation of Family Guy, the DVD's are a welcome addition to planet Earth. I can only guess that Fox is kicking themselves daily for letting this show go out the window the way that they did, only to replace such an amazing show with idiotic dramas like the OC and brain-numbing reality TV. No thank you, I'll take Family Guy on DVD and continue laughing.	5.0	Wit Beyond Wit	2003-09-16	3	1	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A68TR0LT23UGQ	P. Vega	Reasons I will not be buying this:1.)

This is a single f'in episode of a tv show. The hell with it coming right before Forrest Gump in my collection. Leading me to my second reason for never touching this beast...2.) Who the f*** do you think you are charging hardworking people in this economic state 20 bloody dollars for an episode of a tv show in which they just blatantly rip off a 30 year old movie, which retails for about half the price and tenfold the length.Hey Seth McFarle.....F*** your martini drinking self.

If you watched any episodes you know that it is more mature than the simpsons and in my opinion a lot funnier.  They cancel family guy but keep futurama?  Sure the show wasn't getting the great ratings it had from the past seasons but that was because they kept moving the timeslot.  I wish for the family guy to come out with new episodes but i'll take the dvd box set as a consolation prize.  I have all the episodes on my cpu but i must own them on dvd.

After viewing disc 1, I just have to assume it was a primitive ""upconvert"" to the Blu-Ray format.  There was NO improvement in the sharpness of the drawn lines, colors are standard-def bland, and stair-stepping is evident in the resolution.  Of course, disc 1 is still full screen as expected, so ""Family Guy: Blue Harvest"" gains absolutely nothing on Blu-Ray over the previous DVD version.Now, the other two discs are very good on Blu-Ray with sharp lines and colors that really pop!  Nice transfer, and the Blu-Ray difference in quality is striking even for animated content without complex textures.All 3 discs are entertaining parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy, but like the TV show I'm sure they will offend some people some of the time.  You probably knew that already ; )In summary, if you already own the first two, go ahead and buy ""It's a Trap"" on Blu-Ray or DVD to complete your library.  New good laughs, even if not as fresh as the first two.  If you don't have the both the first and second films, it might be cheaper to go ahead and buy this TRILOGY package instead!"	4.0	Great Blu-Ray Transfers except for the DVD-quality Disc 1	2010-12-22	55	48	7

I mean, I've been hearing people abusing Family Guy just because people think it is ripping off or something. Let's end this now: The Simpsons (which I've been watching since I was born, no really I was, my folks love it and made me watch it) is like a 100 years old and it will go on forevermore and such. The end.Family Guy is a funny show. It is great in its own respects. The characters are wonderful. My favourites are Brian and Stewie. I like that dead-pan voice Seth McFarlane uses on Brian. He's an alcoholic dog who's in love with his best friend's wife. You don't get better than that!I've been turning to Family Guy over the last few years. South Park used to be one of my most-watched, but now I feel all the heart has left that show. It seems Matt Stone and Trey Parker actually want the Emmys.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2K9FGSRD400EF	Rayne Labelle	I was disappointed in this release. There were a lot of missed opportunities here. I watched the table read in the bonus section, and there were a lot of hilarious moments that could have been added to the story. Some parts on the DVD weren't all that necessary, they could have removed those and added parts from the table read, and it would have been better. I know it would have been longer, but a lot funnier, too. A lot of the extra dialogue was laugh-out-loud funny. And, there was one segment at the end of the table read that went with the first movie. Listen to it, you'll know what I mean. So I think they should go back and redo this (even though they won't, but I think it's a good idea), and add some of those segments instead. This could have been a much better movie than it was. It was still funny, but lacking a lot. I mean, it's DVD, for heaven's sake! Even a full animatic of the original concept would have been a plus. They do it for full seasons, why not a special? If you're going to put something like this out, do it right, or not at all! Don't rush it just because of the holidays.(On a side note, Another thing I'm also tired of is the stupid eco-cases. That's what this special came in, as well as a lot of other dvds. These can get your movies wrecked if you're not careful. They're not made good. I keep switching them out for regular ones that I bought. If they're going to put these in less quality cases, then charge less. 'Nuff said.)	3.0	Something, Something, Something....missing	2009-12-27	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A63WW5UC6KU18	R. Burney	"I saw my first episode of ""The Family Guy"" about a year ago, not long before it got cancelled. I'm one of those people who loves a sick joke or a tasteless stab at society, and so I naturally laughed myself silly watching this show. It's a lot like ""The Simpsons"" in that it parodies a lot of things about American culture (and other cultures too) and isn't afraid to make a tasteless joke at someone else's expense.But where ""The Simpsons"" stops, ""Family Guy"" begins. Peter, one of the main characters, is even larger and dumber than Homer&#65533;almost aggravatingly so&#65533;but his stupidity contrasts well with the unexpected intelligence of Baby Stuey. Stuey is probably a year old, but he talks like a college grad and curses like a sailor. That and he's constantly plotting to kill his mom.Add to this a talking dog (who is always one to make the snide remark) and a refreshing disregard for being ""appropriate,"" and you have the greatest show that never should have been cancelled. I learned that it wasn't Fox that took the show off the air, but a dispute between the cast members. Either way, it's a shame.If you're the overly sentimental type or if you get easily offended, skip this show (as it will probably just frustrate you). However, if you like ""The Simpsons"" at all, you'll love ""Family Guy.""The DVD includes some commentaries on some of the episodes, behind-the-scenes stuff, and deleted scenes.

It is full of the raunchy comedy and politically charged humor you see on virtually all FG episodes. The casting continues to remain sharp and the humor like why to join the dark side is spot on. This is not for people who watch the show on Fox as there are no holds barred and the language can be raw at times.Still I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Family Guy and is a fan on the show.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3FDK9JTTAD97G	"RDB ""The Little Things that Count"""	"I got this DVD for Christmas and if I knew what I know now. I would have suggested to my brother not to buy this waste of money. Looks like Seth and the gang of writers are losing their touch with comedy, same quality as with the Family Guy TV shows = more misses than hits.The last Star Wars parody made fun of the plot holes, it didn't have to rely on cheap comedy like the Juicy Fruit gum commercial, Don Knott's head on the Taun-Taun, intestinal worms for the AT-AT's, breaking the rule of three - the rule of three states that any comedy bit repeated more than 3 times shows a lack of comedy writing skills and is just filling in time such as (Peter's heavy breathing when cutting open the don-don, shooting the space worm in the asteroid field). The song and dance routine Chris did with his head ranks up there with Herbert's ""Dirty Dancing"" from the first one. Mort as Lando, thats seriously reaching for comedy. The Rocky montage inter-cut with Dolph Lundgrens training scenes is another example of filling in time.I could go on with the misses but it would be like writing a review of one of their TV shows. The hits were very few - Consuala the cleaning lady was hilarious, the Wompa-cookie monster was good (better if he didn't have the dialog), Han being frozen with his butt facing out was good.  All in all very few laugh-out loud moments and a lot of groans and misses. It doesn't have the replay value as ""Blue Harvest"" and this DVD would most likely just sit on my shelf and gather dust. I'm sure the other reviews will fill in the stuff I missed."	3.0	More misses than hits	2009-12-27	2	1	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2NUYRIE014C6S	R-D	Now i know that this Star Wars / Family Guy II : Something, Something, Something Dark Side hasn't been released yet. My review is of a different matter. I do not like the fact that i am paying the full price of a dvd or blu-ray and only be subjected to 22 minutes worth of play time. What they NEED to do with the Star Wars parody project is ADD them to a Family Guy Complete Collection or a Season (insert number here) box set. It is a total rip-off to pay these prices for 1 episode on 1 disc and have it be just 22 minutes. That being said i am boycotting the Star Wars specials until they come out with a Complete Collection.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2P2NFY2WOAG6K	"Redkelt ""-redkelt"""	Although Family Guy is one of the funniest shows on TV, with unmatched humor, that humor is better placed in a 30 minute show instead of an 88 minute DVD.  The jokes were funny and the had all the appeal of the show, however it seemed to be three shows wrapped together and placed in an 88 minute long movie.  The characters seemed a little off, not quite the same feel as in the show, almost as if this wasn't created by the Family Guy staff but by an outside writing team.  Great to watch one time, but this one won't be found in my DVD collection.	3.0	Great Show Not so Great Movie	2005-10-04	7	2	5

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	ANGOXFISYCIGJ	Reid Mccormick	Seth MacFarlane and his team come together again to spoof Episode V in the good ol' Family Guy tradition. Though not as creative and funny as Blue Harvest (Family Guy's send up on Episode IV), Something Something Darkside is still very clever and witty.As stated in the commentary by MacFarlane and his team, spoofing Empire Strikes Back is much challenging than A New Hope. With numerous storylines and a number of new characters, the Family Guy universe has only a limited amount it can add. While Blue Harvest felt like a spoof of Star Wars, Darkside feels more like a typical Family Guy episode with typical cutaways and reflexivity.If you are a Family Guy fan or a Star Wars fan (I am not sure how you could be a fan of one and not be a fan of the other) you will love this DVD.	4.0	Funny	2010-01-22	0	0	0

Also, I read a retarded review comparing Family guy to the Simpsons that was completely innappropriate. Peter and Louis Griffin were both ideas taken from the Flinstones. Brian I can imagine was an idea probably taken from Charlie Brown (Snoopy-- remember that family guy episode with a bit on Hogans Run...) and Stewie... well hes just a character created in seth mcfarlane's sick mind. The only thing the two shows have in common is that they are based on retarded white suburban families. and if you think that Family Guy is for idiots with low iq's and have to spend hours on the thesaurus looking for superfluous words even you don't understand, just to make and idiotic point about a show you hate and have no reason to be reviewing but do so just to feal superior on a website where nobody knows who the hell you are or why you're even attempting to make a point... then you should punch yourself in the nuts and find a corner to sit in because you're stunningly ignorant.If you have a sick sense of humor like me, then you should definatly buy season one/two and even three.

With that it mind, i was hesitant to pick up this special; however, i am extremely glad that i did.I won't go into specifics/spoilers but i will say this: the Blu-ray looks and sounds AMAZING. The special itself was surprisingly funny with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Bottom line is this: if you're a fan and you're on the fence about this, don't be. You will enjoy this. It's better than the entirety of the previous season's episodes, save for ""Not all dogs go to heaven"" (the ep. with the entire cast of TNG).One final note: this is NOT for children.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AE96CWKCHQCQX	R. Matheson	"I'll preface this by saying I'm NOT a fan of the Family Guy; by which I mean I've never seen the show, not that I have anything against the show.  Just never got around to getting into it, y'know?  I am, however, a lifelong, diehard (insert more hyperbole here) fan of Star Wars.  I'm hoping that anyone who's a fan of both has already purchased this or has seen it, so this review is geared sort of toward my fellow ""noobs to Family Guy"".So, for 20-something bucks, this seemed like a good buy.  Some cheap entertainment on Blu-Ray, no less!  Well, the picture quality, as many others have said, was not something that justifies a blu-ray treatment.  I mean, we're not talking Pixar here, guys.  It's a cartoon.  I got the regular DVD of Archer and it was frankly kinda gorgeous.  I was more impressed by the quality of the Archer DVD than I was by the Family Guy Blu-Ray.As far as the box set's treatment of Star Wars, I honestly can't remember a Star Wars scene that was left out of this!  It literally tells the whole story of the original Star Wars trilogy in like an hour and a half.  With lots of parody, of course.  A lot of it is funny.  A couple parts made me LOL Out Loud (tip of the hat to Monk... miss ya, man).  But a few of the jokes were taken too far (by that, I mean they went on too long).I'm told this is kind of common with Family Guy, and maybe it's Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor, but some of the jokes went on WAY too long.  Like the Obi-Wan character singing the majority of ""I've Had the Time of my Life"" with dancing stormtroopers in the background (gobbling up precious minutes).  Without wanting to get into spoilers, there are a few other gags that just drag on and on.  If you're a fan of this, then you've got it made.  I just found it irksome.  One of them was actually really funny, but my smile fell after the gag passed the 45 second mark, or what seemed like it.All in all, though, I WAS entertained by this.  The opening crawls were hilarious.  I may have peed a little.  There is strong language, but my 7 year old (DON'T JUDGE ME!!  I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FAMILY GUY!) barely noticed and enjoyed watching the shows (though I feel so dirty).  Thankfully the sexual innuendoes flew RIGHT over her head.  But there are those, too.  So that's something.  :)I also think I would have gotten MORE out of this set if I had any familiarity with the Family Guy characters.  Never having seen the show, and seeing as how the Star Wars characters are portrayed by these characters, I think I missed a very important (and presumed) aspect that may have really entertained or charmed someone else.  I'm emotionally and socially hobbled by my lack of Family Guy familiarity.  So there's the disclaimer in long form.  :)Bottom line is, hey, it's like 20 bucks.  If you're a Star Wars fan, it'll be very nostalgic and probably asks some of the questions you've been asking for 30 years.  Often I said to myself ""Yeah..  why IS that??"" when a character pointed out a glaring inconsistency or error in George Lucas' writing/science/sense of reality. It was fun.  And it was 20 bucksish.  Do consider the DVD version, though.  I don't know the price difference, but if its significant, know that the quality difference is not.  May the Schwartz be with you all.  And no, the Schwartz is not involved in the plot of this film."	4.0	Shrug...?	2011-02-09	11	9	2

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AX3WJZLFQQRCT	"R. M. Ettinger ""rme1963"""	I'm both a big 'Star Wars' and 'Family Guy' fan, so while 'Blue Harvest' was a great take off, 'Something Something Something Darkside' was just ok.I was disappointed in no wide-screen (I know, I know, it's just a cartoon, but....) and the extras were pretty weak (but when aren't they usually?).For some reason, 'Something' didn't grab my attention the way 'Blue Harvest' did.  The first one was so dead-on with scene by scene and the follow-up, while hitting many of its marks, just didn't.  It threw in way too many stupid things (the guy w/the ice on Hoth) and a Rodney Dangerfield bit.If it is possible to feel bad for a cartoon character, while I laughed and laughed and laughed at Meg in both episodes for her brief appearances, you gotta feel bad she is once again slighted.I see reviewers here who are shocked at language and content of 'Family Guy'.  While some of the non-bleeped stuff threw me for a second, never once did I think it was out of the realm of possibility.  The same can be said for each Sunday night episode.  Sorry parents - do your homework and don't blame anyone but yourself for letting your kids watch something they shouldn't.'Something' is ok and at times quite funny, but it did not give me the thrill that 'Blue Harvest' did.	3.0	It's Something, Alright	2010-01-31	1	0	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	I wonder if getting cancelled was the best thing that could have happened to the Family Guy, Fox's brilliant animated series. The fact is that the Family Guy wasn't cancelled for lack of interest or ratings problems - it was cancelled for being too edgy and the humor maybe too (gulp) sophisticated for the average television viewer tuning in to watch two strangers get married or to see a person eat a bug.You will find esoteric references to popular 70's and 80's television commercials and sitcoms (the Kool Aid guy busting through the wall is my personal favorite) as well as irreverent digs on everyone from the Make a Wish Foundation to the Pope.If you've seen the show or even just heard about it, buy both volumes. You'll get addicted and annoy your friends and family by trying to reenact the plotlines while doing a poor New Englander dialect. If you're an ardent fan, then definitely buy it. Several episodes have commentaries by Seth Macfarlane, Seth Green, and various writers giving insight into the show on every level. There are also featurettes included that take you behind the scenes.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	Above all else, FAMILY GUY is a funny, funny show.  I almost always watch TV, DVDs, or video when I eat my meals, but I have discovered that it isn't entirely safe to do so while watching this show.  It is funny to a degree that simply isn't compatible with eating food.  What is amazing about the show is that while on one level it will strike just about any viewer as a semi-ripoff of THE SIMPSONS (just check all the SIMPSONS references in other reviews--it is almost impossible not to compare the two), it nonetheless manages to come across as remarkably fresh and--paradoxically--underivative.Although the show uses a number of voiceover artists, the majority of the voices are supplied by only two actors:  Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein (who will be familiar to fans of MADTV).  It isn't fair to say that MacFarlane is the Matt Groening of FAMILY GUY, since Groening does so much less in the SIMPSONS.  MacFarlane is the creator of the show, voices most of the male characters, and is one of the main writers.  Alex Borstein voices most of the female characters and is also a writer.FAMILY GUY is THE SIMPSONS on speed and with a bawdy streak.  Like the Simpsons, the show recreates a small town and introduces a host of characters.  Like most people, my two favorites are Stewie, the one-year old evil super genius who also doubles as the youngest Griffin, and Brian, the talking family dog, who is also exceptionally literate and an alcoholic.  Unlike THE SIMPSONS, where Lisa and (usually) Marge are voices of reason, absolutely no one on FAMILY GUY really has their stuff together.  Brian, Meg, and Lois are relatively sane, but all can exhibit bizarre behavior at key times.  Brian can serve as the voice of reason, but his drinking problem can get out of control at inopportune times.This show is absolutely NOT for the children.  There is a huge amount of sexual humor, frequent references to genitalia, and the next-door neighbor is a sexual predator.  The show was designed with a late nighttime slot in mind, and it shows.  Much of the humor is scatological, and there really are no sacred subjects.  To be honest, when the show goes off color, I generally find it to be less funny than in the more primetime moments.  Much of the humor becomes ritualistic (a detractor might say formulaic).  For instance, whenever any character uses the phrase &quot;like the time&quot; you know you about about to get a flashback.  Transitions can be rapid, unexpected, and exceedingly weird.  And unlike THE SIMPSONS, when they introduce a song, it is almost always exceedingly funny.Just don't try to eat and watch FAMILY GUY at the same time.	5.0	Strikingly original and hysterically funny animation	2004-01-31	8	7	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2LE89WOFFZ2H2	Rod	While I'm an avid fan of The Family Guy from day one, the first viewing of this didn't strike me as particularly funny. The movie tells the story, in a flashback fashion, of Stewie's early-life-crisis and the discovery of his real father. This all leads to a cross-country journey with bitter sidekick Brian to discover that his father is really a future version of himself (a particuarly pathetic version) that is in the present on vacation. The feature feels disjointed simply because it is ... it's actually 3 episodes melded into a feature. However, the commentary (audio) is fantastic and even more enjoyable than the film.

Don't buy this, you'd be better off recording it on-air and then clipping out the commercials.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1VCLTAGM5RLND	"Ronnie Clay ""R.C."""	Family Guy is debatably the funniest cartoon on [adult swim] and this movie is no exception. In this 3-part adventure, evil baby Stewart Gilligan Griffin undergoes a near-death experience, takes up drinking, goes on a quest with Brian (and to a lesser extent, Quagmire) to find his real father, and eventually goes to the future. Seth MacFarlane's voice acting is as always wide-ranged and of excellent quality.

The witty humor and constant obscure TV references add up to many gut-grabbing laugh attacks no matter what episode you watch. I've probably watched the first volume at least 20 times over so far.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AD7Z9DDHSNP0G	Ryan O'Reilly	"What is FOX afraid of? Apparently giving America the ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"" episode. Region 2 has it, why not us? Well, it is teeming over the top with filthy jewish jokes, and FOX is deathly afraid that this could offend. Okay, understandable to not let it air on television......BUT ON DVD??? There are more offending movies on DVD out there, FOX. You can't see the offensive material if you don't buy it!! Maybe they're saving it for the Season 3 DVD.Anyways, my first episode of Family Guy that I watched is a vauge, yet known memory. It was that of ""Dammit Janet!"" (which is on this set, great ep), in which Stevie, at a new daycare, falls for one of the other kiddies. Meanwhile, Lois gets a job as a flight attendent, allowing Peter to fly for free. While I didn't care for the Stevie story much, Lois and Peter's caught my eye (and my humor). Really caught my eye. I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to vomit. This started my love for the show. Now that it is on DVD, I can appreciate it greater. Some of my favorite episodes (including the mentioned ""Dammit Janet!"") are on this disc, so this is a great, great buy.Overall, the Season 3 DVD, coming in September, is also going to be a good buy, but this is defintely the cream of the crop."	4.0	Great Buy, yet FOX is afraid!	2003-04-15	8	4	4

In every episode, I can hardly supress my joy of laugher.The first episode I saw was ""Too sexy for his fat"" on adult swim(It's a real sad shame I didn't catch this show in 1999, I cought it 4 years later.  Real sad).  The funniest part was when he dressed like a clown in the war and said to his fellow soldiers, ""You guys are dumb.  There gonna be looking for army guys.""  That just made me buy the whole first and second season.  And man, it just gave me the best summer I've ever had.This just put comedy at a whole diffrent level.  Every single episode has jokes that are packed with so much comedy genius, it make's you wonder, where do they come up with this stuff.My whole family, and my friends loved this as much as I did.  If you love this cartoon then I'm sure you picked this up by now, but if you haven't, you should, because the price is a steal.  Anyone who loves comedy should get this, and go check out futurama as well.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2G1FUVOD322K6	Samuel Bethune	I got to watch Family Guy Volume 1 through the courtesy of my son's girlfriend, who is possibly the only person who loves this show more than I do.  If you already know what Family Guy is about I won't elaborate except to say I think it's the funniest animated series I have ever seen.  I do take issue, however, with the smug, uninformed comments of those few  morons who referred to the show as a &quot;cheap Simpsons ripoff&quot;.  In its never ending quest for laughs Family Guy has in several episodes boldly rushed in where The Simpsons feared to tread.  Cartoons, much like sitcoms, have borrowed comedic premises quite liberally over the years.  The Simpsons, in fact, borrowed a few things from The Flintstones.  So as far as I'm concerned calling any program a cheap ripoff of some other show shows shallowness and lack of intelligence.  That said, I have two major problems with the Volume 1 DVD collection of Family Guy.  First, the picture quality is downright awful on some episodes.  In certain scenes some of the characters are completely devoid of fleshtones and the outline definitions are fuzzy.  At least one other reviewer commented on this being the result of some sort of encoding issue.  While not enough to keep me from purchasing the collection this oversight is unforgiveable given the technology.  The other problem I have is the audio commentary by creator Seth McFarlane and certain members of the cast and production staff, which is only featured on selected episodes.  I would like to have had more commentary regarding the development of certain characters, particularly Brian and Stewie.  I can live with what's there, but in terms of giving the viewer a glimpse into the creative process this DVD set unfortunately didn't live up to its potential.  Despite its obvious flaws this collection is still worth having...just don't pay full price.	4.0	Great Show, So-So DVD Quality &amp; Features	2004-02-09	6	5	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3LBXJ7WATALI0	Samuel J. Sheets	"I've been a Star Wars fan most my life, and have enjoyed watching Family Guy for some years now. I thought Blue Harvest was awesome and was a perfect parody in the Family Guy manner, so naturally I've been waiting for this to come out for some time now. It was all that I expected it to be, except for a few things.It's great being such a big fan of Star Wars and to see my favorite scenes but with a twist. It is what makes these features so enjoyable to me. This one however, seemed to shy away from a few scenes, and I really believe it was because of the Robot Chicken Star Wars Specials (which I also recommend to anyone who enjoys Star Wars). The scenes which were left out which could have been great with the Family Guy characters are the discussion of Lando with Darth Vader right after Han Solo is being tortured (""Pray I don't alter it any further"" etc etc) and also any scene using Boba Fett. I also feel like they could have put a better character as Yoda, considering his popularity in the Star Wars mythos.But other than those few flaws, I loved this Family Guy feature. A cookie monster wampa?! Han's classic ""i know"" response reimagined into a classic Peter response. So many great parts.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A309RPK3YWYV9Y	Samuel Krikorian	Thus spake the immortal Stewie, the homicidal/matricidal baby with the mind,attitude and accent of a geriatric English baron.  In the world of Family Guy it all makes perfect sense, as does Brain,  a talking alchoholic dog with many existential issues and a wicked sarcasm.  This show had a ton of talent behind it, both in the writing and the voice-overs.  Unfortunately, they got a little to bawdy and un-PC for network TV and we must be satisfied with three short seasons of brilliance that will never be duplicated.  This show is totally unique and so chock full of gags and one-liners that you will watch it over and over.

The show was/is hilarious, I'm glad I held onto the few episodes I managed to tape whilst anticipating the release of a DVD collection.  It's pretty silly how it's constantly compared to The Simpsons because as much as there are the blatantly obvious similarities, the show itself is in many ways very different overall.  It's the sort of show which makes fun of itself as well as popular culture and famous icons.  The skits and parodies are cleverly delivered, fast-paced and plentiful.

I'll just say I caught a few of these shows when they were on the air and after Fox bounced time slots I couldn't keep up.Thanks to cartoon network I was getting caught up once again with the Griffins and found them even funnier the second time around.  So when I saw the DVD's I was hooked!  These shows are hilarious.  They are rough, offensive and everything that you'd never want to admit to being funny.They are a wonderful take on Family life.  They are hilarious and even on replays I still find them equally funny if not more so.  Each character has their own way of making me laugh, but I must admit Peter's spouting off at the mouth without thinking is the funniest.  Also, he cusses out of the blue and it will have you spewing your drink.For a fun escape if you have the sense of humor to take it you should give these a try.

If you liked the Simpsons, Futurama, South Park, or pretty much any cartoon series worth watching, you'll love this from beginning to end. Each episode contains random points of hilarity and enough hidden jokes to justify rewatching each episode many many times. The way Baby Stewie always seems to have the right thing to say is unbelivable. As a brief example, In one of the episodes, Brian and Stewie are holed up in a motel trying to get to sleep. In the next room, all you can hear is a drug deal stammering along. So, frustrated Stewie says: There's only one way to end this...""He's WEARING A WIRE!!"". The deal ends in a shootout, and stewie gets to rest. its moments like this that make Family Guy a show few can resist and something all true fans of cartoon series should have on thier shelves."	5.0	Victory Is Mine!!!!!!!	2003-06-07	1	1	0

It relies far too much on beer drinking, farting and burping - and doesn't have the heart of The Simpons or the wit of King of the Hill.  It tries to be witty by splicing in several references to 70's and 80's pop culture but these always feel forced and trivial.  Many of the characters are plain annoying (Peter and Chris) while others are under-developed (Meg).  Stewie is fairly funny but he's kind of a one note song (does the same things over and over and uses the same lines in every episode like 'what the deuce!'..funny the first time but repetitive very quickly).  Brian the Dog can be VERY funny and simply needs more screentime as the Griffin Family's alcoholic pooch.  2 stars for some moments of levity.	2.0	The Show is Merely OK	2005-10-04	9	4	5

For those who like other shows such as The Simpsons or South Park, this is much better. Family Guy Vol.1 features the first and second seasons of the show, season two containing the funniest episodes of the series including &quot;E. Peturbus Unium&quot; and &quot;Wasted Talent&quot; while the first season also contains great episodes including &quot;Death Has A Shadow&quot;.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3VUY9YTO9CZLH	"Sharik Currimbhoy ""YesPM"""	I'm the original Family Guy fan. I remember watching the first episode in 1998 in my freshman dorm in college. I was very excited when the show came back on the air, and had obviously lost none of its spark.When I heard about the movie I couldn't wait to watch it. However, I was very disappointed. Perhaps as a FG fan I had expected the movie to be at par or better than the TV shows. It isn't. The animation is slightly different and the plot is weak and fragmented. I had the impression that the charecters were trying to hard to be funny, which I have never felt in an episode.I guess perhaps FG was meant to be in the 30 min format, and just doesn't translate well into a movie.	2.0	Very disappointing	2005-12-02	7	3	4

Enough Star Wars tie ins to make it hilarious for the fans, but still funny for those who don't really know the movie, and just a sprinkling of Family Guy's notorious inappropriateness.This episode, on the other hand, was mostly inappropriate and not very funny. It did tie in well with the movie, but was nowhere near as humorous as the first. Maybe it's just sequel jitters, and the third will be better, but frankly, I'm now far less excited about the third instalment, ""We Have a Bad Feeling About This""... in fact, after watching ""Something Something Something Dark Side"", I really do have a bad feeling about the third instalment.For my point of view, save your money and just watch the trailer (Sorry MacFarlane, Green, et al)"	2.0	frankly.... a little diasppointed...	2010-01-31	3	2	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	Other very detailed reviews already cover the episodes listing etc, so it's pointless to add to the clamour. The show is a witty and darkly hilarious look at our society, and fans of the show (which really should be anyone with a couple of brain cells or more) should definitely pick up this terrific set.I'll pitch in a word about the DVD itself.The show is presented in its original 1.33:1 full-frame aspect ratio. The picture quality is good, although there's the occasional issue with jagged lines that occasionally appear on the earlier episodes (an issue with the animation itself?) The picture does offer the show's bright color palette though, vivid and well-saturated throughout. No instances of edge enhancement or pixelation appeared, as do on some of The Simpsons DVDs.The sountrack is Dolby 2.0 and my copy has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. The show's dialogue remains crisp and forward throughout, with the surround sound providing some reinforcement for music and occasional sound effects. Audio quality is superb, as sound effects remained clear (and occasionally punchy) throughout.Plus, the extras are great. Creator Seth McFarlane and various members of the cast and crew provide commentaries, there are over 20 deleted &quot;scenes&quot; provided in animatic (moving storyboards) form, the original pilot pitch (a rough, shortened version of the pilot episode), a 7-minute featurette on how the show pushed the envelope across its three seasons and a 17-minute documentary that takes a look at the overall series, from development to characters the voice talent.If you want to own a fab show, get these couple of seasons. The DVD is worth every penny and probably a little better than the 3rd season.	5.0	ABOUT THE DVD..	2003-10-12	4	3	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2Y4MUU6R9NDUR	Shotgun Method	"All hail Seth Mcfarlane, for having the balls to sell his brilliant, edgy, and endlessly hilarious animated comedy Family Guy to Fox. Too bad the boring masses were too busy watching primetime tripe like Friends (next to Ally McBeal and Seinfeld, the single most overrated and overwatched show on the face of the planet) to appreciate this gem. After being dropped by Fox twice, it's since been consigned to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (late night programming), where it fares far better being paired up with Sealab 2021 and reruns of Futurama. Supposedly a new season is due out soon, and I can't wait.Anyway, a lot of folks pan this show as being derivative of that other pillar of edgy animated family comedy, The Simpsons. Some also believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone's excellent (if slightly overrated) South Park is more creative and edgy. Allow me to insert my ""hurumph.""Now, while I have all the respect for Matt Groening and his now-classic show, let's be honest: The past few seasons of The Simpsons have been lacking, being full of retreaded plots and missed opportunities for humor, not to mention the fact that it's far less subversive and clever than it used to be. After over a decade of success, there's no shame in hanging up the proverbial hat.While Family Guy DOES borrow a couple of elements from The Simpsons, it is infinitely more funny, clever, and racy. Imagine The Simpsons with EVERY dysfunctional personality trait cranked to the max (and add some more psychosis, an alcoholic/socially sophisticated talking dog and a megalomaniacal/matricidal/sexually ambigious evil genius infant, to boot), a nonstop parade of pop culture references (some so damn obscure only a completely obsessive dweeb like me will get them), hiliarious guest voice appearances (ADAM WEST!!!!), ludicrous plot twists galore, and a sense of absurdity and gleefully offensive humor not seen since the heyday of Monty Python.As for South Park--make no mistake, it's often a very funny, zany experience. But the truly edgy, intelligent humor of that show is too often slathered in mounds of excessive bathroom humor that while occasionally good at netting some guilty-pleasure laughs, comes off too frequently as juvenile. I mean sure, lowbrow humor can be great, but I prefer genuine WIT, and Family Guy abounds with it. It's unrelentingly smart and never panders to its audience (maybe that's one of the reasons it got canceled). Very irreverent, razor-sharp, and often black humor is what characterizes Family Guy and separates it from the majority of lame programming out there. EVERYTHING gets a proper send-up, from The Pope to Bill Clinton to Christmas specials to the Kool Aid Guy.As far as the family itself is concerned, you know you're in for a riot when Brian, the aforementioned talking dog, is more often than not THE ONLY SANE BEING IN THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD. And he's drunk half the time. Then you have Peter, who is like Homer with the insensitivity, cluelessness, and stupidity multiplied threefold. Chris, the equally dumb older son, with an artistic and sensitive side hidden under his inherited appreciation for bathroom jokes. Meg, the hopeless and whiny teenage outcast. Lois, the incredibly devoted wife who is equal parts oblivious and insane. And my absolute fave, Stewie...the single most quotable character in the entire show (""Damn broccoli, damn you, and DAMN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS!!""). Add some more supporting characters who are equally hiliarious (the macho wheelchair-bound police officer Joe and the total pervert sleazeball Quagmire just to name two) and you've got a show for the ages.Also notable is the fact that Mcfarlane actually voiced a good percentage of these characters. The fact that he could provide the voice for both Stewie and Brian (two extremely different voices) is pretty remarkable in of itself. I also never knew that was Seth Green voicing Chris until I looked at the credits.Anyway, I can't give Seasons 1 & 2 a perfect five, due to some episodes that aren't quite up to par and the fact that the satire would be honed to an even sharper edge on the show's third (and as of right now, final) season. Oh yeah, and I don't dig the packaging (extras are good though, especially the uncensored commentaries). But rest assured, it is a VERY high 4-star score. Like a 4.8, or something. Which means you should watch this. NOW.Did I mention that Adam West is in it?"	4.0	And this was on network TV?	2004-10-21	8	7	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2Q0L9BYC8V9E	SithNerfHerder	First off let me just say that Family Guy sucks!!!  I can't stop watching it.  I bought both box sets the day they came out and I bought the Freakin Sweet Collection the day it came out.  I had downloaded all the episodes and the American Dad pilot before they were available to purchase. I have watched every episode over 100 times. I love this show it is the greatest thing EVER written!!! (in my humble opinion)  I am on all the mailing lists for news of the show from FOX, FamilyGuyFiles, and PlanetFamilyGuy.  I own all the series of collectibles that came out from Metco and those bendy ones also.  What I am trying to say is I am powerless to resist the awesomeness of this show. [...] So if you have never watched this show you should. You should buy every box set that comes out and encourage all your friends to do so too.  Or better yet buy your friends copies like I did.  But BEWARE!!!! Once you start you can't stop.  And don't ever, ever, ever fall asleep watching it because you will have really really WIERD dreams.  I did it and told my friends about it and now they too suffer from Family Guy induced wierdness when they sleep. If you don't believe me go try it.

Disc 1 generally gets the most play, as overall the episodes are perfectly hilarious.

Well, while the simpsons is grounded in (close) reality, Family Guy is surreal, and isn't afraid to do things that would never happen. an example: In one episode, a man dressed as a chicken gives peter a coupon, and Peter refuses saying he learned his lesson from last time. He then has a flashback with a five minute segment featuring him battiling a chicken on top of trucks, holding onto a helecopter, and crashing into an office building, where he slams the top of a copier machine into the chicken's head, and walks out of the hole they created saying only ""Chicken...Gave me a bad coupon""The show was apparently too controversial and was canceled, which is a shame because the show had huge potential.

Anyways first things first, this is in a regular SD screen aspect ratio, which basically means no widescreen. The movie itself is not that great, but not bad. If you've seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen the better jokes. Also the special features are lacking. There is a mode where you can watch the movie again but with some notes around the movie explaining facts or other anecdotes, but that's pretty much about it. There's not any bigger special features or ""making of"". One thing that also let me down big time, is that there's only 1 english audio track. I mean for a blu-ray title worth as many great blu-rays out there (star trek) they could at least include more audio tracks (spanish, french...)But nooooooo. I liked the Spain spanish dub on a PAL version of blue harvest but this one only has english track so that was a big let down for me.In conclusion, the price and lack of features of this animated feature is a big NO.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1QL4I4J8SSC2I	Speaky2k	I am a big Family Guy fan and have been since the original Fox airings as well as a Start Wars Geek.  This sequel to the Blue Harvest as well as a spoof on the Empire Strikes Back was well done, but not up the original.  As this episode of Star Wars was the most plot heavy and not as entertaining to a young crowd it is very hard to spoof.  The Family Guy creators did a good job with it, this time actually giving Meg a line.  This episode was needed to move the plot along to bring out the next episode, but not nearly as funny as the first one.  There are definitely scenes that are great but most of it was almost shot for shot of the real movie.In the extras was a table read for the final episode of Star Wars (Return of the Jedi).

The first 2 episodes, Blue Harvest & Something Something Dark Side were hilarious, but Its A Trap was pretty lame.Many of the other reviews cover this too as right at the very beginning on the scrolling text it states that they didn't want to do Return of the Jedi, but Fox made them and much of the episode was written by the assistants or interns. Many of the jokes are rehashed and unfunny.Its A Trap is the only episode presented in widescreen. Very disappointing especially on a Blu-ray release. Also, Blue Harvest is not even in HD quality. It looks like its just plain dvd version slapped onto the blu-ray disc. you see many jaggies and unsmooth lines. Something Something Dark Side is in HD, but not widescreen.At $22 for a blu-ray set, even with all its downfalls, its still not a bad deal. Plus, like I said, the first 2 are great and made me laugh the whole time. But, I do feel very let down by the laziness in this release.	3.0	Not a worthwile Blu-ray release	2011-01-08	10	7	3

I don't know where that person got the idea that this DVD set only has a handful of episodes on it. The set indeed has ALL 28 episodes of the first and second seasons of ""Family Guy"", as stated by, among other places, the product page for this very product. Let's not even try to understand why he thought that 2(episodes per disc)x4(discs)=6. And furthermore, the show had a total of 49 episodes, plus one unaired episode.Anyway, it is a terrific, cutting edge, amazingly original show, but if you're here you either already believe that with your whole heart, or hate the show so much that anything I say won't convince you otherwise. For those of the former, do consider buying this DVD set because the show, now that it is cancelled, can only live on through us fans. I understand that the set is well-packed with commentaries and the like. I personally only gave it 4 stars because i know the region 2 DVD set (in Europe) also included the unaired episode (""When You Wish upon a Weinstein""), and I for one think we deserve to have that episode a whole lot more than the French do at this point.In summation: this set does have all 28 episodes of seasons 1 & 2, and the show... well, there's nothing like it, and you know it.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3VCFKG8PVV0CO	Stingray Ramone	I remember during the 1999 NFL Playoffs, FOX had heavily hyped Family Guy just as much as it promoted the Super Bowl XXXIII, which of course, was a laugher.  Much like the clash between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons was nothing but hype, I was assured that Family Guy was nothing but just a Simpsons-looking ripoff.  Instead of deriding it further, I just fell in love with Family Guy, although various highly acclaimed critics and a major proportion of FOX viewers, a lot of them, Simpsons fans thought otherwise.  Furthermore, it was a darn shame that FOX did not have a whole lot of faith in the show, as it was shuffled in and out of lineups, like a baseball utility player. Sadly, instead of emerging as one of the marquee shows of the network, it was just thrown aside as an eccentric experimental show gone awry (i.e. Culture Clash, Andy Richter).  Aside from all the bad press it received, Family Guy is fresh, offensive, and just downright hysterical.  By far, it was edgier than the acceptable PG-rated norm, The Simpsons, pushing the ante for witty, satirical potty humor.Family Guy follows the Simpsonic mold of characters.  The series revolves around the Griffin family of Quahog, Rhode Island.  The patriarch is Peter, your overly healthy average joe who works at a toy company and is basically your Homer Simpson-type.  His wife is Lois, a redhead New England-accented average TV housewife.  Meg is Peter and Lois' angst-filled teenage daughter, who like most teenagers, fights the uphill battle to fit in at school.  Chris is the older son, who is a lunkhead like his old man.  Then, we have everyone's favorite cartoon infant, Stewie, a wide-headed baby who speaks eloquently with an over-the-top British accent, obsessed with killing his mother for bringing him into this world and like your typical James Bond megalomaniac, he is after world domination.  The Griffins' dog is Brian, a pooch that can walk, talk, and can become a drunken, sarcastic bum.As far as the episodes go on this DVD set, there are 28 episodes in all, Seasons 1 and 2 in their entirety.  Each episode is a guilty treat guaranteed to laugh yourself silly.  Here are my personal favorites from the first two seasons:Death Has a Shadow: The pilot episode.  Peter is fired when he shows up to work extremely hung over and he receives a $150,000 welfare check by accident.  When Lois reveals this ugly tidbit, Peter tries to save face by dumping money back to the taxpayers off a blimp over the Super Bowl.I Never Met the Dead Man: When Peter teaches Meg to drive, Peter accidentally knocks out the city's cable by colliding into a satellite dish and he makes Meg the culprit, to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.  Stewie attempts to destroy all vegetables by building a weather control device, when Lois forced him to eat his broccoli.A Hero Sits Next Door: Peter becomes annoyed of his new next-door neighbor, Joe, a handicapped man who Peter was forced to invite to play on his company's baseball team.  Because Joe emerges the sentimental favorite from his baseball-playing stint, Peter tries to become a hero by attempting to foil a bank robbery.Death is a B!tch: Peter visits the doctor, worried that he has a lump in his breast.  So that he does not have to pay a cent, Peter proclaims himself dead.  Much hilarity ensues when Death attempts to claim Peter afterward.The King Is Dead: Lois is the new artistic director of the Quahog Players theatre group and she plans to direct The King and I as her first production.  For Peter to stop annoying her, Lois makes him the producer and he converts The King and I into a raunchy cyborg fighting extravaganza.Road to Rhode Island: If I had to pick my very favorite episode, it's this one.  Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and they miss their flight home due to Brian's drunkenness.  The two set off back home on a heck of an adventure.  Meanwhile, Lois forces Peter to watch relationship communication tapes, which turn out to be porn.You can make a viable case for each episode to be a favorite because each one is laugh-out-loud funny, of course, some more than others. In summation, Family Guy is a very well-developed, well-executed comedy, which should be taken with light-hearted humor through its peak moments of rudeness.  It is a hysterical riot worthy of a second crack on the airwaves, but since the likeliness of that happening looks bleak, there is more incentive into buying this extremely enjoyable DVD set.	5.0	Too Insensitive, Too Satirical, and Too Good for Network TV	2003-06-14	1	1	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A23GR1C9U0VS6Z	"stm ""stm"""	"I found the movie disappointing -- it simply isn't as funny as the TV show.  While much of it is ""amusing"" I only laughed out loud a handful of times.  If you have the expectation that this movie will go where the TV show couldn't, you will be disappointed. The movie is significantly less edgy than TV show.  Stewie's acid tongue has been nuetralized and Brian's wit and charm have evaporated.  Much of the movie is focused on the Brian-Stewie relationship and the two even take a road trip together, but nothing here compares to the TV episode where Brian and Stewie find Brian's mother.As has been pointed out in other reviews, the movie is really 3 TV plots woven together into a long form.

The naysayers will automatically draw comparos to the Simpsons and say that its quality of comedy is no where near that of Matt Groening's long running hit animated series. Well IMO the only real similarity they have is that they're both animated and have a similar family structure. Jokes, comedy, and story wise, the two are very different. Family Guy gives you noticeably more laughs per minute than Simpsons, especially if you enjoy witty politically incorrect comedy. It relies a lot more on real pop culture whereas the Simpsons jokes are usually a little more PC and revolve around general observations about society rather than specific occurences such as Family Guy. With that having been said, I guess you COULD dislike this if you really hated vulgarity and toilet bowl humor and absolutely NOTHING could make up for it. But who can't laugh when Peter asks Lois when they ever had trouble communicating and it flashes to the two of them standing in front of a beautiful sunset hugging each other and Lois telling Peter she loves him and Peter saying ""About a quarter past 5""?

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2M1MNG7G40V85	Surface to Air Missle	For those who haven't seen this show you are missing out.  This is animation at it's funniest.  All 6 major characters are well thought out and written with gusto.  The supporting characters are hilarious once you get familiar with them.  It was a shame this show was cut short.  It's pretty risque but it pays off bigtime.  Stewie the baby is my favorite.  He is a baby with a sort of a mad-scientist meets Frasier Crane persona who works that English accent to the utmost levels of extreme snobbiest.  The show is politically incorrect so if you are offended by that sort of stuff stay away.  My only complaint is that Peter the father is a poor mans Homer Simpson who's predictable antics sometime get a little tiresome.  Other than that is high quality DVD with some OK extras and semi interesting commentaries.Bottom Line:  Family Guy aint for families but it's friggin hilarious.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A33ZE6UUUMWD81	Sweetcheeks McMuffin	Upon Family Guy's debut after the 1999 Superbowl, Fox had a hit that had sparked a major public interest. Combining elements of The Simpsons and The Critic, Family Guy is the perfect hybrid of comedic genius. While such racy shows as South Park may have hogged the spotlight, Family Guy was able to hold its own on and off for 3 seasons.What makes this show so interesting is the style of animated comedy used. Often in the show, the characters will say something along the lines of &quot;you remember what happened when...,&quot; and a ridiculously funny flashback will show some whacky situation.  For instance, in one episode Peter, the father, recalls his Mexican relative training as a cockfighter (Peter's relative is about 8 inches tall, wearing boxing gloves, and beating up a chicken)Bottom line, this show has a lot of ridiculous humor and I strongly recommend the DVD set for anyone who misses the show.	5.0	Quite possibly one of the top 10 cartoons...ever	2003-07-17	1	1	0

It does try too hard to be funny ALL the time but when it works it is some really funny stuff. This show was a keeper (after so many attempts at trying to reproduce the success of the simpsons) Fox finally stumbled on a winner, that they foolishly dropped. I don't know why the bin laden joke and the Once upon a Weinstein were dropped. If you find those offensive, I think you  would find the whole show offensive. I imagine fans of this show are not going to be easily offensed by crude jokes and bodily function humor and jokes about a baby wanting to off his own mother. So why should fans be denied these things? Why does the UK get them? It's not like Americans aren't used to crude humor(Goodnes knows we invented it), so this deletion is just plain unecessary and silly.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AAQ4O5V8TT4HJ	"T. F. Brettell ""neech_manley"""	"Well, I was literally dying to see this, as were the friends I watched it with. Most people know that Family Guy is one of the most consistently funny TV shows ever, and the prospect of an entire movie was exciting to say the least.And it isn't a movie. It's three seperate yet linked episodes from season 4, with filler at the front and end (neither of which is that funny, although Bowie gets a killer line) and a relatively amusing 'intermission' section in the middle.The first 'episode' is hilarious. Really, really funny. It gets proressively more tiresome as the movie goes along, although there are standout gems throughout. The one that got me is the scene where Stewie jumps out of the window whilst chasing his 'father', and the next shot is of a moustacioed fat stunt guy in a Stewie costume falling down the outside of the building. It's times like this, when Family Guy takes the piss out of conventions, cliches and itself that it is at it's most amusing and incisive. The elementary shock value of the characters finally being able to say f*ck isn't that fantastic, it's something the majority of people moved on from after the first couple of series of South Park, a show which has itself moved away from its only tactic being shock value and has become better for it.Other highlights of the film include the Walt Disney and Barbara Streisland sketches, and the Jesus bit (actually pant wettingly funny). Stewies put down of Vanessa is amazing, as is the segment where Stewie is up on pep pills.I wouldn't watch this film if you are uncomfortable with the TV series' ""When you wish upon a Weinstein"" episode however, as the film could be interpreted as even more anti-semetic (I don't see it that way, but can understand why some would).Asides from the nuggets however, much of the comedy is formulaic and predictable. I also didn't like the way that they brought back or referenced so many one off characters from the series, it seemed to me like they are only thrown in there to convince the fans that something funny is happening, when all they are doing is going through the motions. I also thought the lack of consistent sub plots was annoying, and think that the writers have overdone the 'Stewie and Brian take a road trip' storyline.Overall, this is a funny movie. But I think that hard core fans of the show expected (and deserved) so much more. Rent, don't buy."	3.0	It's.... ok.	2005-09-19	22	16	6

There are limits crossed, fun in store, and Quagmire does the USA.The main plots as you've heard so far, Stewie thinks he's seen what must be his ""real"" father and goes to seek him out, and Peter gets to sound off on TV as to what ""Grinds my gears"".Some of the extremes are Peter's ""...always wanted to get back into showbiz after they let him go from the Family Feud"".  Stewie's brief political stint, Stewie in hell, Stewie on alcohol and later 'pep' pills, Brian feeling uncomfortable because of ""stewie"", Meg making a change in her life ;).I don't want to give too much away, but really the show is hard core in some spots, and standard family guy in others.  That's the same as saying Extremely Excellent in some spots and only Excellent in others...

As with any Family Guy episode there are the occassional groaner, but for the most part it stays true to the TV series.After a near death experience, Stewie tries to be a better person as to not end up in hell (his glimpse into his possible eternity of damnation left him frightened for his soul) After giving up on being nice, Stewie happens to catch a glimpse of a man on Television who has an uncanny resemblence to him- so he sets out, with Brian, to find the man who he believes is his REAL father.The movie gives a glimpse into a possible future for the Griffin family, and, as in the TV series, Meg's future is the most interesting, and as it always is in the show, the meanest (what do they have against Meg anyway?)For the Hardcore Family Guy fan (those that felt that it's first cancellation was a crime to TV, and rushed out to grab a copy of the the first season when they heard it was being released and missed many nights of sleep waiting for the day- yep - like me)- this is a must see, for casual fans of the show- eh- maybe- if you hate the show- just avoid it. Sure, it's not a pinnacle in animation- far from it (rememeber, this is a show that pushes the envelope on good taste, it's no Beauty and the Beast) I do think it would've been fun as a musical (which could've used a ton of Disney/Classic Musical movie parodies- but still funny)"	5.0	Completely Hilarious	2005-08-18	19	16	3

I had seen the shows before, so I knew what I was getting. A complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) was the video quality of the first movie, Blue Harvest, was essentially that of an up-converted DVD. Putting in the other two movies will make you realize the vast improvement in the quality compared to the first. The extras were for the most part entertaining and interesting. The commentary was very similar to the commentary on the DVDs of the show except with more information on production, ideas about S.W., etc. I've very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price of $23 for the set.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AK2K0SR3KSS0B	TheAgitator	The Family Guy is one of the worst shows I can actually remember in recent memory.  Nothing but a really bad ripoff of the Simpsons with nothing but pop culture references for jokes.  Some of them funny and others just aren't.  Absolutely nothing about The Family Guy is even remotely original and mostly it's just mildly funny.  What's even worse is that Seth MacFarlane sunk even lower with his American Dad show which is even more redundant than The Family Guy.  Even worse is this movie is even less funny than most actual Family Guy episodes.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Go get Skinny Puppy's new Greater Wrong of the Right live DVD.  It's a better use of your hard earned money.  Also, watch Robot Chicken on Adult Swim and give your ratings to that show instead of Family Guy.	2.0	The Recent Mad Magazine Cover Says It All	2005-10-18	14	2	12

I debated how much getting the blu ray would be worth it and I can tell you it is WELL worth it! The sharpness is incredible on the picture and like the sound is also top shelf. I don't have this on DVD to compare it to, but comparing it to Blue Harvest on DVD this blu ray BLOWS AWAY the DVD. So, if you're already set on buying the movie, if you have a blu ray player pay the extra couple bucks and get the blu ray version.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3UW2LF45BOPY7	The Deac	How did this show not last?  It is without a doubt the funniest television show I can recall.  Peter, Meg, Chris, Lois, Stewie &amp; Brian are without a doubt the most dysfunctional family since the Bundys.  Sure the Simpsons might have more notoriety, but Family Guy blows that away.What makes it so funny?  The funniest part of the show without a doubt are the flashbacks...for example, Brian and Peter discussing the hardest time they had together when Peter started his own country...they flashback to the 2 of them on a ferris wheel with Peter lit completely on fire.  Did it make much sense?  No.  Was it comic gold?  Absolutely!Stewie steals several shows as the maniac baby who wants to kill his mother.  Brian, the extremely intelligent alcoholic dog, is a new breed altogether for family pets.  And Lois is probably the only TV Mom in recent history to produce nearly as many laughs as the other family members (Meg and Chris have their moments, but are just background more or less).

It wasn't nearly as good as the first one, and was actually pretty boring.  The problem with FG is the writers can't seem to figure out what's really funny and entertaining.  They generally hit the mark with Stewie, Brian, and Lois; it's just too bad that nearly everything involving Peter and Chris is just tragically stupid and pathetic...and the musical numbers are just forced and boring.	2.0	Typical FG	2010-02-23	3	2	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3IV368HEWLWK0	Thomas Sletvik	"When I first saw this one in the store I got ecstatic! A whole movie about the best character in Family Guy! But after watching it I somehow felt a bit cheated. The reason is simple; what do we love about Stewie? His ""evilness"", his british accent, and his use of big words. Well, how many of these are present in this movie? One! The british accent! The two others are close to gone! And you even get a sort of hint that something's wrong early on when Stewie (after an accident) says; ""from this day forward Stewart Gilligan Griffin will be a good boy"". We don't want to see Stewie be a good boy, we want to see him unveil his evil in all its glory!Ok, that being said, the film still poses some really funny situations, usually with Peter. Also the writers have managed to keep - maybe even improve - the wierd and somewhat twisted humor that Family Guy is known for.Not quite what I hoped for, but don't get me wrong, it's still funny!"	3.0	Not really Stewie as we know him	2006-02-28	1	1	0

Differences: The youngest kid is a criminal genius on his way to world domination, the two older kids are typical underachievers. Oh and they have a talking dog!Just like ""the Simpsons"" the show is outrageously hilarious, fantastically funny and absolutely politically uncorrect.

This DVD is absolute evidence of that. It has so many funny moments that it is one of rarest DVDs that you have to watch over and over to fully understand the humor. The pacing is little too fast because you'll be laughing and will miss the second joke because of the sound of your own laugh.  I loved most of the gags which was very aggressive, I mean you see and hear it and you feel like you got hit by a hammer because the jokes are harsh and funny at the same time. You wish you can work for Family Guy and have a lot of good time creating this type of humor. You have to watch it or you will miss out on what people are talking about at work the next day....	5.0	By far the better show than the Simpsons	2005-09-28	5	3	2
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2UNMXBJSVIXFB	Tony Khamvongsouk	Movie - 3.5Having been merely an off/on viewer of Family Guy throughout the last few years, I find it a bit surprising that for as few episodes as I've seen that I still like the show a lot, yet won't go out of my way to catch up on the ones I've missed. I only discovered Blue Harvest two years ago (a year after it actually came out) and finally got around to watching both it and Something (x3) Dark Side a few weeks ago. With that said, I'm also a big Star Wars fan (grew up watching the original trilogy many, many times as a kid). Combine the raunchy, vulgar, witty, humor and repetitious mannerisms of Peter and company with the ageless classic and you've got quite the satirical homage. Essentially, you get the mixed bag of potty-mouth dialogue, wordplay, and slapstick shenanigans any Family Guy fan would expect, only it's all been re-adapted. Characters from the show play themselves under the guises of their supposed Star Wars counterparts, and do so pretty well. It's not so much a retelling of George Lucas' epic sci-fi tale, so much as it is a long episode of Family Guy using those elements to entertain us. It's not a flat-out parody like Spaceballs either, but it's fun to watch for both its quirkiness to the new and respect to the old. Some of the jokes and one-liners are hit or miss leading to laugh-out-loud moments or complete and utter silence, while some of the characters' actions are just blatantly vulgar for no reason (perhaps to surprise the audience since this is normally edited for TV), though I'd offer to wage MacFarlane just wanted to get the unrated jitters out of his system. I'm also a bit disappointed that both this and Blue Harvest were only limited to 2 acts instead of 3. Not that I want them to make full-length features or anything, but for something as contextually rich as Star Wars I think a longer run time could've benefited for a much more entertaining event. But alas, this is all there is, and we'll just have to wait for the Return of the Jedi parody.Video - 4.5While it's only 2D animation and at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, Dark Side looks remarkably good. Colors are especially vibrant in recreating the Family Guy color palette, while at the same time showing a great amount of line detail in the backgrounds and Star Wars designs of the feature itself. I especially thought some of the more action-packed animation sequences had a very fluid presentation to them and made for an overall pleasant picture. There are very few instances of any real problems like blocking, aliasing, or other artifacts, though there may be some slight banding in the sky of Cloud City, but it's not too noticeable unless you're actually looking for imperfections. If anything, the only real downside to the video is the 4:3 format. The presentation itself looks fantastic, but the black bars on the side kind of make you wish they had utilized that extra space to make a more spacious and fulfilling image. Other than that, great job by Fox.Audio - 4.5For the Star Wars fan in me, I was stoked to hear John William's score in lossless audio. The main theme, Imperial March, and other classic pieces are recreated to sonic perfection and sound absolutely stunning as a substitute for the real thing until Lucas decides to get off his butt and start remastering a Star Wars' BD release. Sound effects have a good deal of depth and dimensionality as well, with separation coming off mostly from the front, and a little bit on the sides. Dialogue is clear, though a smidgen too loud from the center, sometimes overpowering the rest of the sound field and even causing me to turn down the volume at points. LFEs aren't too frequent, but given this was a TV show the overall sound design still possesses excellent fidelity, while at the same time giving you a sample of what Star Wars will hopefully sound like when it comes to BD.Extras - 3.0The special features are pretty limited. Topping it is a very entertaining commentary with a big chunk of the crew responsible for making this and Seth Green. It's informative, fun to listen to, and a good supplement for the product itself. Other specials include a table read of the unfinished script, the surprisingly detailed making-of for the poster art, a Pop-up Video-esque factoid feature for the film, an animatic comparison, and a very short preview for the upcoming Return of the Jedi spoof. All of the video stuff is in HD, and while somewhat lacking overall, is still a good deal for such a short movie.Overall - 4.0If you like Family Guy and Star Wars equally, this is definitely worth checking out. If you're not quite either, then some of the mixed elements from each might be a turn off. I personally Dark Side to be pretty funny, albeit a little misfiring at some points and way too short overall. But it makes for some good laughs if you're feeling the mood for that sort of humor. Presented by Fox with excellent A/V quality and a decent set of extras, Family Guy Presents: Something Something Something Dark Side comes recommended for fans.	4.0	Family Guy Presents: Something (x3) Dark Side (Blu-ray)	2010-06-24	0	0	0

So, once I found out about a movie, I couldnt wait. While I was waiting for the movie to hit stores, I did a little bit of research on the movie. Turns out, this dvd is uncensored! Then I found out that its about another one of stewies adventures. It starts out on the red carpet during the premiere of the movie. Then it ends up with Stewie having a near death experience at the pool. So, he decides to be a good boy (like that could ever happen) After getting drunk and relizing that he still needs to ""find himself,"" he sees a man on the television who looks just like him. Convinced that Peter cant be his real father, he and Brain set out on their greatest 3 episode adventure yet. I wont ruin the plot twist, but i can say it was definitely worth the money.For all of those who couldnt figure out why the movie was censored when you first played it, you have to go into the language selection, and switch it from censored to uncensored. I bought the dvd at walmart and it was uncensored, so dont think that its censored if you buy it there.My overall favorite part, well, actually parts, of this movie was as follows: when stewie broke the neck of the Entertainment Weekly editor, when Elmer Fudd finnaly got Bugs Bunny, when Stewie dropped an f-bomb on that chick Vanessa, and my all time favorite part (for some reason) when Peter buys that catapult and flies through the air laughing. I watched that part like 8 times before i went on with the movie.So if you like Family Guy, uncensored cartoons, crude humor, and celebrity spoofs, then this is definitely the dvd for you. Youll keep laughing even after the dvd is over. I know I did. You wont be dissapointed."	5.0	A great step for the Family Guy series	2005-10-10	1	0	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1A2SWJHNJ10FP	"Troy Kearney ""avid reader"""	"Family Guy is to The Simpsons what a Mustang 5.0 is to a base model Mustang: the same style but just that little extra edge advantage that makes it a lot better.  Where The Simpsons can be somewhat edgy without treading on thin ice, Family Guy takes those extra steps and dances all over the ice with glee.Family Guy is the birthchild of Seth MacFarlane and focuses on the daily trials and tribulations of the Griffin family.  The patriarch of the family is Peter Griffin (voiced by MacFarlane), a Homer Simpson-type dad who is a little dim-witted but can sometimes find a bright spot in any situation (as noted constantly by the flashbacks he and the other members of the family get in each episode).  Along for the ride are Peter's long-suffering wife Lois, their pet dog Brian who through some strang ability is able to talk with the family, and their three children: Meg, who is going through all the teenage angst that most girls her age go through; Chris, the seemingly dumb son who has some hidden talents, and last but certainly not least Stewie, a little cutie with the mind and motives of a megalomaniacal tyrant in the making.Family Guy was initally a hit, but Fox was afraid that censors would pounce all over the show and did virtually everything to make the show unwatchable by viewers.  Finally succeeding, the show was cancelled in 2000 and didn't gain success until Cartoon Network made the show part of it's Adult Swim lineup a little over a year ago.  When ratings for the airings on CN went through the roof and the sales of the DVD sets (this one and Volume 2)skyrocketed, Fox realized it made a terrible error in judgement (no surprise!) and decided to bring the show for a new series run sometime next year.For those of us who can't wait until then, the first DVD box set contains the first 28 episodes of Family Guy over its first 2 seasons (the first season only ran 7 episodes, the other 21 comprise season two)and are some of the most hilarious of the series.  Needless to say that they also spawned some of the most classic lines in Family Guy history, especially Stewie's response to Lois' advice that he go outside and play: ""Why don't you burn in HELL?!?"".  In addition, if you don't find yourself dying of laughter from the scene in ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" where Peter tries to breast-feed Stewie (yes, you read that right), you need a serious humor transfusion.If you consider yourself a fan of the series or you've just heard from word of mouth that this series is hilarious, get this set to see what all the fuss is about."	5.0	The Simpsons with some serious bite...	2004-11-03	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	After the success of Family Guy's retelling of STAR WARS in the animated special BLUE HARVEST, it was only a matter of time before they told their own version of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  Time's up and the Family Guy's version is here with SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE.  Currently, this hour-long episode hasn't aired yet and at the moment is only available on DVD and Blu-ray (but we all know Seth MacFarlane is just as big a money machine as George Lucas and the episode will play either on tv or cable at some point).The story begins the same as BLUE HARVEST did with the power going out and Peter Griffin entertaining the family by continuing the story of Star Wars, but with some particular Family Guy twists.  Darth Vader (Stewie) is using the full control of the Empire to find the Rebel Alliance and wipe them out once and for all.  Luke (Chris) wants to be a Jedi, while Han (Peter) and Leia (Lois), Chewie (Brian), and C-3PO (Quagmire) try to evade the Empire, eventually escaping to Cloud City to visit with Han's old friend Lando (Mort Goldman).SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE does a good job at staying true to the Star Wars saga and continuing the story began in BLUE HARVEST, while interjecting various pop culture allusions and typical Family Guy humor.  Just as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a better movie than STAR WARS, so is SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE a better episode than BLUE HARVEST.  BLUE HARVEST is about 8 minutes shorter in length than SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE, but there are times in BLUE HARVEST where the plot drags a bit. That doesn't happen in SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE; scenes move quickly from one to the next, the gags don't stop, and the story moves along at a brisk pace.My favorite scene in the episode is when Yoda is training Luke.  The scene is done as a montage and is intersected with the actual music and footage of the Russian Boxer Drago training in ROCKY IV. The juxtaposition is hilarious.The extras on the DVD include a commentary, an option of playing the episode with pop-up facts (and unlike most DVDs with this feature, you can actually fast forward through the episode and still read the pop-ups), a table reading sneak peak of WE HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS (the Family Guy take on RETURN OF THE JEDI), and a featurette with the creators of the SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE poster.Overall, this DVD is something that appeals to both Family Guy and Star Wars fans.  It does have some foul language, so parents beware.	5.0	The Farce Is With Them	2010-03-09	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A29HPI08Z5SYYX	Tyler Foster	"Family Guy didn't always suck. The original run of three seasons resulted in a crude, yet sharp and very funny animated TV show. It wasn't a classic, but it was funny, and its not-so-lofty goals were achieved with energy to spare.But when it popped back on television a few years after cancellation, it was never going to work, and doesn't. The new Family Guy is a weak rip-off of the original, forcing the ""obscure-but-cool"" pop culture references down the audience's throat and then drawing each unfunny joke or reference (mainly to itself) out to excruciating length. It's not enough to be rude and outrageous just for the sake of it, the new Family Guy has to rub it in our faces, leaving a bad taste in the viewer's mouth.Of anything that's been produced during the New Family Guy reign, this movie is by far the worst. The episodes range from the rare B+'s to the all-too-common D's, but this movie is an easy D-, representing the worst newly-released feature-length comedy I've seen in five years. I know I'm going to get scathed by hordes of 15 and 16-year-olds who revere the show as some sort of comedic Holy Grail, but despite the promise of ""unhelpful"" tagging, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: this movie sucks.The movie wallows in a string of unfunny movie premiere jokes before finally gearing into a subpar plot that strings three seemingly rejected episodes of the show together into something about as unimpressive as that sounds. Everything feels like it got sent to the animation house during the script's first draft, much like any given episode of the new show. Yes, there are a handful of amusing jokes -- but I laughed about as much as I would watching any one episode of original Family Guy. Considering the film is three times as long and crammed wall-to-wall with gags, this is not a particularly flattering ratio. The movie also throws in some truly gratuitous musical numbers as well, which the show itself would go on to do with alarming frequency.I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's true -- it just ain't the same. When it comes to comedy, while hilarity is subjective, laziness is not, and this movie is lazy. Whether or not you laugh (and, I reiterate, I didn't), the effort put forth by the filmmakers is very weak, and I fully expect that within a few years, once the hype over the show's return has died down and people are actually trying to rewatch and love the new episodes they thought were great in the way they rewatched and loved the old episodes, they'll find there's a lot less meat on the bones than meets the eye."	1.0	Someday you'll all realize it...	2005-09-22	100	48	52
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A288YABU99JXTD	tyler	This is the best show ever on TV. Sucks it got canceled off fox but still on Adult Swim. They might be makin a season 4 with 35 brand new episodes. That would be awsome. Anyways the top 5 episodes here are E. Peterbus Unum, Running Mates, Hes Too Sexy For His Fat, I Am Peter Hear Me Roar, and Chitty Chitty Death Bang. E. Peterbus Unum is the funniest episode of any show i have ever seen. I cant wait to get season 3 im gonna watch them all right when i get it. This show is incredible is beats Futurama by far. It is even funnier than the classic...yep it beats The Simpsons. Its that funny. Stuey and Peter and so funny in season 1 & 2. I demand you go buy this right now.	5.0	Favorite show ever	2003-12-25	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1CEWED35GE0EX	Tyler	I don't possibly see how this show was cancelled, and King of the Hill wasn't. In most episodes of King of the Hill I find myself to not even laugh once. Family Guy was just so great words can't describe it. In watching any episode you are entitled to laugh every 20-40 seconds, seriously. In my own opinion (and I know many of you will disagree) Family Guy is greater than Simpsons and South Park. I would not recommend this to any person who is the typical family guy/girl though, or to anyone who doesnt take too kindly to racial comments or anything of that sort. Though its not as near as profane as South Park, but its still just as hilarious.Seth Macfarlane, the creator, is just unbelievable. If you have seen the show and know how Peter Griffen, Brain (the dog), and Stewie (the supergenius one-year-old baby) AND Quagmire (the horny next door neighbor) speak, you will be surprised to hear they are all the voice of Seth Macfarlane. It's aslo a nice neat little fact to know that Seth Green (The Italian Job, Austin Powers) is the voice of Chris Griffen, my favorite character. I love the voice that Seth Green uses for him.All in all, this is a great collection and I recommend it to any fan of the Simpsons or South Park. The extras are weak, but opposed to what others say, I love the commentary on the few episodes its on, you will catch stuff you wont notice otherwise and they are just hilarious. The series contains all [28] episodes from Seasons 1 and 2 and I'll add its worth whatever price you purchase them for. Hours of laughter.	5.0	In 1 word: Brilliant	2003-07-17	5	4	1

It was the last episode in Season 9, a season in which all new Family Guy episodes were converted and made in the widescreen format. Previous seasons were in full screen. They're just keeping up with the times, and if people are really going to complain about ""not knowing"" or that ""the description never said that blah, blah, blah..."" maybe people should look at the customer reviews. Because a good majority of them have complaints about the widescreen format.In conclusion: great 3 episode arch of Family Guy.

I can quote all of the first 3 seasons word for word, and still laugh out loud to this day.Then seasons 4 came out and i have been throughouly dissapointed. Jokes are forced and more and more sex and dirty terms are forced in, its like there doing it just because they can.THEN THIS DVD CAME OUT! Oh heaven Oh Joy! here it is folks, Some old school family guy humor really busting your gut. There is just a laugh a miniute on this one. While i have to admin some jokes are still more edgy then i would have liked just because once again they seem a little forces, the majority of this is just what i always wanted from a family guy dvd. They dont overpush the swearing, except for 1 nonsense charichter.. and they dont overdo anything. The whole thing is just amazingly funny and the quality is sharp and the audio crisp. Amazing dvd, any family guy fan of the old stuff should really pick this up, or at least rent it and give it a chance.	5.0	Old School	2005-09-27	4	3	1
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	Well it has arrived, the second instalment in the Family Guy Star Wars project. Now that I have finally seen it after months of anticiaption I have to say it was good, but it was definitely not what Empire was to New Hope.First and foremost, this second installment was not going to be a surprise like the first one was. 'Something 3X Darkside' was based on the exact same map as 'Blue Harvest' Macfarlane and company stuck true to the origional film using their infamous humor and pop culture references. I will say there were some moments that caused me to laugh a lot so that was a plus. Another plus was the new characters introduced to play the rolls of the new Star Wars characters...yes even Meg makes her triumphant return. Still, there are some flaws here. I think that this new installment could have been a little different. An example would be how Peter tells the story, it didn't have to be another blackout. Also, the end of the episode ends up in another battle between Chris and Peter about Robot Chicken which makes no sense what so ever because Seth MacFarlane has plenty of Roles on Robot Chicken so Ihave no idea why he takes shots at it. Most importantly as a Family Guy fan I am not a fan of the fact that Stewie is an ambiguously gay character. If you want to use that comedy in the show its one thing, but don't bring that persona to Darth Vader. This is a movie that is suppose to be dark and it is really hard to lighten up a chapter such as this.Though all in all I think it was a well done piece of work and I am looking forward to 'Family Guy: We Have A Bad Feeling About This', I sure hope that thre will be a total of six episode, because I think they will rip Episode 1 to know end which will be pee in your pants hillarious!	4.0	A Decent Follow Up. *Will contain extremley minor spoilers*	2009-12-24	0	0	0

I've yet to figure out why anyone likes the show for any reason, least of all the humor. The show does have one redeeming quality, the voice acting. Seth MacFarlane, Seth Green and others do excellent work that I normally find funny, but the talent is wasted on this nonsense.I love comedy and animation and am a fan of many animated comedy shows: The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Venture Bros., Robot Chicken, Bullwinkle and others, and I have yet to see anything in Family Guy that makes it worth watching once, let alone repeatedly on DVD. The jokes are strained and have nothing to say, unlike the dark, incisive humor one finds in early The Simpsons, or on Futurama or South Park. As for being funny without making any particular social commentary, there are still plenty of animated comedy shows that are better at this too, like Harvey Birdman or the now defunct but once great Sealab 2021.Save your money and buy the DVDs of any of the other comedy shows mentioned above.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2I2HDCI4LJYNU	"voodoochild ""random person"""	"This is a blantant rip-off of the Simpsons. First off, yes this is a funny show, but it is only funny rarely and really only because of Seth Green and Alex Borstein.First off all, animated primetime shows were a dyind arts for 30 years before The simpsons came along, saved animated shows, became the 2nd greatest show ever (2nd to Monty Python) and unfortunatley inspired other people to make there other, most of them unfunny. The only really funny ones were Futurama and The Critic which wee Simpson spinoffs really anyway. Family Guy is one of those unfunny rip offs like American Dad which was on for about 3 weeks.)The Simpsons in seasons 3-6 did ""cutaways"", which were short bits that were unrelated. They were funny. This show copied it and did it for a few times for some laughs, but now the show is half cut aways and hardly any story. Mostly uneccisary nudity is what this show is now.Peter Griffin is fat, stupid, drinks at the local bar with his two friends one black one white, and loves his family in his white shirt and blue pants. So does Homer Simpson.Lowes Griffin is struggling to keep up with her three kids. So is Marge Simpson.Meg Griffin is a misfit, can't get a boyfriend, is unpopular and is the most ignored family member. So is Lisa Simpson. Do you see the patern now?What made me do this review was an outrage I had while watching the new one today. The fourth season episode ""Marge in Chains"" is an episode in which Marge goes to jail for shoplifting, meets friends in prison, and at home everything falls apart including the people. The one on a few hours was exacty the same. Are the low-brow devoted fans ever gonna wake up? Many of them are Simpson fans, so you'd think they'de have noticed by now, but are most likely denying it.This show has only gotten worse over time. I liked it when it first came out. The show has been less funny by now, like the Simpsons did, but that took over a decade, this show has only been on 5 years. When the season premire came out this year, it was the most unfunny thing. It was worse than friends for crying out loud. Jokes about cripples, Jesus on a cross (which is funny only if it goes so far, but this is just blashemous) and kids dying of cancer. That's not dark humor, just disgusting. It seems that to get attention, this show feels the need to try to shock it's audience for publicity or to possibly get more blockheads to buy the DVDs who enjoy constant fart jokes.The next day i mentiond to my friend about how bad that season opener was, and he a devoted fan claimed it was the worst episode they'd ever done.Besides a small amount of these early episodes being funny, it gets two stars for it's ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"" parody I saw on adult swim.So this show will now go into the category of 7-10pm sunday night shows, that have long been burned out, that's now being called ""Animation Domination. FOX has been trying to fill that 9pm spot after Malcolm in the Middle which if anybody noticed is live action. You should go on the internet and dicover how many shows have gone in that spot and been cancelled before there first season ended. Make a drinking game of it.So in conclusion, please don't purchase this DVD if you want smart, satirical humor that never ages wit constant topical jokes. Check out The Simpsons, Monty Python, MR. Show, Seinfeld, even the Honeymooners. If you enjoy low brow fart jokes, cripple jokes and lavatrial omur an average 1st grader would love, then click the ""NO"" button below and buy this DVD.(For the love of God don't buy this.)"	2.0	Spoaridic laughs make this a two star	2005-07-17	23	6	17

I wasn't expecting anything all too great or bad ...just a fun, well made flick like South Park. As I watched this movie, from the start I was pretty dissapointed. There were some funny scenes but overall the dialogue was poor and it seemed like the plot was just getting dragged till the end. It didn't seem like there was much effort put into making this movie even though it has been the hot topic with the show for many months now.

Only some of the episodes have a comentary sound track. And since it was originally a TV show designed for the 4:3 aspect ratio, it may look odd to you on a 16:9 wide-screen TV. But the encoding is good, and there are few artifact problems.Early reports said that this set would include the unaired episode, but only the Region 2 version includes it. That was disappointing. But there is still plenty of great episodes here.Fox resurected Family Guy more than once after cancelation. I still have hope that some day it'll once again be a summer replacement.

I don't see why everyone compares the 2 shows...sure, Peter isn't very bright. sure, they have the same amount of children as Homer and Marge, both animated, both appeared on Fox...that's about as far as it goes. With The Simpsons, we're treated every week to the family's adventures...it has been kept alive all these years with clever references and great dialogue. With Family Guy, we WERE treated every week to one joke, the funny flashback, then another funny flashback. Sadly, it was a one joke show...but, amazingly, IT WORKED! I love both of these shows for different reasons. I love the Simpsons for its smart writing and A+ references and I love Family Guy for the times I want to give my brain a rest and just enjoy a stupid laugh with no thought involved.I loved this DVD set, it sits on the shelf next to The Simpsons in perfect harmony...get over it people, they're just TV shows....enjoy them both, just stay away from King Of The Hill !!!	5.0	Separate but sometimes equal	2003-08-03	0	0	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"Here's irony for you: a show that constantly lampooned the stupidity of TV turned out to be too hip to last on TV.  Oh well, we now have this four-disc set to remind just what we've been missing since ""Family Guy"" was finally taken off the air.  While ""Family Guy"" certainly bears more than a token resemblance to ""The Simpsons,"" it distinguished itself by being even more random and outrageous than its animated predecessor.  Peter Griffin, the title character, basically IS Homer Simpson, except fatter, stupider, and more irresponsible.  Fortunately, ""Family Guy"" also shares ""The Simpsons""' subtle, irreverent brilliance.  Every few seconds brought another unpredictable gag, bizarre flashback, pop-culture parody, or social-historical reference.  While the episodes had plots, they basically unfolded in free-flowing stream-of-consciousness format, making it virtually impossible to tell what was coming next.  ""Family Guy"" spits out jokes so rapid-fire that you can barely even process it all.  Sometimes I've missed one crack because I was still laughing at the previous one.  Of course, the solution is to watch over and over again, which I'm sure I'm going to wind up doing.  Although it makes a great family comedy, ""Family Guy"" is successful mainly as a grand satire of American culture.  The show is constantly casting light on just how shallow, excessive, and flat-out stupid our society can be.  While its merciless parody may not appeal to shallow minds, ""Family Guy"" is a great alternative to the fluff that occupies way too much airtime these days.

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2KGFJG01JVQEC	Wiley and Vicki	I'm a huge fan of Family Guy's first 3 seasons, and a few of the episodes from 4 were ok, but I really expected more. It was an hour and a half of poorly written jokes and four letter words. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't offended by the language. I just think it's sad Family Guy has stooped to using crude language rather than clever jokes. If Meg getting made fun of for being boyish, Lois dropping the f bomb, and Chris yelling random things loudly sounds funny to you, then buy this. This ranks up there with Dumb & Dumberer and Saving Silverman as one of the least funniest movies of all time. Yeah - that bad.	1.0	Lame.	2005-09-27	19	8	11

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2T14I4WE5L6GP	Willow	The first time I ever saw Family Guy was actually in my history class - we had a free day and the teacher decided to bring in the DVDs. I was hooked after the first episode, and after watching three more, I knew that I wanted to buy the DVD set for myself. FAMILY GUY: VOLUME ONE is awesome, and totally worth the 35-40 bucks.Funniest episodes:Chitty Chitty Death Bang - Meg decides to skip Stewie's first birthday party, because she's been invited to a party thrown by some kids at school (something that hasn't happened before). When she gets there, it turns out to be a cult meeting.Love Thy Trophy - This is my absolute favorite episode of Family Guy. Meg gets a job at a diner, and when she realizes that she can make extra money in tips by telling people that her little brother (Stewie) is addicted to crack, he gets sent to a foster home.Death is a [...] - Peter goes to the hospital when he thinks he may have cancer, and when he doesn't, he doesn't feel like paying the outrageous hospital bills. So he pretends to be dead. But what he doesn't know is that Death has to come and get him now, and in a freak accident, the rules of death no longer apply.All the episodes on FAMILY GUY: VOLUME ONE are hilarious, and I just wish I had seen the show earlier. Highly recommended to fans of Friends, The Simpsons, etc.Overall grade - A	5.0	Hilarious TV show	2004-11-13	5	5	0

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	This much awaited Family Guy film is really very similar to the TV series, and if you like that, you'll also like this. It feels however, not so much a film as three episodes following the same story put together.The same humour is used, but cleverly avoids falling into the trap of being the same joke repeated over and over again. As with any Family Guy show, the humour is a little risque, sometimes offensive, but always very funny. Many of the small bit-part characters (some of whom only make one appearance in the TV show,) are also given small bit parts in the film.As with the TV show, there are often little random scenes to explain jokes, and in this film, they are more frequent, and much more random, but still work all the same. The bulk of the film revolves around Brian and Stewie, which is never a bad thing. In short, if you like Family Guy, or can appreciate a childish sense of humour with many adult themes, then you will love this film.	5.0	Very Funny	2006-06-21	1	1	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A2XMPSZ8VVEAGQ	"""y2k632"""	Family Guy.  One of the many shows Fox cancelled way before it's time.  The baby, Stewie, is one of the best cartoon characters that I have ever seen in all of my cartoon experience.  I watched the show on Fox when it was on, and it is unforgettable.  Plus, you get two seasons in one set, as opposed to The Simpsons, Futurama, and South Park, where you have to wait one season at a time.  Buy this set or be out of the inner circle.	5.0	A Classic Show Ended Too Quickly	2003-02-07	1	0	1

B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"While watching the first Star Wars parody, Blue Harvest, from the creators of Family Guy, I was struck by the originality of the ""episode"" (competition with Robot Chicken aside!).  Just seeing Peter as Han Solo, Brian as Chewbacca, Quagmire as C3PO, and Cleveland as R2-D2, among others, was enough to bring a smile to my face.  It was one thing to develop those characters on a weekly TV series, but a whole different thing entirely to take that character development and use it to make fun (and pay tribute to) the first Star Wars film.In this second spoof, ""Something, Something, Something, Dark Side"", the Family Guy team sends-up The Empire Strikes Back.  Since that first shock-value of seeing all our favorite characters in the Star Wars universe is gone, it is more up to the jokes than ever, as sight gags just weren't going to cut it anymore.  With that being said, this entry into the FG cannon performs about as well as anything else...some jokes are brutally offensive, others fall completely flat, and still others are so funny that you'll be chuckling out loud and almost miss the next one!  Really, the success of the TV show stems from the fact that creator Seth McFarlane and Co. know no bounds in terms of poking fun at anything and everything, and that is once again the case here.Basically, this was another funny little entry into the FG universe (literally!) that does pretty much what it is supposed to do.  Fans of the show will eat it up (awkward moments and all), while non-fans will probably find it offensive and turn it off."	4.0	Novelty Is Gone, But Still Funny	2010-01-19	0	0	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A1MDJN25C9AUFF	"Zach ""Zach"""	"As you can probably tell, I'm not too good at coming up with titles for my reviews. Anyway, Family Guy ranks among the greatest television shows ever produced. I have loved the show for a very long time, and used to watch it when it was on Fox (and will again once it comes back) which was when I was in 4th and 5th grade (I'm an 8th grader now). Even though I didn't get almost all of the show's references (the few I got were ones aimed at things any 4/5th grader should know as well as the All in the Family and Jeffersons references), but I still loved the show. I guess I must've understood half of the jokes. Not most of the references, and not ones involving stuff I shouldn't have known back then. Anyway, I loved the show, and it was horrible to see it leave. I can't even describe the rush of excitement and joy I felt when I heard that opening song for the first time in almost two years (on Adult Swim). Two years that had gone by with no way for me to see the show. Oh, it was great. The episode I saw is one of the best episodes of the show, ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar."" I can't wait for the new season, which MacFarlain describes as ""Bigger than Jesus.""Anyway, Family Guy accomplishes what most shows cannot. Multiple laughs per a minute. I guarantee that in only fifty episodes you'll laugh almost as many times as you will watching every episode of South Park (slight Exaggeration there). Most of Family Guy's jokes are when a character references something that happened to them in the past, and then we see a short flashback that ends up being hilarious. The bad thing about this, though, is when you're watching other shows and they reference something that happened to them in the past, you expect them to jump to a flashback and they disappointingly do not.Anyway, Family Guy is a hilarious, brilliant show and this set contains the first 2 seasons (28 episodes: Season 1-7 episodes-Season 2-21 episodes), hitting its stride during the second season. Please enjoy this 4-disc set. I know I did."	5.0	Family Guy-It's Good	2004-08-26	2	2	0
B000083C6V	Family Guy, Volume One	A30580SJ3V6WMV	Zane	Many  of my friends began watching Family Guy back when it was on Fox, but I didn't get into it until it became somewhat of a scavanger hunt to find when it was on.  It is a true injustice that this show was taken off the air.  Although we won't be seeing any new episodes, this dvd set let's us have a huge selection of old episodes to watch for years and years to come.Allow me to speak more about the show itself, rather than it's history, for those who need a little extra insentive to order this wonderful collection.  Family Guy is the greatest cartoon ever.  It's jokes are very random, yet very very funny.  The jokes barely ever get stale and the &quot;running jokes&quot; the creators decided to use are used with enough moderation that they stay funny too.  This show is a cult classic.  It's one of those shows that was surpressed by the powers that be at fox, but still has a strong following.  It's one of those things that you just want to forever tatoo onto your mind, so you can quote it and remember the good times.  I would say Family Guy, is perfect for the college guy.  The best going away present you could get, I'd say.The only reason I would not suggest this dvd set for, is for the fact that some jokes in the cartoon (especially in the first couple episodes) can be taken as offensive.  Now for those who do not get offended that is just one more reason to purchase this set.I really can't stress this ehough so I'll just say, BUY IT, buy it now, buy it RIGHT NOW, it is such a great value.  I doubt that I did this product much service writing this review, read the other ones too their good, then make your decision.  Trust me, it's awesome.Plus keep an eye out for Vol. 2 coming later this year.	5.0	Complete Adoration	2003-07-06	1	1	0
