B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2RPJCRBQFCSMZ	"10th Mountain Soldier ""PEJ97"""	(...) This movie made the entire US Army look like a bunch of uneducated, ruthless killers.  This movie is so one sided and anti Bush.  While the facts presented in this documentary may be true, if you buy this movie you might as well go fight along side the Talian and the other terrorist organizations fighting US forces in the Middle East.  As an American soldier that fought in Operation Enduring Freedom IV, I came home to this movie that totally belittled the US Army.  Mr Moore portrays the US Army as an organization that thrives on tricking young, poor, uneducated Americans into enlisting for the US Army.  While that is totally untrue he even still protrays the Army as a killing machine that enjoys killing innocent Iraqi civilians.  Althought the movie is dedicated to those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan; if you have an ounce of patriotism and pride for the country in which you live then I highly recomend passing on this movie.  Coming home to this movie was like coming home to a kick in the balls!	1.0	fahrenheit 9/11	2004-10-05	68	13	55

Each of his films has shown a greater degree of skill at obfuscation, distortion, and deliberate misinterpreting to make his point.Make no mistake, this IS an entertaining film.  But it is also less credible as a documentary than John Wayne in 'Sands of Iwo Jima'.If you favor rational and logical thought, avoid this film, as it has none of those qualities.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AX8UXTLF70B8Q	3-006	What an absolutely brilliant documentary! I chose not to see this in the movies because of reports of ultra-violent gun-toting right wing neoconservative freaks threatening and harassing decent movie-goers and I didn't want to get arrested by corrupt redneck jackbooted cops for kicking all their asses.Instead, I bought the DVD, but not from Amazon. I have already been successful in changing the minds of over ninety two voters who were either planning on not voting, considering voting for Bushmonkey or, for some ill-conceived notion, voting for Nader.What I am going to do now is buy many, many copies from Amazon and mail them out to various groups, clubs, etc. that I know so they can learn the truth and change their minds too.The great thing about Fahrenheit 911 is that it presents factual information to the viewing public who is sick of getting slanted news from the corporate media giants such as Fox and CBS. Moore investigates the issues thoroughly and presents them clearly and concisely. It also doesn't hurt that he's a near comic genius.I've investigated these issues myself and have found Moore to be completely accurate in every instance. He represents the truth whereas FOX and Headrush Limbaugh spew venomous lies to unsuspecting dipsh*ts who shovel it into their slackjawed mugs like fools.Watch Michael Moore's brilliant documentary Fahrenheit 911 and learn the evil truth behind the Bush dictatorship's foreign policy protocol.Bush has no values.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3KDTNAI35RSKM	Aaron Hall	"Despite the multi-million dollar smear campaign that was waged against the president, he was still able to triumph over Moore, Soros, Franken, and 80% of the media, which backed Kerry. Sure Michael Moore made a lot of money off of people who pay to listen to an overweight multi-millionaire advocate socialism (if he really cared about the poor, do you think he would weigh > 200 lbs? A family of three could live for a week off of this guy's breakfast), make baseless accusations, and doctor interviews, but I don't think Michael was in this for the cash (though that doesn't hurt). He and Soros wasted all their time money and efforts on a fruitless cause -- unless of course their goal was to parody the left and show Americans how much liberals despise this country, thus garnering votes for the GOP. This is what they succeeded in doing anyway.Michael has mentioned that his new project is to ""educate"" the 51% of the electorate that is too smart -- or too stupid as he calls us -- to imbibe his feces and say ""yum, delicious.""Here's a tip for liberals (don't know why I'm doing this): Calling people who vote against you stupid will not get them to change their opinions.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1KQYZZNN4G4XT	Aaron J. Marx	"People need to understand that criticizing the president of the United States is not the same as criticizing America.  America is a big country and everyone helps to make it what it is.  When some people don't like the way other people are taking it, no matter who those people are are how much power they have, they often speak out about it, and it is their right and responsibility to do so.  I'm surprised at the degree of flippancy with which the word ""Unamerican"" is being bandied about these days.  You'd think Americans would be much warier of that word, particularly for the associations it has carried since the 1950s when Joseph McCarthy wielded it like an errant locomotive and destroyed the careers of countless government officials and other Americans through the simple power of vague suggestion.  I'd really hate to see that happen again, but it seems that many right-wing Americans are not afraid to utilize such techniques to silence the left, then as now.  It's a dangerous game and we have to keep it in historical perspective.That having been said, I think Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very important film, and a very important historical event.  In his propoganda (yes, I believe it is propaganda, but no one is criticizing George W. Bush's television ads, which potentially play to a much larger audience.  I suppose that would be be dangerously Unamerican...) Moore gives all Americans who oppose the war a very clear and decisive voice against our current administration.  While I don't always admire Moore's techniques, I don't think that the minor flaws that critics tend to gravitate toward invalidate the film or diminish its prevailing message.  Perhaps the war was good in certain ways.  It unseated a vicious dictator, and perhaps will mean a better way of life for the Iraqis that survive.  But I think Moore's film should raise questions in anyone's mind concerning the war's real motivation.  Doesn't it seem suspicious to anyone that focus shifted so quickly from Osama bin Laden (you just don't hear much about him anymore, do you?) to Saddam Hussein?  It felt to me like he just kind of came out of nowhere, and I didn't need Moore to suggest that to me.  And why Iraq?  Aren't there other oppressive governments in the world like, for example, Sudan or, (gasp) Saudi Arabia? To answer that question, Moore exposes the Bush familly's extremely suspicious corporate connections with Saudis and oil businesses like Dick Cheney's Haliburton, which has received almost $1 billion in no-bid contracts to harvest Iraqi oil .  No one who criticizes the film seems to want to touch that issue, and I think it is at the heart of the film.  It is a truly important question: if you received $400,000 a year from one group of people and $1.4 billion a year from another, whose best interest would you be quicker to serve?Certain parts of Moore's film bothered me.  I think he panders to his audiences emotionally and uses low blows to make his subjects look more ridiculous than they are, but no one can deny that he is a gifted film maker and feels strongly about the message he delivers.  I'm very proud that a  pro-American like Michael Moore is giving such a powerful voice to values in which I have believed for years.  There are very ugly issues on our table and we need to clear them off before sitting down to take pride in our nation.  Before you criticize what I have written, make sure you are actually criticizing, and not simply falling back on the fact that my arguments are common or ""old.""  If you have a valid argument, use it.  But if not don't just jerk your knees and raise your voice without saying anything.  Understand that my voice is one of many (common) voices calling for change in November, and I'm glad to have Michael Moore as a spokesman."	4.0	Anti-Bush is not Anti-American!	2004-07-09	22	17	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3AS2RIKV4KHEB	Abby	"I have felt really alone in my opinions for a long, long time.  Especially after Bush was re-elected. I felt like the only one in the entire country that sees the truth about him.  This video gave me a lot of hope, that maybe people will see it and change their minds.  This video is extremely one-sided, I will admit.  If you hate Bush, you'll love it.  If you voted for Bush, you may feel stupid, but you will probably just be mad.  Michael Moore's opinions are very, very strong and if you do not agree with them, his documentaries tend to fall flat.  Also, I do not believe that all of his ""facts"" in the video are necessarily true.  Some of them are a little far-fetched, and even while I do not support the Bush administration, some of what was said in the video just doesn't seem reasonable.  But other than that, the footage of the war was real and I was saddened to see what's going on over there (for both sides.  The footage of the Iraqi children, the dead baby, and the other dead civilians was enough to make me look away from the tv for a few seconds).  And knowing that this war has no real purpose makes me sadder than anything else.  Anytime people die in a war with no cause leaves me with a churning anger in my stomach.  I was not alive during the Vietnam war, but I can still feel the anger that has lingered in the country over such an unnecessary bloodshed.I don't really like Michael Moore, but this documentary was exactly what I needed.  I watched it after learning that one of my good friends is going to war sometime this year.  It was suggested to me I watch this.  I have been against the Iraq war for awhile now.  It wasn't always that way.  I was at one time a huge Bush supporter/war supporter and one of those crazy Republicans you dread getting into an argument with.  Of course I feel like a moron for that now, and I have since become a Democrat.  But at the time (just after 9/11), I felt terrified and unsafe in this country and, like everyone else in America, I turned to the guy who said he had all the answers, the guy who said he would protect us from another terrorist attack and secure our future by avenging the 9/11 deaths (something that I DO feel was necessary, by the way.  I am not against all war, but striking Iraq after Afghanistan was pointless and had *nothing* to do with it).  Now I feel cheated and lied to, and also very powerless.  I feel like those of us in America that are against the war no longer have a say.  We are pushed to the side and called anti-american.  Michael Moore finally gave us the voice that was taken from us when Bush was re-elected.  I do not know what the next four years will bring, but I know that if things continue as they are, America will never recover.  And that is sadder than anything."	4.0	Finally. . .	2005-03-17	14	7	7

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1B8X2522NIPYH	"acrosstheuniverse2005 ""acrosstheuniverse2005"""	"Many claimers exist out in our world who are denouncing Michael Moore as idiocy and the father of inaccuracy, but those very comments are clearly hogwash and an attempt to character assassinate Michael Moore. Why they would ""attempt"" to do that to a man who is actually revolutionizing our world with his film, instead of a man, that is Bush, who has almost destroyed our country? Obviously, they have nothing better to do than spout off ""their"" inaccurate claims that he is incorrect. All one needs to do is visit MichaelMoore.com to ""verify"" the supposed ""inaccurate"" facts with news stories and data to backup his claims.Another ""true"" erroneous assertion that Bush supporters ""continue"" to make is that ""our"" media is liberal. HA! Have they not seen the partisan documentary ""Free Speech for Sale,"" or ""The Myth of the Liberal Media""? The media in America is far from liberal. The gatekeepers, are almost always white, conservative, and Republicans. Don't believe me, stop being brainwashed by the ""conservative"" media and (again) watch, ""The Myth of The Liberal Media."" Ben Bagdikian's book, ""The Media Monopoly"" is an excellent book talking about how media power ""is"" political power. Hence, the conservative power of the media as gatekeepers to skew, censor or shape news discourse.Regrettably, Republican ideology generally avoids change that occurs in society and instead pushes for things to ""stay the same,"" or for them to ""go back to the way it used to be."" But if people ""go back"" to the way things used to be, they will again unleash many of society's ills that we continue to desperately fight against. Moreover, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to re-elect our current Republican president once more. But unfortunately, these buffoons did!Among many other things, earlier last year, Bush advocated writing discrimination into the Constitution, he has been handed nearly everything to him in life because of his last name, he cannot sufficiently articulate on par with most other politicians, he continues to push through legislation and tax cuts that benefit the very rich, and he has aligned himself with extreme right-wing organizations and people.As a matter of fact, one of the nation's most powerful driving force is deeply embedded into the Republican Party: The Religious Right. Unfortunately, religion has been used for hundreds of years to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion.Today, of course, we do not experience the extreme religious fanaticism that occurred centuries ago. Nevertheless, with the Religious Right backed by millions of dollars and millions of faithful followers, they easily continue lobbying their agenda to Washington. As it is now, it is also a very threatening situation when seven of the highest-ranking Republican senators receive a 100 percent scorecard from the right-wing organization, the Christian Coalition.In his book, ""The Most Dangerous Man in America?: Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition,"" Robert Boston sheds much light on Robertson's theocratic rhetoric, which threatens the separation of church and state on many interrelated issues. Most absurdly, during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice in 1993, Robertson commented, ""There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.""The author also makes known many of Robertson's sordid actions and claims, which include his ability to communicate with God directly, and the insensitive comments he made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that were also very similar to Jerry Falwell's. Unfortunately, President Bush has certainly done his part to please the Religious Right. For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general.Regarding Ashcroft, in my letter-to-the-editor published in the San Antonio Current on Jan. 25, 2001, I said, ""During his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft sponsored unconstitutional legislation violating the Bill of Rights. He is against the Fourth Amendment. He refused to protect abortion clinics from right-wing organizations. He praised Confederate soldiers for fighting to uphold slavery. He blocked the nomination of a gay man for an ambassadorship. He fought federal judgeship of an African American, and blocked efforts to bring an end to racial profiling.""In the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. It did not happen last year, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.And Michael, Michael Moore: God Bless You for making this film. Although Bush is president again, I know God will help us...and these brainwashed people who voted for him...I pray that they will see the light as many of us have already seen it, for years. God keep our country safe from terrorists, ultra-conservative Republicans destroying our country and from complacency and apathy! I have faith!

Hard for me to say from way over here in China.My biggest complaint about this movie is that I can't spell Fahrenheit. How'd that first 'h' get in there? Yeah, it's a guy's name. But still. I bet Ray Bradbury, his editor, or both, used a dictionary when they worked on Fahrenheit 451. Maybe Celsius 9/11 would be a better title. I can spell that.Last week, a friend whose writing I greatly admire asked me an interesting question. Is this movie as popular in China as it is in the U.S.? My answer was that I don't know because I haven't found the theater in Shaoxing yet.The film's getting the ink over here. But I doubt it's in the Chinese theaters yet. They don't just whack in subtitles. They dub every film in Chinese, a source of justifiable pride. So time is required.On the other hand, I saw the VCD in a video store and snagged it. I prefer DVDs, but they didn't have one. I bought the DVDs of ROGER & ME and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE in Hangzhou, and I recently ordered DUDE, WHERE'S MY COUNTRY? (a book) from Amazon.All the DVDs and VCDs here have a number of language options, and if the original film is in English, one option for the audio will be English.(Except for HAMLET with Sir Lawrence Olivier -- he only speaks Chinese. All these years that you thought he was British, you were mistaken.)We know what Michael Moore's going to do before we watch any of his films or read any of his books, don't we? He's gonna find some facts, mix in some opinions, and make us think. I suppose if you like someone he's aimed at, the thinking parts gets a wee bit painful.It may surprise you to know that Michael Moore always gets a few laughs out of me. Since TV NATION. His subjects can be so serious that some viewers are just stunned or outraged. But I laughed at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 several times.I enjoy ""reviewing"" something that you've already heard about. It saves me the trouble of recapping the plot before I go into my opinionated spouting mode.I read an article in a Fayetteville (North Carolina) newspaper about how this was surprisingly popular in that Fort Bragg town. It included the line ""Twelve other theaters in North Carolina are carrying 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' according to the film's Web site.""What? You mean only 13 theaters in all of North Carolina are showing this? Would it really have been harder for me to watch it if I hadn't moved to China? Please don't make me confess my deep dark secret, that I was born in Fayettenam, I mean Fayettehell, I mean Fayetteville.I'm glad FAHREINHEIT 9/11 was released in an election year. When I left the U.S., the First Amendment guaranteed freedom of speech. It's nice to know Bush hasn't repealed it yet.Oh, and I think Michael Moore should be grateful he's not Chinese.

You decide how well it is done. The opening says the following Interviews and Commentaries are for entertainment, the views and opinions belong to the individual speakers. The film starts by predicting a victory in Florida for Al Gore, then the networks change their projection and declare a Bush victory. Over what time span? [If Gore won his home state of Tennessee he would have been President.] Why did NO US Senator sign on to that petition? Was the fix in? People protested at the Inauguration. Bush was the vacationing President.On September 11, 2001 two airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers. [Bush looks clueless after receiving the news.] The film asks whether Saudi money went to George W. when his father was President. Were there any other connections? What about the Carlyle Group? The attack on the WTC meant a larger military budget. There are connections between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family. Why did Bush use 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq? Can fear be used to scare people and justify government oppression? The FBI knew Al Qaeda had supporters in America who were taking flying lessons. Do Congressmen read the laws before they vote for them?The film shows the ""collateral damage"" on the people of Iraq. Brittany Spears trusts Bush, why don't you? The Bush administration said there was no threat from Iraq in 2001. Was this a mistake? Is the high unemployment in parts of America a way to generate troops for the military? Then we see the invasion of a house in Iraq to find a suspect. ""What did he do?"" Why do they hate our troops in Iraq? Why did Bush try to cut wages and benefits for soldiers? Will the bombing of Iraq create business opportunities in rebuilding Iraq? Would Iraq be invaded if there was no oil? Should Congress ask their children to join the Army? These are all good questions.There is a quote from George Orwell about the need for war to keep a ruling group in power. Orwell was a cynic, peace is more likely to keep a regime in power. A loss in war usually leads to regime change, as in 1952 and 1968. What about 2008? This film is sort of slow-paced, but that is the result of using facts and not staged events. It provides reports that you won't see on corporate television. After Reagan was elected he raised the lowest tax bracket from 9% to 15%. Social Security taxes were raised by 50%. This allowed the highest tax rate to be cut by 50%. Most people were taxed more so the wealthiest could be taxed less. Real wages fell as well. These economic policies led to today's recession.

There are plenty of critiques of the factuality of the movie's statements, so I won't bother with those. Instead, I'll talk about my opinions of the style and content.It begins very well. It's easy to follow as long as you pay attention, and keeps a good fast pace. It slows down dramatically when the story visits Moore's hometown and goes on to cover the soldiers fighting in Iraq.It's almost like the coverage of his hometown and Iraq is a different movie, inserted into the middle of the real show. It's different in pace, style, and purpose. As I mentioned above, it's a slow pace. It also tries to illicit sorrow and emotional pain with the audience, with scenes and stories about loss of loved ones and ruined lives. Perhaps he should have made a separate movie about the personal loss, as a tribute and healing aid to those families and individuals who have had so much taken away from them by this war. The slower, more deliberate pace would have been well served with this separate movie.But, that aside, the rest of the movie was very entertaining. It definitely makes George W. Bush look like a complete and total idiot with multiple clips of media coverage. I do believe that Bush is an idiot, and am ashamed of him being our president just for that alone. There are those who claim those clips are taken out of context, without any of Bush's intelligent moments taken into account as well. I defend my view against that by pointing out that the simple fact that Bush has said and done those things, out of context or not, shows he's a selfish idiot. No caring, intelligent person would have spoken or done most of the things Bush is shown in the movie, whether they were at a formal dinner or hanging out with friends. A competent president wouldn't make those mistakes, or at least would be competent enough to minimize the damage. Bush isn't competent.The final comment I have on the movie is about the opening scene where he tries to make many of the Bush administration's officials look foolish as they prepare to be on camera. Paul Wolfowitz using his own saliva to comb his hair is an example. I've been working in TV broadcasting for almost a year now, and I've seen stranger. I also say ""So what?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1HOMI8CVEBV40	"Adaptation ""Chopstick"""	"Honestly! If your a republican, then WHY do you act so surprised when it offends you? Now I'm not gonna attack republicans, this is a DVD review, but.....just a little word of advice. If you didn't like the movie, or if you are a Pro-Bush person, Don't give me a hard time, ITS JUSt A REVIEW, and to be fair and balanced, I will actually take the Republican perspective as a sub review.Democratic View:Okay, When I saw this movie, I thought the beginning was a little commercialised, but it was well made. When Mike Moore does a film, he always starts with a very good beginning. As the film progresses, we see all that we thought had happened, but never really confirmed. Yes, Bush did actually take a vacation the first days in office, I actually have the taped news report from 2000, and no, it definatly wasn't FOX. With the progression of the film we also bear whitness to alot of opinions from a wide variety of people, the most compelling to me, was the homless woman, screaming at the white house, one of those moments. Also, another thing that was brought to our knowlege is that, however ""Brave"" our solders are...They are mostly men. and alot of those men joined the army as some gung-ho fancey. Now don't get me wrong, some of our troops have joined for noble causes, but there are those few, racist, wicked men, who just want to shoot some muslims, either because of the sterio-type that all muslims are terrorists, or due to religious belief. Now, in many a review i have seen the terms ""Bucket of Lies""  ""No informational Value"" and ""Just a Bush-bashing Film with no sence of Truth"" I just want to say, This does have informational value, It ISNT complete lies, and there is some truth to what moore has said. Now, could this be a vendetta film? Perhaps..but if it is...its the best damn vendetta film i ever saw. The thing is...It is a very well made film, regarless of content. Somewhere in the middle of the film , we meet a very republican mother, whos very proud of her son whos over in Iraq. Then one day, he dies, and WHAM! her entire perspective changes, We see a group of solders in a tank, ready to bombard a city, and of all the songs they can play, the listen to "" Let the Mother F**kers burn"" We see what might have been, we see what could have been, and we see that as americans, we are only human.Now for the republican stand point:As many of you put it: This was a pure anti-bush film. Mike Moore seems to hate almost everything, and you can tell. This movie was Bush-Bash after Bush Bash after Bush-Bash, and didn't even give republicans the benifit of the doubt. We see what could be proof of a vendetta when bush turns down Moore, in a confrence telling him to ""Get a life"" He probably should, but you have to admit: He's made it pretty good so far. Along with what seems to be vastly embellished truth, also, Moore always seems to want to put in vastly greusome pictures to proove his point. Another thing, I don't think anyone should bring polotics to the emmys, no matter what you opinion is, but moore seemed to deem it absolutly fit, so here you go. As far as alot of the material goes in the movie, it seems moore expects to change everyone's beliefs, but to be liberal, shouldn't you have to let people believe what they want to? Isnt that, like a rule or something? who knows, but one thing is certain, this movie has caused quite the ruccus, be that a bad thing or a good thing.To end my review, I would like to call apon the Great Charlie Chaplin, to give us a word of advice, We ALL need.""The Great Dictator""We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.The way of life can be free and beautiful.But we have lost the way.Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish...Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written "" the kingdom of God is within man "" - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you, the people.You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting - the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.The soul of man has been given wings - and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope - into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up."""	5.0	Come on!

Case in point: Fahrenheit 9/11. This movie is chuck full of clips taken entirely out of context and purposely made to look George Bush stupid with ""dumb music"" playing in the background. There are clips that are supposed to show the President's ineffectiveness but they are utterly pointless. Let's take the scene where George Bush is at the elementary school and he's told the news about the Twin Towers by his secret service agent. The President continues to sit in the classroom listening to the child who's talking. I suppose that the purpose of this scene is to show how idiotic the President was by not reacting. Firstly, we don't know what the President was told exactly. No one knew at the time that the attack on the Twin Towers was a terrorist act. Secondly, what exactly did Moore expect the President to do? Panic and leave? Tell the child who's speaking to stop and run out? What he did instead was to do what we would expect a President to do during a time of crisis: he kept his cool and left the school without raising any alarms in front of little children. There is another clip where the President says that he's not concerned about Osama Bin-Laden. Again, this clip was taken out of context. The President has said repeatedly that he's not interested in individuals in the axis of terror but the entire network.Whether or not you're a George W. Bush fan, Michael Moore's work is here to appeal to our emotions and spin the facts. This movie deserves zero stars."	1.0	Pushing an agenda	2006-09-06	22	7	15

They both spew irrational nonsense aimed directly at your heart while swiftly avoiding your brain. Movies of this nature are designed to incite rage and anger amongst those viewing it who agree, and those who disagree with the thoughts within. I am enraged for a different reason.I have never had a logical discussion about politics with anyone who thoroughly believes in films like this (or books like Ann Coulter's). Viewers and readers are all mindless sheep, and if they aren't, they sure are treated like them. This is politics, WWE style. I am not a Republican or a Democrat; I am not a conservative or a liberal. I have my own beliefs and I refuse to align myself with either side because of radicals such as these.  The only reason I am giving this movie 2 stars is because it at least acknowledges that we shouldn't mindlessly give into everything we're told about the way the country is run.  However, this is still propaganda garbage that I can't see any difference between it and watching The O'Reilly Factor.Dismantle the two party system, we are not a free country.	2.0	Dissent is the only reason I give this two stars	2007-11-01	15	6	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AI8PFLG9QLDPE	Adrian T. Chan	"Being a non-american, I think this is one of the most powerful & self-critical documentary film ever made in this country or any country. And for once, none of the patriotic crap that seem to attempt to brainwash the general average americans (e.g independence day).  I wish we  all can""trust the president"" as Britney said with such naivety. It shows how blinded we can become.True, Moore may have manipulated and exagerated the facts, and turns it into a very biased anti-Bush movie. And here is where the film technique is so great, with excellent editing technique, justaposing different parts of the film to great persuasiveness, (notably the part where Britney suddenly appears chewing her gum like an idiot). And what humor and sarcasm. The end result is that after watching the movie, you feel like killing the president! (and if this is about a Korean or Taiwanese politician, sure there would be riots on the street by now!)But there are also objective parts too, notably a touching interview with the mother who lost her son, who loaths Bush for sending her son to a useless war, plus quotations of soldiers who realise the meaninglessness of this war. Plus a powerful clip of how none of the politicians involved in the war want to send their children to warApart from the fact of ""war on oil"" which every knows anyway (or are in denial of this fact), there are a few very disturbing information, namely the Bushes family's personal ties with the Bin Ladins, and their personal oil/energy business. All politicians lie(it's their job) but what appears to be most disturbing is how Bush appears to do one thing, but in fact has an alternative motive, possibly a personal one. If he lies for the good of the nation, it may be forgiven, but to launch a war for personal gain is unacceptable.Few weakness here. More elaborate information regarding Saudis' funding the terrorists and H. Bin Ladin's relation with his family would be more provoking. Bin Ladin may not be as mad or evil as we think. He's sick of the dark oil bussiness ties between the Saudis & America and his terrorist activities may have wanted to stop such ties. It's just his way of doing things are totally wrong.In the end, a powerful quotation from Orwell's ""1984"" sumarises how a dictator can manipulate war in order to give stability to a society by inflicting constant fear of something: the Vietnam & Korean war, Cold war, and now ""war on Terror"". In a frightening way, a totalitarian state is not that different from the current situation in America. While, I'm not saying that Bush is like Stalin or Mao, it makes a chilling but apt comparison between a democratic world's leader and that of a dictator."	5.0	The ultimate anti-bush documentary	2004-07-14	50	36	14
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AZSN1TO0JI87B	A. Estes	"I'm not going to claim to be the smartest person when it comes to politics, I'm not. I don't know (and neither do you, fellow reviewers) everything that is going on behind the scenes in America, so I can't really say that what is presented in Michael Moore's highly praised ""Farhenheit 9/11"" is %100 relevant. Afterall, as someone who considers himself to be 100 percent democrat, even I can see that this documentary is lop-sided. From the beginning, it is almost evident that Moore has a personal axe to grind with Dubbya, as displayed early on when the kind gentlemen that is our president, greets Moore with the sentiments ""Get a real job."" But then again, who doesn't have a problem with Bush these days? I have to say, on a personal level, what has happened to America over the past four years, and some of the values Bush stands for, downright piss me off. And the funny part about this movie is, none of the information was surprising to me. It shows Bush as the true moron he is at times, such as when he is doing an interview in a small-town where he says that the people ""don't know the meaning of hard-work"" or in the extra-features, after an interview with the 9/11 Commission, telling the reporters that he talked about ""stuff"" and ""things"" and ""topics."" Not the best P.R. guy, eh? His past is dug into quite a bit here, and not surprisingly, the connections with the Bin Laden family. Make no mistake, there is ample Bush-bashing here. If you're a supporter of the dude, it's gonna infuriate you. But I hardly think Moore is providing us with false information, afterall, his nasal-voiced narration is mainly done over stock footage and interviews, can't really make this stuff up folks (editing my ass). It doesn't have all the answers, or any at all, but let's not make outrageous statements like ""Anti-American"" or simply cutting Moore down by mentioning his weight, something which the average American seems to struggle with. Just watch the movie. Absorb what is presented to you, do more research, and then develop an opinion of your own. I don't take this work as gospel; I knew who I was voting for before this movie came out. Just like I don't need Ben Affleck and Bruce Springsteen to help me make up my mind, I didn't need this movie to do it either. This film and other propaganda, pro or anti-Bush, should be taken with a grain of salt. The people making these films have their own political agendas, and are usually only telling half the side, which is the case with ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" I didn't want Bush as my president, but I don't exactly see him as the embodiment of all evil, just the embodiment of all stupidity (sorry, couldn't help it). But the bottom line is: The film is well-made, and in typical Moore fashion, entertains and informs.

However, considering the subject matter, there arises a very dangerous possibility.I overheard some kids (who couldn't have been over fourteen or fifteen) talking about how The Pentagon wasn't really hit on 9/11.  One of them said that Iraq was going to become a U.S. territory and, oh yes, the draft was coming back.  After all that, they started talking about this film and how awful our president is and how they can't believe he's getting away with all of this.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2ELP13J2HSGJQ	AJ Denny	"Oscar-winner (""Bowling for Columbine"") Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an agitation propaganda documentary. You'll probably like it or not depending if you support John Howard and George W. Bush. Moore's agenda leaves no room for complex analysis of the evidence he uses to support his point of view. Instead we are treated to a 112-minute long blame game.Moore's film is a scathing political attack on the presidency of George W. Bush. The blank, vague look on his face much of the time speaks volumes. Especially when on September 11 2001, after been told a second plane had struck the World Trade Centre, he sat for seven minutes in a Florida kindergarten, reading ""My Pet Goat."" This footage was only available because the kindergarten teacher had her own video camera running.Much of the film is about the murky connections between the Bush family, the bin Laden family (Osama bin Laden's father was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia), and the Saudi royal family. Interspersed with his footage of the grim reality of war, even the Arab news channel Al Jazeera would have shied away from. You get to see the devastating effect of supposed smart weapons on Iraqi children in brutal detail.Although Moore himself didn't go to Iraq, there is also extensive coverage of the US troops there, operating in and around Baghdad. They are in turn scared, angry at been there, and pumped full of adrenaline at getting to play with very big, dangerous toys. One sequence shows a patrol ridiculing a hooded detainee, one man (unlike the prison guards at Abu Ghraib, he was smart enough to wear a balaclava) sexually humiliating the prisoner.One of the final powerful, though once again painful to watch, sequences was of grief stricken mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son Michael Pedersen had been killed in Iraq. His last letter home was full of anger at Bush, saying ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" In tears outside the Whitehouse a Bush supporter tells her she should be blaming Al Qaeda for the death of her son.Much of this information is not new, but just isn't presented clearly by the news media. Here it is packaged in a way, has clearly sparked heated debate amongst Americans. A filmmaker who wasn't Michael Moore probably could have handled the material more deftly, and with much less hatred, but Moore gets across his anger to you. You will leave the cinema feeling like having a long talk with John Howard about getting the troops back now."	3.0	Propoganda Misfired	2005-11-11	12	5	7

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1D4OSW475FGC2	A. K. Williford	"I am a wife, mother of four, college-educated professional, and ex-welfare recipient (three desperate years spent struggling to GET OFF welfare, resume independence, and regain dignity) who by virtue of a previous marriage to a drug addict has likely seen more of the underside of society and politics than many in my demographic classification. I don't consider myself a fanatic, but am known for calling a spade what it is.  This being said, I agree for the most part with ""a customer (France)"" in that Fahrenheit 9/11 probably was not the most objective documentary I've ever viewed.  However, it did contain compelling questions that I don't believe should be ignored by any responsible voting American.The answers that Mr. Moore suggests to these questions don't hold as much importance to me in the grand scheme of things as they seem to for other reviewers. Instead, I believe that the questions raised by Moore in his film MUST be asked and answered by (and to the satisfaction of) ALL Americans, if they are to be honest about their futures, their country, and its leaders.  Running from the answers in blind loyalty to party politics does all of us a disservice -- it's not about who supports whom or what kind of man Michael Moore is.  To me, it's really about what kind of leadership and future you want for your family and its progeny.To clarify for the French reviewer: in my opinion, the emotional scenes did not weaken the message for many American viewers who are compelled to send their sons and daughters to fight for a war that, according to Moore and many others, doesn't seem to have a purpose that would benefit the average American citizen.  (I will admit my bias, since I have three children who are likely candidates for military participation.)  The mother in the film began by expressing her loyalty to US leaders and their decisions, and considerable screen time elapsed before she began to give any indication that she wasn't gung-ho for the cause.  It is my belief that part of her tears might be *because* of that loyalty and trust -- she literally gave her son to a cause that, if one believes the assertions in this film, was in large part misrepresented and in all likelihood, unnecessary.  (Well, some folks may think it was ""necessary,"" but this mother made the ultimate sacrifice to test the validity of that assertion.)At the outset of the US invasion of Iraq, my eighteen-year-old son, who lives on his own, attends college part-time and works full-time, was very pro-war.  He carefully listened to the reports emanating from the media and read voluminously about the causes of, revelations and  discoveries involving, politics surrounding, etc. the war for many weeks, then months.  Each time I visited with him, his outlook regarding the whole scenario seemed to gradually change.  Today he is no longer in favor of the invasion, war, or occupation.  Now, my son is barely old enough to vote, but the war in Iraq is very relevant to him, and because of this, he continues to research all aspects of it.  I respect his viewpoints not because I agree with them, but because he has taken the initiative to look at all sides of the issue and draw reasonable conclusions.Perhaps Mr. Moore does not present an unbiased look at the issues he presents; very few filmmakers do, after all.  However, it isn't necessary to rip Moore's character to shreds in order for viewers to gather what I feel is the the message and essence of the movie: there are serious problems in the way the American people allow themselves to be treated by their leaders.  Rather than let Moore outrage us, I think it would be more productive to direct our outrage at the appropriate recipients."	4.0	Name one person who has no agenda.	2004-07-18	22	19	3
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3MKON3VM0W1TH	Alan Beggerow	Michael Moore is definitely a man with an agenda.  He has made no bones about his opinion of the Bush administration, so it stands to reason that this film would be biased against the current administration to a certain degree.  Not that having an agenda in and of itself is a bad thing.  We all have agendas.  But it is good to know what the persons agenda is beforehand.The Bush supporters will call this film a lie, the anti-Bush folks will call it the gospel.  So dependant on a persons opinion, so will go their opinion of this film.I can't say that I buy into the film completely, but if 50% of what it documents is true, even if only 25% is true, then this country is in very sad shape indeed. If Michael Moore has overstated his case against the Bush administration, that is no more deplorable than the overstating of the necessity for the Iraq war by the administration. We all need to hear both sides, even the rabidly pro and con to help make up our minds. No one side has a monopoly on the truth.That is why I gave this film 5 stars.  Not that I believe everything it has to say, but that we've heard the other side's viewpoint over and over.  It is a film that should be watched by all who are concerned about the road this country is traveling.  Watch it, and make up your own mind.	5.0	Even if just 25% of this documentary is true...	2004-09-08	12	0	12

I have been a fan of Michael Moore's for several years and have found his other films to be excellent (Roger & Me, Bowling for Culumbine). I found this film to go way beyond the boundries of a documentary. Being in the motion picture industry myself, it was fairly easy for me to see the subtle manipulations he used to get the audience to feel the way he wanted. I think it's very sad when someone uses their talent & influence for their own personal desires without any regard for the truth. I wish people would keep art & politics separate from each other.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3TLY1A7NGVCQM	"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP"""	"Except for The Passion of the Christ, this is the most important film of the year, and everyone who still harbors a modicum of respect for our present government should see it.That said, the movie had some problems. First, believe it or not, I think Michael Moore does not give Bush enough credit with respect to the first half of his presidency. More importantly, we should be careful in giving Michael Moore too much praise for anything, ever.Let's be honest: Bush did the right thing, sometimes.There are some things Bush has done for which we should praise him - things for which Moore seems to fault Bush, but which I'd like to see Bush do a lot more.For example, Moore faults Bush for spending a record amount of time in office on vacation on his ranch, during the first part of his term. How can that be a bad thing? Time spent on vacation is time not spent bombing the rest of the world, oppressing citizens at home, and growing government to a record size. I would go so far as to assert as an axiom that the more time a president spends playing, the better. (Warren Harding may be the model president in this and most other respects).Moore also wants us to be disturbed by the fact that Bush remained in a Florida classroom reading My Pet Goat for seven minutes after being told that America was ""under attack"" on September 11. Roger Ebert describes this as the ""most devastating"" thing in the whole film. But this piece of information has never disturbed me in the slightest. The only objectionable aspect is that he stayed there for only seven minutes. As with vacation, the more time he spends in an elementary school classroom with a blank look on his face, the less time he spends doing anything else. I'm happy about having seven more minutes of freedom than I otherwise might have had. I wish he were still down there.Moore also seems to fault the Transportation Security Administration for allowing you to take matches and lighters, but not your own breast milk, on board an airline flight. For this, he credits the influence of the tobacco companies, who want you to be able to smoke before and after you get on a plane. I don't know what basis he has for this assertion, but even if it's true, I'd say good for the tobacco companies. Now, allow cigarettes to be smoked on flights, as long as all of the passengers consent, and we might have something like freedom. Of course, Moore's main point is that the TSA is not about security at all, it's about the government befuddling and controlling Americans, with virtually no regard at all for genuine security risks.The movie could have bolstered its own credibility where it counts by eliminating some other extraneous criticisms. No matter how much I may dislike Bush, I will never get upset about him ""stealing"" the election. Every election is always stolen from anyone who did not cast a vote for the winner and therefore did not consent to whatever the winner might do to him. I'm not even upset about the Supreme Court deciding the election, because that means we're just nine voters away from abolishing democracy entirely.The worst thing about Fahrenheit 9/11.There are more serious reasons not to get too excited about Michael Moore.Keep in mind that this movie's success will give Moore more influence over the minds of the American people. When he wants to speak again, through another film, he will have the country's full attention.And when, perhaps thanks in part to this film, John Kerry is elected president, what will that film be about? A devastating critique of welfare statism? Of course not. In all likelihood, it will be something like an attack on the alleged evils of Wal-Mart. And given Moore's undeniable talent as a propagandist, to the mass-man who does not understand economics, that film will look every bit as credible and persuasive as Fahrenheit 9/11.Surely anyone would agree that it's ethically wrong to give someone money, when you know for certain that they are going to spend it on a weapon with which they will commit a murder. Is it any more conscionable to give Moore money and accolades when we know he's going to spend his enhanced credibility on advancing economic ignorance, and, if he is successful, increasing poverty and even death in countless unseen ways?Well, maybe. It is a great movie.Regardless, let's celebrate a movie that, as the noted political philosopher the Libertarian Jackass has observed, has the laudable goal of ""bring[ing] down a president."" Bringing down a president is fun, and we should revel in it, and do it more often.But at the same time, we must be circumspect. As good as this film may be, remember that Michael Moore is a man who doesn't want you to be free to buy the products you want, to hire whomever you want, or even to defend your own person, property, and family.When the tables inevitably turn on the neocon regime, he will once again be our worst enemy. We would be wise to continuously acknowledge that, and never fail to remind everyone of why he is so wrong about everything else."	5.0	Heres a great review.I didn't write it but it should be read	2004-06-29	25	0	25
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	"...and to paraphrase this comedian's live act ""'Fahrenheit 9/11' now there's a movie that has people up in arms. Michael Moore could be narrating ""On September 10th, George Bush took a sip of water"" (audience reaction) oh f**k""That is the feeling I got throughout this film as Moore narrated.  While I enjoy his films and the persona he shows in them, he may never make a film as bad as this one. He seems to be conspicuously absent on the screen for much of the time and that makes his narration feel intrusive, as if he's trying to distance himself from the material in any small way he can so he doesn't seem too mean spirited and instead give off an aura of truthfulness.  While some of the things he says in this film are eye opening to the casual observer a number of the conclusions that Moore comes to are rash and speculative (which I don't mind, since he does this all the time) which makes most of his films entertaining, if not insightful, but this film is missing a true humor about itself because it was intended for a specific political purpose (with effects expected) in mind. To me, art never works that way since people often see the art much later than the intended effects, such is the case with me. Apart from the controversy, this film just doesn't entertain, or inform us. Moore wants to call Bush a criminal, but never does (for libel reasons, no doubt) so he just implies it. That's the problem with this documentary, it seems to pull the most obvious of punches when that's the reason for its existence, to knock out the opposition.  When you repress the execution of the major point for any reason, the result is going to come out badly, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it just isn't very good, or lasting."	1.0	I believe Todd Barry summed it up best....	2008-02-20	16	6	10
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2RDWW5YN2AXCB	Alex	I am a fan of Mr Moore not so much for the content but for what happens after people watch his films. In a time when everyone is afraid to discuss issues and question authority his films are desperately needed.Even the most hardcore republican who follows all Bush dictates without question needs to watch this film (I'm a former fiscal conservative republican). If you support these wars you need to see what it is really like out there in Iraq for the soldiers. You also need to see the grief a mother goes through when her son is lost. These are not propaganda pieces but are real people and footage. If you still think preemptive war against a non-threat like Saddam was worth it then you cannot deny the price to be paid now and for some time in the future (can you say higher taxes and draft?).Watch the film. Ignore the part that makes Bush look like a fool if you can't take it (first half). Form your own opinion. Talk to a stranger about it.	4.0	Partisan?

Moore makes a lot of good points and draws attention to things that we all need to think about - everyone who lives in a democracy.The only criticism that I have of this film is the kooky song about the 'Coalition of the Willing'. It implies that there were only pathetically small non-US armies involved. With Britain and several smaller countries who do have army, navy and airforce, such as my own, Australia, I think you'll find that Bush did manage to drag together something resembling a coalition to share the blame.Otherwise it was a very moving film, even to someone who has heard most of the facts before. Seeing the families involved in the army speaking made me realise what it is sometimes easy to forget when you live outside of the US - most Americans aren't morons, some just seem to be being misled by all the Newspeak.	4.0	Moore is anti-Bush, not anti-American	2004-08-04	36	32	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2GV7NSHUW7NRG	"Alexis Brown ""Blonde Baby"""	"This documentary is excellent. All of the people who have been critiquing this film, are no doubt conservative, but are also immature, misinformed, and can only bury their heads in the sand, rather than accept the truth. I am sick of reading reviews where people say that he only shows one side of the story and that the documentary isn't true. Moore does a great job of having backed every single thing he says up with solid evidence. You cannot deny evidence. And all of the scenes it shows of Bush? Like one reviewer said, Moore didn't hire some guy to dress up as President Bush and act retarded. Moore didn't hire actors to play army recruiters and politicians. Everything in his film is 100% authentic. And how can he show the other side of the story? There is no logic argument against the facts that Moore portrays. Do people think he is making this stuff up? Again, everything said is backed by evidance. How could people not be sad by watching a woman make a trip to Washington DC after her son was killed in an unnecessary war, and then having the door slammed in her face? That should even make a conservative sad- and if it doesn't, than you are completely heartless and have absolutely no sympathy. I am sick of hearing right-winged idiots talk about how military personell and veterans ""know the truth and support our country and think Moore is a liar"" whenever there is an entire book ""Will They Ever Trust Us Again?""

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"I cannot think of another movie in modern times where your enjoyment depended so strongly on your political views. There was a movie made a while ago which starred Joan Allen called ""The Contender"" that Republicans bashed as being too liberal, but they didn't seem to take that film on as personally as they are this film, ""Fahrenheit 9\11"". And it really is this simple. If you are a Democrat there's a 90% chance you'll enjoy this film. If you are a Republican there's a 90% chance you'll hate this movie. I say 90% because nothing in life is 100% except as the old joke goes death and taxes.Most people should know by now what this film is about. We have all heard the controversy surrounding it for quite some time now. But not until Wednesday were audiences allowed to see the Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival.Michael Moore takes a look at the Bush Administration and accusses the Bush family of having ""ties"", and we've seen how confusing that word can be lately, with the bin Laden family and makes a point of saying there is much going on behind the American people's back concerning the war in Iraq, members of the Bush cabinet, and other issues such as homeland security.I admit I have been dying to see this movie. I couldn't wait. I'm a fan of Michael Moore and his politics, I feel it's important, at least when talking about a movie like this to be upfront as to what your political views are. Because some views will prevent many from having an open mind and enjoying this film. I am a liberal Democrat, and I'm 110% against the right-wing.I was extremely interested through-out the entire lenght of the film and was completely surprised to learn what I did. Some things the American public already know such as Dick Cheney's involvment with Halliburton, the prison-abuse scandal, and according to Richard Clarke, President Bush's preoccupation with Iraq before and after 9\11.Many member of the right-wing have already came out and advised people not to see this film. That say it is nothing but lies. But, if you see the movie, and this is what I like best about it, Moore never actually makes the claims. He uses the New York times, the L.A. times, interviews from Good Morning America, the Today Show, the 9\11 investigation hearings, and Larry King to support his claimes. He shows clips of these interviews where OTHER people make these accusations NOT Moore. I firmly believe 100% what I was shown. And don't kid yourselves, Moore is not the first to say these things.But, political ideas aside is ""Fahrenheit 9\11"" worth seeing? Yes. It is well-made, very, very funny and displays Moore's conviction to the subject. Some may say he makes it too personal, but because of that he can see Moore gets his facts straight. He devoted a lot of time to this exactly because it was personal, and he wanted to present the best case he could against Bush.Every American should see this film. Consider it the political ""Passion of the Christ"". Take the whole family to see this, we, the American people, need to know what's going on. Anyone who plans to vote this year I pled with you, go see this film. Not that it matters, because I think of this as more than just a movie, but, it's one of the best films I've seen all year. It stirred me up and is a great conversation piece to discuss with people.I haven't given much away because that wouldn't be fair. You need to see this and just be prepared to be shocked at what's going on behind our backs. This is a MASTERPIECE and I plan on seeing it again.Something else that needs to be pointed out is people will assume MY political beliefs cause me to be bias towards the film. Let me explain something. One of the things I feel makes a movie great is when it gives you something to think about. When it's thought provoking. Whether you like or hate this film, it's NOT one of those movies where after you leave you'll forget about it 5 minutes later. It has a strong lasting power. It makes you think and raises I feel very important questions that deserve answers. Also as I already stated, the movie is a conversation piece, it may cause a debate. This is what makes a movie great. How many films cause such intense feelings after seeing them? How many movies stay with us long after we have seen them? And how many will cause a debate? Not many. And the ones that do we often consider great movies. That is half of the reason why I recommend people see this film and why I call it a masterpiece.Bottom-line: As far as I'm concerned, an honest look at the Bush Administration showing us things many of us never would have dreamed possible. Liberals rejoice and vote Kerry in '04! It's time we take back the Presidency and Congress."	5.0	The Heat Is On	2004-06-25	12	7	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AFXTPJOE2D4M3	Algernon D'Ammassa	"As someone who happens to agree with much of Michael Moore's politics, I very much enjoyed Moore's humor throughout his latest, whether it's him reading the text of the Patriot Act through a loudspeaker outside Congress, or trying to persuade Congressmen to sign up their own sons for military service in Iraq; or simply enjoying the footage he has found of Paul Wolfowitz spitting on his comb, or Bush struggling to say, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.""As an honest movie viewer, however, I have to remark that this isn't a documentary so much as a two-hour anti-Bush infomercial.  There are no no revelations of fact, and the facts - despite NEWSWEEK's inaccurate criticisms in advance of the film's release - do check out.  What is more controversial are Moore's conclusions, as the film deliberately targets Republicans and the Bush Administration in particular.  Moore's ambition for this movie is to shock and outrage voters into voting Bush out of office, and the film has that feel: more recruitment than journalism.There are cheap shots.  The footage of President Bush looking stunned and glancing around a classroom when he has just been told of the 9/11 attacks is spun as negatively as possible.  The image is slowed down and while Bush stares into space, Moore is there in voice-over to tell us that Bush is reeling because he has no script and no handlers to tell him what to do.  Maaaaaybe, but in fairness, putting myself in that position, I might have a similar expression on my face simply for shock and grief.Moore is not only a great entertainer and a smart, smart commentator - his art as a propagandist is skillful, juxtaposing images to create an alternative narrative for the last four years.  Wisely, however, Moore can also step back and let the mother of a killed American soldier speak for herself as she grapples with the meaning of the Iraq occupation.Will the movie topple the Bush Administration?  Time will tell.  If not, it may accomplish something else almost as important to this viewer: reclaiming patriotism from the hawks.  Patriotism CAN look like George W.

I'm absolutely sure that the ""reviewers"" here are not criticing the film as art but as political propaganda.  It is rather obvious that those that say it is trash, have a political agenda and those who praise it to the sky have one too.There's no doubt that Moore despises the Bush administration, and he would say he has reason to do so.  Many of the visual representations in the film are biased and distorted.  There are, however, powerful images in the film.  Bush's 7 minutes, The Saudi-Bin Laden connection to the Bush family and the greed exemplified at the fundraiser.  There are also some slanted scenes, such as following a proud Flint housewife whose son goes into the military, and dies, and whose conversion to anti-Bush after the death is predictable.Personally I had no problems with Bush until Iraq.  I supported his Patriotic enthusiasm to destroy those that attacked us.  I was all for the Afghanistan invasion.  It was clear that that country had harbored and trained Al Queda and that Bin Laden was there.  Any undertones or connections with Bin Laden by Bush were not evident to me.  Then came Iraq - and the rush to war and my opinions of the Bush administration changed dramatically.So, like everyone else, I went to see 9/11 with pre-conceptions.As a film, I felt that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a bit long, sometimes predictable (based on Moore's bias) and even often overdone.I was shocked, to some extent, to see the heated discussions in Congress about the Florida voter count.  I was unaware of that.But, this film has lasting images which might aid in turning this election.  There are moments when visual evidence of our President's greed, indecision, and single-mindedness cannot be denied.I agree that the film is NOT a documentary, it IS propoganda.  But it does show clearly that Bush was determined to get rid of Saddam at all costs, and perhaps, just perhaps, OIL was at the root of invasion of Iraq.  If Moore is correct, what Bush has done will go down in history as a invasion of a sovereign state for no other reason than he personally hated Saddam, though a tyrant and a despot, who was incapable of injuring the USA.  This is something that no other President in the history of this country has ever done.However, if Moore is incorrect, then he has done a disservice to a President that has simply waged a war on terrorists who attacked us without provocation.When you think about it, based upon what we all know now, don't you have to say - NAH?"	4.0	It's a good film	2004-08-20	39	30	9

It did the unthinkable it showed information on the president that i thought myself would have completely exploited him at all costs. But i admire Micheal Moore for not just dilivering a greatly entertaining film but also showing us what we need to see and here. There are many people, who are against Micheal Moore and in some ways i have been and still am. But the irony is that people will make up there minds of this film before they even seeing it. I know because i did the same. But after seeing the film i know that Micheal Moore has made a movie that is not entirely untrue, though he takes some trueths and twists them in key areas so that they stay true in fact, but the people and media get the wrong idea. But the accually  gist of it is that about 90% of this film is accually facts and untwisted facts. The movie dos have some problems though sometimes the music will overshadow the over all sounds and fell of the events takeing place at the time in the movie and though you really want to pay attention to the film. You cant because this problem becomes too anoiying. Though i only found this to be a problem for about the first 20 minutes of the film.The movie is also verry violent in some seens and shows some verry raw and gritty images of the fight in ireaq, after seeing these seens of creul and violent nature (which also adds in some at times unnessessary language) there really is no reason to heed the film R rating like some of the media is trying to do. The conent alone should grant this and R rating. In the end Micheal Moore has made an acceptionally good movie, that will be the hype of conversations, leading up to the upcoming ellection.	4.0	Micheal Moores  VS.  George W.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1SKBYNV5GGGRF	Amanda Johnson	"Before voting on November 2nd, be sure to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  Maybe it won't change your mind, maybe it will.  At the worst, you might come away with a better idea about why at least half the population of this country and most of the rest of the world are praying to see the end of the most appalling presidency since Warren G. Harding, and possibly since the formation of the United States of America.The four years since the Bush administration took over in 2000 have truly put the previous eight years of the Clinton administration in perspective.  Back in the 90s I actually believed for a time that Clinton should be impeached for daring to question the definition of ""is"" before the House/Senate investigative committee.  Now it's time to admit that that was a mistake.  The Clinton administration gave us 8 years of never-before and never-again prosperity, and 8 years of relative peace. Clinton's misbehavior was child's play compared with Bush's Orwellian world of manipulation, spin, and double-speak that we live in now.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" documents this transition from the Clinton era to the Bush era, starting with the stolen election of 2000 and the complicit undermining of free speech by the U.S. media, and moving to the questionable relationship of the Bush family to the Saudi royals.  Of course, most heartbreaking are the stories of soldiers and their families who are most devastated by the decisions of the neocons.In just 4 years the U.S. economy has gone from a record surplus to record debt -- the highest in U.S. history.  And how many wars have we been in since 2000 -- I've lost count.  But based on the nightly news and the Republican spin machine, you'd never guess that anything was at all amiss.  ""Keep on shopping"", they say, and everything will turn out fine.Even though at one time I thought Clinton should be impeached, I'm now firmly convinced that Bush, Cheney, Rove, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Ashcroft, Condi Rice, and maybe Colin Powell should all go to jail.  Sure, other administrations have ruined the economy and driven us into war, but this one stole an entire election, exposed a CIA operative, and fabricated and lied about the reasons for going to war -- all treasonable offenses.  You can bet that if any Democrat had committed these crimes we'd be hearing about it 24/7 on Fox News.And if anyone thinks that things can't get any worse, just wait.  The only thing keeping this administration under any kind of restraint at all is the fear of not getting re-elected.  A second term will make the first look like a day at Disneyland...And speaking of Disney, don't forget to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11""!  You may not agree with everything that Michael Moore says, but the images are unforgettable. If you don't like listening to Mr. Moore, try watching with the sound turned off, the footage speaks for itself.  In those images you'll witness the catastrophic consequences of unchecked and misguided power wielded by a government that has only a very tenuous claim to legitimacy, in the first place.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1KSFAKXO7JTR4	Amazon Customer	I wouldn't complain so much about Michael Moore if 1) he wasn't so crummy to people who don't deserve it (I don't mind when he picks on the head of GM or Charlton Heston), and 2) if he didn't have the disturbing ability to insert himself into touching private moments that don't need Michael Moore's presence.Happily, both of these tendencies are mostly absent from Fahrenheit 9/11. Republicans and Democrats take it on the chin, but the &quot;average Americans&quot; are offered up without condescension, a rarity in the past for Moore. (He does get a few cheap shots at small countries like Costa Rica and Iceland, though.)As for my second point above, it might be useful to compare two scenes. In Bowling for Columbine, we get a scene where Moore comforts a woman on camera. The woman needs comforting; Moore is there; he comforts her. But there's something smarmy about the event ... it's not clear why we have to see Moore with his arm around the woman, except to point out that Michael Moore cares. In Fahrenheit 9/11, however, there are several emotional scenes, particularly those with the woman whose son was killed in Iraq. Moore remains mostly off-camera for those scenes ... he lets us see the woman's grief, it's powerful and important to what Moore is trying to say, but he leaves it be, he doesn't insert himself for no reason.As usual, Spinsanity takes on Moore's cavalier attitude towards facts, and there's plenty to kvetch about, but even here, Moore is improving. As Spinsanity notes, the film &quot;appears to be free of the silly and obvious errors that have plagued Moore's past work.&quot; They do go on to note that the movie &quot;is filled with a series of deceptive half-truths and carefully phrased insinuations that Moore does not adequately back up,&quot; but to be honest, that doesn't bother me much ... I have no objection to Moore the rabblerouser, editing his footage for maximum impact, I just don't like it when he lies. And there would appear to be very few lies in Fahrenheit 9/11.I'd have to say there's some irony in the fact that Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moore's most successful film at the box office, and also the least &quot;entertaining.&quot; Perhaps Moore should have been trusting his audience all along to get his arguments, without the cheap stuff.	4.0	Moore's best film is his least entertaining	2004-07-29	18	13	5

I have heard many people saying that this is a horrible movie. The majority of them have not seen it. Do yourself a favor and go see it before you talk about it. It you still think it's bad, well that's an informed opinion and one I can respect. The thing which impressed me about Fahrenheit 9/11 is that Michael Moore is very clear that while he does not in any way support the Bush presidency or the administration war machine, he also has tremendous respect for the young men and women who have chosen the military as a way of serving our country. I have rarely seen this expressed so effectively. As an african-american woman, the most heart breaking moments for me were the senate hearing regarding the election of GWB when the voices of many african americans were heard protesting the election results and each time Al Gore asked if they had the signature of one U.S. Senator.  Not a single senator out of 100 could be found to support the resolutions. Why did we not know that these hearings were happening? Where was the U.S. Senate when people were clearly asking for help?

Bush's thoughts as Bush is informed of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. Moore suggests that Bush was thinking only of Saudi oil investments. None of us knew what was going in those early minutes of the terror strike on the Trade Center, as the unthinkable took place. Anyone who has taken an introductory course in Logic learns of the fallacies of making logical assumptions based on innuendo. I was just revolted by Moore's completely immoral, hate-filled screed of a 'film'. Moore also insulted the intelligence of the American people by assuming that they would believe his innuendo-filled comments. And this is where he went wrong: the American people were/are not as stupid as Moore believes them to be, and many people were insulted by Moore's arrogant attitude and assumptions, as he spoke down to them as if they could not think for themselves. And in their disgust at Moore's condescension, and ad hominem portrayal of a man who, whether you liked his policies or not, just happened to have the job of president of the United States at the time of the horrific terror attack, many viewers of this movie quite likely voted FOR George W. Bush, not against him. I truly believe that this shoddy film actually caused more people to vote FOR George W. Bush in November 2004, than against him. Moore's arrogance and carelessness boomeranged on him. If Moore had not made this movie, perhaps G. W. Bush would not have been reelected.I had somewhat enjoyed Moore's simplistic earlier effort, 'Bowling For Columbine', and was expecting much better than this trashy attempt at money-making through slander-based controversy. I should have known better; Moore is an entertainer, and not an insightful political analyst by any stretch of the imagination. Thank God that many Americans (including left-leaning ones like me) have something called education and/or common sense and can recognize lies and deception like the kind Moore attempts to foist off on the public.An interesting related read is 'The Trouble with Islam. A Wake-Up Call For Honesty and Change' by Canadian Muslim lesbian author Irshad Manji, who also dismisses Michael Moore.That Moore's trash won the 'prestigious' Palme D'Or film award in France is only because of the ever-present and fashionable anti-Americanism prevalent in French 'intellectual' circles, and yet another symptom of the cultural malaise that France has experienced in recent years, and about which much has been written.Note also political commentator Andrew Sullivan's creation of the 'Moore Award', for ""divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric""."	1.0	the film that got George W.

It is incredible the lengths this administration has gone to in an attempt to justify it's manipulation of America and the rest of the world. The ""Right"" (which has grown to be synonymous with Christian fundamentalists, thanks to their complete annihilation of the boundary between church and state) wanted to hang Clinton for such things as having tried marijuana or having an affair (which happened to be a personal matter, completely unrelated to his job performance), yet Bush had a long and well-known addiction to Cocaine, womanizing, alcoholism, etc. Such behavior makes Clinton's antics look like a tea party by comparison. But that same party feels that Bushs' indiscretions are acceptable now that their man is up. Often characteristic of the Christian Right hypocrisy.In addition, we have terrorists that have entered, and will continue to enter our country to seek revenge on our soil as long as we continue to unfairly bully, discredit and ignore their and others concerns, especially in regards to how such groups/countries are treated by the USA. So the longer we drone on with this ""war on terrorism,"" the more people we anger in the world. If not due to our direct attacks on them/their country, certainly our negligence of their plight or our complete disregard for their concerns about our actions (or lack of, in some cases) will undoubtedly leave a wound sufficient to fuel some long term hostility. If we haven't angered enough people directly in the war, we've angered them indirectly with our arrogant, self-righteous, entitlement perpetrated by this administration to justify our mistreatment or abandonment of people/countries harboring both our allies and enemies.With all of the anger and disdain the Bush administration has single-handedly warranted towards our country, the potential for us to be targeted for terrorism has risen exponentially. Since we live in a free country, it is extremely difficult to prevent those that seek to harm us from entering our country, this has been modeled numorously. The degredation of our global citizenship, the greater the desire to harm us. Bush has not fought a war on terrorism; he has positively ensured the future of disastrous and destructive terrorism, both domestically and internationally. This will be targeted towards both us and our allies, worst of all far too many innocent people.The Administration has no regard for those men and women and their families that are so selflessly offering themselves up to execute his evil agenda. After all, it's not his family over there on the front lines. His behavior has been worthy of impeachment more than all who came before him. From his slow, basically non-existent response to Katrina and his dumbfounded stall to the news that our Country was under attack to his insistence on chasing down and threatening anyone that doesn't agree with him. Particularly if we are going to take into account his alcoholism, cocaine addiction and womanizing among other things. He actually infiltrated a group of 10 anti-war protestors in one small town. Do we not have bigger fish to fry as a nation, than him using his time, energy and our money to track down every group or individual who disagrees with him. Or rally congress to ensure that two people that love each other can NEVER (via constitutional amendment) be allowed to marry? Is this truly the best use of the leader of the free world's efforts? When you go over the short list of top priority concerns for this great Nation and beyond, gay marriage is right up on the top. Gee, I can think of about a thousand things I'd be so much more concerned about, like our rates of homelessness, abused and neglected children, the many millions that go to sleep each night hungry in this world, illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, uninsured populations, crime and gang ridden cities, FOREIGN RELATIONS, the economy, our budget deficit, our Social Security System, to name a few.Not to mention his endless insistence that otherwise discarded stem-cells cannot be used to save millions of lives because they are a form of life and therefore should be held sacred as one would treat any other human life. Human life sacred!! What about the human lives he is over desecrating daily in Iraq, on both sides? Oh, so human life is only sacred if it's human stem-cells on American soil? Who cares about any other form of human life or how many will lose their lives because of his not supporting stem-cell research. Those lives are not important. So apparently human life is only important in certain situations and applies to only certain humans. Like if you're Iraqi, your life is not sacred and therefore we will kill you. Thousands of Iraqi civilians have died or been cruelly and inappropriately detained as a result of our ""war on terrorism."" But save those stem-cells, by god they fall under the sanctity of human life. What so many of his followers don't understand is that as busy as he is off bullying other Countries, he is simultaneously at home, quietly and not-so-quietly sticking it to the American public as well. So thank you, Michael Moore. Though because your documentary was created a few years ago, you had no way of knowing all of the follow-up material that would be available for a sequel by this day and age, and imagine the possibilities we still have 2 years to go. Wake up America! When are we going to put the skids on this out-of-control drunken frat boy, whom so eloquently demonstrates the old adage ""it's not what you know, but who you know.""

Moore himself, appears only once in front of the camera.  This in sharp contrast to his previous films where he stood front and center.  This film raises questions about arguably the most testing time since the fall of communism.The most profound moments was seeing a mother who had lost her son in Iraq and watching her struggle with the pain that no parent should ever have to go through, the death a child.  Also important was the way that Moore shows us a different and new side of this national tragedy.  He lets us hear the audio from that tragic day alone, which was the most stunning depiction that I have ever been exposed to (after being shown the video hundreds of times I realized that I had become numb to the horror).Agree or disagree with Moore, this film aids the morning and the spiritual redress of this wound.

If you agree or not with the item being reviewed, it's your choice. Everyone has the freedom to have a point of view about this subject.However there are lots of reviewers bashing Michael Moore's movie with phrases full of prejudice and anger like ""he's gay"", ""fat"", ugly"", ""morbidly obese"" and saying he's ""brainwashing the youth's minds"". Is this the land of free or the land of the prejudice? I'm sorry to say that but I'm disgusted by your oppinions to say someone is brainwashing my weak mind. But guess what, you don't know me. Wow, just because many people enjoyed this movie and are starting to think about politics and how they affect the world (hmm did you guys forget that you're not alone in this world?), they are wrong and you are right. And this was only from the few posts I've read. Even ""third reich"" was quoted. Unbelievable!Heck, there's even a guy who says, after writing a somewhat long post that he didn't watch it. So what does it show? I bet many haven't watched it either. So what if Michael Moore is popular? It doesn't mean he has to be a nice guy.What about ""anti-American propagandha""? Man, this sucks, huh? But what about the pro-american propagandha in most Hollywood's war movies? Or teenagers movie, showing the whole world how to dress, how to behave, how to wear? So what if this is an anti-American movie (although I doubt it is)? American propagandha is everywhere. So before you talk about such relevant matters here:1) Watch the movie2) Think about the WHOLE WORLD IMPACT and not only about your internal politics. There's something wrong with this picture.3) By using prejudice every phrase just proves you're mediocre and Michael Moore maybe should do a movie about you and people like you.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1ZOF747O5EB6R	Andrew Desmond	"There is little doubt about Mike Moore's ability to arouse passions.  He achieved this end with ""Bowling for Columbine"" and his recent publications.  He has managed to keep the flames burning with ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  In so doing, he has earned the ire of America's right.Moore has a wonderful discursive style of documentary making where seemingly complex issues are reduced to their basic building blocks.  Other documentary makers could do worse than emulate Moore's style.  However, there are undoubtedly occasions when he oversteps the mark.  For example, he gives the impression that America's Oregon coast is guarded by one state trooper.  This is clearly absurd but an impression is, nonetheless, passed off as fact.  Moore should take care with all his facts.It is now widely understood that there is no real connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime in Iraq.  George Bush and his supporters will, in due course, face the wrath of the electorate.  Moore simply points out facts that some choose to ignore.  This is democracy working in spite of the efforts of Messrs Bush, Blair and co.It is not clear how the mess in Iraq will be resolved.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is a mess made worse by the West.  Moore shows that the emperor has no clothes."	5.0	Fighting his Father's War	2004-08-19	29	23	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ	Andrew Parodi	"Though I usually agree with Michael Moore's views, occasionally I am a bit put off by his approach. His books and documentaries concern very heavy, important topics such as corporate crime, racism, teenage violence, and murder. I think that his mix of humor with such profound topics can occasionally be out-of-place. For example, I am not terribly comfortable with the poster for Fahrenheit 9/11 depicting Mr. Moore grinning as though he's done something naughty but cute, or the image of him hand-in-hand with George W. Bush. It seems to kind of trivialize a very serious situation that has cost the lives of thousands of people. So, though I know that Michael Moore, like myself, is opposed to the Iraq war, I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a bit of hesitancy. This war is no laughing matter.Much to my surprise, Fahrenheit 9/11 is tasteful in just about every respect. Mr. Moore does occasionally go for the laugh, such as when asking members of congress to enlist their children in the military, or when recounting Mr. Bush's famous Bushisms, e.g., ""The question has to be asked: Is our children learning?"" But when it comes to depiction of the profound tragedies of this war, the civilian deaths and injuries in Iraq, the loss of US military, the traumatic injuries sustained by some troops (including graphic images of limbless young soldiers), the impact on the families of the military, the shredding of civil liberties via the Patriot Act, or the fear instilled in the US population by the Bush administration's constant and ridiculous ""terror alters,"" no attempt at humor is found. In fact, such scenes are largely devoid of Michael Moore's voice. No narration is needed.Lila Lipscomb is, in my opinion, the heart of the documentary. She is a mother and career guidance counselor in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan. Several of her children have served in the military, and one of her sons was deployed to Iraq. As Moore points out, recruitment is common in Flint and all poverty-stricken areas. Those at the bottom of the economic system are usually the same people sent to protect it. And Mrs. Lipscomb, a proud American who displays her flag every morning, never letting it touch the ground, is a great champion of the military. She encourages young men and women to enlist and serve their country. It's a great way to get out of poverty, to see the world, to help out.When asked for her views on anti-war protestors, Mrs. Lipscomb says it felt like a slap in the face.It was an important epiphany for her to realize that the protestors were not vilifying the troops or hoping for their defeat, but were opposed to the basis of the war. The troops, of course, had nothing to do with establishing that basis. This was a very important piece of the movie for me because I have often been the polar opposite of Mrs. Lipscomb. Over the last year when I have heard people say they support the war, what I translated that to mean is, ""I believe innocent Iraqi children should be murdered."" Mrs. Lipscomb's testimonials helped me understand that the war does not mean that to those who support it. She, as well as all other military families, are justifiably concerned for the safety of their loved ones, and it is inconceivable to such people that the US government would be reckless with the lives of their loved ones. For them, supporting the troops means not bringing into question the validity of the reasons we've been given for the invasion. Sadly, devastatingly (the second time I sobbed during the documentary, my head buried in my hands), by the end of the documentary Mrs. Lipscomb has changed her mind.I am deeply thankful to Michael Moore for having the courage to bring to the mainstream forum what the corporate media has had the power to shut out for so long. If the horrors of war were always so honestly depicted in the mainstream media then we would not rush into war so easily. And while Fahrenheit 9/11 will inevitably be labeled as biased and one-sided, facts are not partisan. It is a fact that thousands died on Sept. 11th, 2001. It is a fact that the Bush administration has not yet caught Osama bin Laden. It is a fact that an estimated 10,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the US bombardment of Iraq. It is a fact that over 800 US soldiers have died and several thousands have been permanently injured. It is a fact that Mrs. Lipscomb's son was killed in Iraq. And it is a fact that I may lose my own nephew. He recently enlisted. Time in Iraq is not inconceivable, as his cousin only recently returned from Iraq."	5.0	Michael Moore's respectful investigation of the Iraq War	2004-08-27	13	11	2
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2W9N2FDRUMJG5	Andrew Ranazzi	"First, I loved Roger and Me and its sequel.  Second, I think Michael Moore's politics has clouded his art.  With that said I think he has taken untold and incalculable risks in making this film for which he deserves a certain amount of credit.  However, if he wanted to further polarize an already divided electorate he has done just that.The film plays fast and loose with the facts (Bin Ladens NOT being vetted by the FBI, being flown out of the country during the no fly days just after 9/11, lack of intelligence regarding Sadaam's WMD's, Florida voting intimidation, Mischaracterizing recounts in Florida of 2000...ad infinitum...ALL UNTRUE).  Michael Moore does not let the facts get in the way of a good story.  It is fiction from start to finish.  That doesn't mean it still wouldn't have been entertaining...it still could have been.However, if there is one seminal piece of footage that sums up this film it is the 9/11 event itself.  This film goes in to absolute ""Al"" gore (pun intended) detail showing us the carnage of Iraqi civilian casualties and American GI injuries.  However, when it came to showing 9/11 footage the screen goes entirely blank with just some sound effects of plane crashing into the tower and the screams of some onlookers.  Moore's stated reason for this is clear...audience attention.  However, his unstated motivation is equally clear...the visual images of the 9/11 attacks, victims and carnage would not convey the message he needed.  In fact, it might invoke sympathy for those prosecuting the war on terror.  This was the most intellectually dishonest move in filmmaking, fact or fiction, history.By now I'm sure you understand I'm no Michael Moore fan.  However, I like art.

Where 'Bowling' leaves you feeling winded, I found the payoff here somewhat downbeat, almost an afterthought - I was expecting standing ovations, but then they don't happen too much here in Tokyo. . .Moore doesn't feature so heavily in the film, as in his previous efforts, and it is perhaps better for it. At the very least, it is intriguing to see theories once put forward by marginal characters like Alex Jones, given centre stage here, in such a major film.OK, it's not particularly subtle, and meandering in places, but it is riveting throughout.

I can almost see why other countries don't allow bashing of their leaders.  this was the most ridiculous, one-sided load of garbage I had ever seen in my life. if he doesn't like bush that much, he can get out of the country.  Bush is human and honest and did what he could under the circumstances. If he thinks he could've done better, he can run for president, instead of mocking others.  he makes me sick.In response to the famous scene of bush reading to little kids after hearing that the first plane attacked, keep in mind, that at the time, we didn't know what the first plane was.  at first, the news thought it could've been an accident, and was only later thought to be possibly, and possibly paranoid to think it, a terrorist attack.  my first thought was that in speculation that the first plane, (assuming all his opinionated facts are straight), could've been a drunk pilot, the second plane was the confirmation of attack, when bush was already in the classroom.  What could've been done about that?  Shoot down all the planes in the sky?  Which ones are full of terrorists? and there are innocent citizens onboard.Moore admits to having a grudge against Bush as well. So this is really just him getting payback for Bush telling him to get a real job?  Probably.Whether Moore's facts really are true or false or manipulated to fit his own opinion, the point is that Bush did all he could afterwards and was even mocked for htat.  now, we're as naive as we were before the attack.  we're like, gawd, chill out bush, youre so paranoid. its not like it'll ever happen again or anything.  if we're like that now, even after such an unexpected attack, then imagine how carefree we were before it.  no wonder we didn't know what to do. Bush is trying hard to protect the country, to keep the same mistakes from happening again, and people make fun of him for it.Moore needs to think, rather than judge.  when he's president and does a better job, i'll bite my tongue.  till then, he's a golddigger, and if this movie really is just his message to the world, and if he's so high and mighty as to assume he can make a movie about other people's faults and mistakes, then he should donate every penny he earned to charity instead of being such a hypocrite.	1.0	pathetic	2006-03-20	32	13	19

First off, I want to point out to the reviewer that talked about Michael Moore eating McDonald's three meals a day, you're getting your movies mixed up. What you're thinking of is Super Size Me (and Michael Moore didn't even direct that movie). But that also makes me wonder if that person even saw this movie. But this goes out to some of the 5-star reviewers, too; a lot of the reviewers say that this movie looks like it's going to be good. Come on, people; can't we SEE the movie first and THEN review it?Anyway, Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very interesting movie. Michael Moore's dismay against President Bush is still evident here, and basically he talks about the events leading up to, and resulting from, Bush's inauguration and the World Trade Center attacks, as well as the unnecessary war with Iraq. And whether or not you agree with Michael's statements is relative, but at least he backs up his claims. Throughout the movie you'll find video clips and files of goings-on; also, you'll see what Bush was doing during these tough times and what he SHOULD'VE been doing (at least, according to Michael).I knocked off half a star because in the last half-hour of the movie, things started to drag.

I was very surprised by the emotional force of the movie.  I read and heard professional and non-professional reviews and comments before seeing this movie.  I expected to see things that were dramatic, but with questionable interpretations.  I'm still waiting.Michael Moore does provide his commentary on the events and issues of Iraq and terrorism, but he presented facts, not fiction.  Fact:  Bush sat in the kindergarten chair for several minutes after being told that the country was under attack and did NOTHING.  Fact:  the Bin Laden family was whisked away with U.S. approval without proper questioning, while middle age citizens and groups are being infiltrated by government spies, or they are questioned by the FBI.  Fact:  the Patriot Act was rushed through Congress without it being read.  These and many more scenes are facts.  The administration gives alternative explanations for why all these things occurred, but they can't refute the facts.  By the way, why did it take this movie to give us the truth about Bush's sitting in the classroom for so long, then later have his people talk about how immediately he went into action?  Any of those kindergartners could have told him to get up and move.To me, the most powerful scenes involve the pro-war lady from Michigan, who then loses her oldest son in Iraq.  Her pro-war comments were presented without interference from Moore, who interviewed her.  The camera then shows her reaction after she learned of her son's death and as she reads his last letter that his hostile to the war.  More disturbing is the scene of this poor lady as a woman in Washington tells her that her account of her son's death is fiction.  Only the coldest hearted of ""compassionate"" Republicans could fail to be moved by that scene and many others.  I too have a son in the military.

Some may say this is leftist propaganda and that Michael Moore ""hates America"", but they couldn't be farther from the truth. Michael Moore isn't a democrat or a republican and he works to expose the wrongdoings of BOTH parties (he certainly didn't exclude President Clinton).Michael Moore loves this country and it clearly shows in all his work. From his first documentary, ""Roger and Me"", that tells the story of GM closing their plant in Flint, Michigan to open factories abroad to ""Bowling for Columbine"", a documentary that explores the culture of fear and violence in our country; He is a purveyor of truth and an advocate for change.Fahrenheit 9/11 is no different. Moore doesn't just spew out liberal opinions on the Bush administration and Iraq, he shows you footage and documents that the rest of the news conveniently leave out. A great example of this is the footage of George W. Bush's induction day. Moore shows the huge protests that went on that day in DC - like no other presidential induction ceremony in history.  The media didn't inform us of this. And there are many other examples. The ties between the Bush family and the Saudi Arabians also come as quite a shocker. The footage is there for you to see.Whether you are democrat, republican, green, or independent - see this movie. Don't let the ""faux"" news channel or a partisan reviewer form your opinions.

Granted, Moore does occasionally go overboard, particularly with his assertions concerning 2000. Nevertheless, Moore hits home on a number of facts and does not mince any words (or images for that matter). He shows the aftermath of the bombing raids on Baghdad and displays the discontent felt by more than a few of our troops in Iraq. In addition to the serious and occasionally disturbing, Moore also injects a bit of humor, particularly with his statement about Bush spending so much time on vacation; his interviews with House members (especially Porter Goss, our new CIA chief); his quest to inform Congress about the Patriot Act via an ice cream truck; and humorous looks at John Ashcroft, Paul wolfowitz (so that's why he's so slick), and of course Dubya himself. Some people may criticize Moore for depicting Bush as in idiot, they forget that Dubya provides most of the ammunition. In total, this is probably the most provocative and important film of the year, but don't take my word for it. See it for yourself.	5.0	See this movie!!	2004-09-28	29	24	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3UQB6WDKPICVN	A reader	This movie is a great movie in the sense of it exposes most of the facts that the public was not told about how America was duped into the Iraq war. Most of the 1-star reviewers here have been fed ignorance by Fox News and other right wing media, including what the President says. It is truly amazing that we our losing our children for an unknown cause. Saddam was not going to personally hijack an airplane or do something to attack us, so without WMDs he was no threat. It is also amazing how he lied to our country, saying the tax cuts &quot;by far&quot; go to the bottom when the bottom 50% only got 14.7% of that tax cut. He has cut hospital funding for our heroes that fought in WW2, Vietnam and other wars. He has also cut funding to our schools in his &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; act. Imagine if you were one of the children or veterans or living in poverty. The children who can't go to an after school program to stay off the street or get new textbooks to teach them the current information. Or a veteran who can't get full healthcare, even though that person voluntarily risked their life for our freedom. Or, you are a person who is trying to make ends meet for their family, and couldn't get a larger tax break to set them free. Or the deficit, growing larger by the minute. I guess my final message is go and see this film, Democrat or Republican, Liberal or Conservative, White or Black, to unite forever to create the final American dream: Peace, Prosperity, Freedom, Justice, and a right to live a life where no one is in poverty and everyone is happy to live in America to set a role model for the world.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2ICKSJ6T7WIBO	Arthur Digbee	"A lot of other Amazon reviewers complain that the film is biased and doesn't show both sides of the issues.  It's true that it's biased, but so is any documentary.  ""March of the Penguins"" pretends that penguins are motivated by love, and that they share other character traits such as courage, determination, and faith.  That's an anthropomorphism, a controversial position in biology, and ""March of the Penguins"" never shows the other side.  That's OK there, and it's OK for Michael Moore not to show the other side either.To say something nice first: the movie is moderately funny.  Moore accomplishes his humor mostly through juxtapositions.  When he switches from one line of narrative to another, or juxtaposes images, it normally hits you fast and is usually funny.  He also likes to juxtapose music and narrative (such as ""We gotta get out of here"" when talking about the Saudis who fled the US after 9/11).  I didn't think those were very funny because the humor lasts only a second (the line ""We gotta get out of here"" in this example) but his clip from the song lasts significantly longer.  As a result, I found myself thinking, ""enough already,"" for most of the song humor.He also has some amusing but blatantly unfair sections.  For example, he shows a long line of Republicans getting makeup for the cameras.  This makes them look phony.  But, obviously Democrats also get made up for the cameras, and presumably they would look phony too.  So, it's a cheap shot.There are lots of cheap shots in this movie.  Moore has every right to take his cheap shots, but they are, well, cheap.Moore's central ""argument"" is that Bush is a doofus who likes to go on vacation, and whose family and friends make a lot of money from oil, connections with Saudi Arabia, and the defense industry.  OK, there are some grains of truth in that.  However, those facts do not demonstrate *causality* of anything.  Did Bush decide to attack Iraq so that his family could make a lot of money from defense spending and increases in the price of oil?  The movie doesn't even begin to *prove* that.  Moore prefers to *imply* or *insinuate* so that he can't be caught out as telling outright falsehooods.Moore worked much harder on his evidence in this movie, and he sources his evidence on his website.  As a result, he has moved beyond making ""mistakes"" (as in ""Bowling for Columbine"") to misusing evidence.  For example, his data on Saudi investment is either sloppy or misleading (take your pick).  Someone tells him the amount of Saudi investment in the US, and then Moore asks what that is as a ratio of GNP.  Well, that's a misleading measure.  Investment generates income, and GNP is income.  It's like asking your sister the size of her savings account (investment) and then comparing that to the *interest* that you earn on your savings account (income).  It's just the wrong comparison.  The answer to this for Saudi investment, by the way, is ""5-7% of GNP,"" which Moore then refers to as ""7%,"" which is gratuitously sloppy.  Moore needs to learn that such use of evidence does not help persuade us of his point of view.So, Moore isn't an economist or a lawyer.  He's a filmmaker, and here the movie often succeeds.  First, he's unearthed some great film clips.  Here are my favorites: (1) he shows us Al Gore gaveling House members out of order in the joint session of Congress when these members tried to object to Bush's electoral victory; (2) he shows us Bush in the classroom reading ""My Pet Goat"" while the planes hit the Twin Towers; and (3) he found film of Army officers telling business meetings how much money there is to be made in Iraq.  It's a shame that mainstream media do not show us such pictures (although the ""Daily Show"" does).The clips, like the movie, are subjected to Moore's voiceover, which I find annoying.  It sounds as if he's trying too hard (a) not to sound like an angry liberal but a reasonable man; and (b) to speak English at an eighth-grade level so that even a doofus can understand him.  It detracted from the film.In short, the movie is full of circumstantial evidence of various Bush misdeeds.  Where there is smoke, there is doubtless some fire, but Moore implies that there is fire everywhere.  He makes some interesting points but is too blatantly partisan and too unconcerned with proper argumentation to be effective.  Because it became an ""event"" film that everyone talked about, everyone should see it and make up their own mind.  As for me: if it were an undergraduate essay, he would probably earn a B."	3.0	"""Must see"" cultural monument but flawed"	2005-08-23	8	4	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2SZYBCM5ZW4IU	Arwen	I saw this film in the theater and I plan to buy a copy to loan out as well as show in my home.  Mike Moore stands up for the Americans who seem to matter the least to our government.  The young soldiers, recruited from low income neighborhoods and malls.  They are now dying at an average of 3 a day in Iraq. This movie tells you why.  The fact behind every comment made can be found at [...]  I have heard a great deal of criticism of this film and the facts, yet the remarks are unspecific when it comes to  the content of the film because they are being made by people who have NEVER seen the film.  Like John McCain.  Nothing makes a person look dumber than to make a critical remark about a film, book, etc without first-hand knowledge.  I have yet to hear any of the critics of this film explain why there are only 8 state troopers in Oregon?  Why is the FBI wasting its manpower and resources on peace groups composed of cookie-eating Americans?  Or an elderly man, who should have the right to his opinion?  Why didn't the Congress take time to read the Patriot Act?  Why wasn't the Bin Laden family detained for questioning about his whereabouts?  Why did Powell and Rice both assure Americans in early 2001 that Saddam wasn't a threat and had no capability for building wmd only to flip-flop after 9/11?  Why were only 11 thousand troops sent after Osama and the Taliban?  Why were they allowed to escape? Why is George I portrait hanging in a Saudi palace?  Why was George I and Bin Laden's brother-in-law in a business meeting together on 9/11?  Where is our unbiased, un-corporate owned media?  You will not come away from this film untouched.  The first half is hilarious at times while the last half is heart-wrenching.  Every American should see this film and start asking questions of our elected officials.

La Cosa Nostra (the Mafia) understood this simple principle and so do those who ride with George W. Bush. It is not until one views the documentary Loose Change 911 that it becomes evident that Moore is a paid-off policeman who has agreed to look the other way. The release of his Fahrenheit 911 in 1993 was suspicious froim the start. How was a film, purported to be so anti-Bush, obtaining such a wide release through the Hollywood establishment who, for obvious reasons, are overwhelmingly supportive of the Iraq war. Additionally, they have spent so much effort demonizing Arabs and Muslims that Bush's actions are in perfect harmony with all they have represented for years. Again, it is not until one views Loose Change 911 that it all begins to make sense.This is your key: Despite the apparent disdain that Moore holds for George W. Bush, in the end of his movie HE REACHES THE VERY SAME CONCLUSION AS BUSH--that Arab Muslims did the crime and that Muslims are our enemy! In fact, Moore says that because of Bush's business connection to the Saudis we are protecting the most dangerous Muslims in that country. So, in the end, Moore stands right next to Bush pointing the finger of blame at Arabs and Muslims as the terrorist enemy.

I watch Moore's films strictly for entertainment value, they are different than other films, like, say, ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" or ""The Mighty Ducks,"" these are real films with real people.  I don't worry too much about the political issues involved, because of course, there are two sides to every story, so I wouldn't want to make any judgments until I have listened to Mr. Moores opposition, which I do intend to do by viewing some of the anti-Moore material out there (Michael Moore Hates America etc.).Anyway, I really enjoyed Bowling for Columbine b/c it had a lot of interviews with kids that were about my age at the time, and it was interesting hearing from those whose lives were affecting by the Columbine tragedy.  Therefore, I was intrigued to see ""more from Moore"" in hopes that Fahrenheit would be just as interesting and entertaining as Bowling for.  I was kind of disappointed.  It was a lot about politicians and foreign policy that I didn't really know about or care to try and understand without hearing both sides of the stories.  One segment where American soldiers in Iraq were interviewed was very interesting, but frankly I couldn't care less who Bush had over for dinner one night.So I guess what I am trying to tell you, the reader of this review, is not to order this movie thinking, ""I loooooved Bowling for Columbine, I can't wait to get more (similar) stuff!""

Believe it or not folks, but a documentary does not just show reality, it also interprets it. The point of a documentary is for those who see it to start making their own judgments. If you don't agree with Michael Moore's interpretation of the why's of the Iraq war, what is the right interpretation? Can you use the facts or find more facts to come up with a different interpretation? I would call that highly unlikely, but I would like to see the interpretation. This documentary set out to answer the question ""Why is the US in Iraq?"" I can tell you I have asked that question a lot and I found no good reason. Michael Moore has done the same thing, just to a larger audience. While you might disagree with his assessment that it was strictly for money, it is hard to support a different view after seeing this movie. You would be hard pressed to find any evidence linking Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Why? Because it doesn't exist. No matter how much Bush railed for a link, even he had to admit it wasn't there.How can you refute the 7 minutes of inactivity of Mr. Bush in the Florida classroom on 9/11? How can you refute the fact that planes were loaded up with Bin Laden relatives on 9/13? How can you call the ""coalition of the willing"" a coalition if it includes countries that send no troops? These are the facts folks. Michael Moore interpreted them to slam the Bush administration."	4.0	Must See	2004-10-09	0	0	0
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1S9X798GN0AVX	Avid Reader	I viewed Fahrenheit 9/11 just to see what all the fuss is about.  I went to the theater with an open mind, but left the theater with a thorough disgust for Michael Moore's blatant disregard for journalistic integrity.  I went to the theater to see a movie made by a professional, but instead saw a movie made by an amateur.  Take a few truths and make them lies, take a few lies and make them truths, and apparently, you have a Michael Moore film.  Seriously, if you decide to watch this movie, I ardently recommend that you also read the bi-partisan 9/11 Commission Report (ISBN 0393326713.)  Let's face it, Mr. Moore, George Bush isn't responsible for 9/11 -- al-Qaeda is.  Perhaps you've heard of Osama bin Laden?  Additionally, Mr. Moore, the 9/11 Commission Report is just as critical of Bill Clinton as it is of George Bush.  Why didn't you give Clinton the same level of vitriol as you did Bush in your movie?  Mr. Moore, you make the First Amendment sound like a bad idea.	1.0	Irresponsible Journalism -- We Need Less of Moore	2004-09-10	80	26	54

For the first time in many years we finally hear the voice of opposition out loud! He is doing much more here than just ""bashing"" the ""bad"" Republican President Bush as many see it.

What truly amazing courage! Especially now, during the ""Patriot act"" times.From the artistic point of view this documentary is also brilliant and is one of the best world level works in its genre.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2NETDG6BTLT72	A. Wayne Thompson IV	First let me just get it out there that I'm a liberal, I agree with the message of the film, and I oppose most of what the Bush administration has done in response to 9/11.I don't think I can honestly assess Moore's political message because of what I wrote above, so I won't try.  I didn't really need to be convinced.  It would certainly be my hope that an unbiased or right-leaning person who comes across this film would be swayed by what Moore presents, but I can't speak to the probability of that due to my bias.That said, I don't think there's any doubting Moore's skills as a documentarian and as a filmmaker.  I think even honest critics of his political views would have to concede that he knows how to make a movie.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is quite good, regardless of your politics, I think.  It's clever, is fast paced when it needs to be and slows down to dwell on the weightier items, and it does what documentarys should do (IMO): it shows us the truth right in front of us that we'd previously been blind to.I think this film is good enough to merit at least 1 viewing from people all over the political spectrum.  Make what you will of its message, it's up to you whether or not to accept what it says.  But if you enjoy good films, regardless of what side you take, you'll at least be entertained by F 9/11.	4.0	Great filmmaking	2006-09-26	1	0	1

I do not disagree with everything in this movie. I only disagree with its delivery and the Liberal (Half-truth) approach by Mr Moore. I am one of the ones who has been serving on the front lines and I have been serving for over 17 years so I know the truth first hand.

But let's not be too harsh with Michael. After all, he can't help but lie. It's his native tongue.Unfortunately, Moore's lemmings don't seem to be able to discern  truth from fabrication.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AGXNCNAWAFRQB	Balktoroth	First off let me say, I enjoyed watching this documentary. Do you want to know why? Well, the answer is simple, it is because it wasn't the same old sugar coated garbage you hear on the corporate owned news. This documentary is insightful, and an eye opener, how you take it is entirely up to you.I have read some other reviews, naturally, because I wanted to see what others thought about this documentary.. I must say, blindness must run rampant around here..One comment was made, something along the lines of 'Oh, I was in Iraq and everytime a soldier dies it seems like Moore is doing it.' .. Oh, well that's nice, that comment made me cringe. What kind of blatant statement is that? Moore did not send the soldier's to Iraq, capitol interest and neo-con greed did.. Oh wah wah I know it's a tough thing to hear, and I know it would be easier to just deny it. It is funny how people still believe that our president truly believed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and that was enough to plunge the country into near civil war. Companies most closely allied with the administration are 'strangely' profiting immensely from the war.. hmmm, the only people benefiting from this war.It is truly a tragedy in this country when near half of the population have to lie to themselves to feel comfort.Oh and about the bashes against Moore saying he is fat, #1 - that is a low blow without any real merit, #2 - he is an American, and 50% of America is fat, welcome to America.	5.0	'Controversial' Documentary?	2006-07-11	17	14	3
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3JG5FOPHACQU9	Bamfer	This is a powerful movie. No matter your political leanings, there are core truths in the movie that I found indisputable. There's no faking a mother's grief, whether in Flint, Michigan or in Baghdad, Iraq, no way around the horror of 9/11 itself, no getting around George W. Bush's seven minutes of 'deer in the headlights stare' in that Florida classroom.My biggest reaction to seeing the film was the shock of realization of how much our news media censors itself. From Al Gore gaveling down members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the near riot during Bush's drive down Penn. Ave. at the 2000 inauguration, to the suffering of Iraqi civilians and American soldiers: Why is this the first time I've ever seen this footage?It's sad that America never had a proper debate about the Iraq war, as we had for the Gulf War (one of Congress' finest hours, IMO). Moore's movie is a catylst for that debate now. I just hope it isn't too late. As of today, 901 American soldiers, 121 coalition soldiers, and over 10,000 Iraqis (the majority being civilians) have died in Iraq since March 2003.	5.0	Powerful	2004-07-21	11	8	3

This movie tells the real reason that Dubya won the damn election in 2000, The simple fact is Bush didnt win Florida, but his cousin was the one to report who won the state, plus his brother is the governor, which has to help, Gore should have one, Its that simple. Bush spent the time ina classroom on 9/11/01, He then found out about the attacks, and said basiclly screw it, Ill remain reading to these kids, while millions of innocent americans are being killed, hes basiclly sayin its not him he doesnt care, and it also shows that only 1 member of the congress has a soldier in Iraq, other than that the poor kids are the only ones there, Moore went around and got 2 thats right TWO people to EVEN listen to him about that, out of all the members of the congress, TWO PEOPLE listened, and only one of those two, slightly agreed, This film shows how Bush is not fit to be president, and how greedy, and careless the repulic really is about the average american, and guess what Bush was re-elected in November of this year, that shows how stupid people can be, Moore made this documentary or film or whatever you call it in hopes of getting Senetor John F.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	Very possibly Michael Moore's best film. It is quite provocative but uses enough real footage and undeniable facts that you can't help feeling he has some very important points to make here.The movie opens on what George W. Bush was doing when he heard about the attacks on the World Trade Center. When the first plane hit, he was en route to a school where he had a photo op planned with some first grade children. So he goes right ahead and continues to the school. So he's sitting there reading some idiot story with the children (on film, after all, because it was indeed a photo op) when an aid comes and whispers in his ear about the second plane hitting he second tower. For 7 minutes or more, he continues to sit there with the children, very possibly in shock (hard to tell on that face), and does nothing. Of course, the teacher and the children have no idea what his aid just whispered in his ear, and they go blithely on with the story book.One point which cannot be missed in this movie is the extent to which GWB, President of the United States, is essentially clueless. We've known it for some time, of course; but this will rub your nose in it. The movie was made before Obama was elected, so take that into account in judging its effectiveness.Moore does not go so far as to say that Bush planned or even ordered the attacks on the Twin Towers, as some people have argued. But he does point out that the Bush clan (father and son) have many strong ties with oil men in the middle east, especially the Royal Saudis, and very specifically the Bin Laden family. I won't try to unpack the complex interrelationships of families and family money, oil money and oil reserves, financial and political power. Moore does it so well.The other thing he does so well is to go where the people are, ask them what's going on, and listening to what they have to say. He visits corporate money men who are getting rich off the war, or off the fear generated by 9/11/01. He visits whatever politicians and law enforcement people are willing to talk to him, and some that are not. But he also visits Iraq and the soldiers and civilians there. And, because he always needs to pander to the young people's love of blood and gore, shows some very graphic pictures of bloody corpses and other nasty details about the war.He makes friends with a family from his home town of Flint that lost a son in Iraq, and the soldier's mother later comes to Washington, D.C., and visits the White House. Moore brings along a disillusioned Marine to confront congressmen with the fact that there is exactly one son or daughter of a congressman with the military in Iraq. He offers them recruitment pamphlets go give to their children. Most are unwilling to accept them.Be sure you have a fresh box of tissues handy when you play this DVD; like all the others Moore has made, this one will grab at your heart.	4.0	Michael Moore Gets It Right	2012-05-14	4	2	2
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	This film is a brilliantly-contrived and choreographed emotional roller coaster ride that incites a quite palpable resulting attitude of disgust, dismay, and disdain on the of the viewer. Mr. Moore manipulates the images, voice-overs and antics to both amuse and outrage us all at once, in an obviously outrageously satirical (and sometimes hysterical) look at the war in Iraq and the people who engineered us into invading that country, at terrible cost to ordinary American men and women.In essence that is the simple message of this pseudo-documentary; that simple, trusting and basically honorable young and patriotic Americans are being badly abused and misled  by an administration and a government out of control, a government which, in Mr. Moore's view of the world, serves its people up to slaughter without worry and care. After all, it is not, as he so comically and memorably demonstrates, the sons and daughters of the governing elite who serve and die in God-forsaken places like Iraq and Afghanistan.Thus, in one chaotic series of vignettes, Moore corners unsuspecting Congressmen and makes a pitch to have them volunteer their kids as potential cannon-fodder for Iraq. Needless to say, the point is well taken, as only one current member of Congress has a son stationed in harm's way in Iraq. He counter-poses such banal images with those of battle casualties and struggling working class mothers crying over their lost sons after the fact. One must hasten to acknowledge that in fact, Michael Moore makes no pretense in the film of attempting to be balanced or fair; on the contrary, he is puzzled by the suggestion that he do so.After all, as he says, the opinions coming from the environs of the Oval Office have hardly been balanced or fair.  And while one may argue that he has sometimes played fast and loose with the sequences of events, or the connections between various elements tied together in the movie, there are few outright falsehoods one can point to as an example of downright misrepresentation.He also quite cleverly puts the lie to the idea that protest or argument is somehow unpatriotic. This places an enormous burden on those who would argue one must remain silent in solidarity with the troops as a show of respect for their sacrifice. Yet it is hard to argue with Moore's logic that anyone who really cares about the welfare of the troops would take care not to misuse them or continue to place them needlessly or carelessly in harms' way. As James Bovard contends in his new book, suggesting, as Mr. Bush does continually, that by fighting the terrorists in Iraq we will avoid fighting them here, is at best an almost criminally nave notion, and at worst, a cynical and murderous misrepresentation of what is going down in Iraq.We are not becessarily there to preserve their freedom or ours, argues Mr. Moore, and any suggestion that such is the case will have a hard time explaining events that now transpire on an almost daily basis. Moore's intent was to ratchet up debate on the policies and practices and rationale of the neo-conservative regime current in power, and to suggest that perhaps Americans begin to question it and its motives much more closely. Thus, despite it dramatic excesses or its willingness to sometimes take liberties in connecting things which may or may not indeed be so tied, I believe in creating public controversy and stirring public debate the movie will be a stunning success, and that it may well lead to having some measurable resulting political impact on the election in the fall.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	"Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, generated considerable controversy with good reason. It is difficult to imagine anyone viewing the film, especially during 2004, an election year, without developing rather strong feelings about the subject matter. From the title of the film alone, the viewer prepares for a gut-wrenching experience in preparation for watching a documentary that intends to shoot from the hip and does so relentlessly and without apology. Producer/director Michael Moore's appearance in his own film makes it clear that he acts purely from personal motivation in creating such a film at such a strategic time. The question that many are trying to ask is: is Michael Moore pro-American, anti-American, anti-Bush, or what? How can any person conceive of such a disturbing film to show to a public that is still living in the trauma of the event s of September 11, 2001 unless he is trying to convey a message? Even more of a question is: just what are we supposed to understand from this film? Is this Michael Moore's day in the sun, or is it an indictment of President George W. Bush?Moore's dislike of President Bush and the Bush family is obvious from the start. The film paints a very negative picture of the Bush family as being driven only by oil-based wealth that is linked directly to the Bin Laden family, the Saudi royal family, and various personalities that are all apparently ""in on the deal"" in terms of generating profits from all the events that developed before and after September 11, 2001. Moore makes it a point of presenting the idea that the tragedy of September 11, 2001 was a carefully orchestrated event performed with the knowledge and, more than likely, consent of the Bush family at a time when Bush was, as the film states, ""on vacation"" as his popularity rating plunged. The film is truly a cynic's delight in making the point that everything that took place on September 11, 2001 had but one purpose: to generate more wealth for the Bush family and the Saudis, both of whom enjoy an immense amount of protection by the Secret Service.Moore's appearance in the film adds an element that makes him open for caustic criticism, as he is neither photogenic nor particularly tactful. The one element that compensates for what many may believe to be Moore's exaggerated ego in making himself a feature in his own film is the obvious sincerity in which he pursues his subject; nobody viewing the film can doubt that he believes very strongly in what he says. His visit back to his hometown of Flint, Michigan hits hard, as he shows the economic devastation in the city and the aggressive efforts to recruit the many young people affected by the economic blight into the military. The footage showing the bereaved family of Sergeant Michael Pedersen hits home in a way that cannot be ignored, unfortunately, by anyone viewing the film.The filmed carnage of the war in Iraq, a major feature of the film, evokes memories of the Vietnam War for persons old enough to remember that era; persons from later generations for whom the Vietnam War is only a name from history cannot ignore the grim reality that the war in Iraq is something that has already impacted American society permanently. The film, however, makes a compelling point that the one and only motive for launching the war in Iraq was commercial and suited the needs of the Bush oil empire more than protected the American people, which was the reason President Bush appears in the film as stating as the objective of the war. Add to that the sight of Lila Lipscombe, the mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen , who, by her own admission, is a ""conservative Democrat"" and who states openly that she is proud to be American, weeping over her son's death, and the result is a frontal attack that provoked talk in the Bush administration of possibly banning the film. Had the Bush administration taken such an unprecedented measure, Michael Moore would have become a martyr nationwide immediately, and the impact of such an action on Bush's chances for re-election would have been felt acutely.The actual attack on September 11, 2001, interestingly enough, takes up so little time in the film that it might seem to some viewers almost insignificant, but it is, in fact, the focus of the entire film. Moore depicts the attack as an event of which the Bush administration had ample prior knowledge and could have prevented simply by monitoring the many Al Qaeda members, most of whom were Saudi nationals, residing in the United States and studying in American flight schools at the time the attack took place. President Bush is depicted as a President-on-vacation throughout the entire period of crisis, and the message that comes across is that the September 11, 2001 attack was only one part of a scheme to manipulate the public into a mindset of terror so that a grandiose scam could be carried out that would generate profits for American firms connected with defense contracting and fossil-fuel energy sources, as well as the Saudi royal family, who, according to the film, is so close to the Bush family as to be regarded as related.The film makes no pretense at being balanced in its views. No attempt is made to convince the viewer that the report is nonpartisan or unbiased. The audience sees exactly what Michael Moore wants it to see, and Moore does a superb job of presenting his views in a clear, concise manner on film. The viewer is, therefore, compelled to decide whether to accept the film as an accurate documentary or political propaganda aimed at dislodging George W. Bush from the Presidency. Bush's rather hostile policies toward the underprivileged sectors of the population will probably mean that the film will generate almost unanimous support of Moore's views, especially when they see the exploitation of the victims of the economy. In light of the way Moore pointed out accurately that many of the people living in the economic plight in the United States live in conditions not altogether different from those that exist in war-torn areas of Iraq at that time, persons who wondered if they had anything to hope for in terms of simple survival would surely have expressed their views in November 2004. History relates, however, that Bush was re-elected as President, so if Michael Moore's goal was to prevent re-election, clearly he did not achieve his goal.Is the film worth seeing? From a historical standpoint, it is. It is, however, definitely not for the faint of heart, and a person who seeks to keep stress levels down might find the film unduly upsetting. However, even if a viewer agrees or disagrees with Moore's documentary, the film has recorded beliefs held by the public that will not go away."	3.0	Impossible to Ignore, Unfortunately	2005-02-08	13	7	6

My expectations were lowered further when I heard a friend of mine pan it--a friend who *liked* ""Columbine"" and last year's anti-capitalist screed ""The Corporation,"" which I found horribly biased. So, I was surprised to find myself liking it, and impressed at Moore's restraint in making a film that, while biased, is probably his least biased film to date.Now, there are some problems with the film. Moore doesn't fully explore the implications of some of what he says, as is his wont. But there's so much footage in here that needs to be seen and which *hasn't* been in the mainstream media. We haven't been shown our dead and maimed soldiers; we haven't been shown the dead and maimed Iraqi civilians; we haven't been shown our soldiers and their families refusing to toe the party line... and these are things we must see, to understand the consequences of our government's actions.If you'd rather remain ignorant of what's going on, skip this movie.

First of all about a year ago there would've been no way I'd go near a documentary...I was 13 at the time and non-fiction just wasn't my thing. But after i heard that some movie called Bowling for Columbine had an interview with Matt Stone from South Park in it (and South Park was my thing) I decided to try it out. Expecting to be super bored I turned it on and I was instantly a Michael Moore fan. I just couldn't believe how well it was done. So of course when I heard this new movie Ferenheit 9/11 was coming out I got really excited but I didn't expect it to be as good as Columbine. But it was actually better! It was so hard-hitting and intense I could barely believe it. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD. This movie really makes me appreciate being Canadian.So anyways, I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to go see it right away (it has a better effect in theaters).

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A33693RRRFK55Q	"B. Erickson ""boycorrupted"""	"Whew!  Ya know, I'm not sure, but I think this film may actually be anti-Bush.  I'd have to go see it again and take notes to really be sure - it's a bit subtle!OK, so ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not exactly the most even-handed treatment of its subject(s).  I doubt whether anybody could argue that fact.  Actually, it's quite a pretty piece of vituperation directed squarely and ruthlessly at ""Dubbya"" and his administration for practically everything they have done since entering the White House.  It runs the gamut of anti-Bush sentiment, from the shady way he ""won"" the election, to the large percentage of time he spent on vacation before (and even after) 9/11, to the quite specific ties the Bush family has to the Bin Laden family (oh yes), to his hamfisted handling of the largest foreign attack ever on US soil, to his cursory military strike on Afghanistan to appease angry US citizens before hurling us into a ""premeditated, unprovoked"" war on Iraq, which is explained in ""9/11"" as basically a ""Blood for Oil"" expedition...and so on.  Michael Moore interviews bereaved moms and disillusioned soldiers, he corners senators on the street and asks them to enlist their children, he rides an ice cream truck around the capitol to read the Patriot Act to our elected officials (since apparently none of them bothered to read it before signing it into law), he takes every tack he can think of to cast the Bush Administration in the most unfavorable light possible.And in fact, he does succeed.  This movie will get a lot of people riled up.  I don't remember the last time I saw a film in the theatre and the audience erupted into applause every 5 minutes - but that's what happened here.  People WANT to see these points made.  They want an honest accounting of the events of the last 3 years, and they simply are not getting straight (or believable) answers from Washington.  Do they get it from Moore?  Well, at least they get a take-no-prisoners accounting from the other side.  In my opinion, one ought to take ALL opinions with a grain of salt - including mine! - but it's pretty obvious that a) Bush and his lackeys are not straight shooters, and b) Michael Moore is out to get them.  These things should be considered before buying into either side's story.I'd like to make this point though with reference to ""smear campaigns,"" since it's quite legitimate to describe this film as such.  Six years ago we actually impeached a president because he lied about an extramarital sex act.  Well, ""we"" didn't - rather the GOP made it their political raison d'etre to bash the Democrat, and they succeeded in appealing to the lowest common denominator of self-righteous sexual indignation to get their constituents behind it.  Now, yes, a lie is a lie, but on the other hand, all lies are NOT the same.  I daresay - let me make this controversial point - that whether or not Clinton got some action in the Oval Office is not quite as relevant to our daily lives as whether or not Bush lied about the election, the elusive WMDs, or the ultimate reason for the war itself, which has killed thousands of our young soldiers.  How is it that we can impeach one president over a stained dress, while the next one gets away with so many really heinous atrocities against the trust and security of the American people?  What kind of country IS this?  At the very least, we CANNOT re-elect Bush, if we all still want to be here for the next election.  God willing, this film will help and not hinder John Kerry, who is at least conclusively the ""lesser of two evils"" this time around.See this film!  Take its message with a grain of salt, but keep it in the back of your mind when you watch Bush founder as he tries to justify why your son or daughter isn't coming home."	5.0	A much-needed message from the other side.	2004-06-26	23	17	6

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A34PAZQ73SL163	"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!"""	"With the pressing of ""Play,"" one becomes immediately aware that there is something drastically wrong with this documentary. No other one I've encountered included a disclaimer announcing that ""the following interviews and commentary are for entertainment only."" Such a warning is anathema to the goal of a documentary, which should be to educate. As far as entertainment value goes, however, you'd have to be a member of the tinfoil hat left (or those who think John Ashcroft's men interrogate librarians every other Monday) to get any meaningful information out of this film.What is most surprising is that, even from a technical standpoint, Moore's skills are overrated. The film drags on and on. It is devoid of drama as Moore cannot be bothered to showcase any conflicting points of view. Had he merely interviewed a couple of people who were not partisan Democrats he might have succeeded in making the film digestible, but he's simply not interested. If the plot were outlined in equation form, it would read: 2000 Election=Republican Plot, Iraq=Vietnam, Bush=Oppressor, Emotion=Fact, and Individual Suffering=Needed Alteration of Foreign Policy.By the end of the film one feels used and cheated. You may feel anger and indignation, but it's solely due to charlatans like Moore earning fortunes from the cobbling together of mendacious inuendos. It is rather depressing to watch such a cultural blockbuster and, with little concentration, think up five hundred responses which devastate Moore's positions. It's quite easy to do with Fahrenheit 9/11 as it relies chiefly on emotion. The director's emotophilia is even more pronounced in this film than it was in Bowling for Columbine. In the end we have only feeling. He spends over thirty minutes with a woman from Flint who tragically lost a son in Iraq. One feels sympathy for her until she abandons any sense of perspective by deciding that the result of her son's death will be for her to vent all of her rage and anguish in the direction of The White House and President George W. Bush. Moore couldn't be happier about her conclusion and hopes that you'll do the same.Before I saw the movie, allegations by commentators that the film violated McCain-Feingold struck me as unfair, but the evidence is in the reels. We hear from an injured soldier who states (I'm not kidding) that once he gets home the first thing he is going to do is become very active in his local Democratic Party. Go leftist young man! We also see the dour and self-righteous filmmaker on Capitol Hill attempting to convince Congressmen that they should sign their kids up for Iraq. This is yet another of his many ""emotional over all"" segments, but one begins to wonder here about Moore's intelligence. Does he really think that parents can enlist their sons without their consent? Does he even know that children are not allowed in the military? I heard him repeat this same line of anti-reasoning during an interview with Bill O'Reilly over the summer. His confusion here may be based on a utopian's ignorance about the mechanics of the real world.In retrospect, a more accurate title for this film would have been, The Eternal Bush, as its spirit and one-sidedness is remarkably similar to Goebbels' The Eternal Jew. All that is needed is a few shots of Republican legislators scampering into state houses like rats to complete the portrait. Obviously, it's quite fashionable to compare individuals to members of The Third Reich and I am loath to add my pen to the cultural totality of misapplied historical allusions, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is nothing more than an ideologue's checklist of propaganda.With Moore, most of his arguments refute themselves. One cannot believe that the Patriot Act is turning us into a police state when the very existence and celebration of Fahrenheit 9/11 disproves it. This is the freest country in the world and nothing better exemplifies our liberty than somebody like Michael Moore making millions from the dissemination of his anti-American propaganda.

Michael Moore is a liberal and isn't ashamed of it.  In fact he's proud of it, revels in it, trying to take back the word stolen from the left during the Reagan Era.Michael Moore is a brave man, taking on a sitting president during a time where the very rights and freedoms guaranteed us by the constitution are being questioned.  This period will be looked back upon as a very dark time in US history.  We now have brownshirts like Ann Coulter bandying about words like ""traitor"" and ""sedition"" when anyone questions the current government - a government that stole the 2000 election, and as a result, a government whose very legitimacy is questionable.The aggressively populist position of Michael Moore is succeeding where a quarter century of ""kid glove"" leftist rhetoric has failed.  He's taking on the bellicose right with a solid dose of their own medicine and IT'S WORKING.  The amazing thing to watch are the ensuing attacks on Mr. Moore not by the right, but by the leftist elite criticizing Mr. Moore for his tactics.  It's the business-as-usual-Democratic Party policy of eating itself from within.  The left has a tendency to try to be all things to all people, thus ending up being nothing to anyone.  This is best exemplified by the party's decision to choose John Kerry to be their presidential candidate, while a man of principles and ideas like Howard Dean is cast aside.  It's time for the left to stop relying on voters being willing to vote against ""the other side"" and give them ideas and positions worth voting FOR.Michael Moore understands this.  People have criticized this film for having a point of view.  It's a documentary and all documentaries come from a point of view, stating their case.  The real complaint is that this fat, grizzled, ball cap wearing guy with a camera is actually making a point and making more of a difference than all the usual suspects combined.  Michael Moore is through letting the right define what it is and what it means to be a liberal, to be a patriot.This movie is about the Presidency of George W. Bush and the terrible things that this inept, inarticulate puppet of the oil industry has done to maintain that ever-so-important flow of cheap oil.  It's about lives lost, lives ruined and a country losing the hard earned respect of the world.  Michael Moore gets his point across very effectively, forcing the viewer to ask the difficult questions they may not want to ask of themselves.Is it fair?  Of course not, but like anyone with a strong opinion, they're not going to BE fair when it comes to their beliefs.  It's up to you to make up your own mind whether Mr. Moore's opinions have merit.  You may not agree with him, but you SHOULD be asking yourself these questions.

Thats basically the sum of the reviews for this film (those of you who've posted a review but have stated clearly you refuse to ever watch the film, are waisting the time of people who actually want an honest opinion.  Go tread somewhere else).Michael Moore's film comes at a time in our country where political commentary and reporting have reached an all-time low.  In this day and age, we as Americans are forced biased politcal view from every media outlet available, including films.  This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are listening to.  Michael Moore does not hide his political agenda at all, and does not mix intentions.  It's for this reason, he and his film have been labaled ""anti-American"".  However, in my mind, this is as American as it gets.  Right or wrong, Left or Right, Red or Blue, whichever way you swing in politics, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Even if you come away from it with nothing but hatred for Moore, isn't it worth that much to solidify your beliefs?  As an American, I want to know everything I can, and the things that Michael Moore explores in this film, are only one piece of the overall pie when it comes to American Politics.I loved this film's intentions, as I do most of Moore's other films.  That does not mean I (or any American) hate this country, or the people in charge of it.  To me, what it means, and what Moore represents, is the voice from the other side.  A different point of view.  The silent majority if you will.  I don't always agree with the things Moore says or does, but I truly respect the fact that he is out there, doing what he does, because no one else is, and we NEED someone out there ruffling feathers.In terms of the film itself, and the quality of it, I still enjoyed it.  It was funny, scary, depressing, and ultimately, very informative.  I thought it tried a little too much at times, given the broad scope of charges Moore heads up, and would have probably enjoyed another 45 minutes or so to back-up some of the things mentioned.  That's not to say I believe Moore is not being 100% honest with us, it simply meens I wished for a more complete documentary given the topics at hand (I've the feeling that certain parts of the film's research and production value took a back seat to the turn-around time Moore had to get the movie in the theaters and finally into your homes pre-04 election, which he ultimately did)Bottom Line, every American owes it to themselves to at least watch the film, and make your own opininon.  I feel sorry for the people that bash it without having even watched it!  Those are the truly pathetic people of this country, so blinded by agenda, and personal beliefs that they refuse to even entertain the possiblity of anothers point of view.  Thats as anti-America as you can get.  If you've seen any of Michael Moore's previous films, you know what to expect.  If you believe everything the Bush organization tells you, then you have no idea what to expect."	4.0	As American as it gets!!!	2004-10-15	10	7	3

Do you people even know what the word ""propaganda"" even means, well here is the definition given by Websters Dictionary, ""False information or ideas methodically spread to promote or injure a cause, group, or nation."" Now nothing that Moore has said in any of his films is false information! How can something be propaganda when it comes from the sources mouth? One reviewer commented on Bush commenting on the terrorists and then saying ""watch this drive"" without missing a beat by saying, ""cant he golf and not be bothered?"". NO he cant! He is the president, he should have not commented on his golf swing at all, he should have sayed what he sayed about the terrorists then went on his way. By saying what he sayed the way he said it, it makes him look like he doesn't care and his golfing is more important. Michael Moore is not anti-american, he just wants a better America! One reviewer commented about the woman who lost her son in the war by saying that her son signed on to the military voluntarily. Yes it is true that he did sign on of his own free will, but once you are in the military OWNS you and you do what they say. She was protesting Bush for carelessly sending people to die for an unjust war! He signed up for the military, but not to die for no reason.Michael Moore is a truth seeker not a propagandist, sometimes the truth hurts. If you want to be a drone and just do and beleive everything that Bush says, then you are a fool.

Iraq-al-quauda connection. Yeah whatever. The only connection the al-quada has is with the saudi arabia. And the Bush family have connections with the saudi's. So really...what else could it be?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2H5G22VQ5RZ55	"""blambert32"""	"How many reviews have been written by those who just assumed whatever Moore put in the film was based on truth? A typical example of his use of innuendo to distort the truth was his claim that ""$1.4 Billion was given by the Saudi Royal family directly to the Bush family...(long pause)..., their family friends, and companies they've done business with."" It is true the Saudis are rich and invest almost all of their money in U.S. companies. It would be difficult to refute that if the Bush's once ate at McDonald's that a Saudi investment there would support Moore's claim. The way Moore wrote the narrative, though. makes it seem that the Saudi's gave money to the Bush's or their friends when in fact they didn't. The mention of the Carlyle Group is also indicative of his outright lies. Of course, the narrative is written to never outright claim that George Bush, who only had a passing participation with that company once when he was Governor of Texas and then was totally divested with it way back then, was actually getting money from them. Ask any of the viewers, though, and you'd think Moore actually proved some kind of collusion. That company incidentally was described as a Conservative company owned by friends of Bush. If you allow that members of Carter's administration who started the company, and members of Clinton's administration who make up the bulk and controlling interest are ""friend of Bush,"" and ignore the remark about it being ""conservative,"" then Moore is once again off the hook. The fact is though, that the only thing the Bush administration ever had to do with any govenment contract that impacted Carlyle was to cancel a huge proposed contract that cost the company billions of dollars. The innuendo made it seem like Buish somehow put money in his pocket with sweet under the table deals with Carlyle, when the opposite was true.Moore claimed Bush intervened to fly Saudis out of the U.S. immediately after 9-11, but we have already heard Richard Clarke explain that he made the call on protecting the Saudis and that the decision never went higher than him. As a matter of fact, he also denied that anyone was flown out. What he said happened was that the initial claims of Arabic-speaking hijackers crashing the planes caused a fear of vigilanteism against innocent Arabs, so many were bussed to safe areas for protection and vetting by the FBI until the flight restrictions were lifted and they could be flown home. Clarke said all the Saudis protected were cleared by the FBI before being released. Far cry from what Moore insinuated.Remember that encounter with the Congressman, when Moore ambushed him and asked if he has any family members he would like to have join the military and be shipped to Iraq? That Congressman calmly told Moore that he did have two family members in the military and that they backed the War on Terrorism and were set to go to Iraq. Moore cut out that part of the film and just showed him strutting away after Moore ignored his cival response and said something rude to get the walk-away reaction.So far, there is a case to be made that not one single thing in Moore's film which is aimed at discrediting Bush is fair or truthful. However, he was very skillful at only suggesting the claims he made and never coming right out and saying them, in order to deflect lawsuits. The fact that he knew what he filmed was libelous, and worked so hard for legal deniability, goes a long way to discredit him personally and to show him for what he is.Pro-Kerry fast-talkers and ""Anybody But Bush"" haters love this movie and hope it's unfair and unscrupulous assertions will impact the election. It is possible that when the movie is fairly examined for content veracity and people's eyes are opened the opposite will be true."	1.0	Purposeful disinformation.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"I remember (not too long ago) when Rush Limbaugh was having a field day with President Clinton's marital infidelity and the Whitewater debacle. In fact, there was nearly an impeachment over it. An impeachment! Over something that had nothing to do with American policy (foreign or otherwise).I'm a registered Democrat (yep, I sit on the left side pretty comfortably), but I had to eat some crow when I found out my man, Mr. President himself, had lied to the public about his affair with the young intern (and possibly others like Jennifer Flowers). I had to ""zip"" my lips shut because what he'd done was wrong. And he finally had to admit it. Shame on him. But does such an action deserve as much media attention as it got, and a near impeachment?Now let's zoom to the current date and Mr. Moore's film. Here we have a President who pretty much stole the White House (there is room for argument here, but when your brother is the Governor of Florida, and that was the deciding state with such a closely contested presidential run, you have to have some doubts about the validity of it.). We also have a President who's business acumen is less than impressive prior to becoming the Commander-In-Chief. And he probably didn't even know who the Heads of States were in any other country besides those in the western hemisphere (I'll let his foreign policy speak for itself here). None of this is impeachable either, but you can see where this is going. President Bush is, in my humble opinion, a moron, a puppet President. I felt this way before going in to see Fahrenheit 9/11, and felt it even stronger after watching the film.But let's talk about the validity of Mr. Moore's film for a moment and not get too political (well ...as best we can anyway).The Bad: Mr. Moore tries hard to make ties between the Bin Laden family and the Bush family. I think we can safely say that he didn't do this very well in the film. It's kind of like six degrees of separation, and when you're in politics those connections can be made in even less than six degrees. The thing that struck me as ""bad"" about this portion of the film was that all of these connections were made long before the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. That would be like the lead paint industry being blamed for ground water contamination since there was no way to know (at the time the paints were made) that lead was really that ""bad."" This might be an overly-simplistic example, but I didn't want to lose anyone so early on. You get the point.The Good: Well, pretty much everything else. Oh sure, Michael Moore's documentary is extremely stilted toward the anti-Bush sentiment. But did that really surprise anyone? If you read newspapers or magazines at all, you HAD TO HAVE KNOWN about the controversy surrounding this film before its release in the U.S. (which almost didn't happen).For some reason, President Bush reminds me of Gerald Ford. But while Ford stumbled physically (to the excitement of Chevy Chase and the Saturday Night Live gang), President Bush stumbles mentally and professionally. He can't make decisions without someone telling him what to do (if there's any doubt about this, just watch the first 1/3 of the film where he's been notified of TWO planes hitting the Twin Towers, but does nothing for many minutes while doing some PR work at a school. Not very flattering). And then, if you can handle it, watch the end of the film when he tries to remember a famous quote and, again, looks like a complete idiot (I guess no one could get to the teleprompter quick enough).Throughout the film the anti-Bush message is strong but if there is another message, it's that fear is even stronger. Similar to Mr. Moore's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE documentary, this film also focuses on the fears that drive our decisions, and how the current administration fed those fears to its own advantage (the colored code alerts for the country, the new homeland security branch, and the impossible and improbable links between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein).Is this film for everyone? Definitely not. Is it something to be watched-with a kernel of skepticism-by those who wish to see it? Most definitely so.It certainly is a film to be reckoned with in the documentary world. Although its message is so far to the ""left"" that some will ultimately throw up at its filtered messages, others will praise it for bringing light to the dark Bush administration that still remains an enigma to many."	4.0	Conservatives Turn to Eat Some Crow	2004-06-27	19	5	14

I have major problems with anyone using human pain to further his own cause, something that was done repeatedly and effectively in this movie.

He did not do anything to us but struggles with the situation left by the last administration. I did not find there any good questions and I was not presented with answers worth hearing. I think it was an anti-government, anti-American and an anti-truth production of a very uninformed mind. What is wrong with you, Mr. Moore?

Michael Moore's often buffoonish approach to disarming the objects of his attacks is less effective in this film, mostly due to the seriousness of the subject. I would have preferred that a more intellectual director would have tackled this one. It's pretty easy to make George W. Bush look like a moron: all you need to do is present footage of him talking. I've read a great deal about the Bush family and this movie taught me nothing new (that doesn't mean YOU shouldn't see it though). Furthermore, the fact that Moore casually insinuates conspiracy theories based on a relationship between the Bush family and the bin Ladens is a little obnoxious. Like all Moore films, this movie is a bit chaotic and fails to really stay on target with any sort of statement other than ""Bush sucks."" This is definately entertainment, NOT a thesis backed up by relevant points. One minute the soldiers in Iraq are heroic victims of Bush's policies, and then suddenly later they are portrayed as bloodthirsty meatheads. The movie is all over the place. I prefer more academic ""documentaries"" (if you can even call this a documentary). If you are not very aware about current events or politics, this movie might be helpful to you. Otherwise, I would recommend movies like ""Control Room"" or ""Manufacturing Consent"" (or anything with Noam Chomsky's name on it for that matter). This movie seems counter-productive to the very necessary discussion on the conflicts between Christian and Islamic cultures, the effect of U.S. foreign policy on other countries, and the real roots of terrorism. Films like this are calculated to achieve an emotional response that will stir people up and make money. Certainly there are important points made and I do agree that Bush is an incompetant president, but I am uncomfortable with Moore's overall approach. Still, the movie is very much worth seeing. It includes a lot of footage that you won't see anywhere else very easily. However, the film isn't as good as Moore's ""Bowling For Columbine,"" and I predict that in another 10-15 years, people will have forgotten all about ""Farenheit 911."""	3.0	Subject is too serious for such mud-slinging entertainment.	2004-12-20	20	10	10

"""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an outstanding documentary covering some of the general facts and questions about 9/11.  The movie even goes so far as to examine the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers during the advent of the ""war on terror"" and does a good job of getting footage of the Iraqi people after the initial devestation of their cities.Moore couples witty humor with poignient moments and keen insight into the motivations and tactics of the leaders who are the faces of the elite running this war.My only problem with the movie is that it is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is so much more confirmed information that was left out of the movie.  However, I know that the general public in the very least was exposed to the many questions presented in this movie and, perhaps, started the journey down the rabbit hole into exploring more obvious questions from 9/11.As a starter into 9/11 conspiracy research, this movie is a good foundation."	4.0	Great film for the general public, but just the tip of the iceberg...	2008-03-16	9	4	5

I am not attempting to make a political statement here, just a true one.  The man is a jerk.  Watch a few episodes of his TV show ""The Awful Truth"" for evidence of this fact.  I feel so bad for all the low-level secretaries who have to put up with this sarcastic, brash buffoon who bursts in with a camera crew and no appointment to make trouble.That being said, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Moore's strongest film, largely because it keeps Moore out of it.  The sort of aggressive grandstanding that has both made Moore famous and also most hurt his credibility is kept to a minimum here.  Even when he does, for example, take an ice cream truck around the Capitol to read the US PATRIOT Act over a loud speaker (yeah!  that'll change the world!), somebody made the very intelligent decision to cut away quickly.  Yes, he still pulls some of the same old stunts, but, unlike films like ""Bowling for Columbine,"" these are not the bulk of the film, but rather more like a signature:  could you call it a Michael Moore if there wasn't at least a bit of that?It's been said that this is a film you should see regardless of your political views, and I agree with that.  When I watched the film, I had the thought several times that somebody was standing behind Moore with a cattle prod, ready to zap him if he didn't keep his tone on the voice-overs in check.  This restraint is what earns Moore the right, in my opinion, to at least be heard.  You know it's a passionate issue for Moore if he's willing to restrain himself so that more people will listen.In the end, it's a film worth seeing and you might as well see it now, because it has the shelf life of deli ham.  If you really want to own it, wait a few months and it should be in bargain bins.  This is one of the reason that this should never be considered for Best Picture, as Moore has been campaigning for.  This isn't a film--it's an argument.  So, while it's not remotely Best Picture material, and its value is only so immediate (hence its quick move to DVD), see it.

When voting for president, i generally vote on my gut instinct, for who i think will do the best job of running the country. Up until September, i was like most, not impressed by either Kerry or Bush, waiting for a chance to hear what they had to say and listen and read some media reports. I heard about the movie and had a difficult time getting it, as most did not carry it due to fear, which struck me as odd.  Finally I watched Farenheit 9/11 and was disgusted by the arrogance and lies of this administration.  Michael Moore presents facts that are undisputable and allow you the viewer to think hard.  Facts are from several different reputable sources that cannot all bend the truth. It is clear that Mr Moore has a grudge against President G.W. Bush, he shows that at the beginning, but in the movie he presents facts to support his views which make it difficult to say he is  bending the truth for his own reasons. After hearing the controversy surrounding Mr. Moore and the government and republican effort to silence him, I was glad to finally get to see this documentary that said what everyone else was afraid of saying in fear of the RNC wrath. This movie really changed my mind about President Bush and his administration. Facts presented here about the President Bush's administration, policies and practices were an eye opener.  A lot of stuff i did not know about. This is not the way that this our country aught to be run! As a Texan and former Bush supporter I believed that this movie was biased and a lie, but I was challenged to watch the facts presented in the movie then think about them. Let's just say bush doesnt get my vote anymore. The whole issue about the Bin Laden family being flown out of the country after 9/11 especially strikes me as odd.  The fact that they should have been detained for questioning cannot be argued. Bush family ties to rich oil Saudis and business with the Carlyle group which did business with the Bin Laden family!  Question the motives of the war in Iraq, knowing that most of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, none came from Iraq. In fact there are no known ties to Iraq or WMD's.  So why arent the Saudis being questioned??? After all, Bin Ladin is a Saudi himself. Why arent we attacking Saudi Arabia?? Why arent we concentrating our efforts in Afghanistan? that's where Bin Laden is! Why are the rich and administration favored companies fighting over the oil fields in iraq? I thought this war was about terrorism?  Why are the military (using our hard earned tax money) guarding the oil fields  more than anything else in Iraq(and dying in the process)? Is the death of all these military personnel (1000 and growing) worth it?  What if one of them was my kid, brother or cousin?  Is Iraq on its way to becoming another Vietnam like crisis? Is this about oil? If so who benefits, and are we likely to give up control of the region if Bush returns to office?  Will Iraq elections be fair (or will he be US controlled for oil purposes)? Are we suggesting that Iraqis and other countries take our place  and pay for a war we started? Will they willingly do that? are they less human? Were all the peaceful diplomatic efforts exhausted before the war started? Did Bush go against common sense? Is Bush's arrogance hurting our foreign trade relations and deficit?  Does he even care about the deficit? At least watch this film before you vote, and figure out why the RNC is trying so hard to silence Mr Moore. Think hard about the facts.  I dont think the American public is ignorant as this administration probably thinks, i think we are in the dark about the truth that is hidden from us.  If many knew the truth they would clearly change their minds too. No wonder the RNC is trying hard to silence Michael Moore.	5.0	THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE: FAHRENHEIT 9/11	2004-09-24	35	26	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2NB0V13FCCTBC	Brandi  Price	"I saw Farenheit 9/11 this morning in a packed movie theater in a rich, politically conservative suburb of Dallas, TX where it received good reviews and even a standing ovation and numerous claps by some in the audience. I'm glad to see stories reported in the Washington Post, BBC, NPR, and in AP stories finally come together in this sobering documentary on the Bush Administration's reaction regarding Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War.Before anyone says it's 'inaccurate"", hopefully the reviewer has actually seen the movie and remember if it is inaccurate then director Michael Moore would be sued for slander and/or libel. That hasn't happened.Instead Moore uses quotes from uses senators and representatives, footage from congressional sessions, interviews with U.S. soldiers and Iraqi people who have had family members killed, and shows how Choicepoints and Katherine Harris used inaccurate information to steal the 2000 election for Bush.The movie starts off with the 2000 election and the confusion over who actually won Floriday. It made me very angry to realize how no U. S. senators responded to numerous African American U.S. representatives' and their constituents'  requests to have a full recount in Florida following the 2000 elections. All that was needed to do this was one signature from one U.S. senator but none came through.The movie details George W. Bush's business connections with the Bin Laden family in the Carlisle company where the family and wealthy companies get rich off of oil and war, or defense weapons. Moore hits the nail right on the head and finally explains the detailed reality of Bush's critics going to Iraq for oil.I was so shell shocked throughout the movie listening to a U.S. troop gladly talk about how he likes to play the song "" the roof is on fire"" when he rides in the tank on the way to fight in Baghdad, or burn up Baghdad.Footage of U.S. troops toying with a dead Iraqi body tickling his feet asking the body if it's ticklish and referring to the dead person's sexual organs in an obscene way shows there are more than just physical caused by war: it also weighs heavily on the troops' souls and pshcye.It also shows a mom living in Flint, MI, where at least 50 % of the population is unemployed or have exhausted their unemployment benefits. The mom proudly talks about how her family has always been in the military and how her daugher and son are in the military.When she learns that her son is dead from fighting in Iraq she later is seen surrounded by her family reading the last letter her son wrote to her from Iraq. He said he didn't know why George (W. Bush) sent the troops over to Iraq. ""we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction"" and he sayid ""Bush just sent everyone to war to fight a war for his dad."" Her son also said he hoped ""the fool (Bush) is not re-elected.) I cried through this, as I did at the beginning of the film when footage is shown of horrified people's reactions in NYC after the planes immediately hit the twin towers. I wasn't the only one crying since I heard some sniffles and people near me were crying during different parts of the film.The movie was the hardest film I've had to watch because the Iraq war is ongoing and so much information has come out  that was detailed in the film just within the last few years. It's alot easier to stomach fiction and actors portraying someone. It's almost impossible to watch Bush say stupid remars such as  ""Your are the haves and the have-mores. I call you my base"" to people sitting at a fund-raiser dinner, while a U.S. troops points out to  Moore that he's only getting paid appx $2,000 to $3,000 monthly for serving in Iraq while Halliburton workers in the same area make appx $6,000 monthly to do construction. Moore also mentions how Bush cut terrorist defense spending prior to 9/11 and how he cut health and other benefits to military personnel and vets and how he's helped close numerous veteran hospitals.The movie asks all the right questions about an administation that has almost made it a crime to do so,or at least accuse anyone who does question the Bush Administration as being ""unpatriotic.""

Some may not want to admit or even hear this, but we are given a biased view of the news, indeed the world.  I am sorry to tell you that the world is not black and white.  For example, how do we distinguish the ""bad"" guys from the civilians in Iraq?  Seems like a pretty easy job in simplistic land, but in reality there is a lot of grey.This was the first ANYTHING that dared to question the status quo and consequently the Bush administration and its policies.Think about that for a second: the first ""anything"" that questioned the administration.  You can call it a work of fiction if you like, but even then it was still the first anything that questioned the administration.How many of you have studied history?  If you have, you can use examples from political, military, sociological, even financial history to easily and conclusively demonstrate that ""bad"" things happen whenever someone or group is left unchecked or even unquestioned.  US Political history example - Nixon's uncontrollable ego and subsequent criminal actions.  Military examples - Where to start? The phrase ""groupthink"" was coined because of military blunders.  Sociological example - Tuskeegee Syphilus Experiments in the US.  Financial example - Nick Lesson and Barclays, Enron, WorldCom, every single financial analyst on CNBC in the late 1990's.So perhaps, just maybe, history has told us that unchecked power is not a good thing, and because of this any attempt to question that unchecked power should be well-received by all men, especially in a time of war.PS - Think for yourself-It is more laborious, but it just might save your life sometime."	5.0	Is everything in its Perfect Context?	2005-01-08	28	12	16

Duh, like what is the Amazon.com reviewer suggesting? That anyone who regards Moore's film as a pack of lies doesn't ""truly"" know what it means to be an American? He's probably one of those idiots who believe that anyone who questions the ""facts"" of Moore's films are suggesting he didn't have the right to make it. He had the right to make it, and we have the right to criticize it and to criticize him. That's called freedom of speech, but the Amazon.com reviewer probably regards it as censorship. Get a dictionary, you damn fool!Space is limited, too limited to counter Moore's film point by point, but I wouldn't do that anyway. I've read reams of articles about both the film and Moore's other works (including his books) and anyone interested in knowing the truth can get off their lazy behinds and do the same. The fact is the man cannot be trusted, and even those who share his political idealogy know he's a fraud and condemn him for it. Moore discredits the very people who champion him with his lazy and/or inept research, and his all too obvious lies.Moore is an overgrown child with a blind hatred for authority figures. This film is nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of an incorrigible twelve year old giving his teacher the finger to win the admiration of his classmates. Moore's hatred of George W. Bush may even stem from the fact that the Bush family was instrumental in getting Moore's filmmaking career off the ground (read the story on Moore in the current - as of this writing - Rolling Stone). He now bites the hand that fed him, perhaps because he resents his indebtedness to them.To those of you who blindly accept what Moore says, learn to think for yourselves. Moore is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and he'll devour you and your pet causes, not George W. Bush.On top of all that, the film is shoddy. The guy can't make a competent film, yet he's an Oscar winning filmmaker. He's a mediocre writer, yet he's a bestselling author.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1UGZ8BTGDQ6YB	B-R-Mike M.	Farenheit 9/11 is a funny yet emotional and eye-opening film focusing on the Bush Adminastration's connection with Saudi-Arabia and their acts before and after the September 11th attacks. It's a gripping and involved satire that digs deeper than any other film that director Michael Moore has done. With media footage and file footage about Bush and others, the film covers a veriety of subjects, including the patriot act, Bush's past oil connections and others.Michael Moore does an amazing job of getting the facts to the view. Unlike his other films, Moore rarely appears on camera, letting the film clips and interviews speak for him. This let's the viewer get the full story, rather than just stare at some guy who is talking about Bush.The emotion is high in this movie. Graphic scenes of war-devastated cities in Iraq, a collection of scenes with a mother mourning over her sons death in war, and a thought provoking look at Iraq in the month leading up to America's attacks. However, there a comical parts, and the film has a satirical edge. From stealing a ice cream truck to read the patriot act to Congress or playing back a stupid remark that Bush had said.This film is genius. It's sad that it did not effect the election, but it is good to know that there are people like Michael Moore out there who still feel the need to change something. The braveness in this film and the unbelievable amounts of data collected in it's entirity make it a film like no other. A film that not only is based on facts, but based on human emotions. I recommend this film to anyone who loves films. It is a masterpiece and is definately one of the best movies of 2004.	5.0	Genius Film That Should've Helped Election	2004-11-13	27	15	12

The facts have been checked scrupulously by Moore and a team of fact checkers and attorneys.  And boy are the facts damning.Farenheit blew me away. I laughed, I cried and I cursed.  I walked out of the movie theatre and my whole body was tingling.  The movie is a courageous exposee of what corporate America does not want all of us to see.  Moore brilliantly shows how corporations and the rich congressmen who answer to them, are willing to shove our country into war to increase their profit margin.  This movie is more than an indictment of Bush, it is an indictment of a system which would allow Bush and Congress to lie to us and lead us half the way around the world to line the pockets of the wealthy.Michael Moore is a courageous hero of the lower and middle classes.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1CKZ7AXPIJYZ5	Brownthing	I watched this film last night, and having sympathy with many of Michael Moores views, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was in the end a little dissapointed. I felt the movie would have had a much stronger impact had it adopted a more neutral tone.Michael Moore's self-righteous pushing of his own agenda quickly became irritating, clouding many of the issue's he raised. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of world events will have noticed him being economical with the truth (e.g. the omission of Britain from the coallition) with the sole purpose of manipulating emotions. I found this a little rich considering his scathing attacks on the US government's fear promotion tactics.Nonetheless, this is an important film. These issues needed to be raised, it's just a shame a greater focus was'nt place on the facts in hand rather than Moore's own anger.	3.0	Wasted opportunity	2005-01-28	0	0	0
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1NPNGWBVD9AK3	"Bruce Kendall ""BEK"""	I had high expectations for this film. Winner of the prestigious Palm d'or at Cannes. Widely praised, even begrudgingly so by some reviewers from a traditionally right wing perspective. Good word of mouth from some fellow reviewers for whom I have great respect. Too bad it didn't really deliver.I give it a middle of the road rating, because I found the film about half enjoyable. It's very well edited and generally moves at an excellent pace. There are some truly funny bits, especially the montages of Bush and his cabinet getting made up for various televesion appearances. Attorney General Ashcroft serenading the faithful is not to be missed. The usual assortment of Bushisms and the now infamous 7 minute scene of The Commander in Chief sitting with the kiddies after being informed of the second tower being hit. Moore hits the mark there.At other times, he misses the target completely. The segment in the ice cream truck was funny for about ten seconds, then nada. The bushwacking (pardon the pun) of the Republican Congressmen outside the capital was simply a concept whose outcome was predetermined. That Moore actually got any politician from the right to stop and speak to him speaks well only of those who were brave enough to engage him. It was a cloyingly empty exercise on his part. Which strikes to the heart of the matter of my problem with Moore. True, he acknowledges his bias, as if that alone were enough to get him off the hook in regards to presenting us with a &quot;realistic&quot; viewpoint. I don't expect objectivity from a documentary filmmaker, but I do expect a slightly less corrupted presentation. For instance, when he first inteviews the mom in Flint, MI who acts as a thread for his anti-war stance, it's obvious that she doesn't know of Moore's muckraking history. He basically nods in agreement when she delivers her views about the military and how proud she is of her family's collective contribution to the Armed Forces. He doesn't give her any hint that he has a hidden agenda. Then later in the film, he comes very close to exploiting the poor woman when she learns that her only son has been killed in Iraq. Moore has become infamous for this tactic (playing both sides of the fence, as when he pretended to be a gun lover in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE).I also don't think Moore is half so funny or clever as he thinks he is. One half hour of THE DAILY SHOW with John Stewart delivers more laughs and more finely wrought political satire than does two hours here.There are definitely quite a few things that Moore gets right, however. The slow motion photography of the rain of paper after the collapse of the twin towers was very moving, as was the accompanying soundtrack. The brutal, graphic war footage is something every voting American should see. Many won't want to and never will, but there is no way one can idealize the carnage of war after viewing those images.On the whole, Moore does succeed in his indictement of the Bush administration and its single minded pursuit of regime change in Iraq at any cost. I can't say that he taught me anything I didn't already know before. I was hoping he would. Thus the disappointment. I still say it is a film that people should see, if only as a reminder of how far politics has sunk in this new millenium.BEK	3.0	A Bit Disappointing	2004-07-13	318	186	132
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3SOV9HFM5H9T1	Bruce P. Barten	The movie jumps around so much that it is hard to tell whose almighty dollars are actually getting stolen while this movie is being shown.  The little old ladies in the movie don't want to talk too much about the politics of war, always too disgusting to talk about, and who would want to be in a movie that doesn't talk about anything but bad Congressmen who don't read the bills they pass or put their own kids on the front line in Iraq?  Al Gore has his greatest movie appearance ever, actually officiating as President of the Senate while denying the Black Congresswomen the petition on a denial of voter's rights in a Joint Session of Congress because no Senator would sign the petition complaining that the right of blacks to vote had been denied in many districts.  People who think George W. Bush gets too much time on screen while the elementary class is reading MY PET GOAT the morning of September 11, 2001, ought to be thankful that Michael Moore didn't spend more time reading the PATRIOT Act or explaining why taking two cookies in a peace group meeting invites mass anarchy.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3JPFWKS83R49V	"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey"""	Michael Moore has made a name for himself as the consummate documentary director, creating many movies that present his take on a critical issue and that chronicle the moods of Americans and the world at the time. Fahrenheit 9/11 continues Moore's foray into political documentaries, this time focusing on the war against Iraq and the man who got us into the mess, George W. Bush.Moore spends most of this documentary talking about the war, but he begins the film with a presentation on the election of 2000 and how Republicans and their colleagues helped to rig the election in favor of Bush by purging minority groups from the voter roles in Florida. Then, he quickly shifts gears to the war itself, showing the president sitting in the Florida classroom as one of his aides whispers in his ear that the U.S. is under attack.What follows from there is Moore's attack on the president and his war, showing how Bush and his team manipulated facts and twisted the truth to get the American people to approve the war effort. Moore makes many personal attacks on Bush and he portrays the president as having a one- track mind and as being rather stupid. One of the major criticisms of this film is how it takes things out of context, and this does appear to be a valid complaint. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others are shown making quotes to the camera and sometimes, they are quoted out of context. Moore includes a quote when he needs one, to drive his points home, regardless of how the quote was originally intended.Where this documentary succeeds most is when it sticks to the facts. The parts that talk about the phony weapons of mass destruction claim and the use of fear to sell the war to the people are among the best in the documentary. Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is Moore's sarcastic wit. One of the funniest moments in the film comes when Moore decides to drive an ice cream truck around the U.S. Capital and read the provisions of the anti Patriot Act through a loudspeaker. He does this after learning (accurately) that most of the people in congress voted for this anti- liberty measure without even bothering to read it.Besides the quotes taken out of context and the attempts to make Bush look either like a complete fool or a cold, uncaring villain, there are a few other things I didn't care for. I didn't like the sidetracking by Moore, such as when he shows scenes of abandoned businesses and houses from his hometown of Flint, Michigan- similar to what was shown in his first documentary, Roger and Me. And I felt he got a little carried away with Lila Lipscomb and her concerns about young people going off to war. This adds some good drama to the film, but I would prefer if he stuck with the facts.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a pretty good documentary even though it's obviously one- sided and gives no opportunities for any opposing viewpoints. Many people are angered at Moore for making this documentary while others applaud his efforts with great enthusiasm. Whatever position you take, you should still take some time out to watch this documentary. It shows how a group of people can successfully manipulate the truth and then add a dose of fear to the equation to convince millions of people that armed conflict is necessary and moral.	4.0	We Gotta Get out of This Place	2004-11-29	18	13	5

It's Moore's opinions drawn from these facts that people can choose to believe or not.  Moore presents the Bath connection and the connection to the Saudi royal family to support his claims that Bush's loyalty to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens presents a strong conflict of interest in his dealings with terrorism pre and post 9/11.  Moore shows the way the military preys on the poor for recruiting.  He supports his claim that the terrorist threat to the US is not what the Bush administration would like you to believe by showing the lack of protection at most of our borders.  When he talks about the 2000 election Moore shows the connections Bush had in Florida that helped him block the recount.  He presents strong arguments supported by facts, which is more than what can be said about the president.

For all the death, destruction, and anger in the world today, it's easy to get caught up in a propaganda film like Fahrenheit 9/11 and place blame on the current president.Moore's anti-Bush / anti-American film is flawed in many aspects. I recommend watching the other propaganda film FahrenHYPE 9/11. In this film, they interview the soldiers and families that were used in Moore's movie. It is interesting to hear them talk about how most of the footage was used without authorization and edited to fit Moore's anti-message. Needless to say that they were angry that their words were edited into something that was never intended to be heard the way it was portrayed.Anyway, watch both films, and if you are at all intelligent, make your own mind up, don't rely on the Moore's of America to give creditable information. There is a lot out there that is easy to review. As bad is Bush is to some, look into Kerrys past and tell me he is a sure thing for a better replacement.

If you've read ""Dude, Where's My Country?"", then you will have a good idea of the content of Fahrenheit 911.  However, don't overlook the special features:  Condolezza's testimony before the 911 commision (Ms. Rice, what was the name of the PDB document?  Uh, I believe it was ""Bin Laden Determined to Attack within The United States"".---HILARIOUS!).  There is also some very eye-opening footage of Iraq before the war (looks a lot less like a hellhole than George would have us believe).

I went in a great supporter of Michael Moore - I own ALL of his books and DVDs, and I would count myself as a biased supporter IN HIS FAVOUR.  As such, my opinion of the film surprises me more than anyone.The film lost a lot of credibility when Mr Moore was listing the countries involved in the coalition of the willing.  Many small countries were named, but neither Australia nor England were mentioned.  An amazing oversight.Also, I was deeply offended by the way in which Saudi nationals were presented at the beginning of the film.  I am sure that Mr Moore would be amongst the very first to agree that not all Saudi people are criminals.  It is obviously absurd to even suggest such a thing.  And yet, during the film he seemed content to find any picture of a known political figure with a person wearing the Saudi national dress as an example of collusion.  I was not alone in seeing this as a very unbalanced portrayal.I went into the film a strong supporter.  I left with more questions than answers, and the knowledge that this is one DVD that I will not be buying.	2.0	I can't believe I am writing this....	2004-07-18	36	13	23

Alas, though, its focus was not only one-sided, but also ironic.  It condemed Bush as if he was the root of all evil, yet did nothing to report all the wrongdoings which have been done by some of America's greatest presidents.  Michael Moore simply has a beef with the world because his hometown of Flint is a welfare ridden town because the people there obviously cannot get jobs.  I do not really know why this is, but I can garantee you that if I lived in Flint I would see to it that I had a job and I would work my ass off just like I do now.  I think that the people in Flint need a lesson in hard work, and not a merely a scapegoat, that being the president.  Michael Moore is a liberal democrat who obviously has no true morals and probably never enters the door of a church.

I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about ""his base - also known as the haves and the have mores"". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think this is an important film and is worth viewing - just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top sometimes."	4.0	Good exploration of Iraq war...with  some over-the-top moments	2005-12-22	17	8	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A38VRS1WMQMALU	Captain Video	By far the most important episode in this film is the section where Bush, after being informed of the fact that the second tower had been hit by a plane, fails to carry out his duties as commander in chief for a crucial seven minutes. A competent commander in chief would have responded by politely excusing himself from the class and heading for the car in which he came in, which had a secure phone, and, while ordering the driver to head for Air Force One, using the phone to call the appropriate people in Washington and taking command of the situation.The film clearly shows that instead he sat there clueless for seven crucial minutes, while the students were reading The Pet Goat to him, not knowing what other terrorist attacks were in the process of happening, and while, in fact, two more hijacked planes were headed for Washington. This is not the way Bill Clinton would have responded, nor for that matter Bush senior.If a uniformed general had failed to act like that, he would not only have been removed from command, but also court marshaled for dereliction of duty.Thank God that the Cold War was over and that we were not under a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union.This is a crucially important movie that all Americans should see because Bush's failure to carry out his responsibilities of commander in chief during these crucial minutes proves that he is not fit to be commander in chief. It makes a compelling case that the people must remove him from his command this November.	5.0	Film proves Bush unfit to be commander in chief	2004-09-06	52	44	8
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ANGRYXMUEVCHT	Carl Hoffman	Let me repeat an obvious insight of several other reviewers: If FAHRENHEIT 9/11 misstates any facts, Michael Moore is open to being sued. He has a seriously-vested interest in getting his facts straight, because there are probably a thousand conservative lawyers with ten million conservative dollars who'd love to nail his butt to the wall. As you read this, they are probably eagerly viewing and re-viewing F 9/11 for grounds for legal action. If they don't file suits--and right now it's four weeks and counting--it means they couldn't find any misstatements. In short, if there are no lawsuits, the right wing can engage in all the smear tactics it wants--but MOORE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.Stay tuned to Fox News; that's where you'll first hear about any lawsuits. On the other hand, I suspect it's going to be a long wait.Here are some of the points Moore makes, which are undisputed by anyone who has read the newspapers for the last 3 years with an open mind:1. With a full recount, Gore would have won the state of Florida, hence the 2000 election. Right-wing pressure tactics extending up to the Supreme Court prevented a full recount.2. There were unprecedented, large-scale protests at GWB's inauguration. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus attempted to keep the &quot;election&quot; from being certified by the Senate based on the egregious disenfranchisement of minority voters in Florida, but could not find any support in the Senate.3. The Bush administration had warnings about the 9/11 attacks and chose to ignore them.4. The President George W. Bush is an inarticulate man who spends a lot of time on vacation. On the other hand, he sometimes projects a warm persona to voters.5. He's also a privileged rich boy who has been bailed out of every mess he's ever made in his life, and there have been a lot of them.6. He doesn't like being questioned about his motives and policies, and he can be sarcastic and defensive in response.7. Pres. Bush and his highest advisors lied to justify the invasion of Iraq.8. The president's family and VP Cheney are neck-deep in financial ties and dealing with the Bin Laden family and with corporations which stand to make huge profits from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.9. Like all wars, Iraq has led to the death and brutalization of innocents caught in the crossfire. These include U.S. soldiers.10. Bush refers to the richest people in the U.S., the elite, as &quot;my base,&quot; and rules in their interest.11. In contrast, the servicemen and women who are actually fighting in the Muslim world tend to hail from impoverished communities which have been on the receiving end of the president's economic policies.12. The supposedly &quot;liberal TV news&quot; (I don't know whether to laugh or gag when I hear that phrase) have done an atrocious job of covering the truth about Bush.13. There's a lot more, but the above are highlights.Parts of the film are funny. Moore has the satirical propaganda skills of Rush Limbaugh, along with far greater respect for the facts. Some of the film lags, especially if you've been reading the newspapers.But mostly it's sad, the saddest film of the 21st century to date, because so many Americans think so highly of this disastrous president, and display such hostility to fellow Americans.For me, the saddest and most terrible moment of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 comes when gold-star mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son was killed in Iraq, journeys to Washington and is confronted by a Bush supporter near the White House. Without bothering to talk to Ms. Lipscomb or learn her story, the conservative woman angrily asserts, &quot;This is all staged.&quot; That's what's happening in our country today. Half of it is confronting the other half because they simply refuse to believe the clear misgovernment of an administration whose policies from Iraq to the economy to the deficit to the environment have been one disaster after another. In this election year, we Americans have to face an obvious fact: George W. Bush is incompetent, or worse.Just remember that he once said with a straight face, &quot;I'm a uniter, not a divider,&quot; and keep listening for the next lie.	5.0	The Saddest Film of the Year	2004-07-22	15	12	3

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A27U11OYELOTEX	Carlos Nazario	Whether or not you like Michael Moore (I do not agree with all he believes), you must admit he was very brave in making this documentary. This is patriotism at its best! To describe the President as he does and document all his charges for the entire world to see, is just incredible. A number of people say that when we are at war we just just follow the White House words faithfully, to stand beside our President. Well, what if he is wrong, should we all go down with him? Moore has been vocal with his objection to this war when it was at the height of its popularity. Now more people are seeing what this wae is about.Some say he is putting up half-truths and outright lies and does not document something that does not support his view. For example, that he did not show the Senator who had a relative in the war. He did mention in the movie that all but one of the Senators he tried to petition did not have kids in the war. He says that Bush spent his first days in office leading to 9/11 (42% of the time)on vacation. He showed a clip of Bush talking tough and then asking the reporters to check out his golf sweing. This coming from a man sending our young people to their deaths! He did not make that up. The way he documented the link between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens also is not made up. How many people knew that the Bin Ladens were responsible for financing George W's first oil company? Also, which companies are the ones that are making a killing (pun intended) from this war. The Patriot Act, the single piece of document that could lead to the destruction of the American way of life (I am a banker and I know what this law allows the government to do).Moore asks if you are looking for someone who is responsible for a killing, who would be the first you would interview? The family, most likely. Why, then, were the Bin Ladens able to leave the country shortly after 9/11 when even the President's own father could not? They left without any questions asked of them.I believe that everyone, whether you agree with Moore or not, should see this film and then decide for themselves if this is a just war.	5.0	Patriotism At Its Best!!!	2004-07-01	19	10	9

I did not vote for Bush in 2000 and will emphatically not be voting for him in 2004.  This does not, however, make me like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" any better.Moore's movie is a repellent pseudo-documentary and a tragic lost opportunity.  What could have been an intelligent and witty film emerges instead as a sleazy hatchet job embodying all the journalistic ethics of a supermarket tabloid.  From the notorious fake ""news clipping"" (really a letter to the editor -- with a false date) to the deceptive editing to the continuous barrage of grossly misleading innuendos, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a masterpiece of distortion and con artistry worthy of Bush himself.Dave Kopel has put together a widely-read list of ""59 Deceits"" in Moore's ""documentary.""  Be sure to read the full version -- with extensive references -- at davekopel.com, not the brief PDF summary.  It's true that Kopel includes some minor and debatable points, but most of the complaints are fair -- and devastating.Moore's ""Factual Back-Up"" on his Web site (michaelmoore.com) is fascinating, in a perverse way.  He simply ignores many of the serious flaws noted by Kopel and others, while offering proof of other facts that no one has disputed.  Most amusing is his brazen audacity in citing references that actually *undermine* his position.  To defend his statement that ""Gore got the most votes in 2000,"" Moore quotes from articles entitled ""Recount Provides No Firm Answers"" and ""Review of Ballots Finds Bush's Win Would Have Endured Manual Recount.""  No kidding!  Check it out for yourself.Of course Moore falls back on selective quotation when necessary.  For example, no one disputes that Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush, but Moore conveniently omits the fact that CNN and CBS were the first to retract it for Gore.  Moore's ""Factual Back-Up"" is a jewel of misdirection; he simply omits the following key segment from page 15 of the CNN report he cites:""9:54 p.m.: The Decision Team recommends that CNN and CBS retract their Florida calls for Gore.  The two do so and are the first networks to retract ....""It is depressing to think that more people saw this trashy schlock on its opening weekend than will *ever* see Jhally and Earp's superb anti-Bush documentary ""Hijacking Catastrophe."""	2.0	Good intentions, sleazy filmmaking	2004-09-22	33	7	26

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2868CSEXTLJ01	CB	"In ""Farenheit 9/11,"" Michael Moore composed the finest, and to my knowledge the only, video documentary that explains the connections between the Bush Family and the House of Saud. While books have been written on this subject (such asHouse of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties) seeing this illustrated in motion picture form is exceptionally hard-hitting and visceral. Not only does Moore show how this deep relationship affects US domestic and foreign policy, he also goes into the relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. This partnership has been rather lucrative for both sides, and caused the Bush Whitehouse a bit of trouble after 9/11; for which they edited out several sections of the Congressional Report which many believed contained information on these partnerships.Moore then deftly weaves the Saud/Bush strain with the growing frustration and despair on the part of the American troops in Iraq shortly after Saddam's regime was toppled. Along this line, he profiles the story of Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier killed while serving in the invasion. Her story is powerful. In one scene she reads her son's last letter from Iraq, where he expresses anger at President Bush for putting he and fellow soldiers in that country. This was moving. The trials of this family no doubt reflect the turmoil of all families that have lost loved ones in battle. The various interviews Moore includes of soldiers in Iraq, and those who have returned wounded and are now at Walter Reed are enlightening. The youth of these soldiers is remarkable. They are kids in large part, and were inserted into a mission that required close, urban combat. The brutality of war hits the viewer in the face and will touch your heart.This documentary is the type of reporting Americans deserved to receive when these events were unfolding. Instead, major media outlets cheered the invasion of a sovereign country which had not attacked ours. Watching in hindsight, I'm amazed at our gullibility, and at the fact that voices of dissension were squelched and censored. Iraq is now a mess. A once stable country was turned inside out with wholesale slaughter, creating a power vacuum and sparking intra-Muslim violence throughout the region between various Sunni and Shia interests. This documentary is an earnest attempt to awaken Americans to this tragedy. The betrayal of trust by a government only interested in profits should be viewed by all.

Among the many facts that cause audience members to gasp when they see this film are:--The illegal manner in which the Bush team rigged the election in Florida largely by disenfranchising eligible Black Democrat voters.--The fact that the Bush family has done business with terrorists (namely the bin Laden family) for decades and treasonously allowed the bin Laden family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of September 11th , before other flights were allowed to resume and before the FBI could question them.--The fact that far from showing ""courage and leadership"" immediately after the attacks of September 11th, unelected President Bush sat in a class room for several minutes reading ""My Pet Goat"" to children with a stunned expression on his face.--The fact that the Bush regime manipulated legitimate fears of terror among the nation's citizens mostly with bizarre warnings and a meaningless color code system in order to force through a deeply unpopular right wing agenda of social and economic policies that are extremely harmful to all but the most wealthy Americans. Actually, in the long run these policies will destroy them too, they are just too short-sited to realize this.--The fact that not one congressional leader read the totalitarian provisions of the USAPATRIOT Act before voting for it. Not one.--The fact that the Bush regime abandoned all but the rhetoric behind the war on terror in order to pursue its pre-election dream of colonizing Iraq.--The fact that the situation is Iraq is a disaster. We are destroying peoples' lives, and randomly arresting and torturing people there. Our troops are getting killed and wounded in a war that is based exclusively on the lies of George W. Bush and on the aims of right wing zealots and oil companies.--The fact that American companies flagrantly admit that the war in Iraq is a colonial occupation from which they profit.--The fact that none of the children of war proponents ever have to risk their lives in this war, only the poor do.None of this is new of course to anyone who read political biographies and newspapers. The accomplishment of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that it captures a lot of publicly available information that has previously been relegated to the back pages of newspapers and brings it into our movie houses and living rooms so that even the most delusional of us can no longer pretend that the Bush Regime is legitimate and that it knows what it's doing."	5.0	Imperfect but sadly enough it's right on the money	2004-08-18	61	44	17

I am enraged as I listen right now to the news on CNN. Do you know what they say? Bush has won this 2004 election. You know what that means? It means that some southerners couldn't get their head on straight and now, we are stuck with this president for another miserable four years. The east coast gets the picture. New York gets the picture. Pennsylvania gets the picture. Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire gets the picture. Even our own capital of D.C. wants this terrible president and ignorant human being OUT OF OFFICE. But before this chaos ensued, Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11, a thoughtful documentary showing the people that couldn't already figure it out who W really is. He wants to please his daddy. He wants presidential fame. All he's doing right now is making a mess of things, and Moore showed us all Bush's treachery. Some people just can't figure themself out, and those people make up half the union. Basically, America, you made the wrong choice in 2004. You screwed up real bad. And you WILL pay. This powerful documentary only further proves my point. Senator Kerry, I support you, and your motives. You were my unanimous choice for president, along with millions of others who wanted you. You knew what you were doing. You would have bent America's twisted spiral into a straight line to success. Maybe if Bush hadn't stole the 2000 election, we wouldn't be in this boat anyway.	5.0	Finally Someone Shows What We Are All Thinking.	2004-11-03	40	11	29

My wife and I saw F9/11 at a local theater, and were pleased that we were turned away on the 5th night because it was still sold out.  We walked away elated, not frustrated.  When we finally saw the movie, it was very hard-hitting.  Information that was gathered from newsreel and public documents.  It's all there.  Moore uses a little bit of his schtick in D.C. trying toget Congressional offspring to sign up for Iraq, but all in all, he showed that the president and family are not forthcoming in most aspects of their lives.  The coverup of Halliburton and Saudi connections is very real and available.Hey! All of you naysayers, even if it's 90% or 80% true, which factcheckers were utilized to make SURE that it was not faulty information, then it's STILL a SCARY REALITY that our President could be sickenly outside of the public interest.	5.0	The Best!

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1709B3VNUMXQ	Cedric Richeson	This an award winning movie?  Oscar material?  Not even close.  Moore's movie is akin to made for tv fare.  I did laugh at the ice cream truck scene, but the appeals to pity, gratuitous gore, profanity, and utter dishonesty in editing make this movie rather tedious.  I do not share Mr. Moore's socialist politics, indeed I view him as anti-American.  However, in view of the ballyhooed press I expected a more compelling movie.  As a propagandist, Moore is at his best showing dead babies, maimed soldiers and grieving families, but sorrow needs no cinematic skill.  Moore dwells upon these negatives of war torn Iraq with a blind eye; indeed Moore's vision seems akin to that of a one-eyed cleric. His occasional touch of humor also lacks art, having the routineness and impact of an average late night tv joke.  As a documentary, the film fails completely.  The dozens of significant factual deceptions documented in depth by Kopel on the internet destroys the film's credibility.  Without credibility, the movie becomes high schoolish; a movie clipping montage strung together to provide images and words for Moore's peculiar story, which is decidedly different from the many stories from which the images were extracted.  You may choose to beleive Moore's conspiratorial tale or not, but I doubt that Moore will have much to do with that belief.  Moore exhibits no art in his craft and his work lacks both persuasion and power.	1.0	What were they smoking at Cannes?	2004-10-29	50	17	33

Here is the moment where we get the slow motion, heart-wrenching footage!  Now we have the ironic twist, and the witty voice-overs!Granted, there are a few issues that Moore brings up that warrent further analysis, like the massive Saudi investment in the US, and how it can create conflicts of interest among politicians.  But the moment the film starts getting interesting, it switches gears, and begins a long, hysterical, tirade against Bush and his Iraq policy.  There are long, long, sequences, without dialogue, in which we are shown exploded bombs, and weeping mothers.  I felt like I was watching something Joseph Goebbels put together.  Many of the ""facts"" are not even accurate.  The Saudi citizens in the US did not fly out under the flight ban -it was afterwards.  FOX News initially said that Gore had won Florida, not Bush, the list goes on and on.  The worst thing about it, is that Moore knows he is manipulating facts, and yet does so with impunity.I was also hoping for some humor.  I didn't find any.  I simply don't find Moore to be particularly funny.  He also has a poor speaking voice.  the next time he does a film, he should get an actor to read the script for him.The only reason this film won any awards is because of the politics behind it.

However, I have to say that I have never seen a movie use or misuse video clips to swing opinion.  I have seen several of the clips from his movie in their entire form ane have to say that his view and slant on them are entirely left wing.  The sad part is he has totally misrepresented them and has misused his liberty to express his opinion by turning truths into lies.  Anyone who believes this movie obviously does not do their own research and only believes what they hear on tv.  I would hope that people would combat their own ignorance by reading and researching instead of having to wait until they lose their jobs or means of supporting themselves due to a horrible president.  Anyone who would believe that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a real documentary instead of Michael Moore's opinion is someone who is too lazy to do one's own research on the facts.  Just go look up the facts.  Don't rely on people like Moore who only wants you to believe what he belives.  That is how communists act.  This is America.  Exercise your right to do your own research of the facts.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	"Conservative media pundits never tire of tarring their vague ""liberal"" opposition with charges of rabid passion which, when considering their own rhetoric, only proves that a sense of irony is no Bennettian virtue. Certainly, Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" will do nothing to deflate their claims--indeed, it will incite them further. But Moore would not have it any other way. Impassioned to say the least, and perhaps over-hyped, Moore's best film since ""Roger and Me"" is garnished with sarcastic and brutal juxtapositions, savvy and artful editing.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an extremely well-crafted editorial--or better yet, a screed (wholly in keeping with the tradition of the 18th & 19th century pamphleteers). But in all, it pontificates more than it devastates. It generates only so much smoke, stoking anticipation for a scorch-worthy fire that never really appears. Many will come to the film pre-loaded with a ready sense of outrage, of course, as if a mere clip of George W. Bush golfing is enough for cries of perfidy. While Moore does his best to paint the overall picture, the audience is encouraged to connect the dots further with a dozen I-got-ya affirmations."	4.0	Less Moore is more Moore	2004-06-29	13	3	10
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A37C28ZSZQA2SJ	CG	First, let me start this by stating that I don't agree with Bush's policies and I don't agree with the way he's handled the war in Iraq.So why don't I like this film? Although I agree with many of the things Moore says, I think Bush has done enough wrong that there is no need to state facts in a misleading fashion to criticize him.The film begins with slow motion footage of leading Republicans being prepared for interviews (make up application, hair styling, etc). What message is this supposed to send? Are we supposed to actually believe that Democrats don't wear makeup for TV, but Republican do? A similar montage could just as easily been put together of top Democrats. I feel these images were a cheap attempt to embarrass and humiliate people.Second, Moore discusses how much Saudi Arabia has invested in the US and how much leading Republicans have invested in the defense industry. I don't believe for one second that Saudia Arabia is investing significantly more in the US than the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, or any number of other countries are investing. I also don't believe that leading Democrats aren't investing in the defense industry. If there has been special treatment by the Bush administration for Saudis (which I think there probably has been), I don't think it is ANY different than Clinton, Bush Sr, or Reagan.I didn't find any &quot;new&quot; information in the section on Iraq, but maybe this is because I live in Germany and the German media (not to mention all of Europe) is highly critical of the war. Perhaps there are things that are reported here that are not reported by the US media, I can't comment on that.Next is the Coalition of the Willing; countries like Morocco, Iceland, etc, were listed, but Japan, South Korea, Poland, Spain, Italy, and the UK were not. They are (or were) not contributing as much to the war as the US, but they were the 6 biggest countries in the coalition when the war began, and they were not mentioned. Maybe it would have been more effective to discuss how almost all of these countries had a majority of the population against their involvement in the war. Wouldn't this have as much impact?While the death of US soldiers in Iraq is terrible and is tragic because they should never have been sent, I think it was pretty disgusting to spend 15 minutes following the mother of a fallen soldier around and spend less than 5 minutes on a montage of fallen Iraqis. Of course she is in pain and so are all Americans, but this is American self-centeredness on a grand scale and it is probably one of the biggest things Europeans criticize Americans for. The message it sent me was that American deaths mean more than Iraqi deaths. There are plenty of insurgents that are fighting, but for every dead US soldier, dozens of COMPLETELY innocent Iraqis have been killed. In addition to the American mother, why not follow an Iraqi mother around? The German and British media have many specials doing just that, documenting surviving family members trying (and failing) to receive compensation from the Coalition, compensation which is &quot;technically&quot; available.I also agree that America is living in a state of fear, but I don't think this is a conspiracy by the Bush administration. The media knows that fear gets ratings. The network news must compete with the cable news channels and the cable channels need 24 hours of programming. I think this state of fear is the media and not Bush. The same arguments were made in Bowling for Columbine, and this was for the most part describing the state of the media during Clinton's presidency.Overall, I thought that a film could be made with the same message and just as much impact without including the embarassing images and using statistics out of context. Bush has really damaged world opinion of the US and burned a lot of bridges in Europe. Maybe this film is only intended for an American audience, but for foreigners, I think it painted no better picture of Americans than Bush does. After all the media hype, I really expected more from Moore.	1.0	This film irritated me to no end...	2004-08-01	52	18	34

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ABN9MWPSML86	Charles John Gervasi	Fahrenheit 9/11 was better than I thought it would be.  I was afraid Moore would use most of the movie to poke fun at President Bush.  He clearly does criticize and make fun of the president, but the film goes way beyond that.It spells out clearly in a way everyone can understand the web of business relationships that the president's critics charge have tainted his handling of foreign policy.  It puts a face to the suffering of the families of the people killed in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.The movie is completely biased against President Bush, but it still is a valid documentary.  No one going into the movie should expect it to be unbiased.I can sort-of understand how right wing ideologues feel appalled to see a feature length film criticizing their point of view.  After all, I can't think of a mainstream film this critical of the left.  Rightwing ideas predominate other media, though, so I don't think rightwingers should be indignant about one movie showing the progressive point of view.This movie is a great rallying point for people who already disagree with the president.  It is not scholarly nor does it try to be.Progressives will get good laughs and some tears out of this movie.  Rightwingers will probably find the movie silly, and hopefully they will get a glimpse at how silly FOX News and other rightwing media seem to people who don't share their ideology.	5.0	It was as good as or better than Bowling for Columbine	2004-06-26	13	5	8

I found the comments of some of our soilders particularly frightening such as: ""We put a CD of Ozzfest in the speakers of the tank and shot anything that moved"" Wow nice Christian behavior! The footage of Iragi's being mown down by machine guns is also really disturbing; its not like TV violence, you are left with a lump in your throat that does not easily go away.Moore does a great job of showing how much money companies are making in Iraq; the real reason for the war, and we are left to ask"" what are the rest of us getting out of this conflict? We certainly are not safer.Perhaps the most important question the film raises is: Where are the rich kids???? Why are they not on the front lines? The Marine recruiters in the film said they would never go to the mall where the rich people shop to look for recruits, Why is that? This conflict is just about poor kids being forced to kill and be killed for the rich man's gold just like all wars have been.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1MNTSHWJ2C63L	"Chris H. Metzger ""melville10"""	For the individual who is well read and keeps up with current events, much of the content on this DVD will not come as a surprise. Moore's documentary argues that the Bush administration not only handled the terrorist attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon in an incompetent manner but that George W. Bush along with members of his family had ties with the individuals who were either directly or indirectly responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The film opens with the aftermath of the 2000 elections and moves on from there. Moore rehashes much of what was already reported on such as Dr. Rice's ignorance regarding the report on Bin Laden submitted to her a month before the attacks. He also rehashes former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke's interview on Good Morning America, after he quit his job, where Clarke elaborates on how the Bush administration was obsessed with linking Iraq and al-Qaida together when in fact no such link ever existed. There are some entertaining parts of the film such as the former phone worker who was questioned by the FBI at his apartment after calling Bush a derogatory name at his local gym which was overheard by another gym member. With the exception of the revelation of Bush's relationship to James R. Bath, much of this won't come as a surprise. If one wants a better in depth look into the 9/11 attacks I recommend picking up a copy of House of Bush-House of Saud by Craig Unger, Superpatriotism by Michael Parenti, and Forbidden Truth (two French authors) which elaborates in detail the U.S. government's early diplomatic relationship with the Taliban regarding establishing a pipeline. Also PBS Frontline put out two excellent specials, which may not be on DVD yet, entitled House of Saud (history of the U.S.--Saudi relationship up to 9/11) and The Man Who Knew which is the story of the late FBI agent John O'Neill and his attempts to foil the 9/11 attacks only to fail due in part to diplomatic red tape and an apathetic U.S. government.	2.0	Review of Fahrenheit 9/11	2006-01-13	15	8	7

Both parties are so far gone from normal Americans, it's high time we removed them both.That being said, this apparently is an important film, because people are talking and that is ultimately what every film hopes to achieve. Yet!! Remember something. Many of the antidotes and messages portrayed are products of keen editing and conjecture by a democrat. Films are illusions and Fahrenheit 9.11 is plain and simple propaganda.Because President Bush sat thinking in front of a classroom of children after being told of the attack on New York. We're supposed to believe there is something wrong with that? What is he Superman? Supposed to spring up and run out of the room? CHILDREN!! Would any normal person not think about how to carefully walk this line sitting in front of a classroom of children?  Yet, the movie spins a different tale, VOICED OVER by Michael Moore who TELLS US what Bush is THINKING!!Osama Bin Laden's family was flown out of the country despite all planes being grounded. What's the assumption here? How about looking at the real truth. Bin Laden's family denounced Osama long ago. They are peaceful people and after what happened, they feared for their lives, rightfully so. Besides, the FAA has since stated that there is no record of this flight or any other.Bush knows the Bin Laden family. So what? Wealthy people like the Bushs, the Bin Ladens, the Kerrys and the rest of our politicians make up about 2% of the worlds population. Is it so shocking and scandalous that they know each other?Politicians putting on makeup for the camera... uh... that's normal. Anybody who knows anything about T.V. would know that. Cheap shot.Another cheap shot was showing the video of the people of Iraq, playing and shopping before the war. Awful? Yes. Sad? Yes. War is awful, but I'm sure you could have seen the very same thing in Germany before WW2.  Was removing Hitler wrong?Is it wrong that security was guarding the Saudi Arabian embassy? Maybe if it were a tank, or a S.W.A.T. team, but one guy!!  Come on Michael!!Documentaries in their truest form are UNBIASED and tell us stories with CAMERA, not with VOICE OVER. Moore took his video and talked over it, inputting his own biased democratic opinion.Bush meeting with Al Queda before 9.11 is called a President's job. Presidents meet with all leaders and heads of states at various times for various reasons. Clinton had many cordial visits with Yassar Arafat, does that make him a member of Hamas?Ever heard the phrase: ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer""?Michael Moore took stock video of Bush and others in these meeting and subjectively inserted his own words.The best moments of the movie were when he let the camera speak for itself. Like when the politician admitted that they never read entire bills before passing them, or when he asked politicians about enlisting their sons. That's documentary film making!  Unfortunately, most of Fahrenheit 9.11 is Michael Moore voice over propaganda.A true documentary would have also told the story of the Priest and his congregation that went to Iraq to protest before everything happened. When he got there, he was faced with an onslaught of Iraqi's who told him gruesome stories of the things that Saddam had done to the people of Iraq, and they wanted to know when we were coming to remove him. He promptly returned to the U.S. with a publicly changed mind.Moore proved something though. The power of film is great. You can show images and voice over nearly an entire film with your opinions and many many people will believe everything you say.In my opinion, treat 9.11 like today's biased network newscasts. Make sure you know which network your watching and don't believe everything you hear.If you truly want to get a view of the FACTS behind Fahrenheit 9.11, watch it, but also watch FahrenHYPE 9.11.

Both parties are guilty of these things and if you think otherwise... YOU'RE A FOOL.I was sort of a fan of Michael Moore before 9.11. But, after watching this, I have lost all respect for him. He has ABUSED his power, disgraced our military and has at numerous times in this film, lied about things to suit his agenda, or maybe JUST DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK, and that to me is irresponsible and unforgiveable.Moore should be excited about one thing though, apparently Osama Bin Laden has now seen his movie... and has given it two thumbs up."	2.0	Documentary with VOICE OVER bias and KEEN EDITING	2004-10-12	60	33	27

So are Billy O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and the divorced druggie Rush Limbaugh. The simple fact of the matter is documentaries are supposed to have a POV (point of view to you red staters). Moore's bias is evident. He despises an American family who kowtows to Saudi oil interests and pretends otherwise. He is offended by backbenching Congressmen and women who give this family the authorization to send other people's kids off to die for these family interests. He is angry that this family's thugs, hired hands and relatives stole an election the Fredo of the family lost. He is upset that innocents are being killed in the name of freedom (yeah well at least you died from an American bomb and not Saddam's heavy hand).

He doesn't hide that he's liberal and not a Bush-lover, but he also didn't interview himself for two hours.  Moore has a lot of credible interviewees and tons of footage of Bush past and present [some of the scariest being the 7 minutes of indecision at the elementary school in Florida on 9/11--you can see his head kind of rocking back and forth], questionable activities by the Secret Service, a meeting of corporate cronies who stand to make millions if not billions off of the war in Iraq, and families whose lives are destroyed by the Iraq war, to name just a little of what's shown.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AENI3U0Z7UJBH	Christine Lee	Michael Moore is the type of man who has his fair share of detractors as well as supporters, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie.The film begins with footage of jubilant Democrats celebrating what they believe to be the victory of Al Gore as the new President of the United States of America, but alas, that happiness is short-lived with the startling news that, in fact, GEORGE W BUSH IS THE NEW PRESIDENT!How did this debacle happen? How could a spoilt, over grown child like George W Bush possibly succeed the intelligent and sophisticated President Clinton as President of the most powerful nation in the world? Simple, get your brother and some of your Daddy's friends help you cheat on the vote recount in the state of Florida, where your brother happens to be the governor, and convince Dad's friends in the Supreme Court to rule in your favour in spite of glaring oversights, and blatant evidence of voter tampering.Cut straight to the blackest day in the history of the 21st century, and we see footage showing that on the day the Twin Towers were destroyed, George was visiting a primary school to read with the kids (assuming the man had the intelligence to read as well as the kids!). And while the nation was in a state of sheer naked panic, George just sits there in the classroom and barely blinks an eye.The second half of the film then concentrates on the Iraqi battleground, and the very human cost of war. The most poignant moment of the film is Lila Lipscombe reading the last letter her son wrote her from the Iraqi field before he was killed in action. He tells her that he and the other troops don't know why they are there, they don't want to be there, they all just want to come home to their families.But perhaps the most galling aspect of this film, second to the gruesome images from Iraq, are the existence of a business relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. The implication being that this war on Iraq was instigated in order for Bush and co. to make millions (billions?!), but all at the expense of 3000 innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001.Many detractors have gone for the juggular, and accused Moore of fabricating many facts, some going as far as accusing Moore of telling outrageous lies. But prior to seeing this film I read several books regarding this subject, one of them was 'September 11' by Noam Chomsky, 'Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq' by Christopher Scheer, Robert Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudry just to name a few. These books had already exposed Bush for the sycophantic bully that he is.And yes, I for one hope that he falls flat on his arse by losing the next election.For anyone out there who was skeptical about the connection between Al_queda and Saddam, or if you wondered how did it go that Osama Bin Laden was deemed responsible for September 11, and yet somehow, Bush suddenly declared war on Iraq WATCH THIS MOVIE.Just a point of interest, the Bush administration claimed there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and the Al-Queda group based on the fact that Mohamed Atta (one of the leading hijackers) was in Prague the same time an Iraqi official was visiting the city of Prague. There were several claims that they held a meeting, but oddly enough, the 'sources' which claimed that they spoke at length were untraceable to all. And there has never been any evidence that the two men ever met, only that they were in the same city at the same time.So, like I said, watch this movie yourself, and decide whether or not the real axis of evil (Bush, Blair and Howard) deserve to win their respective elections or not.Another four years? More like another 6 weeks for Bush.	4.0	The Awful Truth, the sequel	2004-09-24	20	16	4

What this film did for me was show me with supportive facts how our president is much more inclined towards accruing power and money for himself over peace and fairness for the rest of us.This film was a shock to my system... not because of any one thing I hadn't heard necessarily or couldn't deduce from a pattern of slimy practices (on behalf of said president), but from a well-done montage of the whole (including daddy-president's avarice) from Michael Moore's thought-provoking and courageous commitment to the truth.Seeing the damage this President (I happen to have an aversion to his name; I think you understand) and his daddy have inflicted upon the poorest of this country makes me furious. When the military is  looked at as the only upwardly mobile occupation in your area (poor Lila Lispscomb) then we have real problems (I served in the military so I know). And when we have a tyrannical commander in thief who is all too eager to endanger American boys for fattening his pocketbook (how THIS president is not impeached for lying to us about WMD and a former president IS impeached for lying about some cum-stains is beyond me) and then strip away more of our hard-fought freedoms with the so-called ""Patriot Act"" is just maddening beyond desription. Could someone please explain to me the difference between what Saddam did to Kuwait and what we did to Iraq? Please?!I came away from this film feeling angry at first (yes, even more than I am now) and then very sad for so many Americans who deserve better than watching their children try to make it out of ""slums"" only to become more fresh meat for the military.I'm afraid another four years with this president the American dream will be turned into even more of a night-mare for folks who are running out of options just to survive...never-mind the steeper slope this country now finds itself moving towards... a Totalitarian regime.And where's our media in all of this?

I highly recommend going to see this movie, even though like most of us, you already have your mind made up about the issues that it addresses. He did a good job of expressing the feelings of most people about the events before and after 911. Here are a few strengths and weaknesses:Strength: People were quiet during most of this movie. But it was wonderful when people would just start clapping, like when the solider said that if he was asked to return to Iraq, he would refuse, because he couldn't stand to kill poor and innocent people to make Bush rich. That was beautifulWeakness: The tone was too satirical, too funny, I know no one wants to be bored at the theater, but these are somber issues, not funny ones.Strength: He obviously spent a great deal of time researching for this movie. It was very comprehensive, he reminded us that we did not infact elect Bush, he showed us documents that link Bush to the Bin Laden family, etc. He left few stones unturned.Weakness: Not enough attention to the suffering of Iraqis. I know that Moore knows his audience, and they are more interested in seeing how their tax dollars are being wasted to make a few millionaires richer, but to me the real issue at hand here is the unjustified and brutal suffering imposed on the people of Iraq.	5.0	Had to be told, but could be more powerful.	2004-06-27	13	5	8

It also meanders from point to point haphazardly.So why the four stars?  Because this is a fantastically entertaining movie.

With Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore presents his admittedly biased case against Bush and the war being waged in Iraq. Unfortunately, when you're watching a Michael Moore film, you never know what to think because the only information you are privy to is presented to support his own views.Fahrenheit 9/11 is split up into basically two parts: the first is an indictment of President George W. Bush, the way he has run the country, and his motives for starting a war in Iraq; the second focuses on the people fighting the war, and is easily the better piece of the film.Moore makes the case that the presidential election of 2000 was a sham because votes from racial minorities were not counted appropriately, and that had they been, Al Gore would have won the election. Regardless, we all know that Bush did win, and in August of 2001, he decided to take a rather long vacation, with which some in the country took issue. Bush didn't seem to be terribly serious about his job--until September 11, and we all know what happened then.What was our president doing when he heard the news that two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York? Reading to children in Florida. What did he do for seven full minutes after hearing this news? Absolutely nothing. Why? Well, this film provides us with some background, linking the Bin Laden family with the Bush family through the oil industry, in which both families are major players. So, members of the Bin Laden clan were rounded up and flown out of the country immediately after the terrorist attacks on the WTC. Why?Fahrenheit 9/11 also accuses Bush of manufacturing the war in Iraq, claiming that he invented ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction in order to rally the American people behind the war effort, which was only for his own personal financial gain. Is this true? Who knows?So where does this film succeed? It succeeds in telling the story of Lila Lipscomb, a Flint, Michigan native who, when we first meet her, is a fervent military supporter, citing that the military helps young people who otherwise wouldn't have a chance to get education and travel the world. However, after her son is killed in combat in Iraq, Ms. Lipscomb becomes disillusioned, questioning why her son had to die, and what good it did for anybody.Moreso than in his other films, Michael Moore managed to stay off camera for a good part of Fahrenheit 9/11, though his voice is heard throughout in narration. When he is on the screen, he is usually grandstanding, like when he asks for Congressmen to enlist their own children in the military. A true documentarian observes and lets the audience make a judgment for themselves, but that is not Moore's M.O. He wants to present an impartial story, and he does, and I wish I could believe every word of it, but with Moore, you never really know.	3.0	Typical Moore - some provocative stuff surrounded by bias	2005-03-19	7	3	4

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2SARUOCCNPOMJ	"C. K. Lutman ""keith"""	"Definitely his best work. I was prepared for a weak ending, but he tied it up well (not gonna spoil it). Moore does a great job of presenting complex material, esp. the ties among the companies of the Bushes and the Saudis. Most of this material I already knew, but I had never seen the disturbing footage of Congressmen challenging the Bush ""election""/selection, while all 100 Senators left them hang out to dry. I also never saw the egging of the Presidentail motorcade at his inauguration.  The photos of the Bushes shaking hands with the Saudis were weak (every President has to do that). Some of the best footage came from daily soldiers' lives in Iraq.Moore puts together a cogent, tightly constructed argument and supports it well with publicly available video and documents, and surprisingly little of his own invective. He lets the facts speak for themselves, facts any person can verify later.  Well done, Michael. Thank you.Can't wait for the DVD, which I hope includes the pile of stuff that you wanted to include, but had to cut in the interest of time."	5.0	Just saw it -- one of the best documentaries ever	2004-06-26	16	9	7
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AZ5250G2U795I	C. K. Ogi	If you begin this film with the undisputed knowledge that Michael Moore has an agenda, and that agenda is hating Bush and getting him out, then you should be prepped to watch this with the appropriate amount of judgement necessary to weigh the facts/opinions he lays out.A film with an unapoloagetic agenda, I do have to appreciate.  Moore carefully lays out what appears to be very shady goings on in the post 9/11 America, and the Bush administration in general.  I will say that I found some of his arguments and fact gathering very intriquing.  Ya gotta give the man credit for dogged research.That being said, he is very selective about which facts he reveals, and how he lights them.  For instance...one segment has him talking to Secret Service agents guarding the Saudi embassy.  It would appear that the Saudi's are given special treatment by the secret service.  However...Moore fails to mention that ALL foreign embassies have assigned Secret Service agents.  There are several instances of selective fact statement, so I think it's important to remember that some of his more astounding 'black/white' angles do have decided shades of gray.What I appreciate about this film, and why I do recommend it, is because it sparked me to do my own fact finding and come to my own conclusion about the arguments displayed in the film.  It made me think, and actually motivated me to find out more about my government, and to help educate myself on my choice for president.  It's a welcome change when a film spurs action, and for that reason, I can recommend this...as long as one doesn't make the mistake of making Michael Moore's Bush administration one's own.	3.0	Well done documentary, but remember to bring your salt.	2004-08-18	28	18	10
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"I think the most important thing about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is: Some big ol' sloppy, public school-educated guy from Michigan didn't like something; he went out and made a movie about it and got people charged up.  Love it or hate it, that is America.  Love it or hate it, he can say what he wants and you can say what you want.The important thing, I think, is that people get motivated -- one way or the other -- by ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  Is this movie good journalism?  Good documentarianism?  Not really.  It's more of an op-ed piece and there are things here I agree with and there are things I don't agree with; it's a bit like a lecture you can't stop if you have questions.But the important thing people should take away from it is curiousity.  If you think Moore's facts are faulty, dig in and find out for certain.  If you think he's telling the absolute truth, let that motivate you to learn more and you may find your opinion shifting a little.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2HA9JM6BW0433	Clockwork Apple	"What goal? To get Bush voted out of office of course. After only about 15 minutes of the constant little conspiracies thrown in one after the other I started laughing and then began to wonder why this film was considered so provocative by so many people. All Moore did was show Bush doing something like playing golf, while making small remarks like, ""Isn't it about time you got to work George?"" Apparently GWB spent his first 8 months on the golf course?? Yes it is that silly. He remarked that it looked like GWB was going to be a lame duck president, lame duck after only after 8 months, are we kidding? Especially, after the huge division Gore created when he demanded a re-count after he lost the election. A re-count in only a select few democrat counties. I guess what they really meant was ""Let every democrat vote count and count and count and count!"" One more thing, which is worse a president that spends his time playing golf, or one who spends his time getting BJ's in the oval office, no wonder we had the first world trade center bombings, Oklahoma city bombing, Waco, Ruby Ridge, the pull out in Somalia, the massacre in Rwanda, the attack on the Cole, the US embassy attacks in Africa, held to the same standards, Clinton looks pretty pathetic.I also thought it was really funny that Moore actually believes the entire world was somehow influenced by FOX NEWS when announcing GWB president. Fox was not even considered much competition back in 2000, so why would any news network base their coverage on what Fox had reported? Especially since they are considered a really conservative slanted station, right? Does this make any sense? I guess everyone at CNN and MSNBC sit around and watch FOX news to determine what facts to report. If this were true they all should be removed from the air.Moore would also show columns from a newspaper written by some liberal and then stress that they are indeed fact. Almost all the people I saw interviewed had a book bashing Bush or was some other flaming liberal fanatic.What was the point of showing Bush and others in the administration getting ready for the camera with make-up artists, etc., etc. Are we to believe the every single democrat went on air after 9-11 looking like they did when they woke up in the morning. He also tried to insinuate that the footage was on sept. 11 right after the attacks. He did this by showing the date sept. 10 then immediately after showing the edited for liberals Sept. 11 footage (to liberals 9-11 was apparently just a few papers flying in the air, dust and some really upset people.) the film jumps right to members of the Bush administration getting ready for the camera, while the credits roll. How could they be so vain after what just happened?His constant attempt to make Bush look like an evil money grubbing, Saudi loving, oil corrupted, moron backfired and I found myself impressed by Bush even more than I already had been. This movie was just too much hype and it became a broken record really, really fast. Moore claims he loves this country, if he expressed this type of love to his wife would they still be married? Can you imagine if he made a movie about his wife by constantly bashing her and telling her how terrible she is and how messed up she is, and then giving no solution to the apparent problem? What Moore should of done instead was just filmed himself in front of the white house holding a sign that read ""I hate George W. Bush and America so much I can't stand it!"" He then could of simply went to the airport bought a plane ticket and left for France never to return."	1.0	Not a very well made film, boring and Moore did not even acheive his goal.	2005-07-26	77	42	35

Even if you only believe that a fraction of what Michael Moore has portrayed in Fahrenheit 9/11 to be based in fact, you will  realize the extent of the serious problems that currently exist in the running of our great nation and that changes must be made to protect ALL Americans.The first time I saw this film, I was in a suburban movie theater on a weekday afternoon.  The show was well attended by a very diverse crowd and the most amazing thing happened at the end of the film.  People actually stood in the aisles for several minutes and applauded the film as if it were a live performance.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"This is an astonishing film; it is astonishing because of Moore's courage to expose president Bush and his present cronies' blatant connection to corporate America, making loads of money from the spoils of the Iraqi war, (these connections are a matter of public record). It is sickening to realize that these so-called leaders are making a disgusting amount of money from the deaths of American boys and innocent Iraqi children. Further to this, the insidious method this administration applied through the media, the out-right propaganda, to justify attacking a sovereign country, spreading fear about terrorism and placing Iraq in the ""terrorist mix"", when Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction, nor are hiding terrorists and have done nothing to the American people, was blatant dishonesty and frightening in every sense of the word. The Bush family are connected to the bin Laden family, also public record. (Their business partners for goodness sake!) It is also public record that the only people allowed to fly, when the whole country was grounded and on red alert after 9'11, was the bin Laden family. Before the smoke even cleared after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York, the bin Laden family was high tailing out of town, with the approval from the Bush administration - also public record. It has been three years since 9'11, and the masterminds behind and responsible for this terrible act of terror, Osama bin Laden in particular, has never been brought to justice. Why? Have we forgotten about this man, is he no more a threat to us, or has he been conveniently swept under the rug, lost behind the smoke of the (unnecessary) Iraq war? The answer to this question is a simple one: money, lots of money, and its Saudi Arabian money.Australians were lied to as well. Our media has never really taken our prime minister to task about Iraq. The only reason, the main reason, our prime minister sent Australian troops to Iraq was the threat of WMD'S. Well there were never any weapons, but our politicians, like Las Vegas magicians, divert our attention with one hand, while doing something else in the other - slight of hand. Our media should be ashamed of themselves, because journalism is no more about truth but about pushing the party line. People are dieing and those at the top are making millions and the media continue to focus our attentions away from this ghastly reality. Sadly, however, looking at the election results, we continue to buy the lies, hook, line and sinker.Michael Moore had an obvious agenda when making this film. Although his filmmaking style can come across as ""biased"", too one sided, the bottom line is that the facts speak for themselves. Our mainstream media are in business to make money and not to expose the truth. So it is fortunate we have individuals like Michael Moore who care enough and have the courage to tell the real story or at least point out the red flags that continue to pop up in this whole mess.This is a confronting film and one everyone should see."	4.0	It's about money...	2004-12-24	25	10	15

As it were, Moore uses a twisted premise (Bush is evil and he is worse than any terrorist) and takes the audience through his ""logic"" in hopes of having them arrive at the same conclusion. The problem with this movie that it leaves out too many fact to justify Moore's rediculous conjecture.Although he tries to convice us that we went to Afghanistan for an oil pipeline, he fails to see that after all this time, there is STILL NO PIPELINE and there are no plans to build one.His Halliburton conspiracyare also overdone. It's true that Halliburton was given a no-bid contract to help with oil operations in Iraq, but Bill Clinton gave Halliburton an identical no-bid contract to go into Bosnia and rebuilt the oil infrastructure there.He tries to connect the Bushes with the bin Ladens by showing that members of both families have investments in the Carlyle group. Once again, his attempt at logic falls short. In fact, one of the largest investors in the Carlyle group is George Soros, who is one of the major backers of MoveOn.Org, an avowed enemy of the Bush administration.All in all, Moore's attempt to convince us that Bush is evil just comes off as too emotional and not cerebral enough."	1.0	Full of half-truths and lies.

Michael Moore is not one of them. Long before it was fashionable, long before most of the country woke up and realized how harmful and unnecessary the Iraq war is, Michael Moore was a powerful (and often lone) voice that spoke truth to power.Fahrenheit 9/11 is not only a must-see film because of its relevance. It's also witty, engaging and very often funny. That Michael Moore manages to take such serious material and put it into a context that makes for a riveting documentary shows that, as a filmmaker, he's second to none.After Katrina, I heard a lot of people who tried to avoid blame for having voted for Bush saying that they didn't know, they couldn't imagine how bad he would be, they thought the was right about the war, blah, blah, blah. Well, screw them. Fahrenheit 9/11 was out there, proving beyond any doubt that emperor Bush has no clothes.

You people are afraid to feel emotion, to have compassion.I do not care what your bias is or what Moore's bias is (becasue yes I know he has one... that is how you make a f***ing documentary) because if you were not disturbed by the uncut images of war and death and hate in this film, you do not deserve to vote. And as a matter of fact, you are the people who should be on the front lines. If you are ignorant enough and full of such detest for human life that you cannot take in what this movie has to say, you are not an American in my eyes.Our Founding Fathers wanted a country of love and prosperity, peace and happiness. And most importantly, of intelligence and freedom. It was founded on the principle that we shall all accept one another for who we are and what we believe in, not to hate and try to destroy one another. Yes, our Fathers fought a war. But they fought that war for our freedom. And don't any of you try to hand me this crap that we are fighting for freedom now. If you did not appreciate this movie and feel that way about the war, you just are not paying attention.And for who ever it was that was talking about film editing and how he made pieces of the film look as if they were one, uncut piece, but in actuality, he manipulated the footage to just look that way so he could show only what he wanted to show: You are Stupid. And I HIGHLY doubt you went back and watched this film THAT carefully to notice such things. That remark is not only incorrect, but marks you as ignorant an unwilling to just accept some of the atrocities of life.Please, America, if you are truely patriotic, you will listen and see just what this film is talking about; this is patriotism at its finest. Grantid, you must take everything Michael Moore says with a grain of salt; of course he is going to be biased, because, as I said, that is how you make a documentary.Of course, you could look at my review and disregard it entierly, as I openly admit to hating the curent government and everything about it. And since I feel that way, then this is just a stupid liberal trying to play mind-tricks in order to get you to listen to what I have to say.

I pretty much see either a one-star review with a particularly right-wing rant or a five-star review with a leftist rant.  Unfortunately, I would be willing to bet that a lot of the one-star reviews came from people who did not watch the movive, and the five-star reviews came from people who did not pay too much attention to it.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentry that was compiled brilliantly.  Yes, there is a liberal spin on it.  It's Michael Moore, what do you expect?  If you get over it, you will learn quite a bit from this movie.  It is quite obvious when there is a slight distortion of stats; you can look past it.  The vast majority of the information in this movie is, in fact, true.  The conservative 'documentry' that was made in response to this movie, 'Fahrenhype 9/11', actually contains a lot less truth than this one.I really suggest that you put your politcal sentiments aside and enjoy this movie.  Watch it looking neither to bash the president or with such a closed mind that you won't accept any information as fact.  This is a critically acclaimed documentary for a reason: it was put together very well, and no one should question Michael Moore's skill at drawing the emotions he intended to draw.  Get over politics and learn something about current events.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is more informative than CNN or Fox News was during the past couple months.In short: if you're intelligent enough to look past the liberal bias and/or watch this movie with an open mind, I strongly suggest it.	4.0	The election's long over; Intellectuals should buy this DVD.	2004-12-15	27	20	7

To those who rant that this documentary is propaganda and anti-Bush, let me remind you that Mr. Moore uses network and archived footage aired nationally and internationally - there's no Hollywood staging. He is also practicing his civil liberties and Constitutional rights to criticize an administration that is violating those rights. The very rights that, supposedly, Bush paid lip service to when selling and fooling America into thinking that we needed to free the Iraquis and save us from the gloom and doom that would fall upon us ""any day now"" unless we got rid of Saddam.Mr. Moore's use of network news footage is brilliant and disturbing at the same time. It was very telling to see and hear some of our troops high on adrenalin rush, stating how ""cool"" it was to shoot 'em up while listening to loud music CDs inside the tanks - then later get their sobering statements after witnessing the damage they had done to innocent Iraqis. This, in itself, was worth watching.Yes, Mr. Moore omits some facts that all of us are now aware of (the 9/11 review papers were released after the documentary was finished) - and his personal opinions and views are quite obvious. But whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, a Green Party member, or an independent, you will walk away wondering whether the entire Bush administration thinks that we are all puppets and idiots who can be manipulated by spin masters.Watch this documentary and draw your own conclusions - but do not rely on someone else's views to deter you from it.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	Fahrenheit 9/11, by Michael Moore, is yet another example of a potentially talented artist taking the easy way out. There is no doubt that MM has few peers in agitprop, but he has become a magnificent filmmaker, as well. He understands how to truly manipulate an audience without resorting to the cheese of a Steven Spielberg. Evidence of this comes from the fact that the most bravura moment of his latest filmic screed against President George W. Bush comes not from the humanzee grins of our leader- especially in the 7 minutes of paralysis after being told of the attacks, nor the oafish military recruiters he follows about poor urban malls, nor even the distorted ethics of exploiting a grieving mother whose son has died in Iraq or trying to paint the Saddam-era Iraq as a place where carefree children flew kites & all was well- despite over a million bodies in mass graves over the 3 decades of his American-backed rule, but by NOT showing us a replay of the horrific fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11. He understands that the viewers memory of the event will be far more powerful than seeing it, again, for the umpteenth time.... On the + side, the film is at its best when it takes on its own- exposing the utter fallacy of the `liberal media' during the lead up to & during the war. Rather, Brokaw, Jennings, & co. are shown as the sycophantic corporate daisy-chainers they really are- not once calling the Bush Administration on its, now proven, bevy of lies about the war. Of course, given the recent death & apotheosis of &uuml;ber-moronic ex-President Ronald Reagan by the media, it's a shame many need MM to state the obvious. Another highpoint is the connection between the fact that it is Bush's American poor & uneducated fighting the Arab world's poor & uneducated- a fact of wars since their start.Instead of being a detailed journalistic `true documentary' Fahrenheit 9/11 is a disorganized mess of a film, however occasionally brilliant, that has only 1 unifying theme- a hatred for George W. Bush. As admirable as this may be in real life, it does not suffice in reel life. I suspect, though, that reel life is where MM prefers to reside, for their he can solipsistically sneer at the American public he repeatedly (& not wrongly, mind you) derides as being stupid, yet Sisyphanly attempts to sway, even though few of those who should see the film will, & those who do already agree with its tenets. A similar phenomenon occurred earlier this year when it was the Conservatives' turn to rail against what & who they hate with The Passion Of The Christ. Sadly, despite all the wisdom MM wishes to impart to the American people he fails to heed 1 of the oldest nostrums in the book: choose your enemies well, because that's who you'll most likely resemble. & from where I sit, that ain't pretty!	3.0	Good agitprop	2008-09-11	7	0	7

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A7EJERNB7IK3Z	CQ DX	This important 'film of our times' is not to be missed.  It is a scathing and mostly truthful view of this inept and foolish administration that is leading us down the wrong road in so many ways, domestically and internationally.  True patriotism is not a 'party dependent' concept.  Yet the right wing would have you think it is, as they feel they have the market cornered on patriotism, morality, and truth. Moore, like millions of Americans and people around the world, shows his patriotism, outrage, and concern throughout this masterpiece by exposing Bush for what he is.  Mainly, an arrogant, inept fool who uses 'god' to illegally invade another sovereign country based on WMD lies and the fear of terrorism brought to focus on 9/11.  Even though it was mostly Saudi nationals who attacked us that day, not Iraqis!  Most of the world believes that our retaliation in Afghanistan was a 'just war', whereas this Iraqi invasion was folly and wrong.  The geological areas that were hit on 9/11 (NY, PA, D.C.) even voted against Bush last November.  That says it all.  If you care about America, see this great, truthful patriotic film, or ignore it at your peril!  I have a lot of respect for Michael Moore's work, and his penchant and talent in exposing hard truths, which is in many cases the road less travelled these days in America.

Then quickly moves on to show that Bush took several vacations right after he took office.  Whoop-ty-doo!Then it talks for about fifteen minutes about 9/11 never showed pictures of the twin towers.Then it begins talking about how G.W. Bush is somehow in league with the Bin Ladin family.  Whoop-t-doo!  His family disclaimed him a long time before the attacks.Then he starts making accusations about Bush wanted war with Iraq from the beginning of his term in office.  Who cares?  Sadaam needed to be taken out long before then.And after seeing recent evidence they have found evidence of Weapons in Iraq.Then after this he starts talking to a FEW disgruntled soldiers and their families.  Now I have family in the military and the military people I have met think it is right that our forces are over there.I feel that this film could have been done soooooooooo much better if they had shown both sides of the argument and actually given sources for where to find there so called evidence for their accusations.  Now I'm sure some things in the film are true but for the most part this film was nothing more than a Bush-Bashing Festival led by a crazy Lunatic.Now on the good side Michael Moore did do a fairly decent job of incorporating the segments taken from the news and making some segments of this film fairly interesting.But Most of this film was total B.S.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2.0	Bush Bashing At It's Complete Worst!	2004-11-10	58	19	39

If you take a step back, Michael Moore has compiled a documentary that raises key questions and highlights current issues.  Wether you agree with him or not is your business, however as a documentary, this is well put together and extremely thought provoking.  It is compiled mostly from released documents, news segments and historical facts, some of which seem to be questionable to the population at large.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A6BNTSQTFVYIQ	Crix	Michael Moore has been called a traitor by conservatives for making this film, for them, anyone who questions Bush or his actions should be condemned or even jailed, as one reviewer suggested on this board.  Is it not an American's duty to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions?  If a president deceives the nation on such a grand scale as Bush has, is it not reasonable to call his fitness to serve into question?  Moore has been accused of hating America for recognizing the wrongs of our nation in films like Fahrenheit and his previous works.  By this logic, a parent who questions their child's wrong behavior and tries to convince them to correct it must be full of hatred towards their child.  Moore makes the films he does out of love for a nation that he hates to see being mislead, the young men and women unnecessarily being sent to die or be wounded, and the millions of hard workers in this nation being left behind while rich corporations make off like bandits.People have attacked the credibility of the film, yet give few, if any, specific examples of inaccuracies.  Every line of the film is backed up with sources that Moore has made available on his website and the companion book.  Even so, can anyone dispute the words coming out of Bush's mouth?  Did Moore hire the Tonight Show Bush look-alike to make Bush appear to say some of those ridiculous things?  Did he hire a talented makeup crew to make those Iraqi children look like their faces were scorched and limbs blown apart?  Did he hire a talented actress to give a convincing performance of a mother whose son was sent to his death in service to his country?  No, these are all real and unavoidable.This movie is a splash of cold water into the face of all Americans to wake up and realize the despicable campaign of fear and deception waged on this nation by the powers that be, to profit off the suffering and death of innocents and the sacrifice of our servicemen/women.  If America would care more about who occupies the Oval Office than who is the next American Idol, we wouldn't be stuck with this incompetent fool of a president, surrounded by his father's cronies calling the shots.

You will like or dislike it on a purely visceral level that has nothing to do with craftsmanship, writing, or sense. I happen to think that it contains many provable falsehoods, but so what? A film like this is not about convincing anybody with data.A great many people believe fiercely that every word of this film is the gospel truth, and even more that it contains enough truth to be thought provoking. There is a school of thought that believes that FDR knew about the Japanese plans to attack Perl Harbor well in advance, and deliberately sacrificed the men who died in that attack for a pretext to get into WW II. Director/writer Moore's film is the same kind of reasoning. It is possible to believe it, and some people probably always will.The Conservative Right has been attacking Moore as a fraud and a hatemonger over this film, and in doing so I think they go at least one level too far. Moore is an angry partisan of the Liberal Far Left, but he has not come completely loose of his wrapping. The truely pathetic Pearl Harbor plot  - mongers believe that FDR ordered the base left defenseless specifically to incite an attack. A similar position is taken by the deranged idiots who maintain that the 9/11 planes were flown by CIA dupes. Moore does not go that far.For myself, as a reader of Von Clauswitz and Machiavelli, I would be greatly conforted if I believed that Bush had plotted to get us into the war on terror, and to justify the invasion of Iraq. Both are clear necessities of statesmanship, if we are to live in a world that is not run by thugs in dish towels. It is periodically necessary to remind the barbarians how unpleasant it can be to annoy their betters. However, since I do not believe that Bush is that cleveer or far sighted, I must reluctantly conclude that Moore is full of dung.	1.0	You'll believe or disbelieve, depending on your politics	2004-07-12	38	9	29

Bush and the fictious war in Iraq. Little did anyone know but Moore was also offering a teaser of his next film, Fahrenheit 9/11, a scathing attack on Bush, his link to the rich Saudi oil families, the ""War on Terror"" and the war currently raging in Iraq.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Moore's documentary is that he puts a human face on the citizens of Iraq-something that the mainstream U.S. media has failed to do. He shows graphic footage of dead and maimed civilians killed by U.S. bombs and soldiers. He lets them speak and it becomes readily evident why many Iraqis hate America so much and why the mission to liberate them has so far failed. Moore also gives the U.S. soldiers a voice, interviewing several serving in Iraq and how some are clearly tired of fighting for people who don't want them there. Some soldiers who have come back home are also featured and they talk about their experiences and how their view of the war has changed. Moore also shows how the deaths of American soldiers have devastated their families with one woman in particular, Lila Lipscomb, whose story is quite compelling and resonates on a deeply emotional level.""Release of Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an 11-minute featurette on the film's reception at the Cannes Film Festival. There is also footage of long line-ups and sold out screenings as the film made its way through the country.""Eyewitness Account from Samarra, Iraq"" is an eyewitness account by Swedish journalist Urban Hamid on a U.S.-led raid in Samarra. There is incredible footage of U.S. soldiers arresting a man accused of funding insurgents that is narrated by Hamid himself.""Lila Lipscomb at Washington, D.C. Premiere"" features comments from the woman that Moore talked with in the documentary and whose son died in Iraq. She delivers an impassioned speech at the film's premiere.Finally, there are seven additional scenes of footage, including interviews with more average Iraqis on the streets of Baghdad on the eve of the 2003 U.S. invasion. Also included is more with Corporal Abdul Henderson and his experiences in Iraq and a very funny segment with Arab-American comedians doing routines about the ""War on Terror"" and how they are persecuted on a daily basis.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an incendiary zeitgeist movie that taps right into what is currently happening on our political landscape. It is an angry blast, a howling protest movie against a Presidency clearly out of touch with what is really going on. It is a brilliant film for these troubled times and is what every American, be they Democrat, Republican or undecided, should see before they vote in November."	5.0	A movie every American should see before they vote!	2004-10-05	227	165	62

Getting Bush out of the oval office, this coming November.Bowling for Columbine is mainly subjective and mainly about the discussion of how the 2nd amendment affects America as a whole and its consequences behind gun ownership. It did contain a morsel of Bush whacking, but that's it.Here, Michael Moore brought out all the big guns. From Bush's allegedly and dishonestly stolen the electoral votes from Al Gore, to the 9/11 tragedy, the follies of the Patriot Act and culminates in the debacle known as the Iraq War Part 2. Moore gnashes and chews his way to portray Bush as one big dumb Texan cowboy who hides behind his daddy's boots.Propaganda or not, Moore still present a credible situation in which Bush is absolutely the wrong man for the American presidency.The DVD itself is packed with extras. Even though, I didn't quite like the film itself (Yes, I consider this a film, not a documentary), it works more like a newsreel to me. However, the extras could prove to be interesting.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AZYJ9TS07B02W	Czinczar	Watching this, I was often reminded of the conspiracy theories I hear about on the radio shows of some Religious Right nut cases. The pattern is the same. Some very interesting facts and personal relationships which are normally obscured from the general public are brought to the forefront of our attention. Then, our host makes all sorts of cross connections between them to prove his pre-decided conclusions. Contrary evidence is ignored. Threadbare connections are given much more significance than they're due. Casual, incidental aquaintances are portrayed as tightly coordinated planners. Then, voila! You have a worldwide conspiracy out to dupe the public! Moore reminds us that the Religious Right don't have a monopoly on this sort of thinking. But there's a problem. You can't dismiss all of Moore's conclusions as paranoia. Some of them are true. But which, and how many? This is our puzzle. Moore brings up many facts that can't be ignored. They cry out to be connected. But which of these connections are valid? How much does it really fit together, and how much is wishful thinking? Moore does much of his connecting through emotional rhetoric and innuendo. Time and again, we must decide for ourselves how many of his links can be trusted. There's our task. As for the movie's over all style, it's typical Moore, which I happen to enjoy on a visceral level. He can still splice together very selective quotes and scenes to serve up a big helping of delicious irony. Many of his points are old liberal boilerplates. I don't need him to tell me that war is horrifically cruel to civilians, that the poor do the fighting and dieing, that certain groups and companies profit off war, and that W is a dimwit. And I certainly didn't need all those ugly extreme facial closeups. To show the Iraq war was unjustified, he uses the same arguments the anti-war people have been using for a year and a half. Not that they're wrong arguments. He just adds nothing new to the debate. The viewer's mind will not be changed after this. Still, all those facts .... It's time we sweep aside his implied connections and do our own connecting. There's still a chance he's right. This movie is a challenge to us all to investigate the facts, come to our own conclusions, and act on them. Don't ignore the challenge of this movie.	4.0	Connecting some interesting dots, Moore style	2004-06-28	14	6	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3C1BVDA2QOY1H	D. A., Moyer	Usually Micheal Moore's over the top style of documentaries alienate a lot of viewers but in the case of this work you have to get past that part.  The most telling clips of this film are not the graphic casualty scenes but rather the comparison of the difference in the stance of the Bush administration before and after 911.  Currently the administration has been forced to admit that Saddamm was incapable of manufacture of wepons of mass destruction since the mid 90s.  There are scenes that support that statement in this film from notably Colin Powell in 2000-early 2001.The casualty scenes are not gratuitous by any means, they definatly drive a point home.  One of the stated goals of the Iraqi War is to free the people and bring stability to the region.If you read that form of liberty to be American style of freedom then a keystone of that is due process of law.  Under the American system individuals are innocent untill proven guilty, so the argument that Saddam was guilty because he wanted weapons of mass destruction doesnt make sense.  Under our system you can want to do whatever you want but you are not guilty untill you actually do something.  As far as stability in the mideast, all that we have accomplished is to create a power vacuum in a society that has been developing along certain peramiters for thousands of years.  Make no mistake Saddam Hussain is a monster but he was a monster trapped in a bottle, he was no threat to us or anyone outise his borders.  Not only did we take him out of hs bottle but we broke that bottle so we have little control of events.The film is well directed even though it is heavy handed.  Perhaps Micheal believes that he needs a hammer to get peoples attention, well it is a workable solution in this case.	3.0	Generally not to my taste,but	2004-10-28	11	5	6

These include:Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, continuing to read with the children.

Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329.It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including:What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government?Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: ""At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections.""Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who &quot;was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth&quot; (WAMY), which the FBI has described as ""a suspected terrorist organization,"" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that ""has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush."""	5.0	The truth hurts at times	2004-08-06	93	78	15

It's hard to tell who was more worried about this rabidly anti-Bush film--conservatives who fear Moore's mudslinging will stick to the President, or liberals who fear that mainstream America will label his views as way out of bounds and associate them with Kerry.  Time magazine rightly observed that Moore's method incorporates equal parts comedy, tragedy, infiltration, confrontation, and speculation.	4.0	highest grossing documentary ever	2007-01-24	8	4	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1Z5C1DUJ2MXOJ	Daniel Biggins	"I find it incredible the sort of baseless criticism that is being thrown at this film. One reviewer labelled Mike as 'Blasphemous'. What is this? The Middle Ages? Are you going to start burning people at the stake for being Atheist next? Another reviewer called him a 'Trador'. I don't know what dictionary you use, but if you can't even spell 'Traitor' it shows how ill educated and ignorant some of the people who oppose this film are.Sitting at the bottom right hand corner of the world in cosy Australia, I cannot understand the American people and their fundamental lack of the ability to laugh at themselves. Your humor is generally poor (laughing at others misfortune, terrible catchphrases etc.), you don't understand Monty Python properly (members of Monty Python like Michael Palin are the first to admit this), in fact you're such backward rednecks that you can't even pronounce the word 'Python' (it's pronounced 'Pie-thin', not 'Pie-THON').Your health system is terrible, your education system is so bad that most of you don't even know where the countries you're bombing are.Michael Moore is simply pleaing for sanity, he hopes for a time when you elect intelligent people who want to let everyone have the right to a good education, healthcare and not get shot at by loons with assault weopons when they go shopping. I cannot understand how a man like George W Bush, a D-grade student, a born-again christian and a religious bigot could ever be elected for anything - let alone leader of the free world. For God's sake, he can't even string a sentence together.In case you hadn't noticed, since the ruskies went bankrupt from trying to build as many nukes as you, you now rule the world. Apart from a few third-world countries who hate your guts (with good reason), you are the supreme rulers of everything. If you really think you have the greatest democracy in the world, try to make your own country better, along with the rest of the world. Stop those corporations buying your politicians, elect people who say 'NO, I will not be bought!' At the very least let other countries and other people have their own opinions, stop all this ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" nonsense. Let people worship someone other than Jesus. Accept the fact that even though there are brutal dictatorships around the world and there always will be, bombing civilians in these countries will not change this. Sucessful Regime change comes through other means, look at India and South Africa, learn a little from history.Of coarse all of those who gave this film five stars already know how corrupt and rediculous your political system is. You have no leader of the opposition and no independent media. All you have is a supreme ruler, Someone who gets voted in by about 15% of you every four years and is never questioned by his people or the media or else they will be labelled as ""unpatriotic"".This film is a wakeup call and I think it is a historic milestone in your countries history. The unbelievable success and the huge proportion of Americans that went to see it is something to be celebrated. Michael Moore finally has the freedom to make any film he wants, he's got $200 million up his sleeve and I can't wait to see his future work and the work of film makers that are inspired by his example.Now you all know the truth, get out there and make your country and the world a better place!P.S. I realise this review wanders from the topic of the film, but heck! Some of the other reviews don't really stick much to the point, I don't think discussing Michael Moores gut size has a lot to do with this film either."	5.0	Whoa, these one star reviewers are nuts!!!	2004-09-23	39	30	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"Michael Moore knocks down nine out of ten pins for the thought-provoking, humorous, and ultimately disturbing Fahrenheit 9/11, a title influenced from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which books burn.  Well, this documentary is more a critique of the Bush presidency, beginning as it does with a prologue where Al Gore is poised to become the 43rd president, only to have victory snatched from him in Florida, and how Dubya became the winner of the most contested election since 1876.  What adds salt in the wound is how a series of minority representatives protested the ratification of Bush's election, only to be told to shut up by the president of the Senate, Gore himself!Indeed, what kind of president is one who when told of the World Trade Center, simply sits there for seven minutes reading My Pet Goat at a Florida elementary school?  Baaaa!  Or who says blatantly that is really helps having a father who's US president?  But what Moore presents is the dissonance between intelligence reports pre- and post-9/11.  In the former, a former acting FBI director tells a committee that Attorney General John Ashcroft did not want to hear anything about terrorist reports.  Saddam Hussein is also not considered a serious threat by National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.  And afterwards?The GOP has been criticized for standing for Gas Oil and Petroleum, and Moore's showing the Bush family and the Saudi oil elite conjoined at the hip gives credence to that acronym.  Others tied in oil companies include Hamid Karzai, who became Afghanistan's first post-Taliban leader, formerly associated with Unocal 76,  Dick Cheney, ex-CEO of Halliburton, but there are others Moore has omitted.As for the effects in this country, much is made of the Fresno for Peace group, who had their group infiltrated, but he doesn't adequately cover the ramifications of the PATRIOT Act enough.  What comes clear from Representative John McDermott (D-WA) is how fear (the red, orange alerts) and uncertainty is used to control people.  In one clip, Bush jokes how a dictatorship would be easier!!!!!!Moore's use of pop songs as backing for certain scenes range from hilarious to chilling.  An example of the latter is Papa Bush smiling and exchanges greetings with the Saudi sheiks, when R.E.M. and Kate Pierson chime in with ""Shiny Happy People,"" or the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" in scenes of Junior on vacation in Texas.  Anger-inducing is the Playstation/XBOX mentality the young soldiers in tanks have, requiring a song mirroring the situation while in Iraq made me angry.  Examples:  Drowning Pool's ""Let The Bodies Hit The Floor"" and the Bloodhound Gang's ""Fire Water Burn,"" with key lyrics ""we don't need no water let the mf burn.""Which leads to the conduct of the war in Iraq.  The Iraqi people never committed acts of terrorism against Americans, and yet the civilians are the casualties in a war supposed to liberate them.  One angry and grieving Iraqi woman says there has been five funerals because of the bombing.  Indeed, Moore's narration uses the word ""invaded"" in regards to Iraq.  The footage of burned and injured Iraqis is disturbing and horrific.  Yet the onset of attacks against US soldiers lead the soldiers to wonder what they are doing here, clueless to the fact that the Iraqi civilians didn't ask for them.  One Corporal Henderson, he is willing to risk prison rather than return, and even helps Moore trying to persuade Congressmen to get their children to serve in Iraq.Which leads to the rich/poor division in this country.  As in Vietnam and Desert Storm, it's the minorities in decrepit neighbourhoods like Moore's own Flint, Michigan that end up serving.  But disturbing effects are the Marine Mutt and Jeff pair who recruit African-American youth using a slick business-like sales pitch, and the amputees who have been abandoned due to Dubya's cutting veteran's benefits.  And who is benefiting from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq?  The American people or the oil companies?  As Bush says in one fundraiser, ""They call you the elite.  I call you my base.""I expected something controversial along the lines of Thierry Meyssan's L'Effroyable Imposture, but the fact that it wasn't tells how Moore was eschewing something inflammatory and wanted to present something that he wanted everyone to watch, and to reawaken moral and political consciences, for his base."	5.0	The degree at which truth burns and conscience awakens!	2004-07-07	39	24	15
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A289RB53PM6T55	Daniel Lee	"To start off this to me is Michael Moore's best film to date. Some people say he does it for the money and i disagree, he does it to show the other side of things that the press and the government don't want you to see. If you are someone who is undecided on who to vote for than you must see this film and even if you support bush or don't support bush this is a must see. In this film Michael Moore shows how this country went down hill ever since bush made it into office and how the war on terror is all just a war for oil. This movie will take you through ever emotion from sad to happy and everything in between. Some may not agree with what i have to say but I have one last thing to say and that is "" Clinton lied but nobody died!!!""  -Daniel Damnation"	5.0	Thank you Michael Moore for the TRUTH!!!!	2004-06-28	20	8	12
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3L32NBGS5Z4JT	Danielle	Michael Moore has never been secretive about his biases so the criticism of Fahrenheit 9/11 did not influence my decision to either see or not see the film.  I knew that it would be anti-Bush but I saw it with an open mind (although half expecting to be played with by Moore's clever but not always honest portrayal of what he sees as the truth).  I was impressed with the film because it does raise some interesting questions, and it did make me want to go out and verify some of Moore's claims independently.  On face value Moore's film is about exploring the (sometimes sinister) machinations of big business and big government.  However, I felt that above all that this was very personal for Moore.  Here is a man who is angry about the result of the 2000 election, shocked and saddened by the September 11th attacks and bitter about his government's response, in particular the war in Iraq.  And while it may sound trite, thank God we have the freedom to openly criticise and question the powers that be.	4.0	See it with an open mind	2004-08-24	9	6	3

It's just that good.Michael Moore's fourth full-length documentary feature starts with the 2000 Presidential election debacle, but quickly accelerates to September 11, 2001, where the attacks are handled with surprising sensitivity and grace.  The majority of the film, however, deals with the Bush/Saudi/bin Laden connections that may have complicated America's response to 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the backroom business deals that may have provoked both campaigns.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does pull a couple of punches - Moore does not discuss Honduras' pullout from the ""Coalition of the Willing"" because of John Negroponte's appointment as Iraq's US ambassador, and he doesn't target the apparent complicity of American media as much as some may have wanted.  Other than that, Moore hits the target with surprising and devastating force (and some well-placed humor) every time.This is a sobering indictment of the George W. Bush administration and a must-see for everyone on both sides of the political aisle.  Don't wait - see it today."	5.0	Quite possibly THE documentary film of 2004	2004-06-28	25	15	10

This should tip you off that the film is mostly a montage of speculation and political rants with very little of what I would call journalistic substance behind it.I was disappointed by the film simply because it didn't do a good enough job. Taking cheap shots at Dubya may make those who hate him cheer, but it is not particularly compelling for those of us who might actually be trying to remain objective.This is basically the same stuff you'll find on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh, just spun in the other direction. Is that helpful?Post-election, this film loses much of its immediacy.  I agree that Dubya should be out of office, but I seriously doubt Moore's film will change many minds either way. If you already loathe Dubya, you'll love this film. If you support him, you'll end up hating Moore more!All the bomb throwing and conspiracy theory spinning reduce the power of his case, reducing it to a joke skit you might see on ""The Daily Show"" or ""Saturday Night Live."" On that level it is fun, but again it lacks ultimate substance, and Jon Stewart does it better!It cannot be denied that there is plenty of fact-twisting and spinning here. I also found that there were NO ""revelations"" for me. I already knew all of these rumors and theories just by being a well-read citizen.I can only imagine that an uninformed viewer might come away thinking that the Bushes are the most corrupt politicians ever. Folks, the whole political system is corrupt...both parties. Politics breeds strange bedfellows and there is a whole lot of adultery going on. It's what Alexander Hamilton claimed made the system work.Yes, millions of Americans are angry with George W. Bush, and rightly so.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AMQT00IOE3SRH	Darren Hom	Moore's film makes some great jokes and touches the heart in many areas.  The problem is that he relies on these methods to make his point and not on careful analysis of evidence and well-constructed arguments.  He frequently takes Bush's words out of context, and not only those, but also the words of the other people whose interviews appeared in his movie.  Out of a wide variety of evidence, he selects the pieces of evidence that fit his point of view and presents only those.  A good example of this would be the frequent appeal to personal testimony to undergird his arguments, picking only the stories of those people who would agree with him anyway, without giving anyone with a different point of view any time to speak at all.  The voices of people who disagree with Bush's policies are given far more time in the movie than Bush's own words, which is a problem when one considers the fact that this is a movie about Bush.  We rarely see clips of Bush speaking more than a few words at a time, much less complete paragraphs; how are we supposed to understand what Bush is saying in each instance without understanding the context in which Bush originally spoke?  Instead of that context, Moore provides his own context and covers up his lack of scholarship with hilarious jokes and attacks on Bush's character.  Emotive appeals and ad hominem attacks like these are quite effective in convincing people to believe what you say, even if you have very little evidence for what you are saying.If you still aren't convinced, put yourself in the shoes of someone who wants to make a propaganda film supporting Bush.  Take Bush's opponents' words out of context and re-contextualize those words in funny and catchy ways to make THEM look like they have poor character.  Interview hundreds of people and then include only the interviews of the people who agree strongly with your point of view.  Make sure, at the end, that you have video clips of Saddam's soldiers committing horrible atrocities and laughing over their own crimes as if it's all a big joke.  (Be sure not to include the behavior of any soldiers who actually seem to conduct themselves in a moral way.)I'll buy this movie because I think it's important for my middle school students to understand the methods used in propaganda, hopefully so they can avoid them rather than practicing them.  And in the end, it does have the redeeming quality of being absolutely hilarious.	1.0	Moore could benefit from a class in logic	2004-10-18	71	29	42
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"Thank God Michael Moore is out there, speaking for the common man. Though this controversial documentary had a hard road making it to theaters, ""Farenheit 9/11"" has proved that Americans have had enough of the Dubyah Regime and are ready to move on (to the tune of 116 million dollars and counting!).  Bush and his far right conservative circle want to keep his ties to the Bin Laden family and to the Saudi's a secret but Moore and other's like him are determined, fortunately for the rest of us, to make sure that these truths see the light of day.  Republicans are gonna bash Moore for this direct hit on their moronic golden boy because they want to keep him in office four more years so the upper 1 percent of our country, the wealthiest, can continue to profit while the middle class shrinks to nothing and those at or below poverty level continue to grow.Moore, of course, is gonna be biased against this dictatorship, (whoops! I mean presidential administration), and opponents are quite willing to say he lies and creates propaganda against their beloved King George II in order to derail his bid for re-election.  Moore doesn't have to make up things or create propaganda for this film, Dubyah has given him more than enough ammunition---Bush has backed himself into a corner with his lies and outright deception on Iraq and our reasons for being there. Bush has done NOTHING to help our country, has only divided after a national tragedy should have brought us together and helped us stand together as a nation.  Bush has alienated us from the rest of the world although he gives us the impression that there are many nations behind us---a lie that Moore exposes with humor in the movie.The only thing I wish Moore would have touched on a bit more was Bush's use of the church and Christ as a banner he wears to, not only gain support for his ridiculous decisions, but also to explain his reasoning for making those decisions.  People I know vote for this man simply because he is anti-abortion and anti-same sex marriage----they give absolutely no regard to his complete annhilation of our relationship with the world community, the complete lack of interest in guarding our envirnoment and the blatant attack on our civil liberties and rights as American citizens.I'm proud to live in America and I am greatful that we are (for the time being) a country in which we can speak our minds without fear of harrassment or imprisonment.  America deserves a better president and our soldiers NEED a better Commander and Chief---one that won't send them into harm's way to suit his whims and his pathetic need to avenge his father's failure to catch a dictator a decade ago.  I hope that 9/11 is a film that will jolt American's awake from an apparent deep sleep that allowed this administration to steal our rights, send our young men and women to war without a real reason and give tax breaks that really didn't help any of us that really needed it.

They didn't see growth of the war machine. They would have probably asked why were fighting over oil. They never witnessed 9/11. Yet they understood that every generation has been through the Horrors of war. In that situation I think they asked some of the same questions, that Michael Moore did in his new Documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Of course the psalmist left us with a little more hope, ""Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling...Blessed are all who take refuge in him."" Whether you accept that, at least the thought of taking refuge in a sovereign God is more comforting then what Moore, on the other hand, leaves us with. Wallowing in despair, unable to move. I've seen the movie and while I think it brilliant I'm at a loss from what I should gleam from it.In late 2000 it seems the election was stolen away from Al Gore by the Fox News Channel. It also seems the Democratic Party did nothing about it. Millions of voters, and local representatives were upset. But no senator's would lend their aid to the disenfranchised voters of Florida. Bush became president, he went on vacation, the economy went to crap and then while the world was viscously attacked, our country bumpkin leader sat with a bunch of kindergarten children and read a book about a happy goat.I sum up Moore's early moments with much scarsam. Because I consider myself a moderate republican. I think Clinton was corrupt, just like Reagan was corrupt, like Carter was corrupt, and so on. I like George Bush as a president; I even for the most part understand the war in Iraq. Do I think it was necessary? Well no. But I do understand that before 9/11 every Democrat would hold Iraq over the Republican Party as the unfinished war. I remember countless arguments with friends saying ""how come we didn't get Saddam out of power?"" Do I also think that in the long run, 20 years from now Iraq will be a in better place? Yes. Do I have my problems with the Bush administration? Absolutely, yes!After all those questions I guess your probably asking? Did you like the movie? I whole heartily did. Just like I liked Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, and even The Big One. Fahrenheit 9/11 is moving, brilliantly cut together, and Moore's narration is sharp. No matter what anybody has to say about this film, you can't argue that this movie is compelling. Even if it's one giant fabrication, or a giant piece of propaganda, which I myself am not about to agree with or disagree with. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a well made, powerfully moving film, and does what every documentary strives do, it gets people talking.The movie makes you laugh, It horrifies you, it makes you cry, and it stirs a sense of social justice that I think is vital in this day and age. Sure, I could probably write a book about the holes in Moore's logic (I'm still convinced some speech or debate class in high school should look at everyone of his movies and count the number of argumentative fallacy's he breaks) but on the merits of a movie, you can't argue with how well made it is.Michael Moore has always had a keen sense of social justice that I loved. He tries to look out for the little guy. Many of the people he talks to are composites of you and me. I loved the little old lady who talks about Halliburton near the middle of the film. That little old women is the voice of the masses I think. She doesn't have that many facts, but she sure is passionate with the scraps of knowledge she's gleamed from CNN or Katie Couric.My qualms with the film are three- fold. The biggest is Moore's shaky creditability. Lets face it, the guy has been making things up since Roger and Me. Every one of his films has walked the line from creative retelling to outright lie. It taints every idea in the film. It makes a moderate voice like mine very skeptical. Unfortunately I haven't done the research to oppose his ideas, but at least I can distance myself from them while I watch.My other problem is that Moore lays things on a bit too thick as the film progresses. Things go from bleak to worse, as an American I was grasping for something. Near the end of the film I just wanted a solution, a suggestion, even a small iota of hope. Moore presents us with such a bleak picture. He asks probing questions, but you're left feeling like ""what the heck can I do."" Except succumb to the fact that Michael Moore is better person that I am. This is why I like what Solomon wrote and the second quote above. In the end it's all vanity. It all passes away. One day were fighting Iraq, the next there are allies in our ongoing war with some other country that ticks us off. People are fallen and evil at their core. It's why we don't get along. It why we cheat and steal, and the greatest man can be the world our biggest enemy.Thirdly, was the way Moore portrayed Muslims. It seems the best way to get his point across that the Saudi's are bad is by placing ominous music over pictures of Bush and his father in photo-ops with men in turbins. He also uses silly silent movie clips to make the point that the coalition of nations is made up of the US and small inconsequatil countries with backwards ideas. While their may be truth in the comments, using broad stereotypes was not the smartest idea.All in all Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11 is brilliant and bold. But will it sway voters? Probably not. This is a movie for those who agree with Moore, I don't think I will swing to many others. I would recommend anyone give it a try. You might just leave with a few ideas in your head and that's never a bad thing.***** Out of 5"	5.0	Brilliant and Watchable	2004-07-06	20	12	8
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"If anyone shall diss George W. Bush, this is the way to do it.  Michael Moore, one of the finest documentary filmmakers of today, produced, directed, and wrote ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", proving the truths of the last two years.  He takes his 2002 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Documentary Feature--""Bowling For Columbine""), which had some cheering fanaticly and some booing irately, into greater depths.  Few other filmmakers have dared to explore such subject matter.  This film has been highly praised by many critics and recommended by several celebrities including Madonna and Linda Ronstadt.This blunt, fearless filmmaker explores how this country and the military has been deceived by Bush, especially with the War In Iraq.  The featured documents, interviews, and archive film scenes help prove his point wonderfully.  Beyond that, he argues his subject matter beautifully.  The film starts with how Bush managed to slide into presidency in 2000, then shows his ""workmanship"".  Once the Twin Towers footage from 9/11 is featured, it begins growing into emotion and anger.  Moore brilliantly keeps audiences interested in every scene through his witty remarks, his interviews, and his personal reactions to every scene.  Through everything, he expresses his true compassion for this country, the people, and those highly affected by Bush's deception.This film features various celebrities: Britney Spears, Rick Martin, Ben Affleck, Stevie Wonder, and others.  The words of the politicians and the average US citizens also add to the personal film connection.  The various arguments prove various points that this country has.  This features how some have learned the true meaning of ""anti-war"".""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a must-watch film for every citizen, especially before the upcoming election.  This proves the truths of what has happened.  Republican, democrat, independant, pro-war, or anti-war: many are sure to react emotionally to this subject matter.  This is sure to be a big wake-up call for many viewers."	5.0	A Wake-Up Call For This Country	2004-10-09	9	5	4

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"What you think of this provocative documentary is bound to be colored by your opinion of Bush and the Iraq War.  In the interests of full disclosure, here's mine up front:  Bush is a failure as a president as well as a businessman; even if I approved of his domestic policy (which I don't), his hideous legacy in the Middle East, the consequences of which we will be dealing with for decades, would still tip the scales against him.That said, I enjoyed Michael Moore's expose, even though it is largely preaching to the choir in my case.  Beyond the extent of the links between the Bush clan and prominent Saudi business interests, there was little in this film that was new to me.  Although I basically agree with the points Moore makes, I recognize that he is often unfair in the way he juxtaposes images and uses his commentary to create context.  An example: Moore would have us believe that Bush might very well have been pondering the above-mentioned Saudi links while he sat stunned before Florida schoolchildren following the attacks on the Trade Center, although it seems doubtful to me that he had received enough information to make such connections.While ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" may not be as ""fair and balanced"" as the Fox News Channel (LOL), bear in mind that a documentary has no obligation to be.  Moore's film should be seen as a powerful polemic rather than dispassionate journalism; he cares deeply about his topic, and he is up front about where he stands on the issue.  Much of the criticism of him comes from anger and jealousy that he has touched upon a deep chord of anger toward Bush in this country by those on the right who are not above spinning facts themselves."	4.0	The 411 on 911	2004-10-23	33	17	16
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1906RZITWT2K2	"David Bradley ""David Bradley"""	Michael Moore has said he made Fahrenheit 9/11 to force Americans to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and the greater war on terrorism, both of which which he felt had been rubber-stamped by Congress and rushed past the American people.It is impossible to argue that he has not reached that goal. If nothing else, note that there are nearly 700 reviews of this DVD on Amazon two months before it is to be released.Whether or not you agree with Moore's politics, you have to agree that he makes powerful films. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in the theater about a month after it's release, when the Bush administration had had plenty of time to do all they could to discredit Moore and his film. The audience by then was small, but they CHEERED at the end of the movie.Fahrenheit 9/11 may be the best finger-in-the-eye-of-the-powerful you will ever see.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AAE2DUEMTR30I	DAVID BRYSON	This film is partly documentary in the ordinary sense, but it stands to reason that the documentary elements serve a larger objective, which is to ridicule and demean the 43rd President of the United States. The film is `satire' basically, in the sense that the magazine Private Eye, which has a certain international distribution, is satire. Its modus operandi is basically to select and highlight whatever will show up its subject in the most unfavourable way, and to bolster its selections with a cartoon treatment of the principal actors in the drama. As the work of a committed opponent of this president and this war it doesn't attempt `balance', and I'm at a complete loss as to why anyone ever expected it to. One doesn't expect a prosecuting counsel to show balance, and Moore is an advocate making a case.It's also in the nature of the case that the more anyone investigates and thinks about political situations the more unedifying details turn up. This puts supporters of this particular war in an awkward bind, because sooner or later they have to explain what their standard terminology actually means. Supporting the troops, for instance, might mean wishing them a safe return. On the other hand it might also mean wanting them to continue doing what they're doing, and anyone advocating that can reasonably expect to be asked why. Similarly, fighting for one's country might mean defending it from attack. However it's hardly reasonable to condemn Iraqis for doing exactly that on their own soil, or for simply disagreeing with the proposition that the intruders know what's best for them. Stressing the positive aspects of the operation would be a quagmire too, as someone doing that is liable to come across as a complete lickspittle doing Moore's job for him even better than he's done it himself. The clip from the actress whose solution is not to think about the issue at all but to give unswerving and unquestioning loyalty seemed to me perfectly fair and to the point, as that is precisely what many are doing in practice. The usual attempts to hitch patriotism to this dismal outlook only highlight its uncomfortable suggestion of Goebbels.By the time this film was made I expect most thinking people had long made up their own minds about it all - and indeed most unthinking people including the actress who believes that thinking is a bad idea. There are probably not many converts to be made, but there will be some, and this film can only encourage people to use their brains, however reluctantly. In the main it will entertain those who share Moore's basic outlook and enrage those who don't, and I imagine that is the general idea. I had done my own analysis of the issue ages ago, but I was still startled by the revelation of just how little legislation the US Congress actually even reads. If the issue were, say, drainage in rural communities, that might be bad enough. When it turns out to have been true of the Patriot Act it seems to me that those who routinely identify liberty with everything their country does need to wake up. All in all, the film is not quite my idea of a 5-star effort but it's a very effective rehash of familiar arguments whether one feels it really justifies the hype that has attended it or not.	4.0	LAMPOON	2004-07-13	20	13	7

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR	David E. Levine	"Remember the 1930s movie, ""Reefer Madness,"" which was made as a serious film to discourage marijuana use? That movie was so bad and so silly that it has actually become a classic. Before the election of 2004, I refused to see Fahrenheit 9/11. Since Fahrenheit 9/11 failed in it's objective to affect the election, it has sort of become a modern day ""Reefer Madness."" It is so ridiculous that it actually gets 3 stars for it's post election campiness value. The movie opens with a scene of little children happily and serenely playing and people happily going about their business in Sadaam Hussein's Iraq. This scene is abruptly broken up by scenes of war perpetrated by the ""bad guys"" .. the United States. Could you ever imagine pre Pearl Harbor opponents of World War II portraying Hitler's Germany as an idyllic place? But, then again, since the movie failed in it's objective, it is actually hlarious in that ""Reefer Madness"" sort of way.This dvd purports to be a documentary, Moore interviews members of the military and their families. The editing makes it appear that they are victims of Bush's policy and that they are against the war. This is deception and some of these same people are reinterviewed in Dick Morris' ""Farenhype 9/11."" These reinterviewed people are furious that they were deceived by Moore. They say that the interviews were edited to give an entirely different intention than what was meant. They feel decieved, used, and hurt. The teacher of the school where the President was speaking during the events of 9/11 is interviewed in ""Farenhype."" Although a Democrat, she is grateful for the way that the President conducted himself in the school that day. Moore seems to think that he should have caused some sort of panic among the children.Moore takes footage of the 2000 Al Smith Dinner, held each year in New York, in which Bush self deprecatingly refers to the wealthy attendees as ""his base"" and makes it seem Bush is an admittedly big business president. In fact, Gore was also at this dinner and the purpose of an appearence there is to make a humorous speech. Almost all political figures make themselves the butts of their own jokes at this dinner. However, these distortions don't make me angry because Bush won. So, now we have a new addition to kitschy movies that are so bad they are actually entertaining."	3.0	Reefer Madness	2005-03-01	22	10	12

Moore hates it when the Bush admin. acts on terror fears but whips up unrational fear for powers to investigate terror suspects in the same exact way as we have done for the last 20 years with drug cartels/smugglers/dealers. Riding around in an ice cream truck is the level of sophistication Moore uses.Also, he uses a grief stricken mother of a soldier killed by militants - sheer explotiation when she asks God &quot;Why did you send my boy to die?&quot; and Moore uses it in political attack.Also, the Bin Laden family has proven that the dates of leaving the US were wrongly reported in the film as is the doctored front page story about Gore 'election' (it was a letter to the editor title!).Overall, over the top accusations which have been proven wrong or are just American-hating.

It's as though these people saw a different film (or maybe saw it through different eyes).Michael Moore does NOT:- Portray American soldiers as bloodthirsty warmongers.- Say President Bush caused 9/11or any of the other bizarre claims.He DOES use a relentless series of well-documented facts and, in particular, the words of President Bush, Condaleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and others to present his argument. Their words, from their mouths; their actions and inaction.He presents American soldiers as genuine patriots who are willing to risk their lives to do the bidding of their nation and commander-in-chief - without question - to protect that nation. Moore is in no way criticising those soldiers. He's questioning the decisions of that commander-in-chief to put those men and women in harm's way. He's also showing us a taste of what ""harm's way"" really means - and it's horrific.There's no question Moore is making a political point. It's very explicit and, to me, makes it very well. It's fairly free of Moore's cringing attempts to embarrass.To those who want to present an alternative political point: please present a coherent argument and set of evidence. Beating your chest and calling yourself ""Christian"" and ""patriotic"" (and Moore the opposite) are not enough. It's clear to me that Moore's commitment to the USA and the principles it was founded on is extremely strong.Everyone should see this film. And, if a filmmaker produces a documentary presenting the opposite viewpoint to a similar standard, we should all see that too.Incidentally, Michael Moore isn't from ""Hollywood"". He's from Flint, Michigan. ""Hollywood"" - specifically Disney - refused to distribute this film.

Or to set up a villain (actually, an actor) who speaks the truth with his tongue obviously in cheek, so that the listener will get the impression that he is being lied to. The producers of &quot;historical&quot; documentaries know a thousand tricks of deception, and outright lying is only one of them.Michael Moore must be aware that the public falls for the slick tricks that are standard fare in other people's documentaries. He simply did not use them. You know right away that he doesn't like the president. Rather than condemn him for &quot;hating&quot; Bush, at least appreciate that he didn't hide his personal opinions, as many other, less honest propagandists, usually do.	4.0	The real difference is forthrightness	2004-07-30	9	6	3

This is actually an outstanding movie that hits its subject hard and with humor.  The film raises some very troubling and important questions, but it is best when Michael Moore backs away and lets the film's images and the mother who lost her son in the war speak for themselves.  This is emotionally powerful stuff, and at times, the effect is at once both soaring and searing.  Believe me, I was glad for the humor as comic relief.  I am generally conservative politically, and I must admit I was a little uncomfortable with the unremitting Bushbashing.  However, I came away seriously moved, sobered, thoughtful and with an overpowering sense of tragedy in the making, and not many films in the last ten years have done that to me.  So, I give this movie all five stars and a standing ovation.

The statement ""Some call you the elite.  I call you my base"" is an incredibly telling comment.  And Haliburton employees at their sales meeting crowing that its going to be a very good year for them (and then try to back pedal, saying ""Oh, but bad for our soldiers."") tells you all you need to know about the realities of Iraq.  Michael Moore simply can't make up better stuff than this!It always surprises me when the common man is duped into believing this administration is doing right by him, despite all evidence to the contrary. That man will never see this film, let alone with the proper air of scepticism and curiousity.  And we'll all pay for that as the tax base gets shifted to the middle class, our health costs escalate and our boys go to war.  We watch helplessly as our tax dollars are delivered and without accountability to defense contractors and oil companies.And that really is the theme of Farenheit 911.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	"I thought it was a little long.  Moore could have used an editor, but when you're the writer, director, and producer of a film--easily the largest-grossing documentary film in history--perhaps there is a reluctance on the part of anyone to cut the master's work.  And anyway, anyone could see that Moore wanted a little overkill to emphasis his various points: all those Sheiks of Arabi and glad-handed oil millionaires pressing flesh, all the George W. cowboy hats and little boy grins, all the dead and bleeding bodies, the limbless soldiers, the excited bombs a-bursting in surround sound--all the tragic absurdities of the spoiled little boy presidency--Moore knew--needed to be repeated over and over again lest the mass American mind miss the point.Okay, I have mixed feelings about this film.  It's not exactly a documentary--there is no pretense of objectivity, nor is it a full-blown burlesque of George W. Bush and everything that he is about--although it is close to that.  George W. appears often: swinging a golf club and asking us to admire his stroke; knitting his brows and allowing us to imagine that he is thinking; shaking hands with grinning Sheiks and oil-dipped Texas buds while petrol-dollars take to flight; and all the while the camera closes in; and then the sequences are repeated to comedic effect.But I think for sophisticated viewers, those who have been keeping tabs on Bush 43 for some time now, all of this is already known only too well.  Such viewers may find Moore's cinematic guidance a bit heavy-handed.  For such viewers this film may drag a bit in spots.I was thinking, too, while I watched all the shots of Bush II at play and pretend work and behind the podium practicing his oratory, that what Michael Moore really wanted to find is some footage of George W. at prayer.  If only the mendacious president could be caught kneeling before an altar or in a pew after the deed has been done, like Claudius in Shakespeare's Hamlet--how appropriate it would be.  A voice-over might exclaim: ""My words go up, but my thoughts remain below...""A nice bit was Moore's satirical attempt to stop congressmen on the street coming and going to work and get them to sign up their children and grandchildren for the Iraqi war.  Many chuckles there as our good representatives stare wide-eyed and/or flee in astonished horror.  How rude that gruff man with the microphone!I also liked (but found tedious and a bit obvious) the long drawn-out tale of the middle-American mother who identified herself as a conservative Democrat, a woman sure of the righteousness of American intent until it is HER son that comes up dead in Iraq.  And then she turns.  She sees, she understands: these are REAL people dying, getting blown up.  As she cries for her son, we the audience see the glorious ""precision bombing"" that so delighted Donald Rumsfeld mocked macabre by this personal tragedy.  Moore induces a nice clip of the Secretary of Defense waxing ecstatic on one of his favorite subjects (precision bombing).  And, although this is not emphasized, a substantial number of US injured and dead are the result of friendly fire gone awry.  Yes, she speaks too long and too self-indulgently, but in the end who can fault her or deny her feelings?One of Moore's more damning points and one that Bush and Buds cannot squirm out of is the government-sponsored exodus of the Bin Laden family and assorted Bin Laden family members safely out of this country immediately following the 9/11 attacks.  Why would the Bush administration make it such a top priority that such people be flown out the country?  Wouldn't it make more sense to keep them here, at least until they could be questioned?Overall one is left with the indelible impression that George W. is a child playing with the weapons of state of the most powerful country in the history of the world without the slightest awareness of their awesome effects.  He is a frat boy playing fighter pilot, mouthing empty cliches about ""mission accomplished,"" while all about him the real world of poverty and death go on unobserved and uncomprehended."	4.0	A little long, but effective	2004-09-15	33	27	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A57Q87B0TC9IJ	Derek G	"The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines propaganda as, ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause.""  Fahrenheit 9/11 most definitely fits the description of propaganda.  To Michael Moore's credit, he's been honest about his film having a bias and anyone with common sense would know this going in.Moore starts out with a recap of the Presidential election.  Among allegations of vote tampering, Moore cites ""numerous independent publications"" that claim Gore would have won had a recount been allowed in Florida.  Now, wait a second.  Just who are these ""independent publications?""  In the movie, Moore quickly scans over a few newspaper clippings but never elaborates.  In April of 2001, the Miami Herald and USA Today reported that, had a recount been allowed, Bush still would have won; in fact his margin would have widened.  A separate independent study done by the University of Chicago and financed by media giants such as the Associated Press, NY Times, CNN, and LA Times, (not exactly bastions of conservative reporting), came up with the same conclusion.Moore then jumps to the Senate hearing, presided by none other than Al Gore, to officially anoint Bush as the next President of the United States.  Election code states that in order for an objection to become official, a member of the House of Representatives needs to have their objection signed by just one Senate member.  One by one, house democrats parade their way up to the Senate floor to voice their objections, yet none were signed by a senator.  My question is -- why?  Where was Barbara Boxer during all this?  Where was Ted Kennedy?  Where were the democrats when they really needed them?This is one problem I have with Moore, and his movies in general.  It becomes very difficult to trust anything Moore says because he ignores the questions that don't support his agenda.  Watch the above segment carefully and you'll also see how Moore twists everything so that the hearing appears to be an attack directed specifically against African-Americans.  Moore also refuses to, as the old saying goes, ""let the facts get in the way of a good story.""Another example:  At the beginning and end of the movie, Moore holds up a copy of Bush's military records with the name James R. Bath blacked out.  Because Bath later managed money for the Bin Ladens, Moore insinuates that censoring his name is a kind of ""smoking gun"" that ties the Bush family to the Bin Ladens.  Perhaps, but that's kind of a stretch.  A more plausible and logical explanation could simply be that it was Bush's military records that were being investigated; not Bath's.That's not to say there isn't a lot to chew on in this picture.  Moore goes into great length to explain a possible tie-in between the Saudi Royal family and the Bush family.  From Bush Jr. being bailed out of his failed oil ventures by angel investors (James Bath via the Saudis) to Bush Sr. being on the board of The Carlyle Group (a large defense contractor and military arms dealer), Moore's claim that the Saudi investment of $1.4 billion dollars in the Bush family, their friends, and related business is enough to make one pause.  Considering the Saudis control 6-7% of the investments in the U.S., perhaps we should change our labels to, ""Made in America (but financed by Saudi Arabia.)""Continuing down the money trail, let's talk about Dick Cheney's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee prior to 9/11.  ""You've directed me to buy the V-22, a program I don't need.  You've directed me to buy more M1's, F-14's, and F-16's... Congress has directed me to spend money on all kinds of things that are not related to defense, but mostly related to politics back home.""  Forget $1.4 billion dollars.  At a cost estimated at almost $1.4 trillion (with a `t') dollars over the next five years, money that could have been spent on democrat-favored programs like education and public infrastructure was instead spent on weapons the Pentagon never requested and didn't even want.  And who was President during this time?  Oh yeah, President Clinton.  And who controlled the purse-strings?  Oh that's right, a democrat-controlled Congress.  I guess that's why this footage never made it into the picture.This is the other problem I have with Fahrenheit 9/11.  In Moore's mind, or at least in this movie, George W. Bush is the root of all evil, and anything not meeting his criteria is left out.  Now maybe Bush did sell his soul to the Saudis for a billion dollars and the solution to the world's woes it to throw the bum out.  Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest these same problems were going on long before Bush took office, or that anything will change for the better if this is done.I recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 for the issues it raises and the discussions it will generate, but its undeniably slanted viewpoint diminishes its persuasiveness.  It's a powerful movie, and its coverage of the Iraq war, the soldiers serving in Iraq, and parents of soldiers is truly heart-wrenching.  This is where the movie excels.  I just can't give the movie five stars because I left the theater feeling as if I needed to verify every allegation Moore makes, and it disturbs me that some people have bought into the anti-Bush rhetoric hook, line, and sinker.Not long ago, Canadian television aired an investigative report which claimed the moon landing was an elaborate hoax filmed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  Containing actual testimony from Kubrick's wife, as well as interviews of astronauts, scientists and even leaders like Henry Kissinger and Donald Rumsfeld, this ""mockumentary"" showed how easily images and media could be manipulated to deceive viewers in order to sell a particular viewpoint.  The same can be said about Fahrenheit 9/11."	3.0	Bowling for Bush in 2004	2004-07-05	41	24	17

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A11LMGM7C4W1EI	D. Fernandes	I'm not an automatic Michael Moore fan. I think his manipulations are often far too obvious and his constant wisecracks and slacker 'average' guy shtick is tired and sometimes offensive.I saw F 9/11 expecting more of the same. Impassioned appeals to patriotism, silly gags on powerful people and some good, honest criticism. For the most part, the film delivered - it was flag-waving, patriotic and mind-numbingly manipulative at times. But I left the theatre feeling vindicated in some way: for once, a mainstream movie was talking about the ugly side of the American Imperial project and did so in a very well-researched and thorough, yet entertaining way.What I liked:Moore spends a lot of time in the film exploring the connections between the Bush family and big Saudi and American money. It's a complex relationship and I think it's extremely important for people in the States to understand this. Bin Laden's own family were allowed to flee the states without any formal questioning. The US invaded Iraq although it posed no immediate threat. Bush's buddies routinely get contracts for weapons building and 'reconstruction' projects when there are wars. For the first time in a mainstream film, the connection between politics, corporations, profit and war were made. And i think it's a connection that is very hard to ignore.Although Moore doesn't get too involved in the racism that Arab Americans have suffered post 9/11, he does spend some time on the fact that the US Army is desperate for young recruits and often goes into poor neighbourhoods, with plenty of people of colour to prey on, in order to fill its ranks. The scenes in Flint following around Army recruiters are classic documentary filmmaking. Moore backs off and lets these folks speak for themselves. It's powerful.What i didn't like:The opening scene and the soppy patriotic undertones. The whole scene with the mother whose son died in Iraq. Moore spends WAY too much time with her. Maybe it's because i'm not an American, but it seems pretty obvious to me that if you loose a child in a war that the world is largely very critical of, you're going to turn around and put some blame on the president who lead your son to death. I found this scene long, manipulative and I found Moore insincere and trying way too hard to make a point. I also didn't like the silly montage of countries that supported bush's war. Moore goes far out of his way to belittle them - it gets racist at some points and just plain dumb at others.Overall all though, I thought it made some very timely and important arguments. That Bush and his friends, family and supporters are very powerful business people with direct profits to be made in the business of war. That Americans have largely been kept in the dark about the grimmer realities of the 'war on terror' and have been mislead and let down by corporate-controlled news media. And that the people who pay the ultimate price for this system are average Americans and folks from poor neighbourhoods.I recommend you see it for yourself if you haven't already.	4.0	F9/11 - thorough and moving	2004-10-01	23	12	11

It uses plain language and very well selected scenes, it avoids the silly conspiracy theories, presents only the facts and gives voice to some of the US soldiers who served in Iraq.

Capturing the best elements of Reefer Madness, Birth of a Nation, and the works of Heinrich Himmler, Fahrenheit 9/11 has undoubtedly staked out its place in the annals of great documentary.Prepare to have your presuppositions and values put to the fire in the cinematic pyromania that only Mr. Moore can supply. In addition to deconstructing the ""lies"" and ""half-truths"" that the proletariat have been brainwashed into accepting (via journalism, the Internet, rap music, personal experience, anecdotes), the true ""people's champion"" provides some startling revelations...For instance:*There are TWO President Bushes!**During Saddam's reign, the Iraqi people lived in peace, flying kites**Most U.S. Congressmen cannot read* :(Upon first hearing the title Fahrenheit 9/11, I have to admit I was a little skeptical. After all, Bradbury's book/film (trite account of utopian society where all books/independent thought are incinerated) of a similar name was a complete drag. But in true heroic fashion, Moore charges headlong into scandal, armed with nothing more than his girth, camcorder, legions of high-priced lawyers, and an ice cream truck. It's little wonder that some obscure British journalist called Mike ""the most important living American."" Such valor would normally warrant a Congressional Medal of Honor or an induction into the Justice League...But alas, a right wing conspiracy is in effect...Maybe in a better time...a better place...Moore will receive his just desserts.

(CAUTION: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)Where the last one was focusing on our obsession with guns and trying to peer into the reason why America has such a high rate of gun violence, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an outrageous and not to mention deeply frightening look at how Washington D.C. used the attacks of 9/11 to push it's own political agenda and the alliances between the Bush and The Bin Laden families and how dirty deals between the families caused Bush and Osama to become mortal enemies. We see many things where the ties between the oil companies that Bush and Cheney have played a significant part and the Saudi Arabian government officials and the many Bin Laden relatives who worked and lived in the United States and that the administration allowed to flee almost immediately after the attacks in NYC and D.C. You won't believe what this area will show to you. Be warned though: You will be very angry when you are done seeing this part wherever you lie on the political spectrum.I always was certain that the war in Iraq was motivated by our countries excessive thirst for petroleum and how Iraq is the world's second largest source of petroleum and that oil companies have been given contracts to rebuild the country for it's oil but this movie goes even farther and the things I saw just made me so incredible guilty especially for how our countries oil addiction has been one of the main causes of many of the wars we've fought in the Middle East. Being aware of this, I have chosen not to own a car just so I don't support Halliburton (The company that vice president Dick Cheney was head of) or other corporate creeps. The pictures of the many Iraqi children playing basketball, on playgrounds, laughing and reading with their parents and relatives immediately followed by the balls of fire and bombs going off and the aftermath made me cry in horror at the resulting suffering that has resulted from our administrations illegal war. Many of the Iraqi's even though they hated Saddam Hussein were infuriated at our countries unlawful attack against a country that had little if any capability to attack it's neighboring countries.Also a lot of things that really shocked and horrified me that this documentary showed was how the government would recruit soldiers for the war in Iraq, not from the well-to-do neighborhoods but would recruit them from a lot of the poor and ghetto neighborhoods like many areas in Flint, Michigan, Moore's hometown where his 1989 ""Roger and Me"" was filmed at, and many other run-down areas. Many of the poorer neighborhoods where the soldiers were recruited from, were made even poorer as a result of the administration's policies.I was always very scared of what has been happening in the political world but even then, this really shocked me and left me really teed off big time! Okay, maybe some of the things emphasized may or may not be exaggerated but this is the best example of why we need to wake up and realize what Washington is doing and how their dangerous and murderous policies are causing the deaths of thousands or even millions of lives and ruining countless millions more.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is also smartly done and even goes the distance to take some swipes at the Democratic Party and how a lot of the members of that party really dropped the ball on the 2000 Election and that they just sat back and admitted defeat when they could easily have prevented the disaster that America has been both subjected to and causing to it's population and against other countries. This is sure to cause more controversy just like ""Bowling For Columbine"" did but this is one of the most honest and heartbreaking, not to mention powerful documentaries of all time and if you really do care for America and for the international community then you must see this right away because it will make you want to make a difference and try to make our world a much better place than it is now.While this is extremely serious in it's tone, there are parts of this documentary that are really funny and smartly incorporate humor into the movie to bring some laughs without taking away it's important tone. One part will make your stomach turn in three hundred and sixty turns.For all of those who are criticizing or bashing Moore for `liberal-propaganda' or dribble like that, do you even know what liberal or conservative mean? Neither liberal nor true conservative would've been waging this horrific war in Iraq, nor support frauds who have ruined so many lives and the future of so many more around the world. I for one am offended and appalled at the American attitude towards the international community and that seeing this documentary has made me realize just how low we as a nation have gone but that at the same time, we can turn this whole thing around and realize how our politicians have been screwing us over a hundred times due to their self-interest and murderous greed. I give my complete gratitude to Mr. Moore for helping to blow the whistle on the epic corruption of our leaders in Washington and for awakening us up to the dangers of them.Go and see this today! If you are a true patriot, then you must vote for new leaders who care for the people and not the special interests of greedy businessmen or oil companies."	5.0	Extremely important and shocking!	2004-07-04	23	12	11
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2CIQB66LQVLFK	DJ Benny (AKA Ben A.)	Like about 80% of the people on here, I believe this was a good, well-done, eye-opening movie. Alot of republicans dont like it just because Michael Moore is a fat, liberal, mofo. Well DUH, didn't you realize that from the previews.I think that Moore did a good job on his theories about Bush and his administration, but even if you're a liberal against Bush....just remember to take Moore with a big grain of salt. I have heard the part about flying the Bin-Ladens out of the country was proved false by Moore's own source...not that moore doesnt have a point, he just ISNT the man who should have done the film. He has been known to only take one part of a fact and warp it to his benefit. This ruins his original goal ; to convince swing voters to help bush lose the election. But republicans / swing voters decide not to believe a thing moore says, just because michael moore is michael moore.Remember moore's points, but just take them with a grain of salt, and do your research. There are other ways to prove why people dont like bush other than this movie.	4.0	Even if you're a democrat, be careful...	2004-10-10	26	12	14
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AXNZBEAXLVDBO	DJ I DA I	First let me say that the controversy surrounding 9/11 goes way beyond this documentary.  What Michael Moore did is bring to the silver screen issues that may have been otherwise overlooked.  And he did it in a digestable manner.  To be honest, Michael Moore doesn't even scratch the surface of the gross misconceptions and injustices that have occured as a result of this catastrophic incident, but he does inform the world of some of the inconsistances with President Bush, Norad, the Bin Laden Family as well as the connection with Saudia Arabia.  The problem is, people aren't watching this movie with an open mind and going to do further research on the issues presented, they are watching it through republican or democratic tinted lenses without looking at the very basic facts.  Don't trust Michael Moore, don't trust the President, there is an abundance of information availible online, do your own research and follow what your heart tells you.	5.0	You have your own mind, USE IT	2004-10-30	13	8	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3CN9CCJUNIPKT	DJ Joe Sixpack	I was impressed.  I mean, I've never been a big Michael Moore fan -- I'm still ticked off at him for backing Ralph Nader in the 2000 elections, and I think his reasoning is often overly simplistic and fuzzy-minded.  But I think this movie did an excellent job of making his leftie-pragmatic viewpoint accessible to mainstream America, and the information is presented in a very thoughtful, persuasive manner.  There are many, many things in this movie that I have simply not seen in the media before, or even heard about -- notably the squelching of Congressional dissent in the 2000 elections, a travesty presided over by Senate leader Al Gore, and some of the gut-wrenching footage from Iraq, which, amazingly, was fairly restrained, considering how much more, and much more gruesome footage must be available.  Anyway, I guess now I'm more grateful that Michael Moore is out there.  The current climate of trying to cut off all discussion and debate on issues of national disagreement, the my-way-or-the-highway attitude of the GOP media machine, is profoundly un-American, and if left unchecked may threaten the foundations of our very society.  (Debate and honest differnces of opinion makes us stronger and wiser, fellas!!)  So, I respect Moore for his persistent role in keeping civic discussion free and open, even if I don't always agree with him.  If you think you disagree with Moore, but haven't seen the movie, see the movie, and then decide how much you still disagree with him.	5.0	If you think you disagree with Moore, at least see the movie	2004-09-03	10	9	1
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2JNL71XQ02NSX	"DJ ProFusion - WorldFusionRadio.com ""DJ ProFu..."	"Know before you view it that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful film that brings home great suffering and even greater absuridity.  Moore does a good job of dealing with subjects that are unpleasant by mixing in humor, but you still walk away with a sense of tragedy and anger over what this government is doing to people. I saw it three times in the theatre and will buy it this week and watch it again. It opens your eyes to what is going on. It's heavy, makes you cry, makes you angry, and motivates you to implement some regime change right here at home.It portrays the truth most Americans, especially the right-of-center ones, do not want to see. The reactionary right HATES Michael Moore because he exposes their fundamental strategy: the use of fear to divide and manipulate people. Like he did in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Moore shows how fear is a powerful weapon that can be used to trick people into believing things that are not true and acting against their own best interest. The fact that Moore can deliver this message with wit, flair, and most amazingly, in a way that is entertaining, is iodine in the wounds of the reactionaries.For me, the most poignant moment in the film is when Lila Libscomb is weeping over the death of her son, a soldier killed in Iraq, and a nasty woman jumps in front of her and the camera shouting ""this is all staged."" Then she demands Libscomb to tell her where her son was killed. When Libscomb replies without hesitation and gives the exact time and place of her son's death, the nasty woman recoils realizing it isn't staged at all, then stomps away angry. That is an allegory of right-wing reaction to much in the world.Moore can be criticized for jumping through the facts too quickly and of not going into depth when called for. However, he can not be faulted on the factual content of the film. The reactionaries rail and moan but they never can find anything in Fahrenheit 9/11 that is untrue.Bless you, Michael Moore for showing such heart and such courage."	5.0	The Truth Hurts	2004-10-13	43	33	10

The story that he tells is sad and painful on many levels.  The viewers follow the story of one families staunch support of the Iraqi invasion that terminates in a heartwrenching scene in our nation's capital.The one criticism I have of this documentary is that Moore's opinions, while well founded, are so blatant in excess that the story he came to tell is weakened and feels like so many sour grapes.That being said, the movie is well worth viewing.  Everyone should understand and be made to follow the money trail that has led, ultimately, to the deaths of 1000 young Americans in the Middle East and over 3000 innocents on September 11th.	4.0	Disturbing, provocative, but devalued by going over the top.	2004-07-25	11	9	2

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A25JCW6ZCYBZU5	D. Lipsitz	"This has to be one of the best documentaries I've seen in years.  After having seen it, I have little doubt that the media will hate it, and that politicians from both parties in power will villify it.The film starts off with questions surrounding the 2000 Presidential Election, particularly the media's refusal to question what had happened, and the refusal of Democrats in the Senate to even challenge the actions of the opposition, their own candidates, and the courts.The screen then goes to black, and you hear the sounds of the attacks on the World Trade Center.  You'll know what is happening without pictures, trust me.After that, Moore chronicals the events leading up to 9/11, the Administration's perceived lack of action and direction, and the events leading up to and including the war in Iraq.  Moore calls into question actions taken by the federal government to hinder investigations, help the bin Laden family, Saudi involvement in 9/11 and in the decision making processes of our own government, and so forth.Moore goes on to point out what he sees as the hypocrisy of politicians and the media.  He shows the recruiting tactics of military recruiters who leave wealthy neighborhoods alone while actively targeting poor and minority groups.  He shows the absurdity of media attempts to perpetuate fears, particularly when it benifits the current political leadership.Moore takes no prisoners, particularly amongst the media.  While many will interpret this film as ""a liberal attack"" on ""conservative values,"" the film really goes after the media as the main culprits behind what Moore sees as the failures of our current government and society.Love him or hate him, Moore is brilliant.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1JJ2ZUIKFHWBV	"D. Maisano ""Smart Person"""	"Let's clear up a few things with this movie. Does Moore have an agenda? Of course he does. His agenda is to get Bush out of office. Is the movie one-sided? Yes, as the Bush administration is not seen in any sort of positive light in the movie. Is the movie therefore devoid of any political and educational value? Not in the least. Moore and Miramax have stated on numerous occassions that the facts of this film were checked, re-checked, and checked again, and it shows. In theory, you could save your money and just find archives of all the stories that contributed to the facts of this movie. There are also important interviews with former FBI and congressional members in the film as well.Even if you are a die-hard conservative/Bush supporter who feels that Moore's views are without merit, fine. Lord knows conservatives aren't the most open-minded people. However,  you can't ignore the FACTS that are presented in this film, nor can you ignore the footage of the soldiers and Iraqis that are shown here. The casualties of this war are even greater than the fatalities, as you will see soldiers missing limbs and suffering permanent physical/mental damage from the war, which is the kind of stuff the major news outlets seem reluctant to show.Talking about the media, if you wonder why every news station is making their own ""Does Fahrenheit's Facts Check Out?"" segment, its not because they really have evidence of false facts, but rather they're just covering their own butts because the media is shown in quite a negative light in this film, especially Fox News. They're covering up shoddy reporting by attacking Moore (anyone who saw Matt Lauer's interview with Moore can attest to that.)This film is more aimed towards people who really don't know about what's going on in our government. I brought my friend who's never been political about anything to see this and he was appalled when he learned what was going on. To be fair, anyone who sees this movie needs to realize that this is still just one side of the story, and should not base all of their political thinking on it. Still, knowledge is truly power, and the power attained from seeing this movie is very real and tangible. And for all those nay-sayers who say that the film is full of lies, all I have to say is: Prove it. Don't just say, ""The film isn't entirely accurate,"" give me pure EXAMPLES of how this is so. It should be noted that all of these sorts of criticisms have been disproven by Moore, including a high profile one in Newsweek. I'd highly recommend that you go to Moore's web site to learn more.In conclusion, this film is a scathing view of the current administration, and these views are ""justified"" via facts/interviews/information throughout the movie. Not everything is cut and dry in it, but it definately leaves you with something to talk about. I recommend everyone see this movie, and to bring all your friends/family as well. And don't give me the excuse that ""I don't care about the government"" or ""This film will just make me cry/angry."" Just because you ignore these issues does NOT mean they are simply going to go away. You owe it to yourself as a citizen to know what it is the government is doing on your behalf. Remember, our government, and especially our President, are our representatives to the rest of the world. We elect them to represent us, so you owe it to yourself to check that they are faithfully representing you, so that you can make the decision in November whether or not to keep them in office or to kick them out. And on a side note, if you haven't already, REGISTER TO VOTE!

That's the watchword for a documentary filmmaker, even one as publically visible as Michael Moore.  Yes, we all know the guy's political agenda, we all know he hates George W. Bush like summer hates the winter, but if Moore is to be taken seriously he has to establish objective credibility that is compelling and believable and not agenda-driven.  Plus, a ""documentary"" is supposed to present BOTH sides of a controversial issue, so that the viewer may make up his or her mind.  Not so with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, which I had predisposed myself to be a muck of warbling nonsense prior to viewing, yet even I could not comprehend its blatant hatred and vitriol.  In the wake of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil I was shocked, concerned, and disturbed that Mr. Moore would decide to kick a political football of diviseness. . .plus put one or two bucks in his pocket, just for jollies.Don't get me wrong:  George W. Bush is the worst President to reside in the Oval Office since Warren G. Harding (and that's saying something).  I am NOT some politically expedient apologist who enjoys hammering leftists for the sake of hammering; I just call 'em as I see 'em, and Moore dropped a stink bomb here.  Yet, I think I know something about journalism, as I graduated with a degree in it, and I can tell those of you reading these words that Moore has systematically and enthusiastically raped all tenets of objective and unbiased reporting that those of us who labored under the guise of reporting strove mightily to obey.  This piece of sludge isn't a documentary; it's a piece of disingenous propaganda that usurps common decency.  This is flagrant. . .flagrant. . .sensationalism; the very fact Moore tries to paint a Bush/bin Laden connection without flushing out ALL the facts reeks of moral corruption and ineptitude even more telling than Moore's bashing of Shrub.(And by the way, Michael:  You aren't that funny, either.)But heck:  If someone wants to show me that the devastating attacks of 9/11 were the by-products of a corrupt administration in bed with oil-producing countries in the Middle East--a corruption intent on ""looking the other way"" to protect its billionaire buddies--well, I'm all ears.  Show me the money.  But Michael Moore can't:  He's too busy spinning his hatred and personal vendetta against George W. Bush.  The whole ""film"" comes across as contrived and constipated; yeah, Mr. Moore, we get the fact Bush Jr. ran several companies into the ground (What the heck is your point?).

This is the first time I've ever reviewed a movie.Seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 reminded me of my reaction to looking at the concentration camp films of what the Nazis did in World War II.  When I looked at those films, I wondered what was wrong with the Germans who went along with such atrocities.Watching this movie made me feel guilty that our country had done so much harm to innocent people around the world in our apparently misguided efforts to locate Saudi-Arabian led Al Qaeda terrorists.  Now I wonder what's wrong with me for allowing this to happen.I hope you will look at the movie and make your own judgment about what each of us needs to do.  I know that I need to begin to speak out and write against the self-serving nonsense that we are being fed from Washington, D.C.

I had read that book, too, and expected few surprises at the movie.  But Mr. Moore has updated his research and information quite a lot since the book was written.  What he added really floored me.As I read in the New York Times this morning that a military draft reinstatement is just around the corner, I realized that unless we stop our attacks on other countries and our search for oil and military profits we will doom hundreds of thousands of other young people to go through what just happened in Iraq . . . as well as millions of innocent civilians around the world.Let's start acting like Americans again.

Michael Moore attacks with video and film footage on the history of the Bush family and its ties with the Saudi family. Michael Moore starts with the senior Bush and then goes after President Bush by using suggestive ties between the Saudis and Bush families.The director tries to use film clips with commentary to convince the viewer that President George W. Bush is guilty by association and corrupted by oil money. Greed from the highest position in the land is thrown into convincing fashion by film and research facts. Can this hold up in a court of law? Probably not! I'm sure this film would be part of the evidence collected to bring down President George W. Bush if it was brought up in a court of law.The director would have us believe that President Bush is not American by his ties with the Saudis. I believe the true purpose of this film is to bring down the current President Bush's regime and vanish the Bush name to corruption. Michael Moore does have some balls to take on the President Bush though. Its one thing to take on the NRA, but the highest and most powerful person in the world!Only in American can a film director take on the most powerful leader in the world and get away with it. I believe if all of this was true of the Bush family with its billions and billions of dollars at stake in oil and secrecy held in trust, that President Bush or his family keeps it a secret by using his so called influence. Maybe a disappearing act!  Would the Bushes let a documentary film director film and distribute a film with all this bashing of the family name? If this was true!With the majority of the media already under the influence of political parties, can a blatant attack on President George W. Bush by a filmmaker be crushed before it was made? Of course it could. Maybe the political hype and influence in film was underestimated by the Bush family as comes with the territory. Can a film bring down a presidency? We shall see! Any ramifications from this film are still being made and will show in the future.Everyone blames or believes in the highest position in America.	3.0	Only in America!	2004-11-01	10	5	5

The sad thing is that most americans are too stupid to do anything about it. All they do is sit on their couches, get fat and wave their flags like the ignorant twits they are. Not noticing that the country is headed down the toilet under the leadership of this ""special"" president of ours. Our founding fathers must be rolling over in their graves. Brilliant men like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jeffreson, John Adams, would be ashamed of the country they founded on Liberal ideals, if they knew what was going on these days. Surely they'd laugh at us for even contemplating voting for someone as dullard as Dubya let alone actually electing the goof.Michael Moore let's us see that the Republican party is unbelievably corrupt with money-hungry, power-obsessed neo-cons who only wish to make as much money possible without any regard to fellow citizens and how it might affect them. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is brilliant in how Moore shows the audience on video how these people really work. Not way to repudiate that. It's right there on film for all to see. He even exposes the corporate media for being pawns of our corrupt government. Moore is to be applauded and praised for this piece of art and for having the guts to show it.

Moore did his research and with appropriate editing he laid down the footage to make his case.  Some of the things talked about in the film I had no idea of.  As a military wife, I have noticed that this film can have an adverse effect on military personnell.  The people I know who watched the film that were active duty felt kind of bad after watching the film.  They had a feeling of, ""I'm risking my life, hurting the Iraqi people vs helping and for what?""  That was just a discussion had around my military house after watching the film.  The footage of Lila was heartbreaking. No matter what your political views are this film is darn interesting.  The only thing that bothered me at times were Moore's voice overs, his suggestions as to what the president were thinking, no one really knows what W was thinking about in that classroom.

The film represents a milestone for the liberal media and has created a stir which may ultimately effect how people, including Americans, view our Democracy.The movie as a whole isn't nearly as spectacular as the effects it will have. Some of the points are reinforced by examples which seem to have been grasped on a stretch. Moore could have made a much better case against the Patriot Act considering all of the fine examples of its abuse by the American government. Moore could have also mitigated his point, while still leaving it in, about the plane which left the U.S on September 13 carrying the Bin Ladens. Although this was a suspicious action Richard Clarke has clearly shown that it was not a decision made by Bush or his immediate circles.The thesis of the movie is well delivered and supported: These young soldiers, representing mostly the bottom strata of our society, are being sent to Iraq to fight a war that has little to do with the reasons given to fight it. These young people are dying for nothing. They are merely security guards for the huge corporations which seek to benefit from Iraq's resources. The war in Iraq is immoral and represents a huge blemish in the United States' record as a ""leader of the free world.""Weighing in all of the positives and negatives, I would still say this is a movie which every American should see, regardless of their opinions going into it.I tip my hat to Michael Moore."	4.0	The Power of One Movie..	2004-06-28	18	9	9
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2B2T4ZT00OXR8	Down with Deficits	I had never seen a Michael Moore movie and didn't know what to expect. While the film maker makes clear at the onset that Moore is biased against Bush, it is actual footage of President Bush that exposes himself to his own words, behavior and actions.  Moore poignantly handles the darker side of the war from a very personal perspective with the families and soldiers. He is very supportive of the plight of the soldiers and families and uses no trickery but rather employs the real words and footage, and its effect is very moving and powerful. Moore forces us to see the realities of President Bush's zealous march into Iraq, looking for the concocted WMDs. While parts of this movie were sad to see, others were outright funny. One sees the hilarity and hypocrisy of the pro-war Congressmen who wouldn't dare send their kids to the front line, never mind the fact that both Cheney & Bush did all they could to avoid seeing facing any real combat during the Nam war. Moore is brave to examine and question the rush to Iraq and showcase, those who stood to gain and the unfortunate who bore the real cost from this action. I'd highly recommend this film to all teenagers and adults.	5.0	Real footage, Real people, Real captivating	2004-10-15	12	9	3

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ADS5APY1NKTL4	"D. Pawl ""Dani"""	"I just watched ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", last night.  This is the film that has had citizens of the United States, France and other nations debating, discussing and deliberating.  While some see it as a true example of freedom of speech, and following the old addage that ""the truth shall set you free,"" others see it as a perpetuation of subversion, disrespect and even anti-patriotism, at the hands of the filmmaker and writer, Michael Moore.This is the first of Moore's documentaries that I have seen, and I hope to see more.  His unique blend of ironic narration, juxtaposed with presidential footage, a supercharged soundtrack (interlaced with a combination of rock & roll and standards), and chilling figures and documents, backing up his belief that the whole ""War on Terror"" was one of the hugest,deadliest, coldest and most expensive tricks pulled on the American people, to date.  According to Moore, not only was the 9/11 tragedy a set-up, from the get-go, but due to the political and professional ties the Bush family had with the Bin Laden family, our soldiers were sent to start a war with a group of innocent people, in a country that had nothing to do with the terrorism, or the deaths of thousands of innocent casualties in the Twin Towers, that fateful day of September 11, 2001.This film is enough to make anyone opposed to this war very, very angry at our government, the grand manipulators who played with our heads (through media coverage, as an example), and even at ourselves for falling for this cruel joke, devised by politicians who only bow to the almighty dollar.  Moore captures the tone of this anger very effectively, yet, I didn't find it one-sided, subversive or even particularly radical.  I just felt I was being presented with the facts that were coveted for so long, and that I was finally given a glimpse into a reality (more like ""surreality"") that many of us may have suspected, but few of us were able to prove.  I felt that Moore's interviews with people in support of the war were not manipulations.  He listened respectfully to Lila Lipscomb, mother of one of the soldiers, with respect and also with tolerance.  What's more, he doesn't let us forget that the young people fighting on the frontlines are just as human, real and have just as much dignity as those who are vehemently opposed to the bloodshed and heartlessness of violence.Masterfully done, Michael.  This is definitely one of those films that will stand the test of time.  It is truly a time capsule that transcends the generations.  I am sure people will talk about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" for many, many years to come."	5.0	brilliant and chilling.......	2005-10-03	19	14	5

When we arrived in the early afternoon, people were crammed into the entrance and flooding out to the street. There were all types of people, young liberals, old liberals , conservatives of all ages and professions, some holding pro- Bush signs, many expressing the opposite opinion. We were told the shows were sold out untill that night, despite the movie playing on two of the four screens. As we were waiting to buy our tickets for the 8:30 showing, one of the theatres let out. Some people looked outraged, but not at michael moore. They were amazed that so much had been kept from them. Even today, months after F9/11 has exposed some of the glaring omissions the media made in covering Iraq, There are many things in this movie that are found nowhere else, that no company has the nerve to show, because this footage starkly contraficts the rosy picture the Bush administration has tried to paint for us. Moore shows viewers things that we have not seen, guides us through a twisted path of information, but lets us draw our own conclusions about Bush and his administration. Everyone should see this movie. If you are a democrat, you will love it. If you are a republican or independent, and open-minded enough to consider another person's point ov view, you will be deeply moved, and you just may find that you can no longer support George W.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3EQQP0LD4Z375	Dr. Lee D. Carlson	"From an apodictic point of view, i.e. from a point of view that is free of biases and outside of history, however unlikely the attaining of this state is, this work should not be called a documentary. No references are given for its claims, although the checking of the truth of these references may be very time consuming. As an example of this, the attempt by Moore to connect Karzai to Unocal is not substantiated. It would be very easy to give references to substantiate this claim, but he does not.But from this (apodictic) viewpoint, however fanciful it might be, one can make judgments as to the authenticity of the content of F/911. In that sense F/911 could be viewed as providing motivation to perhaps produce a work that would either substantiate or nullify the claims made in F/911. Such reactionary works have already appeared, and have various degrees of quality, if judged from this (perhaps fanciful) apodictic point of view.Such a point of view (again, however fanciful) would permit one to make judgments as to the ""best"" or ""worst"" parts of F/911.  The best part of this work is the attempt by Moore to challenge Senators and House members to sign up their children for Iraq. This of course will not happen. Their sons and daughters do not sign up for combat. That wealthy people do not fight their own battles is an axiom of history. The worst part of the movie is the interview with a few U.S. troops, whose attitudes about offensive operations are presented as representing the majority of the troops stationed in Iraq. In the heat of battle, it is very understandable that they would need emotional props such as hard-rock music to get them through it.When viewing this part of the movie, one naturally wonders what Bush would do in such circumstances. His seven minutes of silence and inaction in the Florida classroom, as portrayed in this movie, instill skepticism in his ability to think decisively, independently, and rationally in situations of stress. One thing is sure, Bush has never had to face the intense emotions of war that these soldiers did. Bush has never had to say goodbye to his wife and children and then march to war. Bush has never had to make on-the-fly decisions in the horrific situations of combat. Bush has never had to bury a loved one killed in war. Bush has never been in a situation where death is constantly tugging at his elbow. This goes for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others in his cadre of yellow abdomens.It would also be incorrect to call this movie ""propaganda"", as this is a term that should be reserved to societies whose governments are oligarchies or dictatorships. It is more appropriate in a democratic or pseudo-democratic society to form a new category or framework to characterize works such as these. This new category might be called ""political aesthetics"", and would be a branch of aesthetics, for, like art, it sometimes provokes strong emotions in the observer and spawns possibly many new genres. In addition, it can require both detachment and involvement to appreciate it fully. Some works of art require, for their appreciation, that individuals detach themselves from their feelings and prejudices, and in many instances view these works from an ahistorical point of view. Conversely, an appreciation of art sometimes requires deep personal involvement, and requires that one ignore external criticism and the opinions of others. In both cases, one cannot speak of the ""truth"" of these works of art. One can only speak of appreciating them. The most important point to remember here is that art can be sloppy as well as ordered, it can induce delight as well as pain, and it can instill respect as well as disgust. This work (of art) is no different than any other.Without extensive research and statistical sampling, it would be difficult to say whether this movie will influence the decisions this Tuesday. But whatever the outcome, this movie will without a doubt be remembered as the most iconic of all those made in 2004. Could Moore have made the movie better than what it is? Perhaps. On Tuesday, will we be fooled again (as Moore asks at the end of the movie)? Perhaps. Can we improve on the current administration?Absolutely."	5.0	A masterpiece of political aesthetics	2004-10-31	33	15	18

For people looking for a justification for antiwar/anti-American activism, this is a fair attempt, but don't try to verify the ""facts"" presented -- it is not possible in a real world. They must be verified using other fiction works.From the flight from the country during nonflight time to altered statements and forged documents, Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' -type effort seems to have no more reality in its perspective.If you want a fun party movie, this may be one in a stack. If you want a documentary (Moore himself admitted that this was entered as a ""documentary"" at Cannes only because that was one classification in which an opening still existed), try something like Grasping for the Wind or something educational rather than a far- far- far-left panic piece.We all look for justification for our nuroses, but this is probably the wrong one for most."	1.0	Fiction, but Fun	2004-10-03	77	15	62

And his handling of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center was stunning. Even if you've seen the same footage countless times on television, Moore makes it feel as though you're experiencing it for the first time.I expected a lot of SNL-type potshots at the current administration. But, like an episode of PBS's ""Frontline,"" this film also presents well-documented investigative reporting that follows the money trail to very disturbing conclusions--which none of the principals have made any serious attempt to deny.Hype aside, this is a gripping take on a subject that should interest all Americans, regardless of their personal political ideology.

They are so grateful that they want to kidnap/behead hostages, and plant bombs for our troops.Even when George W. put all his fine and rational intelligence into invading Iraq, he ignored Two Top level Military leaders who testified we would need (~500,000) several hundred thousand troops to secure the country AFTER the war.

Some of the parts were borderline ridiculous, like when it showed the kids playing with their kites in Iraq before we invaded it.  I think it is safe to say that Iraq was not some sort of utopia as it appeared to be in this scene before we invaded.  Another unfair part of the movie was when Michael Moore asked the politicians in DC to sign up their kids to go to war.  I think he should focus more on whether or not the actual politician was in the military, as it is certainly not the parents' decision to send their kid to war in most cases.  Some of the connections with the Saudi family might not be outright lies and Moore has sources for them, but its definately not a well-proven, matter-of-fact idea as this movie presented it.That said, I wish Michael Moore wasn't the hero of the Left in this country as he apparently is.  I think the reason that he has become so popular is because the Left needs something to cling onto because the Right has so many figures like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, FOX NEWS.  The Left needs some form of propaganda for people too lazy to read a book or listen to the radio to find out what is actually happening.  If the Left's hero were some other figure such as Eric Alterman or even Al Franken, I think that we would be a lot better off; the reason they aren't is because since they deal with more real issues and more real information many people find them boring.  While clearly biased, at least they deal with facts and more objective information than emotional appeal.  That being said, I guess it is better to have Michael Moore than no one to present propaganda for us.Don't get me wrong, I'm a Liberal Democrat and agree with Moore that Bush needs to go, but I don't think that this movie is fair.  Watch it, let it sink in, but don't take the movie too seriously.Just my 2 cents :)	3.0	Dont take this movie too seriously	2004-10-16	14	4	10

Michael Moore's film was extraordinary and it shows that President Bush lied to the American people. Why would he go to Iraq and capture Sadaam and he wasn't even the one who committed the 9/11 attacks, it was Al Queda in Afghanistan. Afghanistan/Iraq have no connections and he swore that Sadaam had weapons of mass destruction! And troops were sent over there to die for nothing and it was sad to see the Limpscomb family hurt about there child's death. They haven't found any weapons of mass destruction and troops and civilians are dying for nothing! People are getting beheaded and so forth. There was an interesting scene in the film where Moore and the marine tried to hand out flyers for the military to the Congressman to see if they would send there children in harms way! You should have saw the look on the Congressmans face. That whole administration is corrupt and Moore did a very good job of letting out the truth! And why didn't they have cameras in the room when the 9/11 COMMISION INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT BUSH AND DICK CHEANEY?? There is a special feature with Condellezza Rice answering questions from the 9/11 Commission and she said, ""BUSH WAS AWARE OF THE SECURITY REPORT FROM THE FBI BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11."" But Bush was too focused on playing golf at his ranch in Texas! 9/11 could have been prevented and Moore gets a standing ovation from me on this film because it is the truth!

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A18CA0GRHDVP8X	Earl Hazell	"I will break from my usual tradition of talking entirely too much about things that deeply affect me in the political realm and say quite simply that a refusal to see this movie by Michael Moore is synonymous with a refusal to actually be an American in the spirit of the founding fathers.Moore knew early on in his career that he would have to develop a marketable persona and larger (and more annoying) than life personality, such that the underlying messages of hope and faith in actual democracy inherent in his films would get out--along with the truth about the deadly direction some in America would like to take it. Like any skilled doctor needing to share a real diagnosis that no one wants to hear, he knew early on--from the days of ROGER AND ME--that the architects of the free market system that is slowly destroying democracy in America had far too much power over the media and interrelated institutions for his message to truly be heard any other way. This now near-iconic celebrity persona of his is what people of opposing viewpoints often debate about--forgetting, if actually ever knowing, that it is manufactured for one specifically noble purpose: get the truth OUT; out of the stale, impotent, universities; off the shelves of the dissident bookstores; out of the hands of the corpoarate leaders who know it will save lives and whole cultures but adversely affect their bottom line. In other words, getting the truth out of the hands of the spineless, useless and moral-less, and into the hands of everyday regular people, without whom the world would not even exist, let alone come to an end.In other words, do not make the mistake the marketplace has been hoping you'd make of confusing the messenger with the message. I saw this movie in the theatres with my teenage children months ago and it is still affecting my entire family. Hardcore Republican friends of mine who were also in the theatre were more dumbstruck and silent than I was.If there has ever been a little voice in your head that has questioned the inconsistencies of the very concept of terrorism as it has been defined by our current politicians; wondered why the search for Osama bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan--a country full of almost nothing but oil trade routes and the poorest people on earth--has somehow fallen off the radar screen with the (pre-planned) rise of Iraq; wondered if the manufactured image of our political leaders is what is actually guiding your support or refutation of their influence above and beyond their actual records of ""service""--and to what they have  actually been serving...if there is any part of your soul still clinging to life in this soul killing quasi-fascist state our beloved country seems to be falling toward, you will find a CPR for the mind, body and soul the likes of which you never experienced before in life with this movie.Michael Moore and FARENHEIT 9-11 have had a multitude of detractors for some time now. But I have yet to hear anyone, literally anyone, refer to the actual facts consistently proven and re-proven when they condemn him. Facts that have been purposely and consistently ignored by the corporate media in the evening news and daily papers--even in the context of their reviews of the movie, its unprecedented success as a documentary, or irrational personal attacks against him. Even the most intelligent and patriotic people on the opposite side of the fence revert to screaming children when critiquing this movie, totally ignoring the movie as a whole, or the most vivid and damaging of the facts within.The facts that make up this powerful and frightening documentary are too disturbing to be taken lightly. And yet the courage and artistry it takes to actually present these facts in an entertaining and informative way as Moore does is nothing short of astounding.Agree with it. Disagree with it. Call him names. Praise his name. Love him. Hate him. Just forget what you think about Michael Moore the person and see this movie, if you have ever once said you love this country. This movie is an absolute masterpiece--and undoubtedly the most important movie of any kind made in the past twenty years.  And given the Orwellian direction in which our democracy seems to be headed, owning a copy of it may have already left the realm of necessary luxury and become a moral imperative."	5.0	Propaganda is what will keep you FROM seeing this movie	2004-09-23	34	29	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3POLEU6T17739	E. Callaway	"I liked this movie a lot. Not because it was the greatest documentary ever, or that it was the most accurate: I liked it because it showed how free we really are in this country. We can call the president of our country a stupid liar and subtly play the guitar riff from ""Cocaine"" in the background while Mr. Moore's narrative spoke of what G.W. Bush was doing during the seventies. There are many nations where this would have gotten Mr. Moore into a great bit of trouble.I think Mr. Moore's methods are relatively sound in that he shoots from the hip and aims for the heart. Was everything in this movie 100 percent accurate? No. Was this a piece of propaganda? Yes. But at the same time it was propaganda, it dared to ask questions that not many people in the media are prepared to ask. Is the war in Iraq just? Was there another way out? Is everything being done to keep our troops safe? What is the real cost of the war?There were some amazingly powerful moments in Fahrenheit 9/11. Lila Lipscomb, the mother of an American Soldier who died in Iraq , reading her son's last letter to her. Lipscomb herself was the person who encouraged her son to join the military. Also very powerful was Mr. Moore's showing of the similarities between his run-down hometown of Flint Michigan and comparing them to pictures of post-battle/bomb Iraq.There were many parts in this film that I thought were appalling, but more than the rampant corruption in the government (which is almost par for the course these days. .) were the lies that the Marine recruiters told the people they encountered. Telling a sixteen year old that the Marines could set him up with a career in music, or getting complete contact information from on boy so they could ""take [him] off our list"" is simply wrong. That is sick. That in itself sets in people's mind, from the start, that these are people who should not be trusted, and that is not an example of the integrity that has been a beacon of the Armed Forces.My only real complaint in this is the fact that many people see everything Michael Moore does as truth and not a hyperbolic representation of the facts. There are even more, who lean toward the right, who see him as a liberal poster-child of anyone left of center. I know this in not Mr. Moore's intention, but it is a side-effect.In my mind, this movie accomplished some things. It showed that people who are liberal still love the United States . A consistent theme in the wake of September 11, 2001 was that people who question the government are traitors and that most of those who did the questioning were liberal. This film showed people who love their country enough to encourage their children to enlist in the services, and still love their country after their child was killed. It also set a precedent that we are again allowed to question the leadership of the country."	4.0	The Left's Answer to Bill O'Rielly  . . . Now Shut up. . .	2004-11-17	15	10	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2UCOSEHTW6I0H	Eddie Konczal	"""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier ""Bowling for Columbine"" and Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" that polarizes audiences along political lines.  If you like George W. Bush, chances are you'll hate ""Fahrenheit 9/11;"" if you can't stand Bush, you'll probably love it.  There's little room for middle ground in today's sharply divided American electorate.Many critics of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" claim the film is factually inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).Not exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is more of an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's hypothesis.  The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating indictment of Bush's policies.  You may disagree with the way Moore connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record (including actual quotes from Bush and his administration).For all the political weight it carries, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is entertaining as heck.  Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first half.  There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's ""Shiny Happy People.""  Moore examines the ""Coalition of the Willing,"" finding that our allies include ""superpowers"" like Pulau, The Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: ""Afghanistan? ...Oh, yeah. They had an army. OUR army!"") Moore also milks the Patriot Act for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).As events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker, and Moore gradually dispenses with humour in order to focus on the story of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war.  Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story belies his reputation for guerilla filmmaking.Near the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about our troops: ""They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?""  Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other valid questions raised by ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", instead focusing on discrediting Moore himself.  They must have felt vindicated when Bush narrowly won reelection in 2004.  But the election results do not invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film.  Rather, as our troops remain in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war fades into obscurity, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" remains all too relevant."	5.0	Burning Bush	2005-05-01	27	18	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AMNV4N9QR3Y5G	Eduward du Bois	This is I think the most important political movie in years. Some might call the film controversial, it is not for the Democrat leadership. A long list of Democrats is very positive about the movie. Senator Bob Graham (Democrat) told the New York Times at its premier in Washington: &quot;there might be half the Democratic Senate here.&quot; And indeed a lot of prominent Democrats where seen and interviewed by the press during the premier party of Fahrenheit 9/11. Tom Daschle (Democrats leader in Congress) was seen, as was Barbara Boxer and Terry McAuliffe (Democratic National Committee chairman). Terry was asked by CNN, &quot;Do you think the movie was essentially fair and factually based?&quot;, answer: &quot;I do&quot;.Kerrie's daughter event went to the world premier of the movie in France, where she was seen in her see through dress (...). But Kerry him self says he did not see it and does not need see the movie, because &quot;I've watched it for the last four years.&quot; (CNN)This leads me to think that this movie will show you a worldview that is representative for the majority of the Democratic Party leadership. In an US election year, that alone makes it a very important and powerful movie.In a lot of other reviews or on &quot;Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; by David Kopel you can see that the film is not very accurate on facts and is also not very consistent in it self. It is basically floats on (bad) feelings about American politics. As a European this leads me to our very own history. In World War II, it was the first time we created mass movements by mass media means. I never could really empathize of how the people in that time get all so energized with hatred by propaganda that was so out of touch with reason and facts, it all seems based on the most primary feelings. I always wondered, how this could prevail in a Western civilization that was made big by the contribution of reason?Fahrenheit 9/11 has an obvious and blunt disregards for facts and reason (the film even contradicts it self often), so I was shocked to see the alignment of the Democratic Party leadership with it. A more accurate reaction came from the Wall street Journal, they called Michael Moore the Leni Riefenstahl of our time. Although I thinks that is a bit over the top, Leni Riefenstahl, did something unique and did not have the knowledge of History, Michael Moore definitely knows history and uses it.Go see this movie, the Democratic Party reveals it self!	1.0	Feelings generate the truth!	2004-07-21	19	6	13
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a ""fictitious President"" who was leading us to a ""fictitious war"", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the filmmaking (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with ""Roger and Me"" or even ""Bowling for Columbine"". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib).  Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads ""The Pet Goat"" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S. Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.Moore has grown significantly since ""Roger and Me"" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden ""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry"" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country."	4.0	Master Provocateur Ups His Game, Reaps Dividends	2004-09-04	31	23	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A9L6L5H9BPEBO	Edwin C. Pauzer	"Five things struck me about this film that have stayed with me:1) President Bush's almost sphinx-like reaction to the news of the terrorist attack on 09/11;2) his weekend at the ranch clearing brush appearing as the common man's man while ignoring the August 6th memo that announced al-Qaeda was going to attempt an attack against the United States using airplanes;3) telling reporters (and forgive me, if I don't have it completely right) ""I think it's important that we all fight against terrorism."" Then, he segues to ""Now watch this shot."" as he steps up to the tee.4) the mother who lost her son in Iraq;5) The military targeting the poor for recruiting.The first image of President Bush in the classroom gives him the appearance of a clueless Captain Queeg who simply does not know what to do. That is not how I want our leader to react in a time of imminent crisis.The second image of our president at his ranch where he has spent 40% of his presidency suggests that the August 6th memo was not given its proper attention. No matter what spin neo con talk show radio hacks may want to say about Clinton, no one can seriously say that this president did not have the information to do something, to take some action other than standing in front of his pick-up and clear brush. As a reminder of how clueless this administration was, Condoleeza Rice was still promoting an upgraded nuclear ballistic missile system, and the attorney general, John Ashcroft placed terrorism under drug interdiction on his priority tree. That's how clueless these people were.The president talking about getting everyone to fight terrorism and then blithely segueing into, ""Now watch this shot,"" suggests that his prior comments were almost reflexive and insincere. It isn't appropriate to say, ""Now watch this shot!"" right after discussing terrorism.While filming the mother who lost a son in Iraq may seem to be a cheap shot at gaining sympathy, it does send another important message: this mother and other Americans who speak out against the war are patriots, far more so than the people who attempt to brand them as traitors.Moore makes an excellent point here about how the poor are so actively recruited for the military while congress keeps their sons and daughters out of harm's way, but are quite willing to send the children of others into harm's way. This is a very old tradition. The president was even the beneficiary of it, receiving a direct commission he did not have to earn, and being jumped over 600 other personnel waiting on the list for the Texas Air National Guard.I gave this only four stars because Spinsanity was able to find a number of misdirections and false impressions under Michael Moore's direction.Nevertheless, this is an important film worth seeing or purchasing.P.S.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2RIRVOV7BOZ77	EJ	"Clearly this is a movie with an agenda: to wake up America with the hopes of showing Bush the door in 2004.  It is all about igniting passions against what is portrayed as a corrupt and inept administration, not about presenting an unbiased look at Bush and Company.  Unlike certain ""so-called"" journalistic institutions on the Right, though, Michael Moore does not pretend to be ""fair & balanced"".  There is no pretense here.  The filmmaker is acting as a powerful advocate for his point of view, and in doing so, does not owe it to his audience to present ""both sides of the story"".Lord knows we're bombarded with the ""other side of the story"" every day by an anything-but-liberal mass media that is increasingly wary of criticizing the Bush administration for fear of being blacklisted as unpatriotic.  (The movie itself almost didn't make it to the theaters when its original distributors pulled the plug, allegedly the result of Bush cashing in a political favor).  Let us make no mistake, though, whether you agree with Moore's point of view or not, and whether you have a favorable impression of the sitting administration or not, Michael Moore is indeed a patriot.  Contrary to what certain pundits and talk-radio hosts would have you believe, Michael Moore is not a flag burner, rather he embraces the flag, but more importantly, he embraces its true meaning.  Contrary to much of the movie's unfounded criticism, one only needs to see the first ten minutes to realize that the filmmaker is a man who truly loves America.  His mission in creating the film and criticizing the present administration is not to bring down America, but rather to save it from itself.Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a perfect film, but its an important film.  Whether you sit on the right, on the left, or somewhere between, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  Whether or not you agree with the film's point of view, Michael Moore should be applauded precisely because he is sparking the sort of heartfelt debate in our society that has been silent since the horrors of September 11th.  For the three years since the attacks, we, as a society, have been understandably numb as we began to heal from the shock of the new reality that has been thrust upon us.  As the scabs of our wounds begin to peel, though, it is vital that we bring a spirit of discourse back to this country, lest this freedom we prize so dearly degenerate into nothing more than a kinder, gentler totalitarianism."	5.0	Stirring Passions in the Midst of an Era of Numbness	2004-09-04	31	21	10

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AYFZF8SRPQS6F	E. K Patterson	Anyone who bases their November vote on this movie is an idiot. The first 45 minutes of this movie could have been left on the cutting room floor. Gore did NOT win in Florida (as the NYTimes, the LATimes, AP, and several FL newspapers all proved with their own recounts), but does Michael Moore care about this fact? No. He continues to propagate the myth that the election was &quot;stolen&quot; by Bush. Moore then goes on a long, convoluted and exceedingly boring examination of the Bush family relationship with the Saudi royal family and the Bin Ladens. According to Michael Moore, all Saudis are evil terrorists and anyone associated with them in any way is guilty by association. This segment of the film is entirely pointless.The most annoying aspect of the film are the flat out, bald faced lies. Michael Moore says at one point that, Iraq &quot;had never threatened any American.&quot; In August of 1990, Saddam Hussein threatened 10,000 Americans living in Iraq and Kuwait when he announced his intention to use them as human shields if the UN forces invaded Iraq. Many Americans were taken into custody by the Iraqi's (and held for months) in preparation for this. Also, Iraq shot at UN airplanes (provided by the US) patrolling the no-fly zones on a daily basis. If he had bothered to do some research, Moore would have known this. Personally, I think Michael Moore DID know this, he just left it out in an attempt to make his movie stronger. Just like he left out images of the torture committed by Saddam's regime. Saddam had people thrown from buildings, beaten with hammers, torn apart by dogs, toungues cut out, eyeballs gouged out. The list goes on and on. For Michael Moore to leave all of this out just proves how weak his argument is in the first place. If he is so hell-bent on telling the truth, he should include Saddam's actions as well. The only reason he doesn't bring up Saddam's human rights abuses, as well the environmental catastrophes he purposely caused, is because they justify the war.As for his protrayal of African-Americans? I'll just say that if a conservative had done this movie it would be labeled racist. Michael Moore makes it look like Black people are all destitute, broke, unemployed and living in projects that look &quot;just like Baghdad&quot; (according to one young man).Michael Moore is typical of what has become of the Democratic party. A bitterly angry group of people who preach that the views and opinions of everyone are important, except for rich white men. Hate is wrong, unless the object of your hate is a rich white man. I'm not saying that rich white men haven't added their fair share of misery to this world. But if hate is wrong, it has to be wrong on all acounts.This movie requires you to check your brain at the door. You have to suspend all disbelief and buy into Moores depiction of Bush as an evil minded troll for this movie to be even halfway watchable. Nevermind that George Bush gave basic civil rights to 23 million Iraqis and 28 million Afghanis (the kind of rights we enjoy in the US that enabled Moore to even make this movie in the first place - I wonder how political documentarians fared in Saddam's Iraq???). Nevermind that Iraq now has the first chance at representative government in it's history. Nevermind that one of the worst human rights abusers and environmental abusers in history is now in jail where he belongs. Apparently, none of that was more important than the fact that Michael Moore doesn't like George Bush. My response: So what?	1.0	Boring, Aimless, Racist and Disingenuous	2004-07-20	103	37	66

""Misleading"", perhaps. ""Biased"" perhaps. But every fact in Farenheit 9/11 was backed up with at least one, preferably more, mainstream media reports.Enough of the wingnuts. How's the movie? Well:1. Flawed. Michael Moore throws a lot of stuff out onto the carpet that is suggestive, but doesn't go anywhere, like the stuff about the Saudi royals (""Bandar Bush"", anybody?).2. Powerful. You will laugh. You will cry. If you saw it in the theater, you'll know what I'm talking about. I left at the end of the movie emotionally drained and mad as hell about George W.

Did I mention that it's powerful?In the end, despite this movie's well-publicized flaws, I have to call it what it is: A must-see experience, especially in this election season, where you need to see this movie even if you are a Bush supporter.

It also peers into the strong influence of the Saudi government and it's awful human rights record and it's cozy relationship with the Bush dynasty and it's oil companies.Some of things I saw ranged from outrageous and horrifying to some being laughably funny especially with how low the officials in Washington really are. One especially made me want to barf in a paper jet bag.I am really ticked off at the 'liberal-bashing' that I have seen here. As a previous reviewer somewhere pointed out, Do you even know what either liberal or conservative mean??!!!! In all honesty, people should never label someone as a 'liberal' or 'conservative' because the truth is is that people I believe are a mix of both political perspectives. I am offended at all of this 'liberals suck' garbage coming from every direction and I am appalled at how low we have come. Liberal and Conservative are NOT black and white!!!!!!!This is a must-see film.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A321JXBZMK6VGX	Elizabeth Howard	"What a shame.3 Stars for pure entertainment value. I laughed for a while, until I was thoroughly insulted by the overall presentation...Michael Moore had an amazing and potentially convincing set of facts that he could have used as the basis for a genuinely moving condemnation of the current (and former Bush) administration(s). Instead, in the name of ""entertainment,"" he resorted to a presentation of material that is, at best, misleading, and at worst, outright deceptive. Not because of a lack of factual content-that was present. What wasn't present was a respectful presentation of information that even a moderately educated and open-minded person would hope for. The film resorts to overly emotional and exploitative presentation of facts that end up overshadowing the content that really could have had impact.I went into the film with high expectations. I wanted to see a balanced presentation of information that subtly and impressively drew conclusions regarding the lack of honesty and integrity of the current administration. Instead, I saw a poorly conceived attempt to make the President look like an idiot-and despite the fact that I personally have HUGE problems with the present administration, I left more angry with the insulting and emotional presentation of the facts Moore sited than with the actions of the Administration he was trying to condemn.Sure, if you have leftward leanings, you might leave the theater shouting ""YEAH!!...See??? I told you Bush was a dishonest moron."" But then again, it's easy to pander to an audience that's already convinced of your main premise. It's preaching to the choir.On the other side of the aisle, viewers coming from the right hand perspective probably perceived the overly emotional and biased manner in which the information was presented, and left feeling nothing but insulted. Moore missed an opportunity to present facts in a credible manner that actually might have swayed people on that side of the aisle in the direction he hoped.Speaking of swaying opinion, can anyone who saw this film actually believe that it could alter the opinion of anyone? It's a scary thought to me that people could be swayed by scenes like Moore's insulting presentation of the President in the classroom when he was informed of the first plane hitting the tower on 9/11. The dramatic music. The focus on the President's face that-if you watch-simply took a snapshot of time when his facial expression could have been interpreted as confused. And you know what, he might have been confused for a moment at that time. What was the plane? A commuter jet? A prop job? What should he have done? Jumped up in the middle of a room full of children and shouted ""Holy SH*&^, kids. We're under attack!! Get under your desks!!!"" Gimme a break. Could he have gotten up, and gracefully and quickly exited at that point? Sure. He stayed with the children in that classroom for 7 minutes. Maybe that's 6 minutes too long. I don't know. Moore offered no real alternatives to what should have been or could have been accomplished at that point in time.I consider myself to be a centrist. I no longer identify with either Party-partially because of the partisan crap that is personified by this movie, as well as it's poorly thought out literary response by the right, ""Unfit for Command"" (yeah, sure, it was initiated by Swift boat personnel, right...). It's films like this and books like that that make me want to avoid the entire political process-because everything get presented on such a slant that I just tend to fall right off.It seems to me that we'll only make real progress toward bipartisanism when somebody actually steps up to the plate and says ""I will not engage in the political rhetoric that is intended to impugn the integrity of people on the other side of the issue."" Some people say that you have to fight fire with fire. No you don't. You fight fire by taking a different road that leads to real integrity. You don't engage in the childish argument that says ""Well, they shot first, so we had to respond.""This film does nothing more than continue to drive a wedge between people, pander to its already zealous audience, and insult the integrity of its viewers.And it's a damn shame, becaue Michael Moore had the facts that people need to be exposed to."	3.0	An unfortunate missed opportunity......	2004-09-02	39	13	26

Now that got me cracking up, but while he was firts in office there realy is not a lot you can do ohter then sit there so i dont blame the man.However when Bush found out abut the attacks while he was in that classroom he did just sit there when he found out, yet by his face expresions he appeared to be in shock. Perosnally i thnk anyone would be also. He did not look to intrested in reading that book anymore and appeared he was thinking on what he could do.

The segment on the ""Coiliton of the Willing"" depicting very stereotype images of the countries.However, I don't understand the reviews that totally discount Moore's film being a bunch of lies. When Moore uses clips of the president saying  dangerous statements such as ""Bring it on"", he is not lying. When he presents the mother of a soldier who has died he is not lying. I was happy to see Moore step away from these segments to let the mother tell her story.  Letting someone share there stories, feelings and experience, especially one that we rarely have the opportunity to hear is not exploitative. The woman at the end of the movie that tells the grieving mother not to believe the protesting woman, that ""this is all staged"" reminds me of the negative reviews. The greiving mother tells the skeptical woman that her son died in the war and she discounts it by saying, ""well a lot of people have died"". Some people in this country want to believe something so bad that they will say something is a lie even when it is it in their face. Everyone take the time to watch this film so that you can wake up.

I find myself thinking about Farenheit  9/11 whenever the stench of  stealth bubbles up in Washington, which seems to be more and more frequently and more and more serious.  Michael Moore probably has more patriotism in his pinky finger than can be mustered up in the whole of  Washington, yet Mr. Moore takes the criticism for speaking out.Suggest you check out the writings of Maj.

You either love Michael Moore's work or you don't. I think it is safe enough to say that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" polarized both the liberals and conservatives. If anything learned from the controversy over ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", there are three conversation topics that makes people's blood boil it has to be: 1) abortion, 2) religion, and 3) politics. Michael Moore's political film really succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. I first saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when it first opened in the summer. I loved it. I thought it was far more entertaining than ""Bowling For Columbine"" (although I do love that film). I think it is funny that people think this film is propaganda. Maybe it is but I honestly don't care, I found the film both hilarious and engaging. I had my opinions on the current political climate long before ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". This movie didn't change anything for me. My biggest gripe about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that Michael Moore makes too many innuendos (not that they weren't hilarious which they were)about the current administration therefore sounded like a thirteen year old taunting another kid on the playground instead of an adult, very childish, if not immature at times. Still I couldn't help but laugh at his innuendos. When the film shifted into a more serious tone with the war in Iraq and Lila Lipscomb, I thought that is the film's strength. Michael let the soldiers and Lila tell their side of the story. Watching ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" reminded me how powerful this film was, especially when the film opened up with just the sounds of people running away from the World Trade Towers on 9/11. My favorite moment in the film has to be when Michael Moore borrows an ice cream truck and drives around Capital Hill reading out loud the Patriot Act because the senators and congressmen (allegedly) never bothered reading the Patriot Act. That really floored me. I also thought it was rather prophetic of Michael to try to enlist the children of various politicians who have all voted for the war in Iraq. The dvd bonus features were just as compelling. I especially was interested in what the Arab-American comedians had to say, particularly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I also enjoyed watching the footage where the producer and camera crew went to before and (allegedly) after the war in Iraq. Overall I loved ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and I refuse to apologize for the fact that I love this film. Did it really change my opinions on the current political climate? No but I was thoroughly entertained."	5.0	Provocative and entertaining	2004-10-06	46	32	14

It delivers a serious message  with verifiable facts in a way that moves people to tears and laughter, seconds apart from each other.2. The movie is controversial.  It tells the story of how our current President and his administration have ties to oil interests in the Middle East, an old hatred of Saddam (""tried to kill my Daddy""), and a heretofore unmatched ability to make the wrong decisions based on preconceived and premeditated agendas without considering the costs in human lives or human dollars.3.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A20ASR095FA6IV	Eric Hewlett	I don't understand why people are asking for the other side, as if every statement or fact has two sides. Like someone saying you are going to die and someone saying wait a minute that is biased I want to hear a lie saying that we might not die.First off amongst the Western World our proud country is ranked number one in terms of poverty, amount of people without healthcare, amount of citizens that are in jail, amount of pollution being produced etc. While the Dutch are becoming models of the International Labor Organization (ILO)concepts of Flexicurity and Development, and while places like Norway and Sweden have the lowest amount of poverty in the World. In the US while farmers no longer count in the census as 3 companies own and grow almost all the food in America--this form of production has shown to be inefficient as despite the US being world's largest and most powerful agricultural exporter it also has an estimated 30 million people suffering from inadequate diets with the amount of children living in poverty rising by more than 15 percent in the 1980s.Market led development instead of being efficent--this pattern of development is instead a paradoxical system of rapid growth of food(in the case of food) production leading to perpetual overproduction accompainied by &quot;reinforcement of social exclusion and thus the growth of hunger&quot; . (Frederick H. Buttel, 2000). Mean while currently everyone in Cuba is properly fed as small farms have in every case proven to be more efficient allowing for more workers and better distribution of food.This is occuring while, America is currently experiencing massive balance of payments crises, as massive growth of trade surpluses accumulated in Asia and the EU by the year 2000 the U.S. ran up a $430 billion trade deficit while, Western Europe's 350 million consumers increasingly have purchased European made goods (Petras, 2002). As Petras (2002 ) states during the year 2000 &quot;over 2/3 of EU trade was inter-European&quot; (p. 294). In Latin America, European MNCs, particularly the Spanish, have outbid U.S. competitors in buying up lucrative privatized enterprises. Meanwhile, the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has been designed to balance out the powers of Europe, has so far been characterized more by exploitation than integration and is not yet a common market (Montezemolo 2000: 4).While our currency is now only half that of the British pound and while more of Americas public is heavily indebted, according &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Time&quot; our military is also spread out and the US not only can not afford proper health care for its soldiers it won't allow anyone to go home even if their contract is through because it is so massively understaffed.The facts are grim the US is seeing massive unemployment and poverty like nowhere else in the Western world. If there is another side to this it is at least companies like Nestl?, Monsanto, et cetera have still been making huge profits. Which while ? the world population (which includes people living in the US) live on 2 dollars a day, our president wont rest until OPEC stops trying to tax the rich by stopping tax heavens, and god willing He will continue to make the middle class pay for massive subsides which go to a handful of Transnational Coroporations (TNCs) (for farms the latest farm bill was 75 billion dollars to encourage over production as &quot;The Economist&quot; reports this has led to the Rocky Mountain's being filled with butter, while many in America go without food).So there is your second side enjoy, sometimes the truth like DEATH's money is a one sided coin. In the case of your mortality, in the case of the environmental distruction, in the case of the failure's of US policy to lead to growth with equity, it is all tails.	5.0	How Many Sides Does the Truth Need?	2004-07-28	15	9	6

A well-done indictment of the behind-the-scenes workings and connections of the Bush family and bin Ladens and how Bush's decisions warrant more in-depth examination. However one feels about Michael Moore's in-your-face, unrelenting style, or his facts/research (he was armed to the teeth with researchers and backed up facts this time), the key point of Moore's work (here and in his other films and books) is that he presents his take on issues but does not ask or want viewers/readers to take him at face value. His work is about challenging people NOT TO ACCEPT what they are fed or told-- but to question, dig and find out their own answers.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	"Michael Moore is the pre-eminent cinematic muckraker of our time, hands down.  And now, with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, he has outdone himself by leaps and bounds.This film is as infuriating and provocative as any film that has ever been made, documentary or otherwise, in history.  With sometimes satirical narration by the man himself, we get a glimpse at the administration of George W. Bush, from the 2000 Florida election debacle to post-9/11 hysteria and the invasion of Iraq that has cost the lives of close to one thousand of our soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians so far.  The Bush/Bin Laden connections; Dick Cheney's Haliburton past; the complicity of the news media in rallying support around this war, particularly with respect to Fox News; the passage of the now-venal so-called ""Patriot Act"" without a single objection in either house of Congress--all of these things and more are bought out in savage detail.  For me, the most troubling and disturbing moment in FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the sequence in which Bush is reading to kids in the school in Florida at the moment one of his aides tells him of the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower--and we look at his glassy stare.  Some have merely chalked it up to showing a brave face on Bush's part; others chalk it up to his supposed ineptness.  I didn't feel either way, though.  I could see the wheels turning in his mind--that with the World Trade Center now nothing but a seven-story pile of rubble, he had been given the perfect excuse to launch a war.It is very easy for Bush's supporters to say this film and its creator are both unpatriotic, that it is slanted so far to the left that it isn't even worth the time to comment.  But from the opening moments of the Iraq war, those same supporters, with the complicit help of right-wingers like the Fox News Channel and blowhards like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh have shoved plenty of their own propoganda down the throats of the American people under the guise of patriotism, freedom, and democracy.  And NONE OF THEM has EVER served in combat.  Not one.  But they have no problem sending poor or working-class kids over there to get killed for a slogan.  Those are questions Moore is asking and demanding straightforward answers to, and that's what makes him a true patriot.  His film merely serves to balance the scales, and if it means turning the far right's apple cart totally over, then so be it.  This is what America is all about.However one feels about Bush or America or Michael Moore himself, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 demands to be seen at least once.  It demands us to ask of ourselves how we got to where we are now, and how we can get back on track to make this nation of ours great once more.  Any film that can ask the tough questions and provoke such a firestorm of response is, for me personally, a masterpiece of the highest order.

Nothing is more eye opening than watching deceptive people being their usual deceptive selves...over and over again. Some highlights: Congress critters scurrying for cover from the unfriendly cameras, businessmen talking about how to divvy up the loot from the occupied Iraq, El Shrubbo talking about ""smoking him out"" and then saying ""I don't care where he is"". And of course Britney Spears showing us that quite a few of the MTV watching airheads NEED to be drafted. Yep, it's a monumental tragi-comedy playing out here as we go from the Florida Fiasco of 2000 to the destruction and desolation of Ground Zero to the ongoing disaster of Afghanistan, which is a brief stop since we are on to bigger and better things in Iraq in no time. Along the way we learn that our country is bankrolled by Saudis, El Shrubbo snorted lines and went AWOL after dodging combat in Vietnam (a perfect role model for his freeper following), and most importantly, many people can be cowed by fear and nationalism into going along with anything someone with an Austrian or Texan accent tells them. Where it really does its damage is when it shows the victims suffering the consequences. As in dead and wounded and those they left behind. The war supporters are up a creek trying to justify those kind of sacrifices for the Big Lie. But this movie is also ultimately inspirational for it shows us that no matter what the next four years hold, we can rest assured knowing the Republic of Palau will be there sacrificing with us every step of the way."	4.0	A Political Screed...and a damn good one!	2004-11-23	12	8	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A32R2HB7JUKA80	E. Schechter	This movie does have something of a spin to it. I think most mature American voters are quite capable of discounting the spin and addressing the issues raised, which are important ones; the movie may or may not influence their votes. I found much of what was shown extremely interesting and worth looking for more information about. Other parts of the film I discounted as hyperbole resulting from a passion against a certain political viewpoint.But, although the film does have its own slant, it has never been claimed to be more than one man's view of events; it should be understood as such. And any critic who says that in this free country a person expressing a different political view from his own is a traitor has a very distorted view of what the United States is supposed to be about. Mr. Moore has put forward his entry into the &quot;free marketplace of ideas.&quot; People of different views have done the same, and some of them also have opinions of interest. Truly, it is possible for people of honor to be loyal and well-intentioned, yet still to hold different ideas about the policies that would govern this country best. People on each side are entitled to try to win others over to their viewpoints. Personally, I liked the film very much. If some people didn't--hey, free country, right?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2DG2TEDAWY7BO	Etienne Lorenceau	"Michael Moore had a chance to do a phenomenal film on American society and foreign policy but he allowed himself to be drawn into a partisan pre electoral film: this will substantially reduce the historical value of the film.The first third of the film on George W Bush is shooting below the belt (and I'm French so I supposedly should have liked that). His placing thoughts into the president's mind at the time the planes hit the towers is a nasty slanted cinema gimmick. For the President to feel distressed in such a circumstance and keeping a face as he measures the importance and the consequences of such an important drama shows dignity. The trick of placing a voice over with ridicule comments does not.So you'll have to wait until the film gets out of the finding ridicule in George W. Bush (which fortunately comes soon enough) to get into a great film.Then Michael Moore takes us with his great talent into real and deep political problems (including the Bush family economical involvement with the Bin Laden family), and the film gets into its claimed humanist tone keeping drama out of the grave tone. These later two third of the movie are just superb.The reaction of the senators being requested to have their children enlisted will go down in history.So don't get this comment wrong: despite its partisan aspect, it is a great film, an absolute ""must see"" whether you are a Republican or Democrat."	4.0	Philosophy or politics	2004-06-29	15	7	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ABOVJGQGGD67C	"Eugene Spanier ""butthebreathofafirefly"""	There were many reasons why America needed a film like Farenheit 9/11 but I didn't expect one of them to be its rumoured censorship. As a non-American, who has always been impressed by the degree to which America defends its rights, I am amazed. HOW CAN AMERICANS ACCEPT THIS? It gives the impression that they are spending their lives asleep.What Michal Moore has assembled in this film is a unique collage of perspectives regarding contemporary Amercian history and politics. Some have called it demagoguery, I think it would be more aptly called an expos&eacute;. Moore supports his claims with such eye-popping, authentic documents, that people lean forward in their cinema seats to examine them, almost in disbelief and even when Moore has already projected them at a high level of magnification.Take for example one of Bush's war record documents. Moore not only has the unclassified copy, but he also exhibits the classified one. Another eye popper is the official list of Saudi nationals who are secretly transported out of the States on September 13th, a day on which all flights were supposed to have been grounded. This is confirmed by a government official. Another document illustrates a business deal in which a Bush family member is financially involved with a bin Laden family member.Not one to go half way, Moore has candy not only for the eyes.Often through the film, I notced the audience was dead silent. People were concentrating mightily on what was being said. One example is a large business meeting where a fellow with a thick accent tells a room full of businessmen that there is lots and lots of money to be made from this war.It's not unusual for wars to provide boosts to economies, but the eager, almost hand rubbing look of contractors moving in to profit from blood and destruction explains much better than Moore can in his own words, the reason why so much attention has been and is being focused on Iraq: it is the #2 oil producer in the world.While documents and interviews make good support for documentary, Michael Moore does not settle for soundbites alone. Several powerful interviews are revisited through the film and American soldiers give some astonishing insights but the most poignant message in this film comes from an interview with the mother, Lila Lipscombe, of a recently kiiled American soldier. (I'm embarrassed and sorry I'm can't exaclty recall what his first name is.). Whether we're hearing her, or her husband speak we still get the same impression: these are good, decent, back bone of America people who simply want to know why the killing is necessary, and who sympathize and empathize with the suffering and grieving of others.You might  form different opinions about Michael Moore, but when it comes to this family you cant help but do one thing: share their pain.What I came to realize after watching this film is the difference between Michael Moore and George Bush. Bush believes that people who criticize him are criticizing America while Michael Moore knows that criticism of Bush has nothing to do with the Office of the President or the American people, it is simply a democratic response to Bush's policies and actions, which in Moore's mind are dubious.The most important notion expressed in this film comes at its close. Moore states, over an enigmatic image that, in our world,  there is a specific, entrenched socio-political structure that exists and the only way we are going to make progress as a society is to overcome our ignorance and engage in democracy as responsible citizens. That's not the exact wording, but thats what I took from it.I strongly urge you to see it and consider his assertions. There are the occasional cornysend-up, along with harrowing war footage, the likes of which CNN seems loathe to broadcast. Yet ultimately, Moore's story is an authentic American one, that does not belong to him, but is being told through him and in his style. A tapestry that is part parody, part imitation of popular American culture, and part plain narrative.It is to Moore's credit that the film is effective not simply as pop entertainment that tugs regularly at emotions, but also as a tragedy in which we are all implicated. Even before I left this film, I felt quite a gamut of emotions, one of them being shame for my lack of action to try and stop this invasion during which so many civilians needlessly suffered or died, and during which much of the country has been razed.My impression by the end of the film is that the country of Iraq has been reduced to ruins, like a wrongfully  convicted criminal , as the jackals have moved in to pave the way for its exploitation.	5.0	The new standard	2004-06-26	29	19	10

If this film carried a fraction the weight of Moore himself it would be a substantial film indeed.""There is no terrorist threat!"" That is a direct quote from Michael Moore. I swear I am not making that up!!! I have seen him on TV saying those exact words; if you have doubts check out his biography on the IMDB. They credit that quote to him as well. To be fair, I don't know whether he said that before or after 9/11 but it really dosen't matter. Either way it shows a profound disconnection with reality, and you can be sure that this film is entirely colored with the same type of rhetoric. Here is another typical Moore quote. ""The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.' They are the Revolution, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win.'' Its almost impossible to believe he actually said that. If stupidity was a sport he would be olympic champion. They are not insurgents or terrorists? Let me tell you, if I were a terrorist and I had to pick my campaign manager, Moore would be my first choice. These quotes don't have anything to do with the movie in and of themselves, but you need to see what Michael Moore really believes to put the film into some sort of context.What Moore is doing in this film is nothing new and its really very simple. His film uses tricks that date back even before the great Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. Moore is merely using clever editing and movie magic to completely manipulate the truth. Moore has theories but no facts to back them up; so what does he do? He goes out and completely fabricates the facts. What you as the viewer has to decide is: Do I care that Moore gets his point across, even if it's in a dishonest way? I personally don't like to be lied to; you may feel differently though.Jean-Luc Godard the famous filmmaker and founding member of the French new wave said of Moore: ""Post-war filmmakers gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary."" I didn't say that; a French filmmaker did. Now if a Frenchman (they are generally very anti-war/Bush) can see through the lies of this film, it shouldn't be a problem for any American to do the same.Don't get me wrong, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a pack of boldface lies and manipulations but if you watch carefully you will see upon closer inspection that Michael Moore is, in fact, enormously fat.This film is cleverly edited for sure; you have to give Moore credit for that.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A23IV3DK4EAXJH	"fCh ""fCh"""	Upon hearing his Oscar acceptance speech, a rather large part of the select Hollywood crowd booed Michel Moore at open stage. And with similar contempt have been treated most of those in the minority opposing/questioning the War in Iraq. All these were taking place while the official politicians and mainstream media were going along.Now that Mr. More set out to give a fuller version of his position, people from several quarters are quick to hold him at higher standards than the current executive has ever been subject to. The saddest part, as Mr. Moore concedes, is that while such treatment is understandable from career politicians it becomes way out of place when coming from the anchors in the official (oops, I meant mainstream) media. Indeed, one can only shriek at the viciousness with which the likes of Matt Lauer &CO; are attacking &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and, worse yet, Mr. Moore himself.Anyway, coming to the Fahrenheit 9/11, pity on those who needed Mr. Moore's movie to open their eyes to what has happened for all this time. Pity for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it should have been the jobs of the elected (and not only aspiring) political opposition and the mainstream media to question this administration's rationale for going to war. Secondly, Moore does only a partial and somehow biased job--and there is plenty of reasonable critique addressing this at Amazon.com --at untangling the reasons for the war. Overplaying the emotional card with the poor Flint MI mother or somehow justifying the War on presidential family ties or oil interests seems a little myopic/naive. As a film-maker, Moore passes; As a historian/documentarian he fails; As a pamphleteer he passes with flying colors! Henceforth, the four star rating.Now, I would like to pose to you, the reader, the following question: How will Moore's movie change the political debate in this country? For it is clear that taking things out of context of what has been the &quot;civil&quot; bounds and using them with an electoral goal may poison for good the future political debate. Indeed, if the non-written agreement around transmissible material is broken, as in the case of Mr. Wolfowitz's licking his comb or Mr. Bush's driving a golf ball, the hell may break loose. In any event, nothing prevents the current administration's backers from bankrolling a similar project directed at their political opponents. So, is this yet another first step in an arms race whose result has not necessarily been more responsive/responsible politicians? Then, as consequence, the cynics or the uninvolved citizenry may well fall back on the same arguments, &quot;they all do it, it's all a scam anyway,&quot; for not making the most of the wonderful democratic machine at work in America. Let's only hope that the most effect of Mr. Moore's movie will be indeed the mobilization to vote of the 50% segment of uninvolved citizenry.As a side note, there is no need to bring back the memory of Mr. Clinton for his consciousness cannot be all clear after Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sudan, etc. In Mr. Clinton's defense one can only invoke &quot;it was the economy stupid!&quot; and not the litany of relative and partial metrics.As a second side note, here's Mr. Moore's acceptance speech: &quot;Whoa. On behalf of our producers Kathleen Glynn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I have invited my fellow documentary nominees on the stage with us, and we would like to - they're here in solidarity with me because we like nonfiction. We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fictition of duct tape or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you. And any time you got the Pope and the Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much.&quot;To sum it all up, beyond laughter or despair, this movie should mark a moment of sobriety about the current and future states of the affairs of the realm. Provided that the electorate and the politicians do their jobs, (on November and in Congressional Comissions/Committees, respectively), Fahrenheit 9/11 will remain just a talented pamphleteer's opus and not some bad omen for things to come. And only then the biggest failure of all, the American Media Establishment, will not afford not to take notice.	4.0	&quot;Veritas odit moras / Truth hates delay, &quot; Seneca's Oedipus	2004-07-20	14	10	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A26NUSD59XTG7C	Felicia Filsdotter	"This is a profoundly disturbing film.  It is a very human film -- more human than previous Moore films -- which is evident from the start, when we see the events of 9/11 in New York not via the oft-seen picture of the planes crashing into the towers, but via the expressions of the people on the ground.  The emphasis on people continues throughout, as we see documentary footage on the ground in Iraq, the reactions of a gung-ho military mom who learns of her son's death, the juxtaposition of injured Iraqi children with news briefings on the ""intelligence"" of the targeting missiles, and scenes of amputated veterans whose benefits Bush seeks to decrease while the military continues to aggressively recruit soldiers from those who have no way out of the poorest areas of the country.  In a cinematically engaging manner, and with strenuously documented information, the film cannot help but portray the morally insupportable stance of a war which is provoked by greed and sustained by misinformation and fear-mongering.  The only thing that might be more disturbing than the film itself is the choice of some viewers to suppress any human response to it."	5.0	Disturbing	2004-06-25	10	5	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AJWDOCM9BLAQ3	Fernando	"From the reviews I've read so far it's obvious to see how polarized views on this film -and current American discourse for that matter- are. Yet it is hard to talk about it without revealing one's own feelings about the war.Overall the film was well done, both in content and structure. And contrary to what the reviews written here by the right-wing sympathizers  (consisting usually of one paragraph and saying nothing substantive about the movie-just ad hominem attacks against Moore) there are no lies in this movie. Moore himself has said he thought about offering $10,000 to anyone who finds anything factually wrong in it, yet some in the right love to bash it. Ironic, since the reasons this administration used for taking the US to war have been proven inaccurate -to say the least-, but the ""Party of Self-Responsibility"" does not seem to admit to them. I'm willing to bet that most of these reviewers who give the movie one star have not even watched it.What the movie contains however, is a string of selective facts that Moore can be very manipulative in using. A good example is the footage of Iraqi civilians on the eve of the war; children flying kites, happy families,  followed by... the attacks. This is followed by scenes of mayhem and death, and one particularly heartbreaking scene of a bloody baby wailing while being carried to a hospital (that scene still haunts me). This was an undeniable part of the war, this really happened, and Moore elicits from the audience the response he intended. Yet as I watched this, I thought that if instead of those scenes he had chosen footage of Saddam'storture houses, children being tortured in front of their parents, wives being raped in front of their husbands and children, then the response to the bombing from the audience would have been a very different one. This was part of the war too.Further, while I believe there was foul play in the 2000 elections, I would not go as far as Moore. And seriously, can anyone say with a straight face that the last name Bush HAD NOTHING TO DO with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of junior? Yet Moore builds up this case in a way that makes it seem as a watertight conspiracy theory, when in reality it was many people, at many levels of government, putting aside objectivity and integrity and ruling out on partisan allegiance, not unlike a struggling democracy elsewhere. Moore does show an amazing amount of papers and concrete proof to base his argument on, but again, one is left feeling that it could not be so ""perfect"" as Moore would have you believe.The documentary does articulate the outrage of many people who feel we were taken to war for dubious reasons, and then it turned out that those reasons were downright wrong. Right now American credibility around the world is zero, and half the people in this country feel the same way about the Bush administration. Moore's intention with this movie is to keep Bush for winning office again, which is in my view a necessary step for our own survival and to signal the rest of the world that this country does not approve of the lies we have been fed. If re-elected, we will be seen as co-conspirators and American reputation will sink even deeper. Although this reader needs no convincing, Moore's film makes the case even more persuasive.In the end if Michael Moore hates America or not only he must know; but raising a mirror to America's face is probably the most patriotic you can do right now.Fahrenheit 9/11 ends with a thought that should be given nothing but respect and approval from the audience; ""Our young men and women put themselves on the line and ask that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary."" How some people can say they agree while at the same time still support what Bush has done -all evidence against him- is to live a contradiction. Yes, Saddam Hussein was the scum of the earth and his sons and cronies were no better, but this was not our war to fight. If the reasons for taking us to war were to ""bring the gift of freedom from the Almighty"" to Iraq or oil or strategic security or whatever, accusations of WMDs and imaginary links to al quaeda do not justify it. That the people who did everything possible not to serve in uniform when it was their duty, are the ones who now so carelessly take us to war, is nothing less than a tragedy."	4.0	Worth Watching	2004-08-29	79	58	21

I however had different reasons for not watching this mainly because being an Irishman I thought that since I do not vote in the American elections it's not really going to help me that much. I wouldn't say that this was a flaw......it's just that it felt like a propaganda machine about George W Bush's time in power and how he used September 11th 2001 to his advantage and if you really did watch this you'd really have to vote John Kerry............so here we are, Bush is still in power ( so much for the propaganda working ) and so I finally watch the documentary. And it is shocking. You see the horrors of the brutality of war and there is no sugary-sweet rendition and you see that American media is not allowed to show the mass amount of American coffins and the changes in the opinion of one Lila Lipscomb. Beforehand she's just a regular "" conservative Democrat "" who is proud that her son and others are fighting to free the Iraqi people. But from what? The people there seem not to mind Saddam. Even though I'm skeptical that all Iraqis love Saddam I do have to wonder where George Bush got these Iraqis thanking him that he freed the Iraqi people.....it's a very strange set of affairs when you find that most of the children in Iraq are at a funfair while GWB declares war on Iraq. It pretty much is certain that this was an agenda motivated by the fact that we "" don't forget this guy almost shot my daddy dead."" Which shows that Iraq was an entirely personal agenda which doesn't even begin to explain how dangerous this president is.What I find more disturbing is the one elderly Iraqi woman feeling completely enraged by what is happening to her fellow countrymen. She's almost manic with rage and tears for her dead countrymen and women. It's frightening and I can fully sympathize with her. When Lila discovers that her son had died in the line of duty and feels similar feelings of dismay and betrayal....although it is moving you don't honestly get the same sense of violent rage and, as bad as this probably sounds, you don't feel as sorry for her ( which I sincerely do feel sorry for her don't get me wrong ) as the Iraqi woman. Besides after seeing how the American army treated it's prisoners it's really hard for you to portray them as the good guys.While there are a few inaccuracies somewhere in the film ( you probably might see them along the way, you might not ), and you may still get the overriding sense that this is a propaganda machine ( if you live outside the US ), there is a sense that the film means well and tries to show a different view that is not shown by the American media. Even still, this film really is just preaching to the converted so if you think Bush has done a good job and are unflinching in your support, you know what you think. However it would be nice if everyone saw this movie in America but......you can't depend on people's beliefs just to change just like that. Anyway look on the bright side people, it's his last term so he can't do anything more after that although the downside is he's still probably scheming his next plan up and god help the world whatever it is"	4.0	You already know where you stand on this	2005-01-14	8	4	4

Completely ignoring the fact that this movie has very little in common with real documentaries, this movie begins with a rambling, incoherent conclusion  that repetitiously attacks Bush and his administration in every way conceivably possible. Now, I realize most of us already have opinions on a subject and it is good to be honest about the fact that none of us can truly be impartial. But the whole point of a well-crafted argument is that you provide your audience with copious evidence, and you present it in such an artful way that the audience reaches your conclusion by themselves by the end of the movie. This even-handed persuasion obviously escapes Moore, as the first few minutes of the movie consist of a very hateful rant about Bush and his policies. Only after this rant  does Moore begin to provide any evidence as to why we should hate Bush.  The feeling I got from the movie was of a little kid tattletaling on his older brother. That's not to say I don't agree with the general conclusions. But the point of a movie like this should be persuasion. Liberals don't need convincing that Bush is despicable. It's the moderates and conservatives who need persuading, and this crude and poorly put together ""documentary"" surely is not going to do that."	1.0	A poorly argued liberal rant.	2007-06-29	23	6	17
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A25150UHNJTJBT	FleetAdmiralJ	"Where there parts of this documentary that were border-line?  Yeah, but then again, one should expect that.  In fact, I was exacting a whole lot more than there was.  I had half bought into the conservative claims that the movie was just one big smear job by Moore.  However, after watching the movie I was amazed by how much it wasn't a ""i hate bush, but i wont back it up"" movie.Coming to the criticisms by Conservatives.1. Many wont believe anyone who says anything bad about Bush anyway.  Heck, they still think that Iraq is in good shape, and that the economy is rolling like it's the 1990s again.  Those people will never be pursuaded that Bush is anything other than God on Earth.2. You can tell when one side of a debate doesn't have an arguement when they start attacking their opponent personally.  That is what has happened to a large degree in the negative comments here.  They simply dismiss Moore's claims as lies (mainly because of #1) and then go on to attack Moore as a person.3. I did visit the webpage listing 59 Moore lies or whatever.  However, after reading through much of it, a lot of it was irrelevant.  Does it matter that Gore was at the fundraiser too where Bush said ""some call you the rich and powerful but I call you my base"" (or whatever the quote was).  The examples of Gore's jokes seemed harmless (""and yes, I invented this dinner"") while with Bush's ""i call you my base"" joke one can almost tell that it has a slimy feeling to it.Also, in the part of the movie where Bush says ""now watch this swing,"" he seems to believe that Moore is attacking Bush for playing golf while talking about attacking terrorism.  However, the fact that Bush is playing golf is irrelevant.  The part Moore was going after was that Bush almost seemed to take his golf swing as seriously, if not more seriously, than his comments about fighting terrorism.On top of this, he attacks Moore on menial facts.  Did anyone REALLY believe that Gore's ""Victory party"" at the start of the movie was in fact a victory party?  I was actualy surpised to learn that it was taped on election day.  I was actually thinking it may be a picture of a rally with ""Victory Florida"" edited into the video to make it look like a victory celebration.Also, this movie is not about Clinton, it's about Bush.  Who cares if Clinton has ties to some of the same companies Bush does?  Clinton wasn't President after 9/11, Bush was.  The claim is that Bush may have allowed his, his family's, and his buddies interests in front of the national interest because of these connections.  That claim is not impacted in any way by what business dealings other people may have had.Finally on this point, are there some cheap shots, such as showing Wofliwitz saliving up his hair? Yeah, but these can't be considered ""deceptions"" or anything.  Also, in his ""rebuttle"" of Moore's claim that the Saudi's hadn't been interviewed before leaving, he stated that something like 30 had been.  Well, 30 is no where near 147 or whatever the number was who left.  Also, I think WHEN the Saudi's left is less important than the fact that they got out ASAP, with apparently minimal questioning.The conservatives are so bent up on little nit picky facts that they miss the big picture.  Even if Moore had presented a documentary that was unquestionably factual, most of his underlying premises would still be alive and kicking."	4.0	Conservative's critics fall flat	2004-09-22	53	38	15

While a balanced presentation of fact is not required of a documentary, Moore's use of falsehood and innuendo to make his case disqualifies the movie as such.  However, the film succeeds in evoking a high pitch of emotional fervor, ranking it as possibly the best propaganda piece of recent filmdom.  Only the occasionally too-blatant use of mockery in commentary and musical effects keeps this work from measuring up to the German productions of the mid to late 1930's, and denies it a 5th star.	4.0	Brilliant propaganda film	2004-08-07	23	9	14
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3FZYBANIGZDQV	flux1968	"Fahrenheit 9/11 has done a great job by exposing the lies and hypocrisy of the Bush administration.  Moore even shows Rumsfeld meeting with Saddam in 1983.  Unfortunately, he does not explain the context of this meeting.  Saddam had just gassed the Kurds, and Pres. Reagan decided to improve Iraq's diplomatic status.  Rumsfeld was sent as an envoy to seal the deal.  Back then he was our friend.  Today, the story of the Kurds being gassed is constantly repeated while the story of how the US gov't rewarded him is somehow missing.F9/11 has provoked a great deal more political discussion than is typical in American society and that's valuable in and of itself.However, I think the movie has some important problems.  One is that he underplays the Democrat role in all these policies.  While he criticizes them for being passive lame ducks, this is inaccurate.  They truth is, they supported the Bush administration's policies, they just would have done it ""differently.""  It's good cop/bad cop.In the movie, we see how Black congresspeople needed one Senator's signature to further investigate electoral fraud in Florida and nobody would sign - including Sen. John Kerry! [this is not mentioned in the movie].The film emphasizes the Bush family's personal connections to oil interests as the overriding motive for his policies.  The implication is that since Kerry doesn't have these ties, he would not carry on the policies.  He omits that obvious fact that, between the Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. administrations, there were two Clinton administrations.  What were the Saudis and oil corporations doing then - just sitting around and waiting for Republicans to get back into office?  The fact is that American oil policy is not driven by personal friendships but by the needs of empire.  Even if we did not have an oil-based economy, we would still want to control Iraq's oil if only because other countries [Russia, Japan, Germany] are dependent on it.  In capitalist competition, one often accumulates resources not for direct consumption but to prevent rivals from acquiring it.Also, where were the protests?  The only protest you see in the movie is the inaugural, but not the Feb. 15, 2003 or any other anti-war protest.  One would get the impression that everyone else is just sitting around getting upset at Bush but doing little about it other than complaining.The barely hidden logic behind Moore's movie is that the Democrats might only be a little better, but they'd still be better or at least more susceptible to popular pressure.  This is not supported by history.  It was Democrats who initiated and continued the Vietnam War [Kennedy, Johnson], while it was a cold war Republican [Nixon] who ended US military involvement.  The arms race that Reagan is blamed for actually started under Carter.  Reagan simply continued and expanded it.Neither party is inherently ""better"" or more open to working people.  Both are representatives of empire [I would argue that a third party would be subject to the same contraints but that's another discussion].The strength of this movie lies in Moore's compassion for working people.  The segment on Lila Lipscomb, a conservative Democrat whose son dies during the war, is powerful.  Here we see the transformation of someone who initially hated the anti-war movement to someone who is now questioning the Bush administration policies.  Moore is never less than respectful with her.The scenes where the Marines recruit in the working-class mall, with overwhelmingly Black consumers contrasts with the various Congresspeople who would not even consider sending their own children to fight a war that they helped initiate.  Aren't Bush, Jr.'s daughters military age?Whether this is properly a documentary or not is irrelevant.  Those who would dismiss F9/11 as propaganda, would not hold Fox News to such a standard - and they claim to be ""fair and balanced.""  Moore's politics are not a secret, so nobody should have been surprised.  There are others who claim that he has no factual support.  Really?  Why don't you go to michaelmoore.com to see his documentation?  They include such marginal 'leftist' sources such as PBS, CNN, Congressional testimony, etc.,Even with my disagreements with him, I feel that we are share the same outrage.  Moore is a very skilled filmmaker.  His use of music, editing and humor combined with his pro-working class approach make him a valuable resource, one that many progressive filmmakers should learn from."	4.0	Very good but flawed	2004-08-20	6	4	2

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	I feel that conservatives and liberals alike are looking at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 through the filter of their own agendas: it is not really an attack on the Republican Party, nor is it really a Democratic election-year commercial.  At heart, the film is an attack on political powers influenced by big business, which strives to manipulate the public through fear in order to turn a handsome profit.  But this is not to say that George W. Bush doesn't get a terrific beating here--he does, and so does his administration, with Ashcroft coming off as particularly ludicrous.In the first third of the film, Moore goes to tremendous pains to demonstrate the existence of a &quot;good old boys&quot; network between the Bush family and Saudi money men, a network Moore claims facilitated the flight of wealthy Saudis from the United States in the immediate wake of 9/11.  While intriguing, Moore's position on this point is distinctly interpretive--but there is much more in the film that is not.In the past, Moore has been accused of startling his targets into unstudied responses by unexpectedly leaping out at them with camera in hand, but no such accusation can arise here.  In FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Moore relies upon media coverage of Bush, and while the coverage is edited for effect there is no dodging the bullet: Bush was where he was, doing what he was doing, and saying what he was saying of his own free will and in full knowledge that the cameras were rolling.  If Bush emerges from this looking like a buffoon, he has no one to blame but himself.At this point the film's edge turns razor sharp and deadly.  It is very easy to forget what someone said in an interview or speech several years ago--but it is also easy to roll the footage and remind us of it, not to mention pointing out various inconsistencies in the process.  But for all the film's Bush buffoonery, the most chilling aspect of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the portrait it paints of corporate greed and human tragedy.In parts of the film Moore approaches his subject with a comic edge, pointing out some of the absurdities arising from the Patriot Act.  But simply put, there are a great many people making a great deal of money out of the United States' invasion of Iraq.  Corporations and investors rake in big bucks while, as one American solider puts it, an American trucker driving five miles a day in Iraq makes more in a week than a solider will make in a month.  When one adds to this chilling observation the fact that the Bush administration has done everything from cut military pay to seek closure of V.A. hospitals... well, it all adds up to a fairly poisonous portrait of both business and politics as usual.  Lives are lost, but no matter, at least so long as the polls are good and the money keeps rolling in.Is the film biased?  Without a doubt.  Is it speculative?  Yes, but only to a certain degree.  Will it make you stop and think?  You better believe it.  Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer	5.0	Business And Politics As Usual	2004-07-04	43	28	15

Moore is a true patriot and has found a way to turn our first amendment into informative art. I am sure he is on the top-ten list under the Patriot Act's ""I' gonna get you"" list for unveiling the truth of all truths. People are actually criticizing Moore's genius of piecing together the ties that George W. Bush has with the bin Ladens and the royal family of Saudi Arabia. These ties are both business and personal, all oil connected.Much goes on zeroing-in on the Iraqi war and how the link between Al-Quaeda and Saddam Hussein is often confused by 42% of Americans when it is undoubtedly nonexistent, does this make sense?A reason Moore won the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, THE Palme d'Or is not because the French hate Americans but they actually give awards to a masterpiece of art when they see one.Moore has many candid footage clips of Paul Wolfowitz, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, Donald Rumsfeld, and ""Dubya"" that they never thought millions would see! Mr. Moore does not mock them solely, they have done an incredible job of doing so on-camera themselves. The movie is not only extremely informative and entertaining, but also heartfelt and include extreme up-close footage with our warriors in Iraq.  I admire these individuals for their leadership/courage but their leader has lied to the entire American public.It is one of the first film documentaries to focus on how fundamentally corrupt this White House administration is.I highly recommend that anyone with an open mind, whether Republican, Democrat, Independent, or Green give this film a chance and decide for yourself if this plays an unfair portrayal of George W. Bush's intent to wage war with Iraq. After watching Bush speak (not just in this movie, I can clearly say that idiocy is what moves the stupidest president we have ever had.

(dictionary.com)Some people, and I won't name names or point fingers, have recently been so brash as to describe Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11 (named loosely around ""Fahrenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury, bookrags.com) as a documentary, or even worse, the made up word ""docudrama."" Let's be fair folks, this entire movie is strictly opinion! Michael Moore clearly hates George W. Bush, ok, I got that, let's move on.To those individuals as bold as to call anything Michael Moore does as ""representative of the facts"" I find you foolish. Michael Moore is an Entertainer, if you don't believe me, do the research (ahem, look at the title of the article.)To those who think my issue is with Michael Moore, you're mistaken. I think, for entertainment purposes he is a very well rehearsed, very well educated individual in the field of entertainment. I have a huge problem with labeling his movie as a documentary. Just because he provides a few facts does not mean that it is objective. His self-proclaimed (see where Katie Couric mentions ""polarizing"") subjectivity alone should give the hint that it's not a documentary, rather, more an influential, opinionated, somewhat manipulative movie. Again, this is not to take away from the movie, at least it's entertainment value; however, I know of no ""documentary"" that provides merely one side of any issue, witholds all information that has any indication of supporting the ""other side"" (regardless of its relevancy) and makes such obscure relationships between so many ""facts"" as to attempt to point a finger, just to blame someone of something (just what, precisely, is still unknown).Michael Moore, this is a call. Either:Edit your movie to include all sides to any issue you proposed.orand this is my point folks..... Stop calling it a documentary.It's one or the other and though I know that it will never be changed, I hope people realize that you can't always believe what you read/see/hear, even if it's considered a ""factual, objective documentary.""For ""Moore"" reading, I recommend these essays:Responding to Michael Moore's F911, and to retain bipartisianship, here's another one for your reading pleasure:Michael Moore and the need for more subjectivity in journalism.Disclaimer: Though I truely would love to write much more, I must, honestly, retain as much objectivity as possible. I will openly say I do not like Michael Moore, I think he is very dishonest, extremely hypocritical, and one of the most manipulative individuals in film history. These, however, are the same reasons I do not like Bill O'Reilly, Michael Savage, Dennis Miller, etc... The only sort of media that deserves the attention it receives is the un-biased kind. Since, quite obviously, it no longer exists (if it ever did) the only thing to be done is to watch/read/hear as many different sources as possible, and make your own, objective conclusions about the subjects of the materials presented.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3FQVHWKRKJGXX	G. Bearman	Usually I go to see movies for their entertainment value, and occasionally I will also see something that's genuinely inspiring or even moving, but often just to be able to laugh, admire great art and acting and a good engaging story are enough for me.This movie is something completely different, as it's not trying just to entertain (though it does) or just be artful (though it is), but to tell the truth to the American people that they have been blinded from by the people in power who work solely for their own greed and ulterior motives, without any consideration to the American public they're supposed to serve, or to the world at large.  We're at one of the biggest crossroads not just in American politics, but in human history, and Moore presents that argument very clearly and understandably about how we've been duped and what we must do come November 2nd.  The stakes are higher than they've ever been, and Mr. Moore shows us that abudnantly.Why the most important movie ever made?  Simply because if this movie helps accomplish it's goal of getting Bush ousted from the White House, it will be a victory not just for America, but for the whole world, and Mr. Moore is to be applauded for his willingness to speak out and for his great courage under fire.  I don't think it would even be out of the question for him to win a Nobel Peace Prize for the brave work he's doing to help turn our country and planet around.  People around the world detest what this President is doing, and they pray like many of us Americans that we will see the light and vote appropriately before it's too late and we get four more years of this madman running the country.  Worst case scenario, that Bush again gets to set about destroying the world for four more years, at least Mr. Moore will have opened the eyes of millions and millions of people worldwide, and the seeds of peace and truth will have been planted to come to fruition at a slightly later time.  In addition to wholeheartedly recommending this movie, I also highly suggest paying regular visits to michaelmoore.com (especially the MUST READ section) to get more truth coming out every day that the media, influenced too much by the right wing agenda likes to keep hidden.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A7SYZZDWXT8DV	G. Carse	"Interesting how quite a number of people who gave this documentary one star didn't manage to respond with a well-argued and intelligent rebuttal, but were reduced to spewing out vitriolic insults about how Michael Moore is fat. What's your point? Socrates was also a bit of a lard ass but we don't think of him today as some bloated, beardy Greek but as a man who managed to teach people to think for themselves for a change.Personally I don't believe you need to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 to know something is fundamentally wrong with the Bush administration. All you need is a triple digit IQ and a brain capable of independent thought. Sadly not everyone is gifted with such intelligence and that's why we need people like Michael Moore to spell things out for us. This is especially true in a country where a not insignificant number of voters, right up to election day, still thought that Hussein was responsible for 9/11, that Iraq is armed to the teeth and George Bush is the only thing standing between us and the forces of Evil. The hard truth that most republicans will refuse to accept is that it was stupidity, ignorance and above all fear that got Bush re-elected.And even if we disagree with Moore's main contention: that George Bush bombed a defenceless third world country, killing over 100,000 civilians, just to steal their oil, the incredible irony remains, that on November 2nd a huge number of republicans who voted for Bush did so ""on moral grounds"". For these people the deaths of over eleven hundred soldiers and countless thousands of innocent men, women and children was less important than preventing gays from marrying!!! But then perhaps it's easy for predominantly white fundamentalist Christians to condone the needless slaughter of so many innocents when the innocents concerned are just little brown Muslims in some far off part of the world they couldn't even find on a map if they tried.To finish, I obviously accept that Saddam Hussein was an evil man who murdered, tortured and incarcerated without trial many of his own people. Well now, thanks to Bush, so have we. Michael Moore may have failed in his quest to kick Bush out or the White House, but if he caused even a handful of flag-waving jingoists to start thinking for themselves for a change then he has achieved at least some measure of success. Remember, to love your country does not mean never to question its actions; that's one of the fundamental differences between democracy and totalitarianism."	5.0	Welcome to Big Brother	2004-11-08	53	37	16

Michael Moore has done an excellent job in setting an example for the American people for how to be a true American. In his movie he has provided an excellent synopsis of the numerous books that have come out chronicaling the actions of the Bush White House in Iraq and the War on Terror. Those people that have bashed Mr. Moore for being un-American are some of the most hypocritical people that I have ever heard. Mr. Moore has shown us what a true American is by truly embrasing not only the right, but the obligation, of all Americans to think critically of their government, no matter who is in power, and anybody that critizes him for this should take a good look at their own actions and how those actions would be catagorized by our founding fathers.

FISHER	"Fahrenheit 9/11 will disappoint the non-partisan viewer twice: on the way in and on the way out.On the way in, I came to the movie expecting a biting, hilarious satire of the present administration a la Saturday Night Live's ""Strategery"" silliness, perhaps with a serious point to make. What the first two-thirds of the movie actually provided, however, was merely unflattering video footage of Bush 43 and others in the administration overlaid with conspiratorial commentary that we're all familiar with involving Florida, Texas Air National Guard, Halliburton, Prince Bandar, etc. I thought that there was a lot of raw material there, but I fell asleep twice during this part.The one part of the movie that began to live up to these expectations shows Moore in Washington with a handful of Marine Corps enlistment documents trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. That was funny, and it had a point to make, but that was all there was of this sort.What woke me up was the amazing videotaped story of Lila Lipscomb. She works at a welfare office in Flint, MI (Moore's hometown) and has two children in the military. In the initial interviews we see her describing herself as a conservative Democrat who is proud of the work she does, proud to be a part of the American Middle Class and proud of her children's service.Then her son is killed and we see her transformed by her grief. That, plus some scenes of amputee veterans brings a very somber and serious tone to the movie. But it goes nowhere in particular with it, and it contrasts incongruously with the first part of the movie. So, the second disappointment is on the way out ... the movie could have been a lot more but its slanted, partisan failed-attempt at satire ruined it.The other movies at Cannes must have been dull, because this one is not all that great."	2.0	Disappoints Twice	2004-06-26	47	13	34

If we want to be free, we have to practice the principles of freedom. One of them is open and transparent dialogue about the actions of the leaders of the republic. When one of those leaders, be they the mayor of the town council or the president of the United States, acts in ways that trample on and defeat the principles of democracy, it is then necessary for those acts to be exposed.It is apparent from this documentary that the Bush family has had and continues to have a long and inglorious relationship with the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family. It was especially nauseous to find out that the Bush administration allowed members of the bin Laden family and principle members of the Saudi royal family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of 9/11. Just what were they thinking? That we would never find out?Another principle is that behavior has consequences. The acts of the Bush family in support of the ""haves and have mores"" has helped those individuals reap an obscene amount of money from the suffering of others.

Well, unecessarily grotesque images are used to portray facts which are not stressed throughout the movie, the camera work at times was so awful it made me sick, but WORST OF ALL, the film is used specifically as a decoy to get his radicalist ideas across to the American public.As some may know, PT Barnum once said you could never go broke underestimating the American people. He was so right, and this movie is a fantastic example of why this phrase is so acurate. If you label the content matter in a film ""controversial"" and then put the bloated, biased information in a colorful package and try to make it look like the narator actually has a heart, then the maker of the movie will make money.What Michael Moore also accomplished in this film was the ability to get across data that was incorrect and severely flawed. Just because the movie may be ""enjoyable"" to some, does not mean that the film is accomplishing its true goals as a documentary.Michael Moore is not a documenter, he is a radical liberal -- we know this. And sure, there are millions of those across the united states, as there are the same number of radical conservatives - but Michael Moore easily is able to get across his ""documentary"" and his ""facts"" as propaganda. Simply put, this is a project used as a coy to get his ideas heard. Instead of going on marches, demonstrations, or even suicide bombing himself like plenty of other people with the same ideas do, Michael Moore insists on eating lots of hot dogs and giving the misguided American public ""knowledge"", which is really just propaganda put into a million-dollar-budget film.And unlike many/most fictional films, this movie has no moral to teach, and no message to give aside from his so-called ""confidential, secretive data"". You aren't going to get something out of watching this film if you are not easily fooled, and you are not going to want to pick this film up again after watching.What saves it?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A5DXP7QPGR5A0	Gianmarco Manzione	Aside from Moore's arguable politics, his Fahrenheit 9/11 picks up where the superior Bowling For Columbine left off: its investigation of America's burgeoning culture of fear. In a way, Moore's decision to focus on issues of such dramatic political implications (Iraq War, Saudi-American collusion) is unfortunate, because it drowns out some of his less contentious and therefore more cogent observations. His delivery in 9/11 condescends where Bowling for Columbine enlightened; it chokes on its own venom where its predecessor stung with its charm. But what appears to be Moore's central focus -- the culture of fear in America -- remains, albeit it more obscured by the fog of so much agression and self-righteousness. In Bowling for Columbine, Moore drew attention to profound and disturbingly comical distinctions between American news, which is obssessed with violence, impending attack and celebrity worship, and Canadian news, which concerns itself with the new speed bump just laid in front of your local high school. The dangerous sense of threat, paranoia and even apocalypse this engenders in American audiences is not even the most devastating of its consequences. The real misfortune is that this hysteria-rampant journalism distracts millions of Americans from the more local, grassroots news Canadian outlets report: stuff that is happening right in our backyards and is thus of more immediate importance and more susceptible to the efforts and opinions of concerned individuals. One wonders whether the federal government fears that our increasingly technological and media-driven culture is slowly but surely rendering centralized government obsolete and would rather scare us into continued dependence and conformity. Fahrenheit 9/11 powerfully elaborates upon this charge, honing in on the predictable target of the multi-colored terror alert system, a much-criticized tool by which Tom Ridge & Co. allege to inform the public on the potential for terror attacks. Moore does a compelling job of exposing the many conveniences of such a method, particularly its power to distract voters from more local and immediate concerns such as health care, education (America's literacy rate ranks only 49th world-wide!), or growing signs that a reinstatement of the draft is on the horizon. This last issue is surely one that the fed would rather spring on us than debate at the possible expense of frightened or embittered voters. Moore's movie may be heavy-handed and conveniently editted, but it is frequently eloquent and moving in its cinematography, courageous, and, with regard to the culture of fear, enlightening.	4.0	The Fear Culture	2004-07-30	10	9	1

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1A4E96DXPO0EN	"Gina ""College Student"""	"I am currently a junior in college and majoring in Political Science so I was very interested in seeing this film. When you are aware of the source (Moore) and his views on the country this ""documentary"" can be a helpful educational tool, but you must not take 100% of this to heart.Moore does not make things up, BUT he does present some of the facts of the movie in a way that makes them more shocking than they are in reality. For example : Moore makes a big deal of the fact that the Bush family has personal/business ties to the bin Laden family, which taken on its face IS shocking, but when you research it you will learn that anyone with a business hand in oil has relations with the bin Laden family, and it is a huge family, who disowned the infamous Osama. So the fact that the Bush's associate with the large bin Laden family shouldn't be quite as shocking as it comes across.So while his movie is filled with actual facts some of the things he points out aren't really as uncommon as he would like us to believe (like the segment which he is SHOCKED to learn that members of Congress don't read all of the bills they pass in their entirety... well DUHHHH they are thousands of pages and there are tons of them!)On the otherhand some of the things simply are shocking, and there is no way around them, such as the mother of a fallen solider sharing her story of how her sons final government check was docked the days of that week in which he was dead. That's disgustingly disrespectful of our government.I have to say I enjoyed the film. Moore has a way of infusing entertainment into his fact. He does make several points and theories as to why the wars following 9-11 happened.I think that if you view this movie with a sceptical eye you will be satisfied with it. Just go into viewing it after you learn a bit about Moore and his agenda. As with everything that has to do with politics there is always an agenda, and if you go into this movie aware of Moore's agenda you will know what to black out and what to take in. Just read up on his facts and listen to all sides of the story. But Moore's point of view is as valuable as anyones and worth all of the recognition."	4.0	Review	2005-01-28	8	6	2
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A148UWKWUZ8FON	Giovanni C. Washington-Wright	You know, I'm so sick and tired of conservatives crying about their man Bush. Did liberals cry when Clinton was raked over the coals? No. The truth is that Michael Moore is a brilliant filmmaker. Sure, he has a bias. If he didn't, you'd call him a spineless bimbo. I'm glad that liberals like he and Bill Maher are around. It seems to me that when intelligent, opinionated liberals are about, conservatives can't take it.Now, with that being said, what is so difficult to believe about facts in this movie? I have read most of the reviews here and have yet to see anyone say exactly what Michael Moore is lying about in his movie. Even Condi Rice, when asked, couldn't provide proof of what Moore lied about in his film.Let me pose this question: Is it really that difficult to believe that the President would NOT declare war on a man who he was in bed with financially? (although this man flew two planes into our buildings -- perhaps over said financial dealings, who knows?). Let's get it straight, people. When somenone punches you in the face, do you punch him back or the guy next to him? I haven't seen anything about us getting close to catching Bin-Laden, but we sure as hell have Saddam. When you think about it all together, it's really simple.I think the conservatives who have reviewed this film are so caught up in the way Moore tells his story (very tongue-in-cheek) that they are consumed by rage and immediately ready to dismiss the film as lies.	5.0	Moore = Genius	2004-10-16	36	30	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AO5F3MTTFCQR8	"girldiver ""Enjoy!"""	Let me just acknowledge my disinterest in the movies of Michael Moore in general. I usually go to see movies for entertainment and although he is entertaining his subject matter usually isn't escapism so I generally avoid his movies. I actually only saw one other movie by him, Roger and Me, and that was years ago. What interested me in this movie was a NPR interview that discussed both its merits and downfalls, the interview intrigued me and so I was compelled to get advanced tickets and stand in line to see the movie!This movie covers a lot of ground so at times you wonder what are we talking about now and then he meanders back to his point of view. Let's not forget this is a movie based on Michael Moores point of view no matter how many people share it. The movie has been called a documentary but it's not filmed like a documentary most people are used too. There is just too much ground to cover. So the film does have merit it's chocked full of facts that are disturbing about the Bush family and their connection with the Saudi's, contradictory interviews of Bush and his cabinet, and personal insights from a select number of Americans.I enjoyed the film it was humorous but at times hard to watch. The movie begins with the idea that the last four years was a dream but in essence a nightmare for Mr. Moore. This movie has validity I just wish Mr. Moore didn't hate President Bush so much. The movie certainly makes light of President Bush's ability as President and Leader of the Free World. Perhaps this movie would be embraced by the Republican's if Mr. Moore had stuck to just the facts and not immersed the film with his personal dislike of President Bush and therefore the controversy emerges.All in all the facts in this movie are incredibly disturbing! Even if you don't believe everything the movie tells you it makes you think about the dispersion of information by the media, the lack of leadership among the Democrats, the motivations of the current White House, and the distinct class distinction in America Today.As for the movie making, like I said there were a couple of times I wondered where this was going but Mr. Moore redirects often and takes you through the maze and back out and you say to yourself, WOW I never thought of that. This movie although not a classic documentary it does make you think and want to find out the truth whether you share Mr. Moores truth or not.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AA3HFFNJCFXI4	G. Laur	Michael Moore is, of course, a childish, smirking mudslinger who can make anybody he interviews look really, really bad through clever editing, and obviously enjoys doing it.  But he stands for good things, and he is not, as he's been labeled, a hypocrite, a hater of America, or even that much of a liar.  He sincerely believes that this country's citizens, whether or not they are Democrats, will be in serious trouble if Dubya is re-elected, and rather than being a piece of propaganda, Fahrenheit 911 is his attempt to show us that our president is a very greedy and dangerous man who is quite indifferent to just about everybody but himself and the people who make him and his buddies lots of money.  If this is true, shouldn't every American know it?Now, on the subject of Moore's alleged lies, footage is footage, and documents are documents, and he uses lots of both in the movie.  One of the most effective moments, which will leave conservatives gaping in frustration, is when he shows, a few months before the 911 attacks, footage of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, and the rest of the Bush buttkissers saying, in very smug and self-assured voices, that Saddam Hussein has no WMDs and has no means of acquiring WMDs.  He then shows all of these people, a month after the attack, saying the exact opposite in that same smug tone of voice, proving his point that the invasion of Iraq really had nothing to do with 911 whatsoever.Watch this film, liberal or conservative.  Some of it can be argued with, some of it can't.

Having said that, I support the idea of getting a look at other opinions and views.  One show I used to always watch was Bill Maher's old show, ""Politically Incorrect"" because it usually contained opinions from both sides and each side was given a voice.  And it was amusing.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" however is not such a case.  Its a film full of a bunch of little conspiracy theories that are presented as facts.  I wouldn't even go so far as to call them that because you can do the research on your own to find that a lot of the film's scenes are edited and distorted to present an illusion.  An illusion that is sadly being misunderstood by many Americans who are accepting this film as fact.  After picking it apart, to call it a documentary would be a joke.  Now effective propaganda?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3FBTJCCNQXW2U	Goldenroom	This is not a documentary. It's a mostly truthful, but bias look at the Bush administration. Most of this film deals with the Bush family connection to terrorist funding saudis, the Bush response to 911, and the Iraq war.I admit that this movie is very emotional. The first part I cried at was a clip of George W Bush reading to a group of children in Florida on the morning of 911. In the clip he is told about both planes hitting the towers. You would think as president that he would spring into action and get on the phone, but instead he sits in the class room like some sort of moron. The most emotional part of the film deals with the unnecessary human suffering of the Iraq war. Everything from clear footage of operation Shock and Awe, amputated US troops, and the families of dead US troops is troubling and sad to watch.For a film that covers a very serious subject, I didn't like some of the sarcastic humor in this film(such as making fun of the coalition members). I also don't like how Moore edited the film to fit his agenda. For example: There is a part of the film where moore is talking to members of congress about sending their kids to Iraq. One of the congressman told Moore that his nephew was serving in Iraq, which is cut out of the film. What is shown is the congressmans reaction to the question before he answered(which made him look bad). Tricks like that are not neccessary, especially when your dealing with the Bush administration.

If however you're looking for intellectual honesty and integrity of the facts a supposed documentary uses to prove its point, then this a one star, and barely even that.  This flick is horribly biased and distorted to the point of outright lying, as Moore is a master of redirection ans taking things out of context to get us to believe what he wants us to believe.-He shows the secret service guarding the Saudi Embassy and asks rhetorically why.  If he checked his sources (and it would be quite bizarre if he didn't) he would have known the Secret Service's bylaws say they can provide extra security to embassies when asked (and not just for the Saudis), but instead Moore implies there ""may be"" some financial favoritism between them and Bush.-He shows a video of a meeting between the Taliban and gov't officials, and Moore asked rhetorically why this is so.  If he checked his sources (which happens to be his own video) he would have known that it was to demand they turn Bin Laden over, but instead Moore implies there ""may be"" some financial favoritism between them and Bush.-He reports that ""while Bush was governor of texas the Taliban visited his state for a meeting with oil executives over building oil pipes in their country"".  Moore has to know that Bush had nothing to do with this meeting (it was actually with Clinton officials) so the only reason Moore would care to even mention Bush is to falsely imply that he did...without actually coming out and saying he did.You get the picture.  Moore deliberately takes innoculous facts and makes them look like something they're not, and then asks a supposedly rhetorical question so he can supply his own intended answer which he repeats until you start believing it- Bush putting financial deals over the welfare of the country.When the facts he quotes aren't incriminating enough, he spices them up.  He can then honestly say that everything he says is true because he really doesn't say anything.  He portrays what he wants you to think on your own.  With this kind of deliberate misdirection, one can even make mother Theresa look like a Nazi war criminal.Like Bush or hate Bush, it really doesn't matter.  If you're going to criticize him then criticize him over legitimate issues, like the war in Iraq.

Like Michael Moore, I was criticized as unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops (even though I served in the US Army from 1978-1984).  I had seen much of the information presented in the film previously, though from separate sources such as books and newspaper articles.  What Moore has done with 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is bring all the various facts concerning the Bush administration's misadventures all together in one controversial film.No one should kid themselves-Michael Moore is a partisan ,and is firmly against what George Bush and his cronies represent. He fully expected - and welcomed - the firestorm of criticism his film generated. The irony is that as time goes by, more and more of what is presented in 'Fahrenheit' is being confirmed by former members of the Bush administration, arms inspectors in the Iraq invasion aftermath, and even by Bush and Cheney themselves!  Even powerful members of Bush's own Republican Party are now condemning the mess that the Iraq 'liberation' has become.I was enraged by what I saw in this movie.  How could so many Americans be so blind (and a large proportion of the population STILL refuses to see the truth)?  How could our media function as a cheerleading section for what was happening?  If nothing else, this film is a call to all Americans to vote to change the direction our country is now headed (or at minimum, at least express SOME kind of opinion by going to the ballot box).If you haven't yet done so, see this film.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1X15AQVSCKKRG	GreatMovieCriticForever	"Michael Moore, does it again with the Cannes Film Festival winning and soon to be Academy Award nominated documentary ""Fahrenheit 911"" his triumph hit centering on the corruption of the Bush Administration following the September 11 attacks. ""Fahrenheit 911"" was made now for political attacks or gain, but simply as Michael Moore has done to tell the truth when no one else has, IN fact during several points of the film, several familiar reporters: Dan Rather, Katie Couric, Matt Laurer all show their lies and ignorance in supporting Mr. Bush agenda to invade Iraq and blame Saddam Hussein for the Sept 11 attacks. However Bush at the same time uses Sept 11 in an attempt to salvage his downward approval ratings, using the attack to bully and invade other countries that don't approve of his policies, pardoning several corrupt organizations that have done wrong doing, and last but not least, having profitable communication with and protecting the Osama Bin Laden Family and then contradicting himself with false allegations of nuclear weapons of Mass Destruction which still has not been found since the days of President Clinton.The movie starts of with the debacle that was the President Election in 2000 with the fiasco in Florida, led by Presiden't Bush's brother Jed and his cohorts of liars to fix the election in Florida in Bush's favor when it looks like Al Gore (who won several states in his favor)was going to win Florida and the Presidential Election. Moore points out how and a company called DATA BASE TECHNOLOGIES manipulated and lied with the vote counts in Bush's direction, securing the state of Florida and making George W. Bush the President of the United States. Last but not least the ties Bush has with Supreme Court that dashed Gore's hope for Presidency. Of course Bush himself who leads the war in Irad has his own contradictory military records. The movie then shows us the horrible day that was Sept 11, 2001 and then shows us President Bush's nonchalant attitude during the first minutes of Sept 11 where he attended some small preschool during a reading of ""billy and his goat"" while having a peaceful reaction when a member of security teams tells him about the hijacking. Bush does not flinch or show any regard for human life during these first minutes.The movie then shows us how Bush and company took advantage of Sept. 11 attacks to use it for their own agenda, that is initiating war with Iraq, arresting people of Middle Eastern decent (except the Osama Bin Laden Family) and of course the most controversial aspect of the whole movie, George W. Bush having business associations with Osama Bin Laden family. That about sends chills down my spine what about you? When we have a U.S. President who swears on the bible to serve the people of America and yet really is serving his own agenda and those who don't agree to his terms watch out!!! Of course since Sept 11, we have learned that President Bush did receive ample warning of terrorist attacks including a four year memo that was kept hidden. Jack Cloogen, former FBI Agent, details the failure to prevent Sept 11 briefly in the movie. The 911 Commission has also shown that there was also nothing done by the FBI and CIA (despite their intelligence reports that an attack was imminent) to prevent the attacks.Moore then shows us the downright lies about Saddam Hussein going back to 2001 when the disgraceful General Colin Powell says that Saddam Hussein quote ""doesnt pose a threat"" and has no weapons of mass destruction. Of course pre Sept 11 despite our boasts about security with President Clinton our security problems and problems with trust were lousy. As covered by ABCNEWS, CBSNEWS, firefighters , police officers, had unworking equipment including walkie talkies, mass confusions and lack of communication, this in turn describes the war with Iraq. Remember George Bush never got permission from Congress or Senate to launch this war and in part several of our former cowardly allies: Great Britain, Uk, Dominican Republic have backed out . The American casualties for the war have been great over 200 servicemen killed in the line of duty. Yet we have the arrogant and pompous saying ""were winning the war"" while sitting home all cozy in the White House. Now ""Fahrenheit 911"" was actually financed by Walt Disney Company yet, when it came to release the movie, the Disney still led by cowards like Michael Eisner put the movie on the shelves. However ""Lions Gate Films (who also released Beyond the Mat) stepped up to the plate and showed guts in releasing the film. Then as I hosted a thread on IMDb cheap, corrupted reporters like Matt Laurer tried to attack Michael Moore before the movie was even released. Laurer, acts so unprofessional to Moore that its hard to believe this guy has a job as reporter for NBC when he really is just a liar, a pasty doing a con job for a higher power. He failed as ""Fahrenheit 911"" is one of the highest grossing documentaries of all times breaking box office records and earning the respect and intrigue of many Americans who have seen the lies exposed by their government, president and Military.A special note of interest is that Moore in the NBC Dateline interview mentioned how one scene was cut, that is when an American soldier, beats and assaults a prisoner of film. this was recorded way before the vile disgraceful actions of the men and women of the Army at Abu Gharaid, where allegations of prisoner abuse have now been proven true by those graphic pictures and sex tapes.All the facts I have listed are from watching the movie numerous times, now with what happened in the political debateswith John Kerry and George Bush its important you see this movie."	5.0	Michael Moore does it again with another important film!!	2004-10-11	60	41	19

The great thing that I seeing now is that people are now finally aware of the corruption that our American President George W. has done. Of course several other respected news sources have already talked about what Moore does in G.W. interest with Osama and his constant pursuit of profit.The war in Iraq is nothing more but a war for profit as I heardthis on KPFK radio from one military member. The BBC recentlydid a documentary on the George Bush family fortune and what's covered is what's essentially what Moore covers. George W. Bushis just another cheap American who promised our country  iberty, justice and peace and has delivered four years of misery. Top it all behind closed door as one critic he hasaligned himself with greedy corporations like Enron has triedto drill for oil in Alaska, has had other business endeavorsat the cost of the American people and now weve had enough.The shamble in Florida as one person , pretty much was a foreshadowing of what was to come from this disgraceful American. I personally find it pitiful to call this man our President.Anyhow, Moore also pokes fun at how many congress members often do nothing and often pass laws that they don't even read with his focus of the ""Patriot Act"".Cheap critics who call this bias are only showcasing their corrupton as individuals when they attack Moore. Obviously theycan't deny anything that Moore points out in his movies, so their childish reactions is to call him fat, and uneducated. Actually their the uneducated ones.Two thumbs way up for this movie and look for any barrage of Flashbacks in the film to show that contrary to the belief thatthe military liberates countries they only invade them and killinnocent people (Chile, Nicaragua, Salvador)."	5.0	Way to go Michael!!!	2004-09-28	78	36	42

I don't know how much validity to give to Moore's claims of Saudi connections to the Bushes, but it makes for a compelling conspiracy film.  The second half has more emotional impact, but gets a little scattered since Moore is no longer telling a story that ads up to something.  The very last 3 or 4 minutes are really strong.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	There's a certain irony in the fact that this movie is giving FOX News commentators (and viewers, apparently, if the commentary below is any indication)such a case of apoplexy. Definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle cracked.Sure it's slanted, but you know what? Some of us are grown-ups and we can decide for ourselves what's factual and what may be specious. And believe me there is nothing here any less specious than one gets in a typical evening of FOX News broadcasting!What David Brock has labeled &quot;the Great Republican Noise Machine&quot; has steadily been eroding debate in this country by successfully intimidating the &quot;liberal media&quot; into giving this president a virtual pass. People like Moore, at least, offer something of a corrective on this score. It's refreshing to see that, yes, there are still impassioned, unintimidated liberals out there. And whether you're particularly liberal or not, I hope at least, you might concede that America needs the dialogue.But of course, in this widely polarized nation, there may be little chance that this film or any other (or any one of the many books published by liberal OR conservative authors) will ultimately succeed in doing much more than preaching to the choir. There is some faint hope that--precisely because this movie is such a phenomenon--that it may spark some useful dialogue though.

I'm a huge fan of ""Roger and Me"", mainly because Moore technique fit the frame. Here, Moore never quite establishes his thesis and sort jumbles a bunch of stuff together. Yes, Bush is a weenie. But Moore doesn't cast any new light on Bush's essential weenie-ness.I suspect when everyone's ideological ardor dies down, somewhere during President Ventura's second term, this film will be valued as an artifact of an insane period in American political life, rather than a masterpiece of documentary film making."	3.0	It's a movie.	2004-08-25	26	8	18
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ASXSN5SAFPVDY	Gregory S. Standard	"Michael Moore......a funny man with a funny cause. This movie is like a poor man's version of a Monty Python film. Moore takes some general ""facts"" about events related to the Bush administration and then procedes to fabricate some hilarious conclusions.I have to admit that I laughed quite a few times during this movie. The charges levied against our current administration are enjoyable because they are so reaching and ridiculously extreme that you can't help but chuckle. Unfortunately, Moore isn't kidding....he actually thinks he is uncovering something important!There used to be a great series on tv called ""Connections"" by James Burke. In this series, Burke does a remarkable job of tying together seemingly unrelated events in history into an insightful understanding of the effects that disparate events have on each other and the future.Well......Moore attempts to do the same here, but he certainly lacks the keen, intellectual edge of Burke and his own clownish actions in the film take away from any legitimacy that he may be trying to portray.Besides, I've noticed a huge amount of hypocracy from many of these wealthier liberal types: while they bash corporations and greed and governments, they are simultaneously investing and earning huge sums of money from these very same entities. For example, Moore owns stock in the Halliburton Corporation. This is the very same company that he bashes with accusations of war profiteering based on past connections with Vice President Cheney.Many of our infamous liberal politician's and celebrities follow Moore's example. At the same time that they are leading the less educated and less informed down the path to liberal nirvana (socialism), they are cashing in big time in the same way that those naughty conservatives do - I guess their conscience looks the other way where wealth is concerned.Overall, this movie has some entertainment value as a comedy, and it has a great deal of monetary value for Moore....which was the real point of his making this film, not his ""patriotism""."	2.0	Funny....but it's no Monty Python!	2006-03-06	16	5	11

The movie is entertaining and pushes for changes in the Government's position in Iraq and in other issues. The movie gives this viewer the feeling that it is about 50% spin and about 50% truth. However, the film is still chilling since a USA Administration in power has such awesome power that the truth is hard to differentiate from the Administration's own spin.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1SDQTPPTYJFRG	gr	"Don't believe everything you see.  Michael Moore is very one sided and has one goal.  Do your own research and make an informed decision not one based on crap you see in a movie.Fahrenheit 9/11 begins on election night 2000. We are first shown Al Gore rocking on stage with famous musicians and a high-spirited crowd. The conspicuous sign on stage reads ""Florida Victory."" Moore creates the impression that Gore was celebrating his victory in Florida. Moore's voiceover claims, ""And little Stevie Wonder, he seemed so happy, like a miracle had taken place."" The verb tense of past perfect (""had taken"") furthers the impression that the election has been completed.Actually, the rally took place in the early hours of election day, before polls had even opened. Gore did campaign in Florida on election day, but went home to Tennessee to await the results. The ""Florida Victory"" sign reflected Gore's hopes, not any actual election results. (""Gore Campaigns Into Election Day,"" Associated Press, Nov. 7, 2000.)The film shows CBS and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, ""Then something called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy....All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'""We then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, ""All of us networks made a mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.""Moore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida.In fact, the networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the evening-before polls had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is part of the Central Time Zone. NBC called Florida for Gore at 7:49:40 p.m., Eastern Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the Florida panhandle. Thirty seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore. And at 7:52 p.m., Fox called Florida for Gore. Moore never lets the audience know that Fox was among the networks which made the error of calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02 p.m., ABC called Florida for Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were closed.About an hour before the polls closed in panhandle Florida, the networks called the U.S. Senate race in favor of the Democratic candidate. The networks seriously compounded the problem because from 6-7 Central Time, they repeatedly announced that polls had closed in Florida--even though polls were open in the panhandle. (See also Joan Konner, James Risser & Ben Wattenberg, Television's Performance on Election Night 2000: A Report for CNN, Jan. 29, 2001.)The false announcements that the polls were closed, as well as the premature calls (the Presidential race ten minutes early; the Senate race an hour early), may have cost Bush thousands of votes from the conservative panhandle, as discouraged last-minute voters heard that their state had already been decided; some last-minute voters on their way to the polling place turned around and went home. Other voters who were waiting in line left the polling place. In Florida, as elsewhere, voters who have arrived at the polling place before closing time often end up voting after closing time, because of long lines. The conventional wisdom of politics is that supporters of the losing candidate are most likely to give up on voting when they hear that their side has already lost. Thus, on election night 1980, when incumbent President Jimmy Carter gave a concession speech while polls were still open on the west coast, the early concession was blamed for costing the Democrats several Congressional seats in the West, such as that of 20-year incumbent James Corman. The fact that all the networks had declared Reagan a landslide winner while west coast voting was still in progress was also blamed for Democratic losses in the West; Congress even held hearings about prohibiting the disclosure of exit polls before voting had ended in the any of the 48 contiguous states.Even if the premature television calls affected all potential voters equally, the effect was to reduce Republican votes significantly, because the Florida panhandle is a Republican stronghold. Most of Central Time Zone Florida is in the 1st Congressional District, which is known as the ""Redneck Riviera."" In that district, Bob Dole beat Bill Clinton by 69,000 votes in 1996, even though Clinton won the state by 300,000 votes. So depress overall turnout in the panhandle, and you will necessarily depress more Republican than Democratic votes. A 2001 study by John Lott suggested that the early calls cost Bush at least 7,500 votes, and perhaps many more. Another study reported that the networks reduced panhandle turn-out by about 19,000 votes, costing Bush about 12,000 votes and Gore about 7,000 votes.At 10:00 p.m., which networks took the lead in retracting the premature Florida win for Gore? They were CNN and CBS, not Fox. (The two networks were using a shared Decision Team.) See Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic & Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ""CBS News Coverage of Election Night 2000: Investigation, Analysis, Recommendations"" (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.)In fact, Fox did not retract its claim that Gore had won Florida until 2 a.m.--four hours after other networks had withdrawn the call."	1.0	People need to do there own research.

Incidently, Michael Moore is a member of the NRA himself.In Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore does make statements that are hard to believe. Still, it is worth it for every person to watch and think for themselves.

What connection has there been with them and the Bush family in the past few years?  What is this nonsense about a ""Coaltion of the Willing""?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1VDA6GS3N714H	"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen"""	"In Fahrenheit 9/11 the strange relationship between the Bush family and the Bin Laden's is exposed.  Both families had interests in the Carlyle Group, one of the major arms suppliers of the US military.  That partially explains how it was possible that 24 family members of the Bin Laden's were flying to their home country after the attacks, the only planes officially permitted to fly at that time by... the White House...  All other planes were kept on the ground.  An ex-FBI agent claims this to be totally absurd.  If you have a suspected murderer, you first talk to whoever is close to him, family members first.  That's what any cop would do.  Why didn't president Bush let this happen ?  Was he afraid something could have been revealed?This picture also shows there never really was any serious effort to find the suspected ""Bad Guy"", Osama bin Laden.  It took the US military two months to start looking after him, sending only 11.000 troops to Afghanistan, just enough to have a new president in office, who helped US corporations in to build a new pipeline.  The search on Osama bin Laden was stopped before it ever began.  In this picture, you will literally hear Bush say : ""I don't know where he is and don't want to spend much time on it"".  So here we had the biggest ""foreign attack"" on the US, performed by 15 Saudi's, under alleged orders of Osama Bin Laden, and Bush doesn't care !?  Probably because either he had nothing to do with the attacks, or worse, because it would have been too dangerous for him telling the full truth, should they ever have captured him alive.  We must never forget Bin Laden was a CIA-man.  And the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.Although Bush doesn't care finding Bin Laden, he insists in fighting a ""war on terror"" !  Who are the enemies then ?  Well, it seems that YOU are, or maybe I am.  After 9/11 everybody suddenly became a possible ""suspect"".  A Fresno peace group was infiltrated by a secret service agent !  A retired man going to a gym was visited afterward by the FBI (!) because he made a casual remark on Bush.  And at airports breast milk was considered suspect.  This ""war on terror"" was above all a war on the liberties of the American people, although it's called, with a certain irony, the ""Patriot Act"".  And the American people believed it.  The objective was having the American people to turn to their ""leader"" to protect them.  But protect them from who ?  The most dangerous men at that time had their office in the White House.  They were the ""leaders"" - like Cheney and Rumsfeld.  And in this atmosphere of fear the war on Iraq was started, in March 2003, when Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with the alleged ""foreign attack"" on 9/11.  Rumsfeld says in this movie, after you see some images of dead babies, children, women and men in Iraq, that the military puts ""a lot of humanity in the war effort"".

The documentary has received so much praise and scorn, that you would have had to have lived in a hole to not hear about this film.  Not since The Passion of the Christ have people felt so strongly for or against a film, let alone a documentary.  The ever so contentious political bad boy Michael Moore has created an ambiguous political satire that delivers punches and blows at our president, Mr. George W. Bush.Mr. Moore has always been famous for his political humor and wild ideas on film rather than his journalistic views in his documentaries.  He has been known to stretch the truth and not tell all truths in his film works.  Is there any difference in his new one?  No. Mr. Moore is still very good at manipulating his audience and persuading them to believe what he wants to believe.  But is this really a crime?  I don't think so because most documentaries hide a lot of truth due to the directors' willingness to do almost anything to get their point across.In saying that, I must admit this is Mr. Moore's best documentary. Though it may be one-sided, you have to respect Mr. Moore and all the time and effort he obviously put forth for this film.  He has gathered facts from various sources to describe the entire presidency of Mr. Bush (mostly concerning 9/11 and the Iraqi war).  In fact I think the biggest question the documentary poses to the audience is how Mr. Moore acquired some of the footage, documents, and facts for his film.  It would be interesting to see a documentary regarding how he obtained all his information.  It is unbelievable and really impressive to observe all the research he compiled in completing this documentary.It is at this point that the documentary becomes extremely one-sided.  Mr. Moore may make an interesting documentary, but his accolades come more from his political humor, not from his journalism.  Portions of the truth are told but not necessarily the entire truth.  In the documentary he mentions all the great countries we have supporting us in the Iraqi war.  This is where Moore's sarcastic humor, for which he is famous, enters in as he mentions only the less powerful countries we have on our side.  Of course Britain and Australia is not mentioned.  Why would Mr. Moore neglect to mention some of the powerful countries that are supporting us? Because it would not cause Mr. Bush to appear so incompetent.  Many more of these ""half-truths"" can be seen throughout the entire documentary.  But when a documentary is extremely one-sided as in the case as this one, one must realize at the outset that some truths will be stretched.As I have mentioned, Fahrenheit 9/11 is entertaining because of its political humor.  It is highly entertaining to see Mr. Moore drive around in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone to congress members heading to work.  The movie's funniest ""prank"" is when Mr. Moore takes to the streets asking members of congress if they would like for their sons or daughters to enlist in the army.  The reactions are priceless.  It's also hilarious watching some of the congress members flee when they discover it is Michael Moore pursuing them.  Obviously he has become a threat to them and they fear being embarrassed on camera.  It's amazing to see how one man can cause so much controversy.Unlike his other films, Mr. Moore is almost absent in this documentary.  Except for the stunts already mentioned, he mostly serves as narrator and lets the footage speak for itself.  For this reason I believe it is his best documentary.  He has put aside performing outlandish, and in some ways ludicrous, stunts to concentrate more on staying the course of the content.  Less of Michael Moore has given the documentary more substance and feeling.  It's comical yet ironic watching Mr. Bush look at the camera and call for all nations to help stop terrorist killers, but then turn around and say, ""Watch this drive"" as he hits his golf ball down the fairway.  It's also disturbing to watch Mr. Bush on the morning of 9/11.  It was conveyed that he was in a classroom listening to young kids read when he was suddenly escorted out of the room when the planes crashed.  Yet on the footage, he is indeed not escorted suddenly.  He just sits there pondering while looking at a book until finally guards had to urge him out of the room.  It was wise of Mr. Moore to take a step back and let his footage speak for itself.  In this, his documentary becomes more meaningful and powerful.The documentary drags somewhat at the end of the film, yet when it was over I was surprised that I found myself joining in applause with others in the theater.  This documentary, as with his others, is extremely well done and especially brings out good points and questions. Your opinion of Mr. Bush will probably not change with the content of this documentary.  If you love Mr. Bush, you will be offended.  If you hate him, you will cheer.  Yet, the fact remains you will have much to talk about afterwards.  In my opinion, a well-done documentary will lead a person to discuss viewpoints with others long after the completion of the film.  This demonstrates that whether or not you hated it or loved it, you cared enough about it to discuss it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who will be voting this year. Prior to voting, it's always important to hear both sides.  Here is an opportunity to hear one man's opinion on Mr. Bush and his administration.Mr. Moore scores well again for his time and patience in research that has produced a documentary with plenty of well-educated, timely shots at Mr. Bush and congress while remaining funny and informative.

I've been watching documentaries for much of my life and I must say that this was simply one of the best documentaries I've seen in a while.  Micheal Moore pulls no punches in this intelligently done and well researched film on the Bush Administration and the so called war on terrorism.The film starts out showing how Bush was actually not elected by the people and goes on the show how incompetent he is.Regardless of whether we are republican or democrat, liberal or conservative we all agree that the current situation in Iraq and Afghanistan is one of the worst quagmires of our generation.  How did we get into this mess and why?  Who are the young men and women putting their lives on the line and how do they really feel about it?  How do the families of these young men and women feel about the war and having their children shipped out to fight?  Micheal Moore does a very good job at answering these questions by illustrating plausible reasons and letting the viewer decide for himself.I live in a conservative state (or so I've been told) yet this film was playing on two screens in one theator.  I was surprised to see that the seats were packed and I could tell by the way much of the audiance would laugh, hiss and jeer in certain scenes that they were not just watching the film to criticize it and Micheal Moore.  At the end of the film, the entire audiance was clapping and cheering.  I don't go to the movies much, but I don't think I've ever seen such an overwelming affirmative response to any film.	5.0	Disney refused to release it.  Who own's Disney?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A28ILXH590CMRJ	Hazen B Markoe	One would never accuse documentary film-maker Michael Moore for being understated or even non-partial.  Moore wears his liberal bias proudly on his sleeve and his documentary FARENHEIT 9/11 definitely displays that.  However, it does make some powerful points about the possible corruption of the Bush Administration that it leaves the viewer both shaken and questioning previously held beliefs.  Starting from the disputed 2000 election, in which Senators from both parties refused to support attempted protests from angry House members, the film winds its way through the 9/11 disaster (powerfully conveyed only by soundtrack against a black screen) and connecting members from the Bush Administration with members of the Saudi government, as well as members of the Bin Laden family. It also questions the very rationale behind the decision to attack Iraq. Of course, Moore uses a deadpan humor to help draw us in with particularly goofy clips of President Bush boasting about his golf game after a serious comment and Attorney General John Ashcroft singing a horrendous song that he wrote himself.  But it contrasts sharply with footage of Bush's stunned 7 minute wait after hearing of 9/11 and a proud conservative-minded mother whose values are shaken to their core after the death of her son in Iraq.  Some clips are obviously manipulative. The scenes with happy Iraqi children with cuts to Bush's declaration of war against Iraq are pretty obvious. Others including a business seminar in which oil executives are boasting of future profits are sobering.  This movie will not change the minds of Bush partisans or haters, but for those who normally don't attend the political process or are on the fence will find a lot to chew on.  FARENHEIT 9/11 is a powerfully moving film that cannot be dismissed out of hand.  As such I would definitely recommend it.	4.0	Despite bias, FAREHEIT 9/11 is powerful and compelling	2004-06-28	15	3	12

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3HHV1TH8P9J14	Heather M	I must say that the previews do not do the film justice. If you have not seen the film, you may have already made assumptions based on the previews and the hype. The movie is not all about George Bush and the war in Iraq, although that is a large portion of it. This film is about the American way of life, our media, and corporate greed that has seeped into the government. This film is not Bush-bashing. This film is not unpatriotic, in fact you can sense the love for America in almost every part of this movie. Most of the things that you are presented with are facts, out there to be verified, there is footage from CSPAN, FOX, CNN and the others. The dates and occurrences are real, and you cannot dispute them, no matter what your political party may be.When I left the theater I was in tears, I could not speak about the movie for about a half hour. It took a long time to think, and absorb what I had seen. While those of us that follow the news (and I do not mean FOX or other network news, but real news) are aware of most everything that you are presented with, this movie puts it all together and in perspective. There was a lot of things in the movie I did not know, a lot of situations I could never have imagined.I think I cried through about 25% of this film. There are a lot of moments I found myself seething in anger, others where I felt complete disappointment in the United States government, and some where all I could do was shake my head in disbelief. One thing I did notice about this film is that Moore was barely on screen, he stepped aside and let the facts, footage and interviews carry the film on it's own. This is great for many of those who feel that Moore himself, is at times, too abrasive.I have heard many people say that this movie is all propaganda, designed to get more votes for the Democratic party in November, but I have to disagree. Those who are Anti-Bush will still be Anti-Bush, those who are Pro-Bush will dismiss this movie and move on, those that are undecided could still go either way depending on how much they already knew. I do not think the intention was to turn Republicans into Democratic voters, but more to get people talking, and to get people thinking. If this movie succeeds at that, I believe Michael Moore will feel his film was a success. I think that everyone should see this film before November, no matter what you believe.	5.0	A must see (especially before November)	2004-07-04	17	11	6

The character formation of some combatants (though certainly not all) seemed to be based on having grown up playing shoot-'em-up video games.

But they perhaps are the same people who see Fox News as really being ""Fair and Balanced"".  I would urge everyone to see this and make up their own minds before condemning or praising it.  I have never seen an entire theater cheer at the end of a film until now.  And rightly so.  To those who call it unpatriotic, just think of how this country was born.  It was born by brave people questioning those in power.  If anything, this movie has restored my patriotism.  And I consider Michael Moore a great patriot.

I must say, however, that I have new respect for him, having seen this movie. I accept that some of the footage may be taken out of context; certainly a great deal of it isn't. I have seen enough television in the past two years or so to know that. Some of the criticism about the movie is just wrong. For instance, I recently saw a film critic complaining about the scene where Moore approaches members of Congress to ask them why their children do not volunteer to go to Iraq. Specifically the critic said that these scenes were disingenuous, since members of congress cannot volunteer their children for military duty even if they wanted to. That is not what Moore says at all. He asks the members of Congress he approaches to ""try"" to get their children to volunteer, something totally different. It is not even debatable that the children of members of the U. S. Congress and Senate, at least most of them, never see military duty and that this war is being fought by men and women of color and sons and daughters of poor and middle-class white famililes-- while our president urges the rest of us to go shopping. Or in his case, he shoots another round of golf.Some of this footage will make your laugh, some scenes will make your cry, much of this movie will make you very angry. And sad. And frightened.Why was Ashcroft sworn in on a stack of three Bibles, I ask. And who were the people that Bush was speaking to at a black tie event, when he said something to the effect that he was talking to the ""haves"" and ""have mores""? It brought a big laugh from his audience but not the theatre audience.I suspect that 99% of the people who see this film already know who they are voting for in November.

We all know Michael Moore as the big guy from ""Bowling For Columbine"", yet on this movie with all the controversy surrounding it he affirms himself as a wonderful director and comedian. Now you may have thought he had no real connection to 9/11, however one of his colleagues was killed in the WTC disaster. All the more reason to bash Bush and create one of the more revealing and controversial movies of 2004.This movie exposes some shocking truths about the Bush administration and how they reacted to 9/11. It leaves some questions for the viewers to answer themselves though it answers lots of questions many Americans were just too afraid to ask.Did President Bush really win the 2000 election?-That is really one of the points that you have to decide for yourself, however you are given lots of evidence. Fox may have actually decided the fate of that election. All the other news organisations apart from Fox called Florida in favour of Al Gore thus supposedly handing him the presidency, however when Fox called Florida in the favour of Bush the other channels followed suit and Bush won the elction, however the person that called Florida in favour of Bush was actually his first cousin.Michael Moore's profile of a woman from his home-town was simply breathtaking. Lila Lipscomb from Flint, Michigan is profiled in the film because her son is in Iraq fighting. Then she finds out that her son has died and she goes to Washington and to the outside of the White House. Her portrayal is amazing.This movie has made me wonder how on earth he won a second term in office and makes me come to respect life even more.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	This film is extremely interesting . Filmed in kinetic documental style , the picture denounces delicate , unknown and powerful facts involved in the Circles of the Power .To my mind the film has peaks an lows ; the recruiting process left me with a very bitter taste because I expected Moore was far beyond in this premise .In the other hand , the crucial events such the secret connections between the Petroleum affairs and the implications which carried to the all most known of 1973 event ; the impact and relation between the necessity of creating war stages and its hidden implications in the Financial World are issues which concerns not only to USA but the rest of the globe . The memory is too fragile and sometimes you need explain certain issues you consider totally fixed .There are many touching moments a bit overlong in the film and in the other hand there are extremely smart moments too short as that one close to end in which Moore requires to one of the Members of Senate for requesting one of his sons to join the Iraq conflict.The environment question was out . The burning Oil fields  after the Gulf War has been one of the most unforgiven and criminal acts in the recent story , the Alaska project and the final destiny of the wasted nuclear material could have been another winner points.May be the documental style has its own rules but I would like to know the position of some other high personalities such Tony Blair,  Jacques Chirac, Aznar , Clinton, Kissinger among others or Peace Nobel winners about this intriguing and delicate web of hidden issues which we will never reach to know in the time of our lives due the simple fact are classified information.Anyway a brave and well received film in the rest of the world -Winner in Cannes 2004- which leaves you as must be with more questions than answers due its unexhausted and arresting lines .	5.0	There is something rotten in Denmark !	2004-11-06	30	18	12

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3KOFEXASZW5MC	hjonkers	"Although Moore's efforts to get Bush out have failed so far, his film still is a refreshing picture that gives some great insights into the actions of the current USA government. On the other hand, like some other reviewers I think Moore misses out a lot of opportunities to make an even more powerful indictment. Moore makes it appear as if the main goal of the Bush government is oil and business contacts - there may be some truth in that, but this is really an all-too simplistic view. The word neoconservative is not mentioned at all - why not mention the ideology that so strongly drives this cabinet and indict it (which is easy enough), and why not say more about Bush's fundamentalist religious convictions? And on the level of actions - where are Guantanamo Bay and other cases of ignoring the Geneva Charter? These may be some of the most heinous and typical actions of the administration and provide most excellent ammunition for critics - but we do not hear about them.Instead, Moore spends a large part of the film (about the entire second part) to tell what a misfortunate idea it was to invade Iraq - sure, he's right, but we all know that (well, *many* do). There is the story of a mother who lost her son in the war, which is very moving for sure, but such stories have been in the newspapers and journals all the time. I'd rather see him offering some revealing material (as happens in the first hour) than making a documentary like anyone else does.Certainly there is a lot positive in Moore's narration about the war, too. The Orwellian quote about war was right spot-on, and if anything Moore convinces you even more that the war in Iraq was a misfortunate idea. Particularly amusing is it when he goes asking conservative Congressmen to let their sons serve in the army - of course their reactions are expectable, but one of them draws such a terrified face when he's asked this (""why, *my* son in the army?""), that he perfectly betrays his own hypocrisy. It is not the rich who sustain this war, as Moore aptly concludes, but mostly the poor ones like those from Flint, Michigan where, due to sheer disinterest of the administration, half the population is without work. Here Moore creates a great image of a government that is so rigorous in foreign policies while it cannot even sustain the situation within its own borders. The same is true for the Oregon coast, where due to budget cuts only one agent can patrol. Does the government actually care about security once the cameras are gone, you will ask yourself. And that while they constantly abuse the ""fear factor"" and have such laws as the Patriot Act that affect the most harmless imaginable citizens.Like many, I do have my doubts about some of the evidences Moore brings up in the first part of the movie about the Bush family's links to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens. Much of the evidence seems merely suggestive, particularly that of the oil pipeline deal in Afghanistan. It really goes a bit far to suggest, as Moore does, that Hamid Karzai was merely appointed because of his business contacts. But even if only a small part of the entire story is true (which I'm sure of) then Bush has quite something to explain. Particularly convincing is the part that narrates about the contacts of Saudi oil sheiks with companies Bush ruled (and ruined) in the 80's, and the dependence of the USA on Saudi investors - how can you act against the Saudis if they're such good friends of yours and effectively own 7% of the country? Again, there is a great hypocrisy in all this, and that is what Moore brings out so well during the entire movie. It is unfortunate that he feels the need to exaggerate things so often, since (as another reviewer aptly observed) the mere facts are saying enough. That, and Moore's reluctance to touch some of the Bush administration's most controversial actions keep this from being a 5-star film.Finally, it seems to have become fashion to say that the Democrats lost due to their total disrespect towards Bush, and that Moore is the best example of this attitude. What sense does this make? As if the Republicans have always been so flattering towards their opponents, and as if O'Reilly is such a nice guy.

It is more of a reality shock which some of us are too naive to realise the actual truth in what is going on the USA.  Moore possesses an incredibly charismatic way of depicting the truth and goes about it by creating a documentary film with all the facts in front of our very eyes.  Moore ironically portrays Bush as a lying, deceitful man who possesses no integrity and would do anything to remain in power.  He also shows Bush as having a low level of intelligence and that he cannot cope in such a high position without his advisors whom he relies on considerably.  He is portrayed as incapable of thinking anything for himself, a view which I think is upheld by most people.  Michael Moore reveals `secrets' that we do not know about politicians and uses documents as proof.  He felt that we all had a right to know and disclosed this to the world.  He shows us what the media may not necessarily show and this is why Fahrenheit 9/11 is truly exceptional in terms of quality and content.Michael Moore uses many techniques in Fahrenheit 9/11, which work to strongly to expose George Bush as he really is.  He uses cuts to manipulate what George Bush is saying, uses emotive language and shows parents mourning over the loss of their children to gain the sympathy of the viewer and feel a strong anger towards Bush.  An example of how he uses cuts is when he may show the war in Iraq and burnt bodies being thrown in the back of a truck and then cut to Bush on holiday, which leaves people in shock thinking `how could he do that?' and that is exactly what Moore's intentions are.Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was released in 2004 before the election with the intention of people voting against George W. Bush.  For those who are opposed to Bush and his principles believe to an extent what Michael Moore is saying is true even before Fahrenheit 9/11 was released, their views on Bush may be now have been further enhanced.  On the other hand, people who are in favour of Bush may be unaware and shocked at some of the material Michael Moore exposes in Fahrenheit 9/11, but they nevertheless remain supportive of Bush.It can be argued that Fahrenheit 9/11 is too biased, however, Moore is only human and we all are capable of having a biased view on one thing or another.  If Moore were to show the Bush's more favourable side, then perhaps more people would appreciate the argument that he is trying to portray.  Nevertheless, Michael Moore did what he thought was best and expressed it passionately and he certainly did not care what people may think and I respect him for that.  I also respect him for creating such a documentary on the most powerful man in the world and not worrying about the repercussions.Huni(Harjinder Khaira)	4.0	Propaganda or the Truth?	2006-02-10	10	7	3

The second half goes into the war in Iraq. Now we might know why we were in Iraq instead of Afghanistan where Bin Laden hides out. A Special Force went in a few feet away from Bin Laden's location. Then the mission was abandoned. It is almost like the Bin Laden family is paying Bush to keep forces in Irag and profits going to defense contractor Haliburton while allowing Osama Bin Laden to get away.  The second half is a gritty depiction of the loss of life in the Iraq war and the way it effects ordinary guys and families from his home town of Flint, Michigan.  I liked it, but two parts are needed so that we don't forget the almost unreported events of the first half.	3.0	Great first half, second loses steam	2009-04-23	5	2	3

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3B2NZR3XN7LS9	Honest John	"First, I give this 5 stars because of the subject matter and the subject matter's importance, AND the supplemental interviews and DVD extras; but not for the quality of the documentary filmmaking.  More about that in a moment...The subject matter is very, very, deadly serious.  Easily the most important subject matter of this decade and certainly one of the top issues of the last 40 years.  Regardless of whether you consider yourself in one political camp or another, or neutral; you should know that the documentary looks at both individual, very personal concerns such as a mother who lost her son in the war, and also examines much broader, political and economic aspects and questions that deserve attention, and intelligent, calm discussion.****  Even if you have seen the film and disagree, you should WATCH THE DVD SUPPLEMENTAL footage.  If you miss these additional parts, you are missing 50% of the information.  Please see #2 belowAnd if you are critical of the main documentary's viewpoint, you may welcome the fact that the supplemental material is largely unedited, running footage devoid of any particular viewpoint from the film's authors.This documentary well deserves the praise for being one of the first to approach this subject at a time when virtually the entire Western world media would not (or could not) go near this topic.  When national fever is high and any questioning of the war effort is considered ""treason,"" ""unpatriotic,"" and ""morally wrong;"" our constitutional rights such as free speech and free assembly are in serious danger.The documentary portrays this, but (unfortunately) only in a sidelight fashion (one of many problems).  In fact, I'm not sure the filmmakers realized this was one of the greatest overriding issues.  If common citizens were better informed, the insane actions and atrocities would have never happened.Yet, the documentary displays this serious, national problem of the absentee press graphically and without any possible misinterpretation.  Both within the US and in other parts of the world, censorship and denial is taking place.  But it doesn't make the points strongly or clearly enough.Because this film and its issues have been seen now by tens of millions, it is part of our culture and that effect is growing.  To dismiss it without seeing it in its entirety (plus the supplemental materials!) is going to cast doubt on anyone who tries to discuss the documentary but doesn't know firsthand how the information is presented.  Basically, you can't attack the documentary's ideas unless you watch the documentary.  Hearing about it from your uncle or coworker will not be an acceptable working knowledge.Furthermore, since these are gigantic political and life-threatening issues, every citizen has a duty to be as informed as possible.  We can't have a country that goes to war, invades another 2 other countries, kills and permanently maims tens of thousands of its own soldiers and tens of thousands of citizens in the other countries, puts another 20,000+ in jail for six+ years, commits acts of torture by the thousands, and then has a substantial part of its own population refuse to consider this as right or wrong, and refuses to spend 2 hours of their time watching a easily available documentary that might shed new light or viewpoints on this situation.That being said, Michael Moore's and his filmmaking team's documentary skills and decisions are sometimes good, but other times quite poor.This documentary has several problems, and these have nothing to do with facts being correct or other content issues; this is strictly about the documentary filmmaking *process* and the decisions made in the creation of this work.-- Big Problem #1:If you have a film titled ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", don't start the film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities.Any filmmaker knows that every minute, and every second, of their footage is precious, especially the first 10 minutes.  A documentary on our nationwide election problems is just fine.  But that's another documentary; maybe a really good one, but I don't think it should have been included, except perhaps at the end.By starting off with material not directly related to the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Moore has given his critics ample fodder for criticism and rejection in the beginning, even if the reason for that rejection has flaws.This decision was a huge presentation blunder, and stole precious resources that could have been used to set up and structure the rest of the material, and prepare the audience for what was ahead.  In its final form, this information is irrelevant to the next 90 minutes and barely remembered after it's all over.-- Big Problem #2:As mentioned above, the filmmakers did not appear to have a good grasp of the subjects they were documenting, and there's no strong sense of what is important and what's not.The results are missed opportunities, a barrage of information, and a lack of clarity.  The information is not well organized, and it's not summarized or reviewed at times when a new viewer needs time to catch their breath.  This is a problem with editing and pacing; and understanding how a viewer or audience will mentally keep track of everything.That doesn't mean the material is incorrect or faulty, it means it's assembled and presented poorly.  As a comparison, I'd say it was like reading a book by starting with the last chapter, then backing up one chapter at a time.  Sure, you read the book and all the words, but the people, information, story, and connections are going to be a lot harder to put together with that kind of approach.We see a lot of really important information.  There's no doubt about that.But what are the most important points?  You might name 3, but someone else might name 3 completely different ones.  And both would be right!  However, this shouldn't happen if the documentary is well made.-- Big Problem #3:The film doesn't possess a good structure.It's not a particularly linear piece, neither does it follow several simultaneous information or storylines. It doesn't have a ""scientific"" approach or any other good format.  Instead it's an assembly line of data but fails to add up to a finished product, and following this analogy, some information falls off the assembly line and is easily forgotten.  Again, this doesn't mean the data is wrong, this is a mistake of filmmaking; and in all fairness, it's the sort of mistake one would expect from someone not well skilled at creating documentaries.  It's not amateur, but it's not tight and coherent either.The material is both dense emotionally explosive, and hard to digest, especially if you aren't familiar with all the facts.  But the presentation doesn't work to help the viewer through this, and connect the many pieces of information or give time for pause and review.  Instead, the presentation is relentless and has a zigzag structure which takes away from the power of the material rather than combine it to something stronger.For instance, we see critically important censorship and denial on the part of the media, but it's not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all the other information and data, and neither are the implications of this media black hole.  This needed stronger, more focused presentation. The great crime that a war for ""freedom"" has denied ""freedom of the press"" is very likely lost to many viewers.Add to this a seemingly never-ending series of musical jokes and segments, which I can't even guess at their purpose.  Here we are watching this [literally] deadly serious material, and suddenly we have silly rock music and images, like some low-grade music video.  This type of decision is truly amateur and pathetic; and just as shameful as the people being being joked about.  If the documentary filmmakers don't treat the subject with seriousness, how can they ridicule other people?But this documentary shouldn't have jokes.  In fact, no ""true documentary"" would ever take this lunatic approach, and this behavior easily opens up the entire subject to ridicule.  It's incomprehensible how any documentary would be created with this type of approach.  Shame on the producers, distributors, and anyone else involved with the production for not stepping forward and ""telling the emperor he has no clothes.""  This juvenile, dimwit approach disgraces the production and insults everyone who has suffered from the craziness of  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  This should never have happened.-- Big Problem #4:  Every moment of the film should be about runaway crazy ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" but it isn't.As an example, President Bush bangs the podium and exclaims the usual nonsense about terrorists hating freedom and hating American goodwill.  So why not show the real reasons?  Like the fact that the United States sold arms to Iran and Iraq as they fought each other years ago, creating immense hostility throughout the Middle East towards the US?  A little information, to either remind or inform the viewer of the real reasons for the hatred goes a long way to proving how we received an endless stream of lies and misleading information about the entire situation.Better yet, since you are doing a documentary, why not ask a variety of experts on the subject, and have them explain and agree or disagree with ""terrorists hate America and freedom"".Instead, precious moments in the documentary are stolen with largely dead or irrelevant material, such as when Michael Moore stands outside the Saudi Embassy with Secret Service coming to ask questions.  It's interesting, but belongs in the supplemental materials section.  That is not something that qualifies as national hysteria or ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  And it opens both Michael Moore and his entire team to criticisms of grandstanding and trying to be performers and part of the story instead of good documentary filmmakers.Here's one of the most important things you should know:In the original film documentary, we see a US military raid on a civilian home suspected to harbor terroristsTo my utter dismay, we see in the supplemental materials this is part of a much larger story with 10 times as much impact, with disgusting, barbaric and outrageous disrespect for ordinary citizens by our soldiers.  Unfortunately this is lost and jumbled in the original cut.The Swedish reporter with the US military unit tells us that no one, including Swedish media, would present this shocking and horrifying behavior.  Furthermore, only the supplemental material lets us have an idea of the type of documentary footage Michael Moore and his team had to work with.  In this well-documented sequence from the Swedish journalists, we see one of our military units invade an ordinary family's home and our soldiers physically and mentally abusing and terrorizing ordinary citizens, including tormenting a crippled old man. Apparently they didn't understand its importance.THEN!  ... we find out that one of the soldiers was drunk, and soldiers hit the old man's penis repeatedly, and this all happens with the commanding officer watching calmly to the side.  Why on earth wasn't this included in the main documentary?  This isn't as bad as Abu Ghraib torture sessions, but it's dynamite material nevertheless.And then we are told this is not anything unusual; in fact it's commonplace!Showing our military behaving like this is extremely important footage, and shows why people in Iraq and the Middle Eastern world have learned to hate the United States more and more each year.  Yet, this crucial segment is poorly presented and largely lost in the original documentary.Compared to some of the segments mentioned above, this is clearly more important.  But, it was cast aside.  I cannot understand this.It's hard to speculate, but if this was left out, we have to ask ourselves what other material has been discarded?  This is, unfortunately, just plain bad decision-making in the documentary process, a real lack of comprehension about on the part of the documentary filmmakers; and poor workmanship compared to other documentary work.-- Final thoughts:At this point you may think my opinion of the documentary is poor and maybe not worth viewing, so let me avoid the film's mistake and summarize this:This is an exceedingly serious and important documentary, and I recommend it along with the supplemental materials to anyone who considers himself a good American, of moral conscience, or anyone who has interest in American politics and actions.You don't have to agree but you should be familiar with the material and see all of it.That's why it gets 5 stars.  You need to watch this.However, I'm very critical of the documentary skill, or lack thereof, and a much better and threfore less controversial documentary could have been created from the same materials, and might have had a more positive impact and received wider acceptance.Even so, this needs to be seen.And if you are confused how I can give five stars to something with this many problems, let me repeat that just delving into this subject in the national, political environment of the time of its release was breakthrough and revolutionary.  It would have been ""great"" in the hands of others."	5.0	Extremely important subject, tainted by poor film making	2006-11-03	13	7	6

The word lie to a liberal is any subject that exposes the ""actual truth"" of the liberal agenda. They are afraid of this and don't want people to hear, because they know they're wrong. The word ""truth"" to them is anything that is concocted to meet the criteria of their belief system. Notice how the mainstream press protects anyone on the left these days? NBC, CBS, ABC and especially CNN does it, and it's done in such a clever way.This movie is more like fiction than it is a documentary, it cannot be proven since this is only through the eyes of a bleeding-heart liberal.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2B0XO8BTPRX7R	Ian Vance	"""All art is propaganda; not all propaganda is art."" - George Orwell...and in my opinion, Michael Moore's timely screed *Fahrenheit 9/11* is Art with a capital A, a near-masterpiece of skewed filmmaking in the fine tradition of *Triumph of the Will* and *Birth of a Nation*, though far more left-leaning than its predecessors.  Composed, with almost equal ratio, of damning evidence and below-the-belt circus antics; dripping with well-deserved contempt for the Bush administration; smothered with borderline-exploitative pathos and bookended by a shellshocked white-liberal's politik angst: *Fahrenheit 9/11* is immensely entertaining and highly relevant in our spin-era, and a must see for any self-respecting liberal (affirmation after affirmation for the leftest paradigm), neo-con (c'mon! Know thy Enemy, yaas?) and film-student alike.To be honest, I'm highly ambivalent of Michael Moore as a ""journalist,"" or, for that matter, a social critic.  Nor am I affiliated with one of the two political juntas that currently split the U.S.A in two: to give this review a proper perspective, let's just say I'm one of those ""moderates"" despised by both camps for not kowtowing to the prevalent rhetoric of-the-moment.  And yet, the talent that composed *Fahrenheit 9/11* cannot be denied - this man knows how to push buttons.  Scruffy and slovenly, Moore's working-class faade contrasts that of his contemporaries (Huff n' Puff blowhard Bill O'Reilly, Oxycotin spokesman Limbaugh, the pathologically perverse enigma that is Ann Coulter), but the essentials of media-manipulation remain steadfast - selective information coupled with highly-skilled editing tricks; shameless pandering; carnival-barker crowd theatrics ... but while his contemporaries tend to shovel all of the tribulations of modern society on the catch-phrase explicate ""liberal"" - lowest common denominator ad hominem expressed in the most blas&eacute; manner possible - Moore's focus here is centered upon the figurehead, the cowboy in control, the inexplicable but all too real joke that is the DUBYA.""Was it all a dream?"" Moore wonders at the beginning of the film, tickling a major sore-spot for his core audience with scenes from the 2000 election fiasco.  I have to admit that it's a guilty pleasure watching Moore take on Bush Co. with both barrels loaded and plenty of ammunition to spare; and although 9/11's cut n' paste technique is often misleading (yes, I've read the 56 deceits page), the material in itself is a damning enough portrait of greed, corruption, hubris, Wizard of Oz stylized fear-tactics, base stupidity...it's all here, folks, in voluptuous quantity.And the music cues - oh, those music cues! - Moore displays as deft a sense at the mixing board as at the editing equipment, and the result is, at times, flat-out hilarious. Bush and family cavorting at the ranch and golf course to down-home country jams - gut busting! Bush's service record underscored by a few bars of Eric Clapton's 'Cocaine' - lip-quivering!  Sinister Arabic music, reminiscent of a villain theme for a James Bond flick, to introduce a rather offensive Saudi Arabian Bush Co. connection - sheer genius! The use of sound is not just confined to the humorous, however.  The black-screen treatment of 9/11, complete with screams and destructive rumbling, is highly effective, and I was surprised Moore showed restraint and did not include footage of the dual impact or the suicide-jumpers.  The burning of Baghdad is underscored by the dirge n' strum of a soldier's favorite carnage-score: the result is jaw-dropping, a horrific example of psychological triune-stroke to motivate battle-heat; when juxtapositioned with the burnt, mutilated Iraqi corpses, it inspired in me both nausea - for the brutality of life; and admiration - for the artistic will composting the film. *Fahrenheit 9/11* continued on, relentless, thoroughly exposing Bush Co. as a plutocratic nightmare to the concept of democracy; and my outbursts of laughter at the antics became edged with a growing hysteria-tone - for this absurd theater was/is all too real, not to mention readily and rabidly defended by the meme-drenched Republican masses.Moore does fumble from time to time.  Certain segments went on too long, the African-American representative reaction being a prominent example.  The patriotic mother/slain child segment also occupied a bit too much of the running time, despite it remaining the heart of the film and its most melodramatic example of Bush Co. betrayal.  My major beef with the film, however (thus the reduction of one star) is that Moore barely scratches at the surface in regards to some of the subjects he brings up: *Fahrenheit 9/11* can easily be seen as a liberal-slander greatest hits package, with all of the accusation and little of the depth.  Still, I know Art when I see it, and Farenhight 9/11 fits the bill.  Big time.  It's status as perhaps _the_ watercooler film of the year (alongside the Catholic Guilt Catharsis of certain other independent 2004 release), when coupled with its explosive success and critical timing, is testament enough. F 9/11 is the most important film released in 2004.Highly recommended."	4.0	Immensely Entertaining, and Relevant: Propaganda at its Best	2004-10-05	19	14	5

Dispute whether this is a documentary or propaganda all you would like. Doesn't matter.  Was the Iraq war really fought for oil and war profiteering or to remove despot from a rogue state? Even that doesn't matter, at least not at this point, anyway. Is this scene or that fact or fiction? Even THAT doesn't matter. Like Moore, hate him - it's inconsequencial.  For this film contains one astonishing scene, caught on tape, that calls into question Bush's fitness to be commander-in-chief.  The infamous 7 minutes.While our nation was under attack, Bush was advised by Andrew Card(?) as he read My Pet Goat to some fourth graders in a Florida school. There he stood, seemingly terrified, like a deer with its eyes caught in the headlights, with nary a clue what to do, for over seven minutes.  Unbelievable.  What an absolutely amazing display of ineptness and utter lack of leadership skill. If there is one sequence that exposes this president as the fraud that he is, it's that one.Have you ever been paged in the office and had to drop what you're doing because business crisis had emerged? Have you, in your life ever had to react to an emergency situation that required immediate action?  Our nation was under attack.  There was no question about it.  Our ""quick thinking"" leader sat - obviously terrified, reading My Pet Goat, in a critical situation when thousands (millions?) of lives were at stake, when time was of the essence, as our NATION WAS UNDER ATTACK BY TERRORISTS!This scene alone should disqualify President Bush for a second term, he is simply, as evident by this sequence, unfit for command.  ""War President"", indeed.  When I heard about this scene, before I saw the film, I almost dismissed it.  I found myself (gasp) siding with the Bush apologists.  Uh uh, see it for yourself.  It completely calls into question Bush's ability to handle crisis situations.  I think it will even give hard right Bush supporters pause.  Disagree over ideologies - right vs left, there ARE fundamental characteristics that the leader of the free world must possess that transcend these ideologies.  Highest among them is the ability to handle a crisis.  Anyone who can't do it has no busness in the oval office.  Clearly Bush, as evident in this scene, doesn't have the right stuff.Having said that, the film completely misses the boat regarding an item critical to its thesis.  That item is The Project for a New American Century.  More attention needs to be focused on this document. For this, clearly, outlines the reasons we went to war in Iraq.  911 was viewed as a once in a lifetime window of opportunity to execute the neoconservative agenda; the democratization of the middle east through the use of force.  That they did, to the tune of approaching 1000 US military deaths, 10-15 thousand Iraqi deaths, and $200 billion US tax-payer dollars.  Moore leaves this out of his film.  Perhaps it isn't sensationalistic enough? I would love to know why. For me, its omission was a disappointing missed opportunity to bring the damned and damning document - the PNAC document, to the attention of the masses.Fool me once shame on, shame on you.

Hodgkinson	"You will notice that most one star reviews of the films assert lies within the film Fahrenheit 9/11, without being able to identify any of these lies: It's a shame that they can't, because Michael Moore has stated repeatedly, to numerous publications around the world, that he will give $10,000 to whoever can prove he's lied: And so far, he has yet to pay so much as a single cent out.This is not surprising, when you consider most of those critical of the film haven't even seen it, or much less know much about Moore himself. The film doesn't refer to September 11th? There is harrowing sound footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 of one of the towers being struck, the audience left in the dark to listen to the people's terrified screams, and imagine the horror they must be witnessing. He's only made two films? His first film was actually ""Roger And Me""...Nor will any of the critics dare answer Fahrenheit 9/11's most powerful and closing imagery: that of Lila Lipscomb. A woman who patriotically hangs the Stars and Stripes outside her home every morning. A woman who encourages the local children of poverty-stricken Flint to enlist in order in order to secure a future from themselves. But also a woman who is reduced to collapsing in tears outside the White House, by someone so lacking in dignity that they'd accuse a grieving mother, an inch from her face, of lying about having a son killed in Iraq.And at current rates of losses, there will be 1,000 Lila Lipscomb's close to the anniversary of September 11th this year. Propaganda? No, the simple, awful truth, irrespective of whether you accept the earlier, more Bush focused part of the film or not. Her son, Michael Pedersen IS dead. As are the uncounted tens of thousands of sons and daughters of Iraqi men and women too: Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us one such mother, digging through the rubble of her former home, desperately seeking her daughter who is buried under it... We see her screaming for Allah to save her, to explain what her little girl has done to deserve such a fate... and then her grief wracked mind tries to bargain for her daughters life: Why doesn't Allah kill American children instead of the children of the devoted? But if he did, would that bring her daughter back? Does killing Iraqi's bring the victims of September 11th back? Or does the circle of violence just continue to claim ever more victims?This IS the reality of War. Fahrenheit 9/11 simply reminds you of it, and asks you if it was really worth paying in this War's particular case.And this is supposed to be the essence of what Democracy actually is: To inform the people of the true state of affairs, and ask them to make choices upon what they would prefer it to be. Screaming at grieving mothers about lying, or putting your fingers in your ears so you can't hear the laments of those who must dig amongst their homes for what's left of their family is the true Anti-Americanism, because it attempts to deny the right of people to make an informed choice. And that is really what the One Star Warriors here are engaged in: They would prefer for you to not know the true reality of War, for fear that you will make a different choice regarding it than themselves.But EVERYONE should be required to see the true face of what is occurring in Iraq, and what is still occurring in Iraq:  Because what occurs there means that many, many mothers will never see their own children's faces again... and we owe it to them, we owe it to Democracy and America, to be as informed as possible before accepting a choice which has such a high price for those involved.So, see this film... not because it's a masterpiece (it's not: the first half in particular is ham-handed in style) or because it's particularly funny (it isn't, depressingly not at times) or even because of the controversy surrounding it; but because it gives a voice to people like Lila Lipscomb and tens of thousands like her. See it, because it's your democratic duty to do so."	5.0	Fahrenheit 1000 by 9/11	2004-08-24	34	26	8
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	APMP0E93851OW	I. Jansen	Ive been taught in my life to look at all the issues. While my familly has always voted on the side of the right wing, i was always told to think for myself. I know the differences in this country are whos on the right or left, and whos loyal to which side. I am more of a realist though, when it comes to the facts. While this movie does it best in showing you how much the president is incopitent in the handling of the countries afairs, it should be taken into consideration that this particullar administation, not all republicans are to blame. Having both my father and step father serve in vietnam, both enlisted men, come back and protest against what was going on showed me at a very early age the great country in which we live. These people sacrificed their lives for the good of this country. Blindly going into war just for the sake of america. They both lost many good friends, loved ones, and still grieve to this day. Seeing what we're in war for, and why were their is a travesty. Especially when people in office are benifiting handsomely while the common americans die denfending us from something that never threatend us. It is just a case of using common sence. IF you dont agree with bush, or kerry, look at what nader has to offer. just use your heads. Ignorance is bliss. But when the facts are presented to you in clear view IT is your duty as americans TO take a stand. TO honor all of those who have protected, and those who have died trying to protect our rights. Look at the deficite, look at the unemployment, and think what your children will have to endure in order to survive. If this administation is not serving the genneral publics best interest something must be done. Common sence also has alot to do with name calling as well. Calling someone Fat because they dont hold your idea of whats right is, to say the very least, a frustated at the facts statement. wheather you like Moore or not, he has provided the facts, what ever order they are in, They are the facts. Pretend bush is neither a repeblican or democrat. and vote with your consience. Or continue the name calling and watch the country split even further. We must all work together to heal the country. If we dont try and work together what are we hear for? Every one has different opinions, but unless we actually try we will fall.	4.0	The Truth Be Told	2004-08-15	22	14	8

It was informative, emotionally moving, and even comical at times. As far as the accusations of ""lies"" from right-wingers... how can film footage of Bush golfing while he is saying he's doing ""all he can to find these terrorist killers,"" be made up? How can the footage of him at a fundraiser for the Elite be made up? How is the heartache felt by the mother who lost a son in Iraq faked? These events really happened-- get over it. This film should be required viewing for the entire American  electorate. It raises honest questions about our current leadership that could fuel informed debate.

This film made me laugh, it made me cry and it had a huge impact on my political views.  As a liberal, i went into the theatre anxious and came out in shock.  Some will complain that the movie was very one-sided, but I think that Moore was aware of this and and some people are too naive to realize that this movie's purpose is to let people see what is going on and what the Bush administration is about.

Actually, it is one of the most important and relevant pieces of film ever made. Unlike Moore's previous work, his personal interventions are reduced to a surprising minimum and the material speaks for itself. We all know that the movie expresses a liberal point of view. However, if only 1/5 of the material showed there was true, it would be enough to reconsider many political positions (and BTW, regardless of what Fox News says, the movies is quite accurate in many things). I would say that regardless of your political affiliation, you should see this movie. If you are a Democrat or a Liberal, it will give you more reasons to be politically active. If you are a conservative or a Republican, it is a personal responsibility to watch this, digest it, criticize it and assume the full consequences of your vote. It is not about convincing or propaganda. It is about putting in the table matters of the utmost important in the year when they matter the most. My respect and recognition to Moore for his bravery. I invite all viewers to leave aside the hype of the movie, watch it because of its importance and make your own mind about it.

The only point I am going to bring up is his film shot in Walter Reed Hospital. He manipulated the film shot there of actual war casualties who had body parts amputated to make it seem that they were against the war. In several interviews post Farenheit 9/11's debut these people in Walter Reed have been disgusted that they were used by Moore to further his own propaganda when they were proud of what they had accomplished over there and would have done it again.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A5MWTP4IF3TL7	I need a Margarita	This movie incites a rift in America right down party lines. While Farenheit 9/11 is loosely labeled a documentary, what people need to realize is that this is still just a movie. But just because it was cleverly edited, remember that Moore didn't fake the footage of the President at the golf course and any other footage (even though he can cut around the headlines)in the film. Of course Michael Moore plays on the public's emotions and sense of patriotism- it makes for good viewing.In the end, Moore is still just a filmaker and he did what he set out to do- make money. He may try to exploit his own political agenda, but if you don't agree with him then don't buy/see the movie, since that just supports Moore's endeavors. For all the bible-thumping conservatives to know that they hated the movie, they had to watch it (or else they should never pass judgement on it), and that's what he wanted in the first place. More tickets sold to people for the sole purpose of bashing the flick. And in the end, if you base your political affiliations and ideals on a movie anyway, then you're the one in need of change, not Michael Moore.	4.0	In the end, it's still just a movie	2004-11-01	34	18	16

Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand that there is no REAL truth. Covering something from all angles, be it a war, an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth, only confusion.It's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film. And I agreed with it long before I saw it. The point is President Bush must not be re-elected. And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why. However it's the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent the film from having any real dignity or class. Sure there is a sense of humor and huge understanding of American politics (you MUST pay attention to every last word) but Moore's point is too biased to really connect with me. Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a second (or 1, 345, 456th) chance. It's just that his intentions come across too forcefully.Yes, the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human life since the Vietnam catastrophe. And all for what? For money, nothing more than paper. If we ever come through this will we trust the Government again? Most ominously not. After watching this film will you ever trust the Government again? I promise you...you won't!There are some powerful scenes, a woman breaking down in tears reading a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed, every Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up, the charred bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq. But the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious. The opening to Fahrenheit 9/11 plays the sounds of planes crashing into the WTC on a black screen. Powerful effects without the use of images at all. Why? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again. Because terrorism is blind. Out of respect for people sensitive for such images being exploited yet again. And to heighten our awareness of the horror of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life.There are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you, be it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling the woman crying over her dead son 'staged'. Sadly though, it wanders off the point in the middle and kind of sags.If it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient. But as it stands Fahrenheit 9/11 is an unapologetic firestorm designed to rip right through the Whitehouse and the Senate. With any luck it will.We may not ever trust any new administration but we'll NEVER be fooled again. Lesson might be learned. But at what price?	4.0	Very important point...	2004-07-11	22	16	6

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AOIPPEZ66R2UP	"Into ""voidness"""	"I don't know what I can add to the nearly 1,800 reviews that are already here, but here goes...It's understandable that after experiencing the darkest side of American capitalism first hand in Flint, MI, that Michael Moore still thinks that US foreign policy is all about the money, but I sat through this whole movie waiting for him to drop the bombshell that a good chunk of what the ""neo-cons"" are about is fundamentalist Christianity...but that never came. Hell, even 60 Minutes ran a piece last year about how potentially powerful the evangelicals are, politically, in the US.There is a lot of debate going around right now as to what ""neo-conservativism"" really is, and whether or not it actually exists. I don't feel that it's too much of a mystery. Yeah, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, etc. don't carry cards in their wallets saying that they are ""neo-cons,"" nor do they sport neo-con T-shirs under their shirts and ties, nor do they have a secret handshake, but there is a very real movement afoot among them and others like them; and it's purpose is to build a world in America's image: not just a world of democracy and capitalism, but a world that practices these things EXACTLY like America does; no more, no less. The tragic events of 9/11 have given them just cause, as they see it, to say, ""No more, Mr. Nice Guy,"" and bring their ideology ""out of the closet,"" to a greater degree, as if to say to the democrats, and the rest of the world, ""Okay, your way didn't work with these terrorists, so now we're going to do it OUR way""...and, in this way, the 9/11 terrorists gave them exactly the grist they needed for things like a Homeland Security Dept., ""The Patriot Act,"" and the Iraq war.There is no question in my mind that fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity is behind the neo-con movement...the only question is to what degree are they fundamentalists themselves, and to what degree are they just pandering to fundamentalist fears and values in order to secure 70,000,000 votes every election. The disorganized democratic party needs to wake up to how much political power the evangelical movement wields and how unified they are in their vision of one nation, and one world, under the Christian god. They are potentially every bit as dangerous as the fundementalist Islamic terrorists that the neo-cons have waged war against, perhaps even more so.Moore completely misses the religious aspect of the ""war on terrorism,"" making it mostly just about Saudi oil money, and I feel that as much sediment as this movie stirred up, some people just found that a little hard to believe. If he had brought up the whole ""holy war"" aspect of this conflict, it would've brought the wrath of the bible thumpers down on him (although it's hard to imagine that Moore would be intimidated by that), but it probably would've ruffled some more of the RIGHT feathers as well. Furthermore, Moore seems to get a little more ""grandstandy"" with each documentary, driving in thumbtacks with sledgehammers; and I think this tends to appeal more and more to the ""choir"" that's already on his side, and less and less to people on the fence whose minds might otherwise be changed by his movies. The ""ice cream truck loudspeaker"" bit in this movie, might've been a little much, for example. I know some pretty liberal people who think that Michael Moore's getting to be too much of a smart ass. If it gets to the point where too many people ""run and hide when they see you coming"" how effective can you be?Fundamentalist religion, and the corresponding belief that ""man""--as God/Allah's favored species--can do whatever the hell he wants here on earth, is the single biggest threat to humanity...and those of us who can still think for ourselves need to wake up to that fact, while we can still save our civilization. Organized religion has little to do with TRUE faith, or REAL spirituality.

Not only is this film significant with one of the most important elections of our time looming over us, it's also entertaining.  It's a very humorous film, mostly because George W. Bush, without meaning to be, is so utterly ridiculous. (It's been said all along that he has the best lines in the whole film!)I do want to point out, in response to many of the accusations I've been reading in these reviews, that ALL of the facts presented in this film have been proven true.  They are indisputable. Moore's opinions are his own, and he arrives at them by some evidences that Bush supporters probably wish could have stayed buried, but facts are still facts.  Yes, members of the bin Laden family were flown home 2 days after 9/11, with nothing more than a cursory passport check.  Yes, Bush really did waste 7 minutes while the country was under attack, wearing a stupid, deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, while a grade school class read ""My Pet Goat"" and people died horribly in NYC. (He didn't want to frighten the children, he said.  He wanted to project calm.  What do most of you do during a crisis?  Do you deal with it directly, perhaps staving off more harm, or do you sit motionless, befuddled,  wondering what to do, while poor souls jump out windows of 100-story buildings rather than burn alive?) Yes, the Bush family really does have very strong ties and interests in keeping the Saudis happy.  Yes, there's a very strong parallel beetween the grieving Iraqui woman and the grieving American mother of a KIA soldier in Iraq. No, we really had no business invading a country on false pretenses.  Weapons of mass destruction, anyone?  Anyone?  Where?  Oops, made a mistake, and only 1000+ Americans have died so far while the rich (like Bush's ""base"") line their pockets further.If anything the only regret I have about this movie is that it makes me so angry.

In this film, Moore just listens, and observes, he is not playing an active part, very much.

I fail to see the treason and libel in it. My most enduring images from the film are when black representatives beg an uncaring senate for an investigation into the Florida ""election""-procedure, and when Bush is just sitting after being told about the attacks. Is that really the action of a determined, strong president? Waiting for Dick or Karl to tell him what to do? The White House has never come up with an explanation for that, any explanation.I wish Mr. Moore could have included the first presidential debate, and Powell's presentation to the UN as features.

He makes absurd leaps in logic, and makes connections where there are none. Moore and his kind want the President to be a bumbling idiot, but at the same time, want him to be a diabolical genius capable of orchestrating 9/11, which in itself is as treasonous an accusation as there could be. It's treasonous because these people aren't just raising questions, they're making declarations.The scary part about Moore's crockumentaries is the fact that everybody will watch them and believe them despite their blatant dishonesty. People assume that documentaries are supposed to be ethical and truthful. And they ARE supposed to be; which is why Michael Moore's can't be qualified as such.The interesting thing is, if Moore really believed what he stood for was the truth, he wouldn't need to lie and distort to prove his argument.Whether its Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, or 9/11--he's never been fair to his topic.

From one who's been paying attention to BOTH sides of the issues for the last 4 years I hate to tell you - Mike actually did that.Unfortunately for Bush apologists, it didn't skirt delicately around or soften the blows of the effects of Bush's policies nor his history. If you're a right-wing conservative and you still need to be coddled, I'm sure William Safire or Sean Hannity or Bob Novak or Anne Coulter or Rush Limbaugh (among many, many others - 'liberal' press my ass) have many comforting platitudes to explain away what's going on right under our noses.The notion that Mike only made F9/11 for the money is ludicrous and again a cheap ad hominem attack to try and undermine the film as a whole, rather than take on what it presents. How does this square with his attempts to screen the film for free and the allowance of people to download and distribute it?Because bottom line: the facts that Mike brings up in the film are irrefutable - it's the conclusions he draws from them that are questionable - though even then he draws some pretty good conclusions. I do not agree with everything he claims, but F9/11 paints an undeniably frank picture of the corrupt man sitting in the White House after a fraudulent election who has gotten the United States as in over its head as he is. Remember, Bush has lied us into a war where we've murdered civilians and sexually abused prisoners, not to mention the physical and psychological toll the war has taken on the troops we sent there. Seeing F9/11 might help you see how my criticism is not partisan slander.People who've questioned Bush from the beginning remember how we were told we were 'unpatriotic' and were scolded not to criticize the pResident - F9/11 coming out gives us permission to talk about what's happening. And with the numerous attempts to silence the film, that's something it's detractors clearly do not want.	5.0	Some of this film is damning in ANY context...	2004-10-21	34	25	9

Luckily, I never spent a dime  to watch this movie; I went to the cinema, paid for a different movie, but walked into the one showing this movie, and only because so many Bush-haters talked about it. It really is a movie for people who hate Bush [...], people who want to believe (regardless of facts) all of Bush's doings being wrong. Apparently, the movie did not help Kerry win the election. Fortunately, many Americans realized what Bush is doing, is right. I am a Democrat, but after 9/11 I voted for Bush.

Bush.  And everything in this film was contructed to instigate Dubya's donwfall.Well, let me clarify the word ""constructed"".  Most people tend to fall on either side of the fence when it comes to this movie, the conservatives would say it's all liberal propaganda, and the liberals would hail Moore as the champion of undisputed truth.  To be fair, they are both right, and they are both wrong.  If you'd just keep a clear head as you watch this movie, and do a little research yourself, you'll find that Moore does manipulate history to mislead people's thinking, but there are also areas that's been well researched and supported.  Examples: While Moore pointed out that the Bin Ladens in America were the only ones allowed to fly immediately after 9/11, they were in fact put on flights one week after normal air travels had resumed in the country; on the other hand, the Bush family's strong business ties with the Bin Ladens and the Saudis are very well documented by other sources and dates back to Bush senior.  So when I use the word ""contructed"", I don't mean Moore had gone ahead to invent fictional facts for the purpose of his political agenda, but rather, he has found a way to creatively and artistically put together the truthes and the half-truthes in a presentation against Bush.Is it a good documentary, hmm, debatable.  It's very opionated and by no means fair-handed.  Moore does build a strong case against Bush, criticising his character flaws and delivers seemingly a mountain of evidence on his questionable relationship with the Saudis.  He stops just short of implicating Bush in the attach itself, although I doubt he would mind if his audience was being led down that path.  Is this a good movie?  Sure.  I found it to be both insightful and entertaining at the same time.  Moore is a skilled filmmaker, and knows how to find humorous and yet revealing angles to tackle an issue.Love him or hate him, Moore and ""Fahrenheit 911"" probably has helped to inspire a new level of civic enthusiasm that's unseen in this country for many years, manifesting itself in the high level of voter turnout at this last election, ironically, the result was probably much to his chagrin."	4.0	Don't Believe Everything That You See	2004-12-30	12	5	7

He called me and every other American stupid, now honestly, how can you follow this guy? And when will Amazon make 0 stars an option? One star is one more star than this deserves.President Bush's reelection with more popular votes than any other presidential candidate in history (over 62 million, and I'm proud to have been one of them, the first time I voted in a presidential election) and the first time a presidential candidate has gotten a majority of popular votes since 1988 proves that America sees past Mooreon's lies. Also, Mooreon said that he hoped more Americans would die in Iraq so Bush wouldn't be reelected, he called the insurgents the true patriots in Iraq and said they were going to win, and called Zarqawi, the terrorist responsible for beheading civilians, a ""minuteman."" Statements like this during wartime are nothing short of sedition. Now this socialist fatass is making a sequel to this movie.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A34KKRE4ZIP7Q6	Jacqueline M. Lum	My wife and I went to see the movie last night out of curiosity. I've never voted in my life and my wife is conservative. I'm puzzled over how it is that Moore, a guy who casts himself in his own films as the underdog, now seems more like the arrogant elitists he used to lampoon so effectively. Whether or not you agree with his arguments in Fahrenheit 9/11 - and there's a lot to debate.But the Michael Moore of Roger & Me was a modest man who seemed genuinely interested in getting at the truth, along with afflicting the smug and comfortable with good humour. The Michael Moore of Fahrenheit 9/11 seems petty and vindictive, bent on not only taking down the people he disagrees with, but also humiliating them for the sheer screw-you sport of it.Moore makes some valid points in the movie about the Bush Administration's handling of the terrorism file before and after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He asks questions - not new, but still requiring answers - about relations between the Bush family and Saudi oil interests, including the family of 9/11 terrorist Osama bin Laden. He asks, as many people do, why members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. shortly after 9/11, despite the grounding of all aircraft in the wake of the terror attacks.He thunders righteously, mainly through emotional interviews with bereaved relatives and disgruntled servicemen, about the justification for the Iraq War, which Bush and his cronies started under false pretences and continue to engage in for increasingly elusive and dubious goals.But Moore also can't seem to keep from playing the schoolyard bully. Much has been made of the found footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 that shows a stressed-out Bush inside a Florida kindergarten classroom the morning of Sept. 11, thinking for seven long minutes about how to react to an aide's whispered news that a second jet has struck the World Trade Center, and a terrorist war on America is underway.Moore also shows, repeatedly, candid views of Bush and his colleagues being made up for TV shows, as if there's something sinister about them doing exactly what politicians of every stripe - not to mention filmmakers, journalists and everyone else - do prior to making formal television appearances.He seems to want to have it both ways about everything. He paints Bush to be the dumbest U.S. president ever, but also as a diabolical schemer who stole an election and conned his countrymen into an immoral war. He claims Bush underreacted to terrorism before 9/11 (he quotes a dubious statistic that Bush was on vacation for 42 per cent of his first year in office), who then overreacted to terror after 9/11.In my opinion, the film was nothing more than propaganda. Probably his worst film ever.................	3.0	From satirist to propagandist	2004-06-27	78	30	48
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	Michael Moore reinvents the pamphlet which is a genre that has widely been practised for centuries, but generally in writ (books or the press), and eventually on the radio. Michael Moore develops the genre by using the cinema as the medium carrying the pamphlet. He is able to use all possibilities offered by this medium : images, sounds, and even some special effects, but particularly elliptical editing that builds some striking and even shocking clashes between shots. This is very dynamic and effective to impress the public and to tune them to the discourse. Then he applies this mature technique to his subject to prove that George W. Bush is problematic as the President of the US for three reasons : his personality which seems to be shifting from one extreme to another and his obsession about Saddam Hussein ; the motivations and objectives of his team that seems to be aiming at only one target which is to strengthen the control of society by the state and its various agencies, and finally the dubious and non-transparent relations with the Saudis and the Ben Ladens, including his personal or family business relations with these. The objective of the documentary is to cast some doubt in the minds of the viewers about the facts and mottos that are ceaselessly repeated if not hammered in all media by all the members of this team of politicians. Finally the pamphlet insists on the very particular relations between the members of this team, first of all the President and the Vice President, with some private corporations that are making a tremendous amount of profit out of the Irak war. This is systematically contrasted with the very emotional interviews of some GIs and some parents of victims, both Iraki and American. All that makes a very strong pamphlet that will outlive the events it has been made for, the US presidential election in 2004, because of the great use of the cinema technology and techniques. A must if you want to build for yourself a personal opinion provided you cross this pamphlet with other sources of information.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	5.0	The pamphlet revisited	2004-10-20	27	19	8

Moore makes his case for the Saudi connection: the unsavory ties with the bin Laden family, the charming Prince Banda who seems to have Bush's inner ear, and the seeming cover up of the Royal Family's role in all this.  He also goes after the Congressmen, in particular the Democrats, who voted for the war resolution, against what appeared to be their own better judgement.This movie will strike a chord with all those who have questioned the motivation of the Bush White House, and no doubt infuriate those who stand resolutely behind their Commander-in-Chief.

The points Moore uses to tie Bush to the Bin Ladens are shoddily presented, and hints that Bush may have welcomed the 9/11 attack further cloud the issue.  Instead of picking a target and homing in, Moore seems content to attack Bush from every conceivable flank, leaving too wide a field and too little substance for things to sink in.  Further, too little of Moore's material is insightful or shocking.  The footage of Bush sitting in a classroom while the first significant attack on American soil since 1812 occured is compelling, but too much of the documentary is ""been there/done that.""A documentary like this may reflect our country's freedoms and partisanship, but it doesn't reflect a well-constructed film or something worth spending money on- look elsewhere.  4/10"	2.0	Political affiliations aside, this is an unimpressive film.	2005-05-12	23	10	13

I went into this movie with negative opinions about the Bush administration and assumed that I would find a kindred spirit with this film. However, aside from being an endurance test for the rational thinker, this film is biased and stilted to the extreme that it verges on yellow journalism and scaremongering. One gross example is from a news archive when Bush was informed of the second plane hitting the Twin Towers. The film clip has a voice-over with Mr. Moore's wild speculation as to what President Bush was thinking at that moment.This is neither journalism nor a documentary.

Yes, the connections between favoured businesses, businessmen and world leaders is daunting and frightening, but presented in a format that is prejudiced and only presents details that support Mr. Moore's opinion.

Do yourself a favor and go see Fahrenheit 9/11 soon, you owe it to yourself to see all points of view when it comes to this election.	5.0	The Best You Can Do Is Listen.....	2004-10-06	41	35	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3TONTCO15FEQF	Jason Echs	"I'm not going to discuss my views for or against President Bush, I don't have the same resources available to me that Michael Moore does to justify creating a movie about my opinion. That's what this movie appears to be at face value. Michael Moore hates Bush and wants the world to know Bush from his eyes. After leaving the theatre from watching this movie, the strongest feeling I had was ""Wow, Michael Moore hates GWB with a passion."" However, this movie is much more than just Anti-Bush sentiment, although the people I discuss this movie with over the work lunchroom perhaps don't see it.Before you simply accept any of his ""facts"" from this film, I'd encourage you to research his controversial findings on your own, to understand the context and perhaps situations behind a particular decision. We are easily duped and manipulated with so-called facts told to us by third-parties. I'm not an American, but this movie motivated ME to examine MY own beliefs about the government I put into power.First of all, I have a conflict with rating this movie. I would like to rate it a 5/5 because of the wide range of facts that Michael Moore presents. These mean even more to me because I spent several hours after the movie, researching what I had just heard. Can GWB really be that bad?! This movie is great to provoke discussion about the government. Throughout the movie he interviews people who blindly follow the government because they ""have faith in their country"" and yet he shows how it's important to be actively involved with the political process, chosing those who will be beneficial to our future. We live in a democracy, and Michael Moore is the ideal poster child for the vision of democracy. For his enthusiasm and desire to chase freedom, I salute him. This is my 5/5 rating.However...At the same time, I felt like rating this movie a 1/5. Michael Moore's contempt of the Bush government is so thick and intentional throughout this entire movie I truly didn't think he was capable of making a documentary from an objective standpoint. Every sentence he speaks sounds like he has vehement hatred towards GWB. He doesn't even attempt to cover his obvious intention to discredit Bush. His voice is very often cynical and sarcastic when talking about Bush, frequently stating meaningless (although true) or partial facts to get an emotion out of the viewers. I have no doubt his facts are correct, however, on several instances (alas, I wish I could remember exact quotes to write) I found he was toying with viewer emotions to convince them his view is correct. I encourage everyone, that before they have faith in this movie, that they look at the true facts before jumping blindly onto the Michael Moore bandwagon. This is my reasoning for a 1/5 rating.So in conclusion, this film is very thought provoking about politics and government, however I feel this was a very one-sided portrayal of the American Government. I'm going to settle this with a 3/5. I think this is an important movie to watch, but I'd highly recommend anything you see be taken with a grain of salt. Make your own decision about your political views, but please, don't make them exclusively from this movie."	3.0	This movie certainly provokes thought...	2004-08-20	8	4	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2RZUFRYRHTRS8	jasoneducator	"------Note: Upon rereading this review, I feel that my political views have changed somewhat. Given the fact that Moore helped motivate the Christian right to vote against his positions, I argue that Moore *helped* Bush get elected. Generation Xers and many minorities still stayed home and did not come out to vote. Also, I regret my comments of ""I hate Bush"". Certainly, at the time, I hated Bush. But I also know that complete anonymity on the internet is not completely possible, and I hope to have the opportunity to work in DC to take full advantage of No Child Left Behind for the benefit of all political groups. At present, I am disgusted by the Democrats, reticient about the Republicans, and ideally an Independent. I certainly stand by my earlier statements because they reveal my mood at the time. But you can see from recent gospel reviews I've evolved a lot over the past few months, and I hope that all will look at my reviews as a personal portion of the evolution of a growing black intellectual.SD 11.22.04--------I'm interested in this movie as both an art and a phenomenon at this point. Does it succeed in what it's trying to accomplish? Who's watching it? Will it affect the election? Right now if you're reading this review you're probably wondering, ""Should I see it, and what should I expect?""First, it's definitely worth seeing. It's laugh out loud funny at points. Some of the skits lead to some ""Candid Camera"" style laughs. Michael Moore standing between the Watergate, the Saudi Embassy, and the Kennedy Center gets questioned by a Secret Service agent, funny stuff. Michael Moore with a corporal trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. Funny reactions! The unplanned, improvised human reactions to the information he produces make you laugh and move you at the same time.Secondly, Moore does an effective job of dramatizing some of the real costs of war. The documentary footage of some of the casualties of war is tough to watch at times, especially scenes from a VA hospital with amputees. The footage of the effects of the war on the civilians of Iraq is equally disturbing. Interviews with soldiers add a real poignancy to the emotional complexities of those who have a job to serve in a war that they either do not fully understand or that has led to their disillusonment. These human stories where his subjects speak in their own voices are a valuable documentary function to appreciate the spiritual, psychological, and human toll of war.Where the movie can be attacked, however, is in his unceasing dislike for Bush and his efforts to establish conspiracy motives for much of our actions in Iraq and in the post 9/11 world. I believe his hatred of Bush, the GOP, and monied interests blind him on how to most effectively make his points. At times, Moore informs me. I learned a lot on the connections to the Saudi government with the Bushes and how political and business concerns impede an effective response to terror. But Bush is not really even a human being in this film. Sure, I hate Bush! Just about everybody left of center hates Bush! A documentary should aid to inform us about who Bush is as a character and a human being, what motivates him, and help us to understand him. A balanced portrayal of Bush would include how his Christian conversion influences his decisions as a crusader beyond a sheer paralyization to monied interests. A balanced portrait would also deal with the fact that funny money has become inherent and endemic to politicians from both sides of the political aisle as I've learned from my studies of Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Texas oil money that funded his rise to power as a champion of liberal causes. Moore spends a lot of time emphasizing how the administration manipulates Americans by an unrelenting message of fear. A conspicuous silence on this count was the total lack of mention of the very real anthrax scare and how this tangible reality of a biological attack put some flesh on the fear that drove us to war.I felt Moore got us to laugh at Bush by making him a straw man, but if Moore's goal is to elect a democratic candidate, he could have been much more convincing with either a more coherent story arc or a more human Bush.I am torn on the focus on one mother's pain at the loss of her son. Made me feel her pain; made me worry that he was exploiting her a little bit as well. But I leave that for you to determine as you watch the film.Moore's obvious liberal bias weakened the film a little bit for me, but I was entertained, periodically informed, and definitely provoked to confront some of my attitudes.Let's hope that this film sparks necessary dialogue on its strengths and weaknesses, rather than becoming a mere antiBush political rally [there will be plenty of those whether this film existed or not!]. For me, it was entertaining counterpropaganda and I encourage you to view it with an open, engaged mind.4.5 stars.--SD [late July 04]"	4.0	Worth the admission price, maximize impact?	2004-07-04	16	10	6

The fact of the matter is, we removed an evil man from power. We removed a man who has killed thousands of people, many of them women and children. Many of them his own citizens. We removed a sick, twisted individual who paid the families of suicide bombers according to the effectivness of the bombers' attacks. How many lives were saved because of the actions of President Bush and our armed forces? Impossible to tell. Regardless of anything else that's been said, it was our moral obligation to intervene. This was no different than the genocidal slaughters in Germany, in Rwanda, and in Bosnia-Herzegovia. Someone has to stop the madmen of the world. If not us, who?

I have to tell you I have never seen a film so manipulating and full of lies like Moore's film. I felt insulted and mislead. I then decided to check all the facts myself and after a deep and long finding of facts it was clear.

Whatever the reason is that you have against Moore. You can't deny to see this movie. Most of the people that hate this movie, haven't even see it. This movie has a powerful message about our adminstration and their connections. A lot of facts in the movie are in the 9/11 commission. Saudi Arabia is been considered a big funding for the al-quada under US department investigation. And in this movie you'll see the connections the Bush family has with the saudi's. I saw ""crap c's"" review about how Moore hates America. I would think that is true, but if it was wouldn't he leave this country like Johnny Depp. If anything, I think he likes this country and just questions about what needs to change, and I'll tell you what needs to be change our president.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1ZGB8VP73DWJW	Jay	"Everybody it seems has an opinion about Michael Moore and be it positive or negative most are not shy about expressing it.  So considering the already entrenched opinions held about the man, any discussion about his work will more than likely follow a predictable path and degenerate into a mud slinging exercise by the usual left and right wing suspects where any reasoned debate gets jumped on and beaten up very quickly.Fortunately ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not a film that explores the finer points of its subject matter and can be dissected by subtle intellectual debate.  This is a wrecking ball aimed directly at President George W. Bush, his Government, personality, policies, advisers, business associates and even his family.  Moore doesn't hold back and at times his attacks on the president seem more like a personal insult than a critique of his presidency.  But then again can G.W. Bush tell the difference?  Recently, the Washington correspondent for RTE News Carole Coleman was granted a private interview with the president at the Whitehouse.  During the course of the interview Ms Coleman grilled President Bush rigorously yet respectfully about his policies, yet the president seemed to take great offence at this and repeatedly tried to brow beat the interviewer.  When one is dealing with a man who seems incapable of distinguishing between professional disagreement and personal attack, Michael Moore's tactics are not only justified, they are obligatory.Fahrenheit 9/11 grabs the audience from the beginning and moves from the tragic, to the comic, to the disturbing, to the downright frightening in a way that the viewer can't help but be pulled along with.  As with ""Bowling for Columbine"" Moore doesn't run shy from presenting the viewer with the raw pain of people directly affected by the events he rages at, the journey of Mrs Lila Lipscombe from unquestioning patriotism through doubt to anger is both tragic from a personal point of view and masterful cinema.  I truly ached for this woman's and shared her sense of betrayal, the worst part of it being as the pro war woman outside the Whitehouse said ""You're not the only one"".  Yet for all this, Moore's real anger in this film is reserved for the class divisions in American society and how this is exploited by the ruling elite to further their own agendas.  One young man's comment ""I was looking at the pictures on TV of Baghdad after the bombing and I thought we have places that look like that around here and we haven't had a war"" sums up the decline of society in the US caused by poverty and official indifference that this film rails against.This is not a documentary cast from the traditional mould where the narrator attempts to see things from all perspectives and present the user with a balanced view; this is a film that is very definitely pushing a point of view and as such criticism that the film lacks objectivity misses the point completely.  However the power of the message can't be denied.  Moore is a persuasive character and when one sees the look on Bush's face when he is told that the Nation is under attack on the morning of September 11th, that look of indecision, fear, and almost blind panic is enough to make you wonder just how much intelligence and moral fibre does this man actually have behind the public image and just what what kind of man is leading us.  Thomas Payne once said ""The patriot must always be willing to defend his country against its government"" and by this yardstick Michael Moore may have done our society a great service in making this film.  Whether you agree with the man and his politics or not, you really should see this film. The fact that there are people who are willing to make and distribute a film like this is proof that the freedoms that are our birthright, they are still alive and waiting to be reclaimed.  I can't recommend this film too highly."	5.0	A true act of patriotism	2004-07-10	30	25	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2U4HYFW41RP4S	Jay Kelly	I consider myself a conservative independent, even though I'm registered as a Republican.  I went into this movie w/ a fairly open mind.It seemed to break out into two major sections.1.  The pre-Iraq invasion half was strongly anti-Bush, not that that is a cardinal sin.  But it definitely had a strong 'agenda' feel to it.  In this section of the movie, I found myself thinking through lots of counter-arguments and objections to what was presented.  So while there was much evidence presented, it appeared to have too many holes or alternate explanations to be convincing to me.  Intriguing, yes.  Worth considering, yes.  Convincing?  Not quite.  It at least didn't convince me of Bush being any worse than any other Presidential candidate out there.2.  The second half was more anti-war than it was anti-Bush.  This was far more compelling to me.  I found myself in tears several times over the horror and tragedy of war.  One of the most compelling statements in the movie was something to the effect of, 'Even if you are not a pacifist, war should be a last, last, last option.  And this was not our last option.'  That's a heavy paraphrase, but that was the general idea.  This didn't have NEARLY the political feel the first half had, and had much less of a propaganda feel to it.Bottom Line: Buy the DVD or at least go see the movie.  It's worth thinking through, considering, and talking about regardless of your political affiliation.	4.0	A Republican Weighs In . . .	2004-08-22	30	26	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3SJMW269N75IL	Jaylyn	"Either you love him or you hate him, but there's one thing you can't forget while viewing this movie and that is this is not a fair movie, meaning there is no side defending the Bush administration and their actions and Micheal Moore has admitted this, not in these exact words, but this is a man who chased Charleton Heston out from a room in his own home so you can't be upset while watching Fahrenheit 9/11's Moore antics. This is a fearless man.The reason this review misses two stars is there was something strange with the delivery of this movie. It deffinately clouds  the mind with emotion. For instance the begining of this movie begins with the haunting audio of the chaos and confusion on the streets of NY just moments after the attack so immediately my heart sank straight to my stomach. Then we see President Bush's reaction when the news was delivered to him during a visit to an elementry school in the middle of a book, which he sits, visibly confused, and decides to continue the story he began with the children and yes, perhaps he could have, or should have, explained to the children that the president is a busy man and apologize for his must needed departure. Then again this is a man who can barely speak infront of adults, would he have sent these children into a panic had he actually opened his mouth? Perhaps he made the best possible decision that he, himself, could handle. Michael Moore made too big a deal out of this in my opinion, and I am NOT defending the President, and I would be the last to.Visually, this movie will break your heart, frustrate and anger you. From the Iraqi man holding the deceased baby, the greif and sorrow of the woman whose son was killed in battle, the story of the Iraqi American being detained in the prisons. Yes, these are unjust,horrible and shameful crimes. I was and am appauled. I walked around for days frustrated all over again as I was after 9/11, after the start of the war and after his re-election (which I was no part of). Then I watched a few other documentaries reguarding the Bush administration, one that stands out is Mark Crispin Miller's A Patriot Act and something dawned on me. From a Patriot act I walked away pretty informed, from Fahrenheit 9/11 I walked away really mad and upset. Did Michael Moore just pull on me what he claims to despise and blame the media for, and that is cramming my eyes with the blood soaked footage of the war and 9/11 to make an opinion for me as the news delivers unfavorable images of minorities and people of poverty to make panic and opinions for those who are ignorant to circumstance? For profit? I'm not saying he's wrong in what he's ""saying"", he is very right. However,I dislike a hypocrite, and apparantly no one knows an American like Michael Moore. So let's be careful.I do give him great credit for his fairness to the military. At first you'll be horrified to see some Marines blood thirsty, ready and excited to fight and kill and at the music they listen to while in battle. Then there are those Marines who are deffinately doing their duty, but either frightened, repulsed, confused and one in particular taking a stand in reguards to this war. He balanced this completely fair.Over all I will say this is deffinately one worth watching. But if you're like me, a house wife with raising kids as your main thought pattern, then you may want to watch this movie twice because this is the type of movie where the visuals cloud your mind with emotion and strongly overshadow the actual information."	3.0	No Middle for Mr. Moore	2005-01-17	10	7	3

His reputation is fairly well known, especially after TV Nation.  But the nonsense in there about this film receiving an R rating?  Bowling for Columbine was R, but Moore wasn't outraged at that (probably because he got an Oscar for that one).  If he really wants his film to hit a younger audience, then he should offer an alternate version of this film.  They made a school PG version of SuperSize Me, so why not this film?  Michael needs to drop some of his old tactics and let the films speak for themselves, because this one certainly does.	4.0	The film itself is very good	2005-06-18	8	1	7

First off I am not a liberal, I did not vote for Gore and I do not plan on voting for Kerry, neither did I vote for Bush (I voted Libertarian but that is not the point).  I am a former film student and someone who reads about and cares about the making of film, I like Moors other films, the big one, Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine (which was better then F 911 in my opinion).  Let us go back, way back to one of the first documentary films, Nanook of the north (spelling)? It was, we were told, a story of an Eskimo family and there day to day survival, it was also, by the directors own admission, a big lie.  The family were not a family at all, they were cast, they took the prettiest among the tribe and cast them as a family, the ""hunt"" was staged, this was a work of fiction, the only difference was the lack of professional actors.  News flash folks, all documenters are like this. The filmakers have a vision, shoot a lot of footage in carefully selected times and places, and then assemble it to make there point, people have gotten the false notion that documenters are supposed to be neutral and unbiased, haw they arrived at such a foolish conclusion is beyond me.  If Rush Limbaugh had made a documentary I can assure you Bush would have looked entirely different.  It is not the story it is the story teller. Everyone knows, or should know, Moores take on George W Bush, this film should be no surprise.  As for the reviews talking about ""Lies"", I did not see this.  Bin Laudins family disowned him long before 911, of course his relatives were flown out of harms way, they are our allies and we need them like we need the rest of the muslim world, who were as shocked and outraged as anyone, many Muslims died on 911. Does that mean he's telling a lie?  No.  He is just telling us carefully selected bits of truth.  Only one member of congress has a son or daughter in Iraq, welcome to planet earth Mr. Moore, how many members of congress had sons on Vietnam?  About the same.  Business as usual.  It is the responsiblity of all of us as film fans to learn as much as we can and demand better films.

This film is not an account of what happened on that terrible day in history, but the shock waves it made, which today still can be felt. If you have read either Dude Wheres My Country or Stupid White Men you would have felt like you have seen this film, as it is just both books made into a film really. The film starts with the 2000 elections in the apparent 'Most Democratic Country in the World' where Bush lost the vote but still became president. The moment where citizens of Florida ask for it to be put right but cannot get a single signature from the Senate, just filled me with anger, how can the people of america allowed Bush to wim, it disgusts me still.The rest of the film is really what a job Bush has done, making America the least respected country in the world. I should know, I am british and live in the UK, and me my friends, my parents, my grandparents and on all TV programs mock President Warlord Bush. If Bush is dum, how dum is america to elect him?The facts presented in the film are true, however they are biast so we only hear Moore's side of the argument. The film made me laugh at moments like Bush's one liners and the equipment to help yourself in a terroist attacks. Moments of the film are alos heart breaking, like the mothor of a child who was killed in Iraq over a qar over oil.Overall I thought this was an excellent film, better then  Bowling for Columbine.

It's a propoganda film, full of slant.Moore IS funny, in a way, and he did a good job with piecing together lots of footage in such a way that made The President look bad. I have to admit, I DID chuckle at a few things. But, if I were given hours of footage of Senator Kerry, in day-to-day life, I'd have had no problem at all putting him in a bad light.I don't know what the big deal was regarding the length of time Bush spent at the school upon news of the attacks on 9/11. What was he supposed to do? Freak-out all the little kiddies and announce to them that America was under attack by terrorists and, as a result, he had to leave immediately?

DeFeo	"In this review I will attempt to see past my own political allegiances and concentrate merely on the film, as that is what reviews should focus on.First and Foremost:  I find this film to be abysmally bad.  I am not a fan of Michael Moore, but can at least appreciate some of his earlier work.  However, this film implodes on itself.The film is structured in almost a 2 part format.  Part ""A"" the remarkable buffoonery of George W. Bush.  However, the rest of the film seems to paint W. as a manipulative evil genius.  For me, this is a painful contradiction.  How could someone so inept and visionless as one part suggests, still be clever and insightful enough to ""trick"" the entire country and propagate a regime?Another qualm that I had is Moore's now trademark style of editing.  I find it to be ""MTV paced"" with quick cuts and loud music, and other auditory stimulation.  A good documentary should let interviews play out, allowing the audience to come to a conclusion based on their own interpretation and intelligence.  With all these quick cuts and eye candy, I feel as if the film tries to force a point (that may or may not have any merit), simply to cut away to another snippet of information (which may or may not be taken out of context)The film is also sloppy...which there is a certain forgiveness to be had in all documentaries (and I would be the first to argue function over form).  But for this film, the content left me feeling empty, and the technical aspects of the film are lacking.  So for me, the film is like a chocolate Easter bunny.

But don't take my word for it, and please don't listen to those who worship Bush like many German's worshipped Hitler before 1942.  Find the truth for yourself.  Most of the facts here are shown as actual video clips or newspaper articles, very little is actually just someone telling you something.  This movie really does something else most seemed to miss: it shows how the elite in our society need to keep some in this country in poverty so the poor can be sent to fight wars that make the rich richer.  If you don't bekeive this, you better start reading your history book.  Most kids fighting are poor kids who had no better options.  This movie cast great respect and sympathy toward the poor who are econimocally forced into the military to fight our wars.  I know many join because they are patriots, but many see this as their only choice.  My family has lost 3 to war.  I feel for those fighting or waiting for their return.  I beleive this type of corruption is within both parties and we need to take our country back from the rich elite businesses that create most of our policy.  Our founding father's would be sick to see what has happened to our great land.  Why else would there even be debate about giving a driver license to an illegal immigrant?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 911"" was one of the first documentary movies to take on the lies and evasions of the Bush Administration. It created enormous controversy earlier in 2004 when it was released. The DVD version, coming out just a month before the presidential election, is likely to exhume the same emotions that surfaced this spring.""Fahrenheit"" is not a perfect movie. Moore's approach is to illustrate his points via stunts, not all of which work. Cornering US reps to get their kids to join to the military makes the point that reps are not terribly willing to put their own families on the line in the war on terror. But then, few Americans have had to sacrifice (yet) in this war. Though it has its moments of humor and absurdity, ""Fahrenheit"" is more frightening than funny; the stakes are too high. While it may be humorous to hear Congressman Charles Dingell ""lecture"" Moore about how our reps don't read the bills that come before them, it's pretty frightening that this is the case. The Patriot Act -- rushed through Congress with barely a reading and barely a debate -- being a case in point.That being said, Moore does provide us with well-executed (and frightening) snapshots of early-21st century America and its top leadership. Watching President Bush sit for 7 long minutes while reading ""My Pet Goat"" to a bunch of gradeschoolers said a lot about his purported leadership abilities. Witnessing the enormous protests in Washington at Bush's Inauguration made me wonder why I had not seen these images before. Seeing a mother, who had lost a son in Iraq, assailed in Washington, DC by a true Bush believer spoke volumes about the desire of many citizens to maintain their rosy view of Bush ""values"" and policies in the face of contrary evidence. Hearing American soldiers screaming in agony after an attack brought home the human cost of the war, which has been suppressed by our leaders. Listening to an Oregon State Trooper describing the budget cuts that have left a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.There's no doubt that Moore is a polemicist -- he is trying to influence the thinking of Americans who would rather not believe the duplicity and danger of the current administation. But being a polemicist doesn't make you a liar, as many of Moore's detractors would have us believe. ""Fahrenheit 911"" is an important addition to the currently muffled voice of protest and truth. Moore has done an exemplary job of bringing his point of view into public consciousness."	4.0	Awake, ye sleepers	2004-10-04	49	39	10

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T	Jed Shlackman	Michael Moore has built his reputation on exposing corporate misdeeds and government corruption.  This movie is an obvious attack on Bush, but one that fails to provide much investigation into what really happened to facilitate the events of 9-11 and America's descent into fascism.  Also, Moore represents a voice for the communist-socialist critique of fascism (fascism being nationalist-socialist) - a tyranny that professes to be benevolent challenging one that appears elitist and arrogant.  Moore starts off with the 2000 election, displaying sympathy for the Al Gore cause (which is not a way to start a documentary if you wish to appear objective).  As he moves into 9-11 and its aftermath, he has a lot of entertaining and heart-wrenching material to lay on the viewer.  Moore is clever at putting together music, video, and voice overs to create a compelling story in this way.  However, he fails to present a lot of evidence about government complicity and elite agendas which can be found in independently distributed documentaries that have been produced about 9-11.  Moore's film only scratches the surface of a dark, disturbing story, and allows the viewers to think they have now been informed about Bush & 911 and that the situation can be improved by going out to vote for Bush's Democratic election opponent, a member of the same secret society and elite network that pull Bush's strings.  This film is vintage Michael Moore, and hopefully it will stir some people to start doing independent research into history and current events, a type of research that goes beyond entertainment and clever juxtapositions of sound and video footage.	4.0	Clever, But Flawed Political Documentary	2004-10-14	45	16	29

Munson	"I was a little apprehensive about viewing this film, but after watching it, I must say that my eyes have been opened a little wider than before.  As a staunch Bush supporter, I was afraid that Moore was going to slam him and his policies unmercifully, but instead, he provides stimulating ""food for thought"".  For example, I found his analysis of Andrew Card's informing Bush of the attack on the World Trade Center very disturbing.  I didn't know that Bush sat in the classroom for almost ten minutes before doing anything.  That is simply unacceptable, even to a die-hard Republican such as myself.I found Moore's analysis of the Iraq war to be very interesting.  The interviews with the soldiers and family members were especially emotional, especially in the case of Lila Lipscomb, who tearfully reads a letter she received from her son just days before he was killed in a Blackhawk helicpoter crash.  Other scenes, such as the soldier describing the type of music that they liked to listen to when going on attack (""Let the mother#@%^& burn!"") was very disturbing to me.  Finally, being a parent myself, the scenes of the dead Iraqi children were especially difficult to watch.There are many items pointed out in the film that I had no idea about, especially the Bush family link to Saudi oil, and how members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States after the terrorist attacks, even though all flights in the United States had been banned.Moore also looks at the disputed 2000 presidential election and claims that George W. Bush was elected by his father's""friends on the Supreme Court"".  The errors of the networks in projecting a winner in Florida on election night is also looked at.I have been and always will be a Bush supporter, but I must admit that this film has opened my eyes more about him and revealed things that I didn't know before.  I thought that this was a very thought-provoking film and it did a very good job at explaining Bush's past and some of the events in his presidency that may have been handled incorrectly.  Moore also manages to add a little humor, such as when Bush and his cabinet members are being made up for television, or when John Ashcroft tries his hand at a singing career.  I highly recommend this film.

This is a question that everyone should ask themselves before watching (or even after watching) Fahrenheit 9/11.  Realistically Michael Moore is a blowhard; an extremely left wing French culture loving, untrusting soul who is obviously has a beef with any Conservative politician, George Bush in particular.  In essence, I feel sorry for him that he is not able to take a realistic look at the world around us and see why some things are happening.Obviously, I am not a Michael Moore fan, however I am not a Bush fan either.  I accept that he is our President and it is my right to say that I think he has made many mistakes in his first term.  History will tell us if his next term is redeeming or damning.  However, Moore is a man who is lucky enough to make movies where he can shuffle is opinion to everyone with a mix of fact and a large dose of innuendo.  Listen to this movie CAREFULLY!  Many statements Moore delivers are simply questions, questions with no answers but his innuendo pushes the element of conspiracy and hidden agendas.I don't believe the first scene with the woman who's son was killed in Iraq is true.  I think that's way too expedient for him to find a staunch Republican who is so in favor of Bush to suddenly do a 180 and question the administration...just within the time he was making his movie.  Hmm, that's awfully convenient.There are many questions that Moore states in his movie that I WOULD like answers to; why were the Bin Laden's flown out of the country under secretive circumstances.  Why did Haliburton get a multi billion dollar no-bid contract?  Why, to this day, have we concentrated so much effort on Iraq when Bin Laden is in Afghanistan?  Why didn't the members of Congress read the Patriot act before voting on it?The movie is fairly entertaining, but a little too long.  I won't debate the true facts of the movie, of which there aren't many.  I was aware of almost all the truths displayed, but when Moore delivers them with a self righteous, pompous, all-knowing attitude, I don't feel compelled to listen.  I am objective and I ask questions, I don't like jumping to conclusions.  Moore has jumped to many of these and this why I not only do not like him, I don't consider him to be a professional.	3.0	Watch Carefully, Listen Closely, Tread lightly...	2004-12-30	5	2	3

Also despite what some people have said, this is not purely an attack on Bush, nor is it anywhere close to an endorsement of the Democrats.  The documentary pieces together information, both from our nightly news sources and from info and interviews that were never broadcast for the public before, and puts together an argument for why we are probably actually at war.  Luckily there is a bit of humor (at the expense of Bush, Ashcroft and the like) to break up what is otherwise a truly unsettling, rage-inducing, heart-breaking depiction of the contrast between what we thought we knew and what may be closer to the truth. Please watch the movie.  Protect and work to restore our freedoms and those of others around the world.	5.0	you must see this	2004-06-25	10	5	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A28765Y2YAI437	Jennifer A. Kern	Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentary not about 9/11/2001, but about what Moore sees as a large scale corruption and incompetence on the part of the current federal administration. Moore unapologetically criticizes and questions the dubious outcome of the 2000 Presidential election, Bush and Cheney's ties to Saudi Oil Money, The real purpose of the War in Iraq and the large scale War Machine that stands to profit from 9/11 and the Iraq War.Michael Moore asks the questions that are on most people's minds (or would be if we scoured the news as painstakingly as Moore has) and shows us answers we may or may not like. Why did the U.S government allow the bin laden family to leave the country after 9/11 when all other planes were grounded? Did Bush ignore warnings that Al Qaeda was planning an attack? How much does Saudi money effect the United States economy?Moore pulls no punches, but if you think the democratic party comes out looking any rosier than the republicans, you need to think again. Moore is critical of our entire government as a whole and wants to know (as we all do) where the government went wrong and what they will do to protect us.Moore's documentary may shock you, and it will definitely open your eyes and get you thinking about the facts he presents, whether you agree with him or not.Love Moore or Hate him, his factchecking is nearly flawless (his website gives every citation you need) and his movie is uproariously funny. Moore simultaneously scares me about our nation's future enough to incite me to action (this IS an election year), and makes me laugh harder than I have at any comedy.The movie shows us everyone from soldiers in Iraq on Christmas Eve, to Taliban leaders, of course to our president himself.The special features have added scenes and extended interviews, including Condolezza Rice's testimony before the 9/11 comission. Moore doens't twist your arm, but he does present a convincing argument for why he feels the way he does. This movie is a must see for anyone interested in politics, anyone who cares about this nation, or anyone who wants to give an EDUCATED opinion about the movie, or just wants to know what the fuss is all about.	5.0	"Moore's most ""incendiary"" documentary to date."	2004-10-13	34	27	7

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2TBGSDGW251SP	Jeremy D. Penn	"Why are there so many bitter, negative reviews of this movie?  Simply because this is a powerful movie that will influence the way that you think about important contemporary issues.This movie presents a sobering, at times shocking, look at our President's actions since 9-11.The President's links to Saudi Arabia, and to Saudi money have been documented in other places, but it is compelling to see it on the screen.  Perhaps most interesting is the time President Bush sat reading ""My Pet Goat"" while the country was under attack.The movie also presents some footage from our troops in Iraq.  It is good to see footage of troops that is a more honest look at their lives in Iraq then you normally see on perky, everybody's-happy news programs.The movie closes by following the grief of a mother who has lost her son in Iraq.  If that doesn't break your heart, nothing will.The extras on the DVD make purchasing this item well worth it, even if you saw the movie in the theater.Many people argue that this movie is bad because ""it is a documentary and it is supposed to provide an objective view of the facts"".  I am a graduate student studying research methods, and it is clear to me that no research, or documentary for that matter, can be completely objective.  No matter how hard you try, everything you write or create is influenced by you, and therefore, not completely objective.  So, think of this movie as an editorial - it uses facts to prove a point.  The point Mr. Moore would like to make is that the Bush administration has made many mistakes and inexusable judgments since 9/11, and should be voted out of office this November."	5.0	Great movie for discussion, thought, and action	2004-10-05	19	14	5

Much of the footage was assembled rather than shot by him, and speaks for itself.The detractors who regard his documenting of grief as exploitation must prefer emotions served up sanitized or hidden altogether. The film so convincingly records the administration's manipulative exploitation of people's feelings and fears, that I marvel how people who see it can still delude themselves into believing that it's OK for their government to wage genocidal war abroad and war against their own liberties at home.I suspect that many of them might have watched the film, but not seen it. Michael Moore holds himself to a standard of truth that is light years ahead of that of our government.

He has a good eye for drama, and that must be commended. However, one must remember that this film is drama, not a documentary. It is filled with misrepresentations, and outright lies. Moore frequently takes words out of context to promote his cause: deframing the President.If you are really compelled to find out the actual facts, please check out David Kopel's, a lifelong Democrat, website which chronicles the inaccuracies in Moore's film. [...] as this will present to you the deceits in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". As a good American, I feel it is necessary to view both sides of any tale.

Bush understands the irony:  In large part, the rest of the world's antipathy towards us for our unilateral attack of Iraq is what catapulted Fahrenheit 9/11 to this year's Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, thereby adding to the momentum it got upon its US release.Does Moore show some prejudice in presenting the facts and circumstances surrounding our build up to war against Iraq?  Absolutely.  But you know Moore's bias going in.  Does his movie still deserve the label ""documentary""?  Probably.  Despite the ""artistic license"" Moore takes in presenting the facts, the facts are what they are.  Even if you watch this movie with a grain of salt and only believe, say, 50% of what you see, it's still terrible indictment of Bush and his administration.I remember shortly after 9/11 hearing the story - it was just a vague rumor then - of Bush having sat for a period of time in the classroom where he was reading with an elementary school class even after being told by Andrew Card that ""America is under attack.""  Cynical as I am, I wasn't about to believe that story without proof.  Michael Moore, as sportscaster Warner Wolf would say, ""goes to the video tape,"" and there's Bush, sitting in the classroom for fully seven minutes after being told the country was being attacked.It's interesting to me that although Moore presents documented facts in his movies, the conservative response is always to simply shoot the messenger (i.e. Moore hates America, Moore's a fat, stupid white man).  The lack of any reasoned debate about Moore's work is very telling about the inability of his critics to refute the facts in the movie.Most touching is the story of the woman who lost her son in Iraq.  She'd been a believer, until she lost her son and found out that we'd gone to Iraq under false pretenses in the first place.  I can't imagine her pain.Bush ultimately explained the inexplicable seven minute delay in leaving the classroom by saying that he was ""collecting his thoughts.""  As talk show host Bill Maher has pointed out, that was a helluva time for him to start a new hobby.See the movie with an open mind and decide for yourself if this man and his cabal should be running the country for the next four years."	5.0	An Immensely Important (Historic?)

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3IH2L4B5VOA59	"J. Houzet ""wozamoya"""	"Let's address some of the deceit and malice in this movie: First off, Moore repeats the tired liberal canard that Bush stole the 2000 election. Come on now, we all know Gore and the Dems tried to flout electoral law to continue the recounts long after this was permitted. And even an independent recount by the AP, Tribune Media and other press months after the election proved that Bush still got more votes in Florida than Gore did. Right-thinking people know unscrupulous Dems hoped to steal that election through so-called ""recounts"" as well as disenfranchising military voters, which were more likely to be Republican.Moore tries to make President Bush and his staff look bad or just silly over and over in this crockumentary. It would be very easy to follow Kerry and Edwards on their campaign trail and get similar footage, should some conservatives be so inclined to gather unused footage from the media and do some sneak filming of their own. But that would just be childish. Moore makes a big deal out of Bush's so-called lack of immediate response to the WTC attacks while in that classroom, ridiculing him for his silence and continuing to read to the elementary school kids. What would Moore have liked Bush to do - declare war on someone immediately, perhaps bomb the Saudis? Bush is merely displaying the human reaction: the shock and numbness many of us felt watching those planes hit the towers. I admire President Bush - he displays the calm of a man in trying times, mourning the loss of lives and speaking with peace and gentleness to innocent little children.Moore ridicules Bush for issuing a warning to terrorists in between a game of golf. What Moore does not reveal is how this was not a sign of laxity prior to 9/11 or a casual response to 9/11, but rather a response when Bush was asked about the continued terror attacks against Israel! Tricky editing by Moore to get the reaction he desires.Moore faults the marine recruiters for sticking to lower-income areas. Hey, this is reality, folks. The army, navy, marines, etc, know where the most likely recruits come from. The armed forces provide many people with jobs, scholarships and opportunities to study they might not otherwise have. Moore would have something to talk about if this was CONSCRIPTION - if the marines were conscripting ONLY lower income people and minorities. But the US has PROFESSIONAL armed forces - this is a CAREER for the people who sign up. Some people seem to naively believe that soldiers will not have to see armed conflict, like the deserters who said they didn't know they would have to kill people. If you don't want to take the chance you might have to kill someone one day, DON'T sign up for the military! I am thankful for our soldiers who make this hard choice to be soldiers and who are proud to be soldiers. In any event, Moore misrepresents the armed forces as being made up of minorities in disproportionate numbers. This is simply not true. The demographic make-up of the armed forces represents real America; therefore most soldiers are actually white. Surprised?Moore tries to use images of wounded soldiers and Iraqi civilians to make people become anti-war. This is just fuel for the crowd that is already anti-war. Such images will always be hard to look at, but we know there is a war on and these are the casualties, it does not make this war less just or diminish our resolve that justice will prevail. Moore and other media weren't around to capture on film the horrors Saddam perpetrated on his people, and he didn't even bother to speak to Iraqis with stories to tell of how they suffered under Saddam and Moore didn't bother to use footage of the mass graves uncovered by US soldiers.At other times Moore uses footage of young troops that attempts to paint American soldiers as casual killers. He makes no attempt to display the courage in battle and compassion to the Iraqi people most of these soldiers have shown. Same with the images from Abu Ghraib prison. They were repeatedly shown and talked about by the media in an effort to portray ALL our soldiers as being heartless barbarians and as though this was official policy. And yet, scant attention was paid to the beheadings perpetrated by the Islamic militants. The difference between American outrage and outrage in the Islamic world is that the soldiers guilty of torture at Abu Ghraib will be punished, but there is hardly a peep about the MURDER of captives at the hands of the Islamic militants.There is more tricky editing Moore does for the best manipulation. Moore actually only met and filmed Lila Lipscomb AFTER her son was already killed. The ""transformation"" you saw take place in her political attitude was carefully edited to appear the loss of a son changed her view on the war. It actually took place months after she first heard the news of her son's death. I don't know Mrs. Lipscomb's mind, but I can fathom grieving mothers being devastated by the loss of their children to war. Many, many mothers lost their sons who were fighting Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, but they didn't suddenly suggest the war wasn't worth it. Likewise, Moore COULD have interviewed parents who have lost children in Iraq but still feel the cause is just. Moore does not do this because it does not help HIS cause.I'm glad Fox News and other sources revealed how Moore carefully edited his encounters with members of Congress, when he tried to get them to sign up their kids to serve in Iraq. When one congressman said he in fact had several family members serving in Iraq, Moore deftly left that part on the cutting room floor, as well as his jibe, to get the desired walk-away effect that he retained.(...)"	1.0	The most contemptible film ever made?	2004-07-13	101	33	68

The fact remains that the Bush Administration lied to its people for invading Iraq thus in its wake killing thousands of innocenct Iraqi civilions and for what cause???????Oil	4.0	Good Enough	2004-09-15	19	10	9

Moore is clearly not playing by the rules.  He does ask some very good questions, even though he goes overboard on several issues like the possible Bush/Saudi connection, the congressmen who don't put their kids in the military or Bush's military friend who later represented the Bin Ladens.He does ask questions that many of us are afraid to ask and to ask those questions, I think, makes a democracy healthier and stronger.  Michael is clearly worried about the health of our democracy and what vision this president has in sending our troops to Iraq, when there may not be a solid plan in place, or a plan not based on solid evidence.The movie didn't always make logical sense but the movie made me feel, and that is what GREAT movies do, they make you feel deeply.	4.0	Moore Takes Liberties But Asks Good Questions	2004-10-16	6	3	3
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2B0DPQK20LYYJ	J. Michael	"This movie (you can't call it a real documentary) is an entertaining, funny and sometimes moving piece of loony left propaganda. That its main target is richly deserving of our contempt and mockery does not change the fact that this film is intellectually incoherent, contradictory and too full of baseless assertions, fatuous ""reasoning"" and downright untruths. The sole fact that he completely ignored the dominant role of Israeli-loyalist neoconservatives in starting the war is reason enough to discount the whole movie. I'm as big an opponent of the president as there is, but let's get a few things straight: he did not steal the 2000 election by disenfranchising black voters in Florida. A bunch of idiots who weren't on the voting rolls because they hadn't voted in 10 years, were felons, went to the wrong voting district, or who were never registered to begin with got mad because they couldn't pollute the system with their illegal votes. The Bush family may be too close to the Saudis, but that didn't cause 9/11 and it wasn't Bush who allowed the bin-Laden family out of the country after 9/11- it was Bush's nemesis Richard Clarke, who only did so after the FBI said that they were not suspects. And if Bush were such a puppet of the Saudis, why did he invade Iraq against the vehement opposition of those same Saudis? And the way Moore portrays it, it's only the poor defenseless black kids who are being victimized by slick and dishonest military recruiters- it's actually rural white kids who are disproportionately represented on the front lines of this war. The military cannibals will take their prey wherever there is poverty and lack of opportunites. No, the real power of this film is in its images, not Moore's discombobulated attempt to fit them all together into a coherent whole. The look on our idiot's president's face as he sat dumbfounded in that Florida classroom for 7 minutes on 9/11 is worth the price of admission(even though I actually bought a ticket to Spider Man and snuck into Fahrenheit to avoid supporting Moore). The scenes of Iraqi atrocities, Bush's arrogance and juvenility, and the unctuous Congressman's reaction when Moore suggested having his son enlist are also great ones. This propaganda movie isn't going to contribute to general enlightenment. It will provoke Bushies, and serve as red meat for lefties, but it will certainly influence the moron majority for whom this film will serve as their only source of information on the state of our country. Even though the immediate outcome of that will be the removal of a dangerous and stupid man from office, this further development of the movie medium as political propaganda does not bode well for this country."	4.0	"""Presidential Politics for Dummies""- Literally"	2004-08-26	28	13	15

Instead, Michael Moore has given us one of the most stirring call to arms I have ever seen. He shows us how useless in fighting back against the 9/11 terrorists were our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, how feeble and incompetent is our homeland security. In chilling detail he makes an indictment of how the Saud Royal family is in bed with both Osama bin Laden and American business, and his message could not be any clearer: we are 2-1/2 years late in invading Saudi Arabia, occupying Mecca, and installing an American-style democracy in that terrorist stronghold.

They delighted indispensing fear. They never seemed to back up theirthreats themselves, but almost always had others do it forthem. And maybe you got tired of it, and decided,  sincethis is my high school too, though I don't have wealthyparents, and am not the captain of the football team, I'lltell someone. I will rat them out. But, no. Too scared.You think maybe being a non entity is a good deal. I afterall am not bullying anyone, or  lying about people. I'm notcheating on my exams. It will come back to haunt thebullies. Because you believe in justice You hear aboutthings being for a reason. You hear that if you are goodand don't curse or drink or smoke, or hurt other people,you're OK.But the bullies drink and smoke. And think nothing abouthurting other people. They kind of enjoy it.  Some of themdrink and smoke a lot. You think it's so transparent. I seethe results of their bullying and getting away with it.Where is the justice?And you think: If I  was mean enough, or if only I had arich daddy. If only I didn't have to study hard or at all,and teachers still passed me to the next grade? So you gohome at night and you study three or four hours, then youcontinue reading a book before school interrupted youfrom real books and learning real stuff. Books like""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" ""BraveNew World,"" or ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Andyou maybe want to talk about them in English lit. classbecause you've grown tired of the sanitized stuff in thetext book. But you know your thoughts are suspect.When did this happen? As you discover there are an awfullot of bullies around. And they aren't all in school. Andthey are not terribly bright. You just know they will makeit in the world. You just know they will get away withanything.You read later Bertrand Russell's definition of howschools make ""manly men"" and how those ""manly men""die on battlefields, not knowing why, and it all has to dowith school, and learning to play the game and not earnthe enmity of ""fools."" And maybe some of these ""manlymen"" who were bullies (the ones without money, who didnot get daddy to buy them out of the draft) got killed inbattle. War turned out not like another high schoolfootball game after all. And yet, isn't this what MichaelMoore is saying? That it all starts then? That if everyonewill be a patriot to their school, things will be okay?Newsies don't ask hard ball questions of certain bulliesanymore. They just have their hair blow dried properly,their make up done well, and they sit in front of a cameraand they read what someone wrote for them. And it's all ahigh school setting. And that's where we are. Only it's abillion times worse. A thousand American soldiers aredead. Ten or more thousand innocent Iraqis. And fewbeen saying anything for such a long time. Just hot air.Just noise. Katie Couric thinks ""Navy SEALS rock""however.If Michael Moore has to have courage to make this film,if people have to have courage to go see it, or to tellothers about it, and not to have ""propaganda"" tossed intheir faces by  people who are so well, informed, they'venot seen it, or any of his other movies, or have not readany of his books, then it seems the big quiet is on. Or was.I happened to like my high school. And it made me madbeyond words when one of the bullies was graduated likeall the rest of us even though his term paper for Englishwas copied word for word from his sister's term paper afew years before when she was in the same class with thesame teacher. The teacher nailed him right there before us.Threw the paper right at him. Furious. Said he would notgraduate. She lied. Or was told to graduate him. Whichshe did.It always takes courage to tell the truth. To have the facts.To do the job the news has abdicated itself from in suchcowardice. That is what is called freedom. It takes nocourage to do nothing and pretend you do not see whatyou see, or do not hear what you hear.Death is not ""Hoppy Rides the Range:"" circa 1943.  Ididn't have to go fight a war though. I did not have tolose a son in a war. I did not have to receive that horriblephone call announcing with regrets....I didn't have to havechildren die in my arms. I didn't have to have my friendblown to bits beside me. I didn't have to have an arm orleg amputated. I didn't have to have my guts blown outand me with a bag on my side the rest of my life. I didn'thave to die for something that was not so.Moore reminds us that right now, right this second,someone is being cut apart by bullets, someone is beingblown to bits by a bomb, someone, a child, for instance, iscrying in her sleep because there is nothing but a screamleft in her, in a tent hospital somewhere in the Mid East,and that scream is one heck of a lot more important, thangoing along, than just hoping it doesn't touch you,because it will, eventually.Michael Moore says so. Well, passionately, with the factsto back him up. And for anyone not obsessed with doingthe second grade versions of the dozens on him becauseof his physical characteristics, that should be the thing thatcounts. Please see this movie. Facts are facts. And he hasthe talent, the tenacity, the compassion, the humanity totell us so. And make me, for one, a little ashamed at howquiet I've been.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Michael MooreMichael Moore has stated from the start what ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is and what it is intended to be.  The film is an attack on President Bush about his handling of our country and his actions after September 11, 2001.  The film is an indictment for his entire presidency and President Bush's failure to truly ""lead"" our nation.  Michael Moore has had no hidden agenda.  His agenda with this film has been quite public.  He wants to educate the public about President Bush and he wants President Bush out of office.  Moore is using this documentary as a platform against President Bush and he is open about it.  All documentaries, whether or not the director is open about it, have a certain amount of bias.  I'm not sure it is possible to not show bias and still have a quality film that makes a point.  Moore is just less subtle about his bias than most.Since this is a documentary, there are three things that must be taken into consideration:1. Is this a well made, quality piece of filmmaking?2. Is this movie entertaining?3. Is the documentary factual?The first two questions are common to all movies.  The third question is directed towards a documentary.  I do not have the expertise to answer question 3, but I can say that many of the arguments Moore makes in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" are ones that I have heard before, often from reputable sources, so I am inclined to accept the veracity of the facts presented in this movie.  The facts may be accurate, but is Moore's interpretation truthful?Michael Moore opens ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with the 2000 election and the claims that George W Bush, with the help of his brother and the official vote counter of Florida, cheated to win the election.  Moore goes onto show the viewer how Bush always intended to invade Iraq, even before September 11, even if there was no connection between Iraq and the particular terrorists who were to blame.  Moore continues to show the connection between Bush's family and the Bin Ladin family (which is not the same thing as a connection directly with Osama) and how numerous members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States without being questioned only two days after the 9/11 attacks.  It is Moore's contention that President Bush has been a failure as President, but worse, has been damaging to our country and to the world.Right now I have no reason to doubt the facts presented in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", but it is Moore's interpretation of the facts that point to a larger conspiracy among everyone in the administration to fight the war in Iraq no matter the provocation (or a lack thereof).  It is Moore's interpretation that says that President Bush deliberately manipulated America with the fear of post 9/11 that has allowed him to fight a war that nobody would have supported otherwise.  I'll admit that Moore makes a compelling and powerful case, but I'm not sure how much I am yet willing to accept all of his interpretations.One thing is clear to me, however.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a skillfully made political film that far surpasses any of the political advertisements that you see on television that are ""approved"" by the candidate.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is deeply moving, often funny, and is a well made, well crafted film.  It goes without saying that this is a very divisive film and perhaps the viewer's enjoyment of it (or even acceptance of it) may very well depend on what side of the political spectrum one finds himself (or herself).

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	"Fahrenheit 911 is Michael Moore's contribution to the 2004 Presidential Campaign. Hoping to help other loyal, concerned Americans bring the Bush Administration to a hardly untimely end on January 20, 2005, Moore documents the perfidious nature of the crooks and warmongers who have misgoverned us since the Supreme Court stabbed us in the back after the 2000 Election.The movie begins with the last, triumphant days of the Al Gore Campaign as it swept toward victory in November of 2000.  Moore then documents the shenanigans and insider dealings which produced the Florida fiasco and installed Bush and Company in the White House.  Moore does an especially brilliant job of documenting the sleazy tactics and underhandedness of W and his milieu, which includes some of the smarmiest people in the Middle East and Europe.Next, Moore shows us W. on September 11, 2001, sitting with a glazed look on his face as his world began to crumble.  Moore demonstrates that far from being the courageous, calm leader Republican propagandists portray, W. in the days and weeks after September 11 was more of a pawn than a king.The most powerful parts of Fahrenheit 911 deal with the tragic war in Iraq in all its bloody details, details that the US media has never had the stomach to show us but which are essential to our understanding of exactly what our government is committing in our names. Moore also shows us exactly which Americans are doing the fighting and dying:  not the privileged sorts who run the government, but the poorest and saddest among us.Fahrenheit 911 is a muckraker's delight.  It claws away our illusions and demonstrates that the Emperor has no clothes and that our ""gods"" have feet of clay."	5.0	Michael Moore Punctures the Bush Balloon	2004-09-24	24	19	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AX1W6T957ITA8	John D.	"Sometimes when someone believes so obsessively in a certain philosophy it becomes hard for that person to destinguish between opinions and facts. What one needs to keep in mind is that the ""facts"" cannot ""speak for themselves"" (as the editorial review says) if they are not believable as true facts or not sufficiently proven. The viewpoint in the film is weakly presented and seems to be based more on what Moore wants to be true than what he can prove to be true. The argument is tenuous and juvenile and reasoning is often subsituted by low and base satire, the kind that could be made of anyone (for example, footage of Paul Wolfowitz combing his hair with saliva or superimposing the heads of the party members on cowboys). The great irony is that Michael Moore never seems to consider the possible humor of filming a hypothetical documentary of himself trying reach around his fat to his less readily accessible parts in the shower or trying to fit into his briefs in the morning. The true shallowness of the film can be seen in one scene in particular, the scene where Moore is standing outside the congressional building passing out military enlistment flyers to congressmen asking them if they want their children to enlist. After a few hours of doing this, to the point where congressmen become annoyed with him and run away, he triumphantly concludes that his prediction was correct, that the congressmen would be repulsed by the flyers (although the thought probably never crossed Moore's mind that it may have been him repulsing the congressmen rather than the the flyers). The bottom line is that Moore seems to assume that proof is not necesary, that all people everywhere will automatically agree with him and the liberal doctrine and do not need to be presented with a mature argument of why they should follow it. I am sure that many Moore-ist liberals will go ahead and vote this review ""not helpful"" simply out of suspicion that I disagree with the film, but there are no ""facts"" in it that ""speak for themselves."" The only thing that speaks for itself is the obsessive urgency to sway the election results, an attempt that in the end proved to be inconsequential and unsuccesful."	1.0	I wonder who the Amazon editorial reviewer voted for....	2005-04-23	37	12	25

Hogan	I'm a well-educated (2 advanced degrees) and well-infomed former Marine Corps officer and I thought I'd seen and read everything there was to know about the war in Iraq, 9/11 and terrorism. I was wrong. This documentary opened my eyes to many facts that left me and my wife absolutely dumfounded. It was also very funny in places and generally very entertaining. I don't agree with all of Moore's conclusions, but the main thrust of his film, the deceits and treachery of the Bush Administration, are incontrovertible and have never been disproved by the Wing Nuts who claim he's a liar.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2D5BGCNBZVN93	John Smith	"Moore deserves an Academy Award for this incredible documentary, and imagine how Dubya will SQUIRM if he loses in November, and Moore sweeps the Oscars! This film not only opened my eyes, but confirmed my suspicions about why the Hell we were attacking the country of Iraq. There are murderous dictators, and atrocities happening in countries in Africa on a daily basis, as well as our own back yard of Haiti, and drug lords running rampant all over South America, and infiltrating our streets with Crack Cocaine and Smack. But we dont declare war on them, we do nothing, but send our regards. Why, you ask? Well, I can GUARANTEE you that if the country of Haiti had the 2nd largest Oil Reserves on the Planet, that we would have already invaded it, deposed the leader, and stuck a US Flag in the center of the Capital of Port Au Prince, thats for damned sure.George Dubya Redneck, the real life J.R. Ewing, and his sidekick Dick Cheney have, shall we say ""business interests"" in all that Black Gold/Texas Tea that Saddam Hussein was sitting on so smugly. Could they and Halliburton get to it with Saddam there? No Way, Jack! BUT, after 9/11 happened, this opened the floodgates, all of a sudden they had all the excuse they needed, the fear of the American People to inexplicalbly declare war on a country that had ZILCHO to do with 9/11. And now, except for those damned insurgents, George Dubya has his foot in the door, and is on the verge of being a billionaire once he hands the reins over to Dick. And if it costs over 1,000 US troops, well, thats just tough, and the Dept. of Defense will send their sympathies and regrets, oh, and they wont forget to dock your precious sons or daughters pay for those last few days when they were in a body bag, after all they only get paid for killing Iraqis, not ""lying down on the job""....This film made me disgusted, especially when they showed US Troops a little too happy about burning down homes. This film made me nauseated when we saw what really went on behind the scenes of the last US Elections, and Bush's Limo getting pelted with eggs says all we need to know about why we need to get that reject from Hee Haw, and send him back to Jerkwater Texas where he belongs."	5.0	The Bush Administration EXPOSED!	2004-07-11	35	26	9

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2F2MQKBB4CYPF	John W. Evans	"I finally got to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", and I don't know where to begin describing it.  The first adjective that comes to my mind is ""horrifying"".  How honest is Michael Moore with this film?  One thing is for certain: he is honest about his intent, which is to help defeat Bush in 2004.  The quotes he uses from the Bush administration folks are genuine, as they are provided in the form of video clips that feature the suspects.As usual, Moore injects a lot of his personal emotions...  he is a master at this.  There is speculation which appears a bit wild at times, particularly in the first half of the film.  However, the basic information is there and the questions arise from it.Moore asks tough questions about why Saudi nationals were allowed to leave the U.S. during the days immediately following 9-11, why people aren't more concerned about the close ties between the Bush family and the Saudis, why we let Bin Lauden get such a big head start on us before we went into Afghanistan, why we really went to Iraq, etc. ad nauseum.  For the most part, he steers clear of using fallacies as he presents his questions and arguments;  he mainly uses real information as a springboard.I would imagine most avid left-wingers will at least try to see the movie.  Most right-wingers will probably not bother, preferring to wish the film would go away.  After all, it represents an attempt to upset the status quo, and it is a radically different way of looking at things than what they are taught to think by conservative TV and radio programming.  My hope is that many ""undecided"" voters will see it and find themselves as horrified as I was at how Orwellian the Bush neoconservatives are made out to be;  if the Bushies keep hammering away at us, we may well soon believe that ""War is peace"".Inquiring minds want to know, and Moore provides plenty of fodder for thought.  This film may help us realize how repugnant politicians are in general...  and particularly the delusional little cabal currently running (ruining) the United States of America.There are some out there who hate free speech and would like to suppress it in order that only one narrow set of views is available to Americans.  Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity immediately come to mind.  People of that ilk must be squirming in their seats every time they hear about Michael Moore or about the success of this movie.  As they plot various ways to suppress the voices of dissent, we should be thankful they are being made uncomfortable.  These people seem to want a one-party system in America.  I believe they are out of touch with what a majority of Americans feel about this country.Michael Moore has referred to this film as a ""comedy"".  I certainly wouldn't call it that, as I found the laughs to be few and far between, especially in the second half of the movie.  I would place this in the ""horror"" category.  The Iraq footage is terrifying, and it is not for the faint of heart.  The interviews with the troops left me feeling empty.  Some of them expressed a sort of joy in killing Iraqis, including citizens.  I think it's likely that only a handful of our troops actually feel the same as those depicted in the film, but when I see their attitudes and behaviors displayed on the movie screen and pair it with the images of Iraqi prisoner treatment, I believe these troops aren't to blame for their actions.  Problem behaviors such as these begin at the top, through macho/arrogant leadership and that leaderships' misguided attitude toward the rest of the world...  it seems like it's ""God Bless America and God Damn All The Others.""There is nothing comedic about that.  We simply can't command the respect of the rest of the world, we need to earn it.  At this point, thanks to our current administration, we need to earn that respect back.  They all loved us after the September 11 attacks, now many of them hate us.  How did that happen so fast?  Moore points out these things and explores them...  and to his credit, he isn't shown much throughout the movie.  He is mostly there as a voice-over.  Considering how self-aggrandizing he tends to be, I found this to make the film that much more watchable.If you disagree with what Moore says in ""Fahrenheit 9-11"", I hope you have at least bothered to see the film.  If you refuse to go see it, then maybe it is because you are afraid of being exposed to things that run counter to your belief systems.  Moore's film should horrify true left-wing believers and hardcore conservatives alike...  hopefully enough that a wholesale change will come about at election time.First half of the film:  2.5 stars.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A25CQTB313XDWO	"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland"""	Upon the release of Fahrenheit 911, Michael Moore has arguably established himself as the answer of moderates and liberals to the likes of Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh.Though many are outraged about the allegations of Fahrenheit 911, and perhaps rightfully so, it is not so apparent that there have been deliveries from the most outspoken voices of the GOP that have answered Moore's indictments in this film with strong, highly reasonable, clearly expressed responses. From what I see and hear on most of FOX News and the like, the only discussions from neocon pundits, including Ann Coulter, Joe Scarborough and Sean Hannity, center around name calling and portraying Moore as an anti-patriot who is aiding the terrorists without effectively deconstructing the perceived merits and flaws of Moore's documentary.I do agree that this film is slanted, but the so-called extenuating circumstances that critics have tried to espouse in defense of the Bush White House hold very little weight. And who are these critics? Again, Coulter and company.Don't get me wrong. There are annoyances from the leftist view, but when you have guys like Savage, Hannity and Limbaugh espousing their venom under the guise of news talk radio, leaving little room, if any, for other points of view, perhaps for those other opinions to receive any undivided, uninterrupted attention this documentary had to come out.I often wish that we could have some scholarly, well-informed, well-balanced discussions on a regular basis. I think that the conservatives would serve themselves well if they had more of the intelligent analysts like George Will, William Buckley, and Bill Kristol. They might not be the most exciting, but they do not go off foaming at the mouth, indoctrinating one-half of a nation that they have, in essence, divided.Oh, yes. Our nation is divided. It does not help when you watch programs where the so-called moderator allows one guest to voice, essentially, the moderator's sentiments in full and then join this first guest in double-teaming against the dissenting party, not allowing this second guest to complete the first two sentences without being interrupted. Again, I think that what has been happening on certain programs on MSNBC, CNBC, FOX, and various outlets has contributed to the popularity of Fahrenheit 911, because it is one rare source that one can hear some degree of satire about President Bush.There were promises of uniting as opposed to dividing, but this juvenile attitude that one is so much more entitled to put others down than the next person is creating a rift. It especially is troublesome when idealogues are so full of themselves that they communicate as if they do not have to heed the facts, especially if the facts do not agree with their perceived standards. If they saw Fahrenheit 911, they might conclude deep down inside that Moore has managed to hold a mirror that reflects their arrogance.	4.0	A Thought-Provoking Display of Uncompromising Liberalism	2004-07-23	8	6	2

Unfortunately after analysis, much of Mr. Moore's efforts doesn't pass, or hold up under scrutiny. In that regard, it's merely opinion--conjecture and provides every viewer the opportunity to experience highly developed, dialectical based propaganda.Unfortunately, with the seriousness and nature of the subject at hand, propaganda does not serve, but detracts from matters of great import to our society.Opinions be had, Mr. Moore certainly has one. I can only hope that the masses that view this effort do so with the blinders off and preconceptions/misconceptions aside. You'll need it! F-9/11 is very convincing, except for one fact, which is that the average citizen will never really know the how and why, or the failures (if any). Why?

I guess it must have been really exahusting and time-consuming for Bush to fight for America (for the real reasons), so he simply chose to start a war under fake motives with Iraq (for the black gold, that is no surprise to any one). Also, how he tried, and did, cut back the budget for veterans and the families of the deceased soldiers. It just saddens me to see so many people hating this documentary just for telling the truth(it hurts, don't it?). This documentary is not anti-Bush propaganda, you should already have your mind made up about either loving or hating Bush.

Slevin	"There is so much information passing around Amazon regarding Michael Moore and of course much more about 9-11 and the recent investigations.  The new book ""The 9-11 Investigations"" has the sworn testimony of Richard Clarke and George Tenet and Condy Rice and Madelline Albright and the reports from the Staff and this information is very informative.If anything Moore's movie will affect so many individuals to decide how they view President Bush, the USA, the War on Terror, Iraq, etc.  One thing that caught my attention about 9-11 in the investigations it was found that even if Bin-Laden had been killed or captured prior to 9-11 it would not have prevented it according to the investigation.  Moore may feel they are all 'in on it' but anyone watching these investingations know that there was a real attempt to find out whether anyone was negligent prior to the event.Is the President responsible?  If so, why did the investigation not turn that up?  Is Moore being truthful with us, is that not important to all Americans or do we pick and choose what we believe because we 'choose to believe it?'Moore's previous movies have had a tendency to exaggerate.  He is funny, but does he really have our best interest in mind when he makes movies and writes books that villify?  He calls Americans in general, you and me, stupid.  We make him a multi-millionaire and he laughs all the way to the bank while we become angry about what he is saying.There is the new book about Moore that is hitting Amazon at number 4 last night and 10 this evening, I do not like the title, however it is a very eyeopening read.Again see the movie, but in order to keep both our feet on the ground, we need to be informed that not everything we see is real and we can have a picture painted that says a thousand words, yet those words could deceive us and delude us as we tear each other apart on these pages and in the political fight to come.

Menta, Jr.	"Sadly, even in light of how the Iraq situation seems to get worse and worse each day, there are still many people who say, ""Oh, I won't see that Michael Moore film... I hear it's really biased.""  I wish these folks would smack themselves on the head and realize that administration officials have been feeding everyone THEIR side of the story for three-plus years, so what's WRONG with hearing an opposing view for a lousy TWO HOURS?  I'm not saying you need to agree with every single point Mr. Moore makes here, but what's so crazy about viewing the darned thing once before giving it a blanket dismissal?Just be warned, viewers may find precious little to refute in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", as Mr. Moore makes so many of his points by simply letting the president speak for himself, via the ample newsclips that were assembled for the film.  One of my favorites is the quote in the subject line, which Mr. Bush delivered to a roomful of fat-cat campaign contributors during a lavish fundraising dinner.  Actually, the entire quote is even more revealing: ""Ah, the haves and have-mores... some people call you the elite... I call you my base.""  And not only does the quote confirm Mr. Moore's assertions about who the president is truly ""for"", but it also raises (yet again!) questions about the leader of the free world's mental agility, in that he actually allowed those comments to be videotaped!But, hey, if you still need another reason to watch this movie, it's also very, very funny in places.  And, of all forms of humor, political humor is always particularly fun, isn't it?  Also, the humor gives one occasional breaks from the serious, heart-rending, and tragic moments in the film, which I have to be honest and say are also here in abundance.That's it for now.

That being said I felt that this film was pure sensationalism from a disingenuous film maker. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a one sided self serving film from a man who thrives on calling himself a political activist. Mr. Moore is often times misinformed and blinded by his dislike of President Bush. With Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael Moore has 2 uncensored hours to force feed us out of context statements and his own political commentary.After seeing this film the only questions on my mind were, how can I belive what I just saw from a man who openly critises the President of the United States any chance he has and what about the other side of the story? All of the reasearch for this film seems to have been done with one intention and that was to subject viewers to Mr. Moore's views and not on the facts of what happened.Michael Moore should be congratulated, not because the film opened my eyes to the world but because the film served one purpose his own.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AE42RZK38XOKJ	Joshua Christofferson	"Michael Moore is obviously just as angry as any liberally minded American, and I am no exception. The helplessness that many feel under the current administration grows daily, and our faith in our leaders drops a little more each term.The problem with Fahrenheit 9/11 is not necessarily the subject matter, but the way in which it is presented. There have been plenty of cool-headed news articles, TV shows, and radio broadcasts that lay out in great detail the many flaws and contradictions of George W. Bush, but none as venomous as Michael Moore's film. It is obvious that Moore is using every piece of data in his arsenal to dethrone Bush, but all too often he falls into the trap of sensationalism. Not to say that the actions of President Bush are not sensational themselves, but Moore 's version tends to boil the blood. Perhaps that is a good thing. Perhaps that's what voters need to get Bush out of office. The only issue I take with this sensationalistic approach is that it mimics the tactics of the far right. Radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or Ann Coulter all use the most extreme elements of liberalism as their ammunition while they ignore many points of raw fact. They form opinions based on deep-seated hatred of the ""other"" party simply because they are not ""them."" This is the attitude that I hoped liberal thinkers would not take part in. Unfortunately, this is the posture that Moore leans toward in his film.The reason I take note of this, and believe it is worthy of discussion, is for the simple fact of credibility. I do this not to discredit Moore , nor do I do it to support Bush. I simply want a critical analysis, not just an analysis based on what I want to believe. In other words, I want to find out if everything Moore says is true, false, or smudged in-between. If I simply take what Moore tells me to be true, then I am no better than anyone who simply takes what anyone tells them to be true.Michael Moore uncovers little in his film that hasn't been addressed: the Bush connection with the Saudis, the Patriot Act issues, the 9/11 report, the alleged Iraq/al Qaeda connection, etc. These stories have been unfolding for the past few years and it was refreshing to see them all come together in a logical fashion. There are only two points that I wish Moore had been more careful in deliberating:1. The Saudi flight on 9/132. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictator1. The Saudi flight on 9/13I was discussing this with someone I know who's father is a big-wig at LAX. This person reminded me that the FAA lifted their ban on flights on 9/13, the same day Moore says NO ONE was allowed to fly. In fact, the FAA did lift their ban on many flights on 9/13. While most of the flights were still grounded, and many airports were kept closed by the FAA due to poor security, there were some flights that were allowed to fly (mostly flights that were already on route when the ban took effect). What Moore meant to say was that no NEW private or commercial flights were allowed at that immediate time.Also, the independent 9/11 commission confirmed that the FBI did adequately interview 30 of the Saudis (it does not say if any of these 30 were from the bin-Laden family or not. We do know that some of the bin-Laden family was on board one or more of the flights in question which flew between 9/11-9/15). However, as Moore points out, it does seem highly suspect that the bin-Laden family was seemingly ushered out at the earliest convenience, and that they were not as thoroughly interviewed as they should have been in such dangerous time.The point I'm making here is, while Moore 's statements were true, the whole picture was not painted for the public. He chose not to include the fact that SOME flights were being allowed by the FAA as a general lift of their ban. By avoiding this, Moore leaves us with a partial untruth, and these partial untruths are great ammunition for Bush supporters which ultimately only weaken Moore 's argument. By not revealing the fact that some flights were allowed to fly (whether or not it pertains directly or not the Saudi issue), Moore comes off as a manipulator of facts to his enemies. This in turn only discredits any true information he may have. By leaving out important elements, Moore 's enemies can say, ""Ah-ha! He twisted the story to suit his agenda, therefore we can't trust anything he says!""2. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictatorMoore paints a picture of how rosy life was before the US bombs hit Baghdad . He shows people in cafes, women walking the streets with smiles, and even kids flying kites. This can be viewed either as a portrait of how innocent Saddam's Iraq was, or how innocent people were killed (and still are) during the US attack. Of course, Moore is presenting the fact that many civilian casualties were killed, but the rosy picture portrayed could easily be read as, ""Saddam's Iraq was a swell place to live before the Americans arrived."" By not mentioning once that Saddam, at the very least, was a dictator that gassed many of his citizens and tortured many others, is irresponsible. This leaves the impression that Saddam's Iraq was just minding its own business, living in sweet harmony, when the US bombed away.Now, the case for or against invading Iraq is a different matter of which I am not commenting on here. I'm only pointing out that omitting some details of why Saddam was targeted by the Bush administration (right or wrong) were purposely left out to stir emotions instead of objective fact. Again, Moore is not necessarily lying, but he's leaving out important parts of the story. He's leading the public in a similar manner that a Limbaugh or Hannity might.Other than these two discrepancies, I felt that the film was very engaging and entertaining. Just the fact that the film was subject to banning and attempted banning in many cities attests to the power of cinema, and the power it has to sway the populace. This is why I commented on Moore 's approach. It is not meant to discredit him, as I mentioned before, but to hopefully bring to attention that even Michael Moore can make all the facts fit perfectly despite the fact that some facts are still clouded in mystery and subjection.Everything he portrayed in his film has been documented and covered by various books and articles over the past few years. So, while there is not much new evidence displayed here against Bush, it is nice to see all of the indictments come together under one roof, even if it is done with a sensationalistic flair of entertainment. But then again, if all this information was presented in a calm, cool fashion by a show like FRONTLINE, then millions of Americans might not ever see it, which begs the question, perhaps sensationalism is necessary for mass media to get its message across. But do the ends justify the means?"	4.0	Entertaining Politics	2004-10-03	37	22	15

Evans ""Village Idiot"""	I find it humorous that people in this forum seem to be reviewing their own political positions and purposes rather than going into or after the film itself which is the real state of grace here.  Michael is an excellent documentarian, perhaps the best today, with a more historically bent nod to the Burns brothers (sic) and a few others.  He is a great one because he wakes people up and gets them to display thoughts and emotions, while many of these films just make us grab for some more popcorn, change the channel, or nod off.  And almost all of Moore's films have made us think and feel STRONGLY (Roger and Columbine especially).As a documentary junkie I have never seen anything perform the effect that Fahrenheit 911 has and does.  It is the cattle prod for the polarization of America today and seems to be getting more and more defined as we move towards November.  Well so be it.  Whether you are a Bush monger or a Kerry cutie this is a movie that needs to be seen.  You decide for yourself whether its purpose is propaganda, entertainment or to overthrow the world in a nicer way than Dick Cheney (corporate takeover) or even John Edwards (legal eagle) ever thought possible.I was so disappointed in a recent New York Daily News or Post cover story (can't remember which but they're pretty much the same, right?) when 911 Tragedy standard bearer Rudy Giuliani (I voted for him) blasted this film, sizzled Moore and went on to say he never saw it.  What!?!?  Siskel and Ebert moment ala Rudy: I loved the film Gene.  I hated it Roger, you're an idiot.  Why?  Don't know, never saw it.  Sounds like my Robin Hood book report in the 4th grade.  Skipped the book, watched the cartoon, wrote a parody (got an A+).What is everyone so afraid of?  Changing sides, a firmer position, not having the best hairdo?

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A19N15QU7VHM0F	Joshua M. Guillemette	You should watch this film with your eyes open. Mr. Moore has a political bias and clear dislike for the war in Iraq and the Bush Administration; Couple that with fact that there are 56 documented untruths and I think you would be hard pressed to call this a documentary. However, Mr. Moore does show us a few things.One we live in a great country that protects his right to promote his political agenda. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 please watch the counterpoint, Fahrenhype 9/11 to see both views.Two, war is always horrible in the toll it takes on soldiers and civilians, and should never be entered into lightly. However, after one Gulf War, many resolutions, and a final call to disarm over a 12 year period, one can hardly say the president made a rush decision; whether you agree with the policy or not.Last, the military is a great way to learn a trade, see the world, and pay for college; that is why Mrs. Lipscomb still promotes it. I should add that West Point and The Naval Academy are some of the hardest colleges to get into and are not attended by only those in the lowest socioeconomic bracket. Many people from all walks of life are drawn to the excitement, the challenge, and the desire to serve thier country. Each and every one of those who enlist know full well that it is potentailly dangerous. That is why you get a rifle in boot and not a tutu.Honestly, in these highly charged times you owe it to yourself to listen to both sides and make an informed choice.

I like the way it starts out cause it brings back memories of the 2000 election. I really think the threat to America was overlooked before it happened and the first several months George W. Bush was kind of a slacker president. He read My Pet Goat for 7 mintues before telling the class what happened on September 11. The war in Afghanistan ended up not being as big as the war in Iraq which to me is pretty strange because for me the reason the trade center was attacked was because of Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sending their warped believers off on a plane.Footage of the war and certain people's sick attitude about it were very disturbing. Its emotionally moving and will make you cry at times.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2WTN1GAIBOZU	J. Pinkerton Snoopington	Before starting my review, I should probably say that for the most part, I agree with Michael Moore's politics. I dislike president Bush and his regime, and think they have been very destructive in their first term (here's hoping the second term isn't so bad). That being said, Moore's controversial &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is a disappointingly mixed bag. Unlike &quot;Roger and Me&quot; or &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; it's straight propoganda. Moore hits the audience over the head with his message, giving this reviewer a severe headache by the film's close. While Moore doesn't appear on camera as much as his previous films, his narration is near-constant - his narration combined with the endless news footage and documents gives this an irritating &quot;slide show&quot; or &quot;court case&quot; feeling. While Moore's previous films had interesting human stories, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; gives us only the plight of Flint war mother Lila Lipscomb. Moore attempts some of his trademark pranking, but it's unsatisfactory (particularly in the awkward Patriot Act scene - a prank that peters out before a punchline). After a while, the film just gets dull. That being said, there is still plenty good to say about it - the scene where Lipscomb goes to capitol hill is undeniably moving, and much of the &quot;found footage&quot; (Bush in the classroom reading &quot;My Pet Goat,&quot; the unforgettable &quot;Now watch this drive&quot; scene) is great, and many of the individual scenes (the opening, homeland security) are well done.The DVD has the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Since a startling amount of this movie is grainy news footage, there really isn't much the DVD can (or should) do. Suffice to say, the image looks good enough. The real value of the DVD is in the extras. Some of the extras, especially the scene with Condelleza Rice (&quot;I believe it was called 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the US'&quot;) and the documentary about Arab American comedians. The worst extra is about the release of the film, which is fifteen solid minutes of people saying what a great guy Michael Moore is - dull, dull, dull! Another extra worth checking out is the theatrical trailer, which is surprisingly effective.	3.0	Excellent Propoganda, but a Middling Film	2004-12-05	0	0	0

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	APCPYBSKH0NIA	J. T. Keith	"Michael Moore has a specific viewpoint and a clear agenda.  There is no question that his movie is intended to provoke a response rather than merely provide a bland analysis of the Bush presidency.  It is fascinating to see footage of the president and his advisors that has never been aired elsewhere and is not a pre-arranged photo-op or soundbite.  Also, the image of Vice President Gore carrying out his duties in the Senate by dismissing the challenges to the 2000 election results is stunning.  That's right.... Gore is pounding the gavel to silence those who were trying to file official protests on his behalf.  Regardless of your opinion on that election, these scenes are highly entertaining.In my opinion, Moore's movie is most effective when presenting the American citizens who have been investigated by the government under the guise of ""national security"".  The idea that someone would be visited by the FBI after criticising the president while working out at a health club scares me greatly.  I love this country and it sickens me to see such un-American police powers.  I now understand why one of the most conservative members of Congress in the last 10 years, Bob Barr of Georgia, has signed on as a consultant to the ACLU to fight the USA Patriot Act.In Moore's previous films, he shaped the issues by adding his own voice at every turn.  With this film, he has greatly reduced this tendency.  Comparatively speaking, he is rather tame in his own personal commentary, particularly after the Bush- Saudi segment.  He also limits his use of ""ambush journalism"" that is a staple of his earlier works.  I can only recall one instance of him trying to goad someone he was attempting to interview and even that segment was less confrontational than his usual style.I highly recommend this film."	5.0	Informative most of the time, entertaining throughout	2004-09-30	20	15	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2LROTEGW09DHH	Julian Benard	This film comes from a very biased viewpoint and should be taken as such.  This is no different than listening to Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  Moore tries to present his viewpoint in a humerous entertaining way and that is hit or miss.  I don't like his stunts such as getting Congresspeople to enlist their children.  I think that detracts from his narrative and it isn't that entertaining.  What I think most people should look at is that it is not 'liberal' to question the government's motives.  I lived through the 60's where civil rights participants were followed and bugged for years.  These people were in peaceful groups and did not use violence.  What a waste of resources, especially when the FBI and CIA could have been following the violent racist groups dedicated to making the white race supreme.  Now the government sees antiwar protesters as enemies of the state.  This deserves attention.  Also the Bush administration ties to Saudi business interests should be closely investigated.  We have lost billions due to the protection of Haliburton.  That money is not going to rebuilding Iraq nor protecting our troops.  Can you get any more unpatriotic than that?  Anyway Moore's points are valid, even if he goes overboard on the issues.  His facts are not always correct which detracts from his message.  He should tighten up his narrative so that people who don't agree with him would at least try to delve into the criticisms.  My professor told us to read newspapers/magazines from all points of views. You can't be a critical thinker without seeing opposing views.

It's only called a ""documentary"" because we don't yet have a genre called ""political-essay-as-feature-film"", even though that's quite obviously what this is. It doesn't aim to present ""the facts"" and let you decide for yourself - that's what the news is for (unless you're watching Fox). Rather, it's taking a particular view of certain facts and expressing it with maximum emotion. This is seen by some reviewers as unfair or somehow inappropriate in a feature film only because it happens so rarely in that medium. Not so in others. When the likes of Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly spew their conservative vitriol all over radio, television and print - or when Gore Vidal does the same for the liberals - nobody seriously accuses them of being ""biased"" for the simple reason that nobody expects to hear a list of facts. We expect to hear an argument, and that's what we get. They're arguing about policy and ideology from passionately held positions. That is precisely what Moore is doing here, no more and no less. As a fair and even-handed ""documentary"" it deserves 1 star. As a feature-length essay, it's highly effective. Love it or hate it, this kind of thing is essential in a democracy, and unavoidable.

It is easy to understand why many people would simply hate this film (they would call it lies, deceit, B.S., etc.).  But to those who hate this film without even seeing it, that is where I would have to draw a line.I did not like the film totally (I felt that there were too many cheap shots at Bush and company), but I do give him points for how he presents his information (if he says that he has people who check the facts he presents, then anything from those facts COULD be true).  This film does show that this is America, where we have a right to express our opinions, in the hopes that those opinions would never be suppressed by anyone.

Good.The movie starts out in the lull and disbelief of the election in 2000, which is somewhat comical and points out the problems of both Gore and Bush and their tastes in recreation/celebrities/music. Then, we talk about pre-9/11 Bush, and the stupid things he did (or didn't do, who knows.)Finally, we hit it. Yes, it's tastefully done, no it's not used against Bush in any way.The following movie is a chocolate/vanilla swirl of a movie, both pointing out the paranoia of the Patriot Act, expoliting the poor, and Bush's friends, the Saudis! Weeee!In the end, it does the movie accomplishes two things, it shows that in a rush and fit of anger, Michale Moore, the guy who did The Awful Truth and Bowling for Colombine, two of my favorite works, can get sloppy, and it also shows that the movie is mostly hype.

During Roger & Me he interviewed people before the GM layoffs and fixed it so it looked like their lifestyle was a result of the GM layoffs.  Is this a man whos main concern is showing how the GM layoffs hurt people, or is this a man who's just trying to make a film that will stir emotions?In F9/11 he asked a Senator a question about sending his son to war and he only filmed the question.... not the answer ( which, by the way, was ""I don't have a son but my nephew is in Iraq"").  Let me write that again, in a ""documentary"" he filmed himself asking a question, and DIDN'T FILM THE MANS ANSWER!!!!!!!!

There are some truths in the documentary. There are also some twisted truths and some outright lies. To make up your politcal mind based solely on this is frightening. People will go to vote based on this and this alone for someone to run our country?Moore, by creating this documentary, had only one thing in mind. I do not even believe it was to reshape the minds of many. It was simply to make money. Has Bush made mistakes as the film suggests, absolutely.

I thought that Moore, known for his &quot;pouring it on&quot; , sometimes to the point of absurdity, might do our cause more harm than good.This is not the case. In this movie, Moore has restrained himself from exuberant, &quot;over the top&quot; claims and attitudes, and presented us with a work that, although it has its light moments and even some hilarity, will make the audience soberly ponder the path of our current administration.My sole criticism is Moore's voice-over during the footage of Bush, at the Florida elementary school, hearing about the attacks. Moore speculates that Bush may be thinking of his family's business involvements with the Bin Ladens, and other connections to the international oil scene. I think that Moore is giving Bush far too much credit! The man does look stricken, frozen even, but it's probably because he is waiting for someone to tell him what to do. Where are his advisors when he needs them? Such a crisis is far beyond the man's abilities to comprehend and deal with alone, and he knows it.	4.0	Not as &quot;over the top&quot; as other Moore productions	2004-07-31	13	11	2

But come on---you know some of it is true and that should be enough for anyone to see where we are headed with this corrupt administration.  Let's say, just for argument's sake, that you only believe that a tiny bit of what is in this film is true.  That should be enough for any sane person who loves this country to demand these morons be kicked out of office.  Personally, I think that most of this film is probably right on target---I mean the facts are there to back up all of the claims Mr. Moore makes.  Thank God he has the courage to make a movie like this.  I am terrified for our country if Bush and his cronies are given another four years to destroy this country.  Even if you are the most closed-minded conservative Bush lover you MUST see this movie.  I have a feeling most of the reviewers who are critizing it haven't even bothered to watch it.

It's not anti american to question the president. Thats what Moore did and our founding fathers did in 1776.3. Why do people only question Moore than these other books and films? Is it because he has personality?4. Remember that Saddam did not attack us, Bin Laden did and he is NOT in Iraq.5. The title Don't Knock It Before You Try It are a reference to a Ben Harper song6.

Michael Moore has a team of accrediable fact checkers, so while it may seem what he may be telling you is one sided it is nontheless the truth.  For those of you who support Bush in all his endevors, you may not have heard some of the things he has said when he strays from the speech his writers prepare for him for nearly all public performances.  As sad and hard to believe as it is The United States is one of the most hated countries because of this whole Iraq thing.  When he strays he says the most appaulingly idotic things.  I for one am ashamed that I am represented by a President who sounds uneducated.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a wonderful documentary that envoked many emotions in me, sadness, anger, and embarrassment.

Bush provides the comedy. In a film that is not merely a machination to poke fun at Bush but also to question and challenge his authority, Moore wants to arouse the audience's senses on a President that has exceeded the exercise of power. Consider this film as a campaign against Bush and its true success can only derive from the inauguration of a man other than him. Well at least in the eyes of Michael Moore.Michael Moore is known for his satiric wit and comedy in films such as ""Roger & Me"" and the Academy Award-winning ""Bowling for Columbine."" In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" he tones down his screen presence and jokes and instead, said he'll let Bush provide the comedy. In this film, we have a more mature side of Moore because by temptation, it could easily have been a film that ridicules the President's mannerisms and so forth. Instead, the main focus is on the citizens of the United States and even that of Iraq. Moore means not to degrade Bush personally but exemplify how Bush has degraded the United States with a failed presidency.(...)"	4.0	We want MOORE!	2004-06-29	26	10	16

Yet, this film is an example of a contrived presentation of the ""truth"" that can anger a Canadian, like myself, who is already against the war before watching the film's introductory credits.This film is a work of propaganda that seeks to convince its audience to agree with a particular point of view by showing a collection of carefully screened and selected snippets of ""reality"".  Michael Moore interviews only those US soldiers that have doubts about the war.  Mr. Moore carefully chooses to interview a mother of a fallen soldier who is emotionally traumatized and angered by the on-duty death of her child, who had VOLUNTEERED (not conscripted) into the US military.  Mr. Moore thoughtfully decides to show footage of Iraqi children killed by US aerial bombardments rather than footage of Kurds massacred by Saddam's soldiers.  Mr. Moore deliberately wants us to watch scenes of US soldiers in Iraq arresting a terrorist/insurgent suspect (who could possibly be released later on) rather than a horrific scene of Saddam's secret police abducting a political dissident (who could well ""disappear"" forever).  Mr. Moore degrades America's coalition of allies by listing only the smaller allies (Morocco, Coasta Rica, etc.) and not mentioning the larger allies (Britain, Australia, etc.).  Thank you Mr. Moore for showing only what you want us to watch and omitting everything else that goes against your misguided anti-Bush crusade.  None of your facts are erroneous, but there are a lot of deliberate omissions designed to give a distorted view of ""reality"".  Further, Mr. Moore prefers to interview women rather than men, or rather, HYSTERICAL (and irrational) women who will provoke an emotional (rather than cool and rational) response from the audience.  Why doesn't Mr. Moore interview a parent of a fallen soldier who can rationally look beyond the death and understand the ""bigger picture""?  Further, it is not natural for any mother to become traumatized by the death of her baby boy even if he had died fighting a more ""just"" war such as the war against Nazi Germany?Finally, could Mr. Moore stop demonizing the Saudis?  The Saudis are like any other people, even if one is disgusted by their method of capital punishment (public beheading) which is actually more swift and humane than death by electricution or lethal injection.Yet, I will give Mr. Moore's film some stars for showing us things that one does not see on CNN, but always watch with a critical eye!  For example, one learns from the film that the Bush family has business ties with rich Saudi families such as the Bin Laden family.  Then again, I personally find nothing nefarious and shocking about this Bush family secret.  Any member of the Bush family should be free to make money by associating with persons from so-called ""evil"" countries as long as this is done while not holding public office.  Unpatriotic, perhaps, but certainly not unethical."	2.0	Propaganda Alert!  Watch only with a VERY Critical Eye!	2005-01-26	21	13	8

The only difference is that Riefenstahl didn't call Franklin Roosevelt a liar.Consider the contagion, which Moore willingly spreads, that Bush was reading to schoolchildren when he was told that terrorists had attacked the WTC, and simply kept on reading.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2P7FT3KC8KEUV	Kevin Rosero	"I went to see Fahrenheit 911 last year in theaters, very wary about the fact that even its supporters did not regard it as objective.  Yet I was willing to go see it if it showed footage from the war in Iraq that I could not find in the mainstream media.  The movie does have genuine clips of Iraqi civilians who were bombed, and for this reason alone it should be seen.  The palpable grief of Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, is also moving, as is the grief of all mothers who lose children, whether in necessary or unnecessary wars.  But after that, the virtues of the movie diminish and start to be overshadowed by its problems.  Sticking just to the question of war footage, Moore himself seemed to imply before the movie's release that he had footage of Iraqi prisoner abuse older than the Abu Ghraib photos, yet there is nothing so raw and clear as that in the movie.  There is only a scene cut and presented in such a way as to imply sexual abuse, when actually the footage may be about something quite different.Dave Kopel's online essay, ""59 Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"", describes how problematic Moore's style really is.  ""59 Deceits"" has its own problems, but it provides links to other pieces defending Moore's movie, and to critiques of Kopel's own piece, including point-by-point rebuttals.  Having compared Kopel with his critics, I would invite other fans or critics of the movie to decide who does a better job of transcending their own problems, for instance by inviting the opposite side to respond and not merely dismissing their views.  I find it significant that Kopel does invite Moore to respond, and this should be no surprise, since Kopel is a lifelong Democrat who, like Moore, supported Ralph Nader in 2000.It's impossible to see this film and not be moved by the suffering depicted in the U.S. and Iraq.  It's also practically impossible, unless you hold Michael Moore's political views, not to feel infuriated that such suffering should be presented in a movie that was openly made for political purposes.  In short, if you agree with those purposes, you won't feel manipulated, but if you disagree in any way with Moore's politics, you'll feel manipulated toward his views, rather than genuinely persuaded.  Considering that the American public was largely manipulated into supporting the invasion of Iraq, a movie like this hardly leaves you hopeful.But manipulative politics is not the chief problem with the film.  I find some things in Moore's political worldview attractive, especially when Fahrenheit is shining a light on problems at home, and drawing attention to how those problems might be linked to war.  The greater problem for me while watching the movie was not that I was listening to someone with radical politics, but instead a feeling that certain facts or realities - and yes, certain sufferings - were being systematically kept from me, as if I could not be trusted to make up my own mind.  Michael Moore has written that Americans are essentially stupid:  ""Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet....in thrall to conniving, thieving, smug pricks.  We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing.""  Not that Fahrenheit 911 cares to show us anything about what it's like to live in foreign countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq.  The movie assiduously avoids trying to educate us about life beyond our borders, besides showing us sweet scenes of everyday life that go down easily.  No doubt Moore feels that Saddam Hussein's police state was already highlighted enough by the mainstream media, and that his job as a film-maker was to point out the dark side of American involvement.  But in this way, his movie unwittingly argues that the mainstream media is doing a good job, or at least a passable job, of educating Americans about Iraq.  It clearly is not.  The Bush administration may have rightly called attention to certain living situations far beyond our imagination in our democracy, but neither Moore nor I would assert that the White House has fairly educated us about what Iraqi society was like before American intervention.  If that's a problem, and Moore says our ignorance is a problem, you'd expect Moore to try to address it.  No attempt is made.  Perhaps he doesn't trust us to make up our own minds.  Maybe he thinks Americans have been kept fully in the dark about their negative impact on other countries and cannot be trusted to hear anything else right now, even if hearing other things would help make an emotional connection between Americans and Iraqis.  Perhaps he doesn't feel the oppression in Iraq was really something worth looking at right now.  Any of these attitudes is a serious problem, and would be in any individual.  All the more is that true for someone who calls his films documentaries, and who does call in his films for compassion.And there are many inconsistencies here.  Fahrenheit is very respectful towards the horror of the 9-11 attacks, but it uses the attack on the Pentagon as a sight gag, despite the fact that a third of the people who died were civilians on an airplane.  He has said this about the Lila Lipscombs of our country: ""I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end.""  Finally, Moore has publicly excoriated U.S. support of Israel, yet he says nothing about Israel in Fahrenheit, presumably because he did not want to lose the large Jewish vote on the left when it came time to unseat Bush.  No doubt, too, since he wants to paint U.S. foreign policy as being in Saudi Arabia's pocket, he doesn't want to analyze how that nation, besides rarely agreeing with Israel on anything, actually opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Nevertheless, it's a strange issue to omit, because U.S. support for Israel is widely reviled in the Middle East; it's something that Americans do need to look at; and talking about it would be a great way to indict Bush.  Moore attacks Bush, his personality and his politics, in every possible way, but says nothing about Israel, a country right at the heart of Middle East violence.As noted, both fans and critics agree that the movie is not objective.  Fans of Fahrenheit 911, and even some critics, often say that it wasn't meant to be ""that kind of movie.""  The fans say that it was meant to show the side of things which runs against the mainstream, and if it doesn't attempt anything else, so what?  But then why call it a documentary?  If a movie known as a documentary raises questions about whether, for instance, the film-maker is playing fast and loose with the documents or the material he is trying to document, then the movie is ""that kind of movie.""  Any movie purporting to be factual is going to call up such questions as whether facts were documented and presented in context, and whether there was misleading or deceit going on.  So why is the movie's lack of objectivity said to be a non-issue?  That attitude is a serious problem.  What it really says is that the question of deception is not so important as the question of who will sit in the White House, or in this case, the objective of unseating Bush.  The lesson being taught here, whether fans of the movie are aware of it or not, is that truth is not so important as political victory.  I am fully convinced that this is the attitude that got us into war in the first place, and is no way to avoid future wars.Michael Moore is a dragon-slayer, not in the traditional sense of someone who might actually be doing something good, but in the contemporary sense of someone who is willing to deceive (by careful selection and omission) in order to get his man."	2.0	Michael Moore, dragon-slayer	2005-03-27	22	11	11
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	APNREOIST2E5C	"kgrossmann ""kgrossmann"""	"I'm both impressed and agitated, but indecisive though. What is really the truth? Moore's mockumentary is thought-provoking and gives the impression that it depicts the stifled and hidden truth. But we've learned to be critical of any  documentary that uses propaganda-like means - and Michael undoubtedly does employ rhetorical devices that has (used in any other topic, notably with evil intentions) the potential to short-circuit balanced reasoning and which is predominantly emotional. Not that Michael has any vicious in mind, not at all, quite the contrary.On the other hand, Michael Moore has never denied that he is not polemic and doesn't harness emotional propaganda-like material. And he has never denied that his documentation style is in part unbalanced and unfair. It seems he has come to the insight that this is the only way to raise awareness and to give some parts of American society a wake-up call. For the European audience, predominantly accustomed to think critically of the United State's warfare under G. W. Bush, of any warfare and patriotic militarism whatsoever, it seems a little too much. From the perspective of an American journalist and filmmaker it might be the legitimate way to depict grievances and clear things up, that would otherwise be falsified and sifted out by the mass media, courtesy of the U.S. administration and its alleged lobbyists.Intermittently some scenes struck me slightly questionable. We don't know what George W. Bush was really thinking when he learned terrorists have attacked the Unites States - and we don't know how other politicians would have looked in this situation - not even Barack Obama. In this case, Michael is toying with speculations, not with facts. Nevertheless, as mentioned, may it be legitimate facing the atrocities following the attacks.Very riveting and revealing was the quote of George Orwell book ""Nineteen-Eighty-Four"", expounding the function of warfare for a modern society. And it was daring as well.In conclusion and maybe a little surprising, but assuredly not as a u-turn I daresay: Time has told and proved that this movie was an overdue antidote against the treacherous, fraudulent warfare propaganda spread by the American government in those years.

True, he sometimes draws a bit far-fetched conclusions on pretty loose facts, but rather than dismissing the film as propaganda, we should take this as an encouragement to think for ourselves! Beliefs that cannot be questioned are not beliefs, they are myths. From my point of view, Michael Moore has made a brilliant documentary, which despite some far-fetched ideas essentially comes down to be just so true. In this fantastic world of precision bombing, war seems to be just another videogame.

Most of the material in this film is very truthful (the Iraq war, George Bush's entanglement with the Saudi Arabian government, among other things), and yet some material is false and i thought didnt need to be included in the film. Also, there is the funny and sarcastic material that had falling out of my seat.I was deeply disturbed by a few scenes in this movie (particularly the scene of Baghdad's citzen's being slaughtered by the american forces, the scenes which showed the desecration of those two american bodies) and a few were just kind of stupid (the interview of the woman who lost her son, who was aboard the black hawks that went down), and a few were very insightful, which revealed things i never knew about the Iraq war and the actions of George W Bush.Anyway, I think this movie is a must-see for everyone.	4.0	Very insightful, but can be stretched	2004-10-30	8	2	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A6ADO7B6FUVN	"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org"""	The title of Fahrenheit 9/11 uses the title of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel where the firefighter's job is to burn books and Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper begins to burns.  The activist and filmmaker Michael Moore happens to get in trouble with Bradbury as he used the title, but Moore used the title in respect of Bradbury.Fahrenheit 9/11 won the Golden Palm in Cannes 2004, which began a long road of controversy as Disney refused to release it, but later it was released by Lions Gate.  The Republican side of America loathes the film while Democrats admire the craftsmanship of Moore as it goes into lengthy detail to reveal President Bush's involvement with the Bin Laden's and the war in Iraq.  The controversy around the film brought more attention to the film as it helped the film break box office records as a documentary.The film focuses on President Bush as Michael Moore is displaying his view of the United States presidency through like minded people.  Moore does this with strong conviction as these people that he displays have become targets to the big presidential machine by ways which include tools such as the Patriot Act, decisions made in regards to the war in Iraq, and family's that have lost loved ones in the Iraq war.  The notion becomes evident as the film unfolds, that it is Moore's desire to oust the current president of United States of America because of his decisions.Whatever political affiliation the audience has all around the world Fahrenheit 9/11 will affect all viewers.  The personal experience of the film will either be positive or negative and this will heavily depend on socioeconomic background, upbringing, and beliefs of the audience.  Whatever the outcome, people should cherish and protect the freedom, without being persecuted in any way, that one has to make a film such as Fahrenheit 9/11, because in a society, e.g., Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the film would have never been made.	4.0	Moore Brings Political Controversy to the Box Office...	2004-10-28	27	18	9

Fahrenheit 9/11 is an exhaustive collection of snippets of interviews, speeches, war footage, and news reports that cohesively serve one purpose - to convince moviegoers that Bush has got to go.  I can honestly say that very few movies have impacted me as much as Fahrenheit 9/11 (another movie to consider watching is Afghanistan's first movie after the fall of the Taliban named ""Osama"").  However, Fahrenheit does not come without its fair share of faults.  I found the filmto be closed-minded, and I felt that some of the facts/events/speeches were taken out of context.  Yet, its only natural that Michael Moore does that.  Moreover, I felt that Moore was trying to denounce Saudi Arabia because they ""owned 6-7% of America.""  He criticizes the Bush regime for their pampering of the Saudi Arabian ambassador in order to propagate that Bush was after oil and resources.  Yet, Moore (perhaps unknowingly) shows that he's hypocritical because he denounces America's cruel actions in the Middle East while he himself denounces the economic activities of Saudi Arabia.  Aside from these flaws, the film's power of influence never ceases to amaze me.  Critics of the film will find that Moore's film is no better than the Bush regime in terms of brainwashing.  However, one cannot argue that the numerous true facts presented in Moore's movie campaign speak for themselves."	5.0	4.5 Stars (Powerful Movie with Minor Flaws)	2004-07-03	13	6	7

From Lila Lipscomb, a proud military mom, who lost her son in the war to the streets of Iraq where shell shocked parents carry their mortally wounded children in search of medical care. In light of the current information that Iraq was not responsible for 9/11, had no WMDs and was at least a decade away from reconstituting a formidable weapons program makes this even more tragic. The fact that our current administration still contends it would have done ""exactly the same thing"" underscores the need to vote these guys out of the White House on November 2.

Or, as one reviewer has claimed, this is shock value without purpose, place, or reason is somewhat naive.The film is a work of genius. Fantastic, visionary, apocalyptic.Micheal Moore displays the carnivalesque workings of the body to the full. Where others have chosen to shy away, Moore explores every crevice of the grotesque, literally dissecting it to its corporeal elements to discover just exactly where are heads are at. The dead body is central to the film. Typical outdated stereotypes of the human mind, and indeed of America, are discarded along with the decaying flesh. Namely, preoccupations with politeness, taste, manners, and rational, institutional values are laughed at and abused. These things, along with sexual life, eating, drinking, and defecation have radically changed their meaning.The film is made in a time where America and its people are questioning and trying to define themselves. The warm closed insular security of the American economic womb has been violently ruptured. Jobs and moral values are no longer stable in modern-day America. Just exactly does it mean to be American? A number of middle-eastern influences confuse the cultural collage that the USA in a time where not many things are stable. Boundaries that did exist are no longer there. Being polite, reserved and rational with a nice institution to support you is no longer America.And this is where Moore comes in. Moore explores boundaries and then seeks to subvert them. Sexual boundaries do not exist. One is free to have sex with one's daughter or drink the breast-milk from your wife because there is no where to stop when there are no borders. By pushing the boundaries and bringing them to the fore, Moore questions what exactly makes us tick. Where are we when there is no one to define us? We may have the trappings of civilized beings, but we are after all bestial.The home video camera work gives the film a haunting sense of reality and naturalness to what was previously considered to be unnatural. The dark sense of humour permeating through this real texture transcends this film from generic classification.

You didn't like the humours because of the sympathy you have for your president, but you can not deny that it is grotesque that a president do not move an inch when it's being said he's country is under attack (the school scene).Mr Moore has this talent for him: he tells with humour what others do not whish to hear, and exposes serious matter with solid arguments.This movie won the best image price in Cannes (and not the ""palm d'or"" as someone said).The precedent reviewer say that it's as treasonous as could be to picture the president as a ""bumbling idiot, but at the same time, want him to be a diabolical genius capable of orchestrating 9/11"".No, Mr Bush didn't orchestrate 9/11. What he did was much much more subtle, and that is what you can understand if you carefully watch Mr Moore's film. Watch it 2 times, so that the shock of images from the 1st time fades away and you can focus on the real, deeper content.The subtleties are all the intricate felony of the war business (which is a fact), and relationships with whealthy people in order to serve his own interests, and much more.Fact: Mr G.W. Bush is elected president, he played clever, but not very fair.Fact: Mr G.W.Bush attacks Iraq under the pretext it has weapons of mass desturction: this is clever to serve his own interest (not those of America or those of the soldiers), but the argument is wrong.Fact: Mr GW Bush new argument for the invasion of Iraq is to free its people. Where did the first argument go?Fact: Mr GW Bush seeks democracy and peace in our world.Democracy? What about protecting Taiwan and order to invade China who claims Taiwan to be its own and who has 100s of missiles pointed toward it? Peace? Why then invading a country using fallacious pretexts?Fact: Mr GW Bush reads a story at a school at the time when he's being told his country is under attack. That is not clever.From these facts, draw your own opinion about Mr GW Bush being both a joker and a genious, but be honest, even if it's not a confortable idea especially for those who voted for him and still trust him.And these, you can learn it from this movie.Note: I'm not american but like this country and am concerned about what its president is doing to the world (including its own people)."	5.0	Open your eyes	2006-06-14	11	7	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1YQT36IR92UO8	Lalo	This documentary is an excellent example of what makes our country great. It is freedom of speech and the liberty to differ and dissent that formed our country in the first place. Agree or disagree, to say that Moore's film should be censored or banned strikes at the very bedrock of our country.This film scares people, it scares the people currently in power and it scares the hell out of their bamboozled lackeys. It does what the corporate media is too spineless to do, expose truth about 9/11, using mainly news footage of the people in question.It's implications are sobering and have potentially far-reaching consequences.Bravo Michael Moore, thank you for showing us freedom of speech in action and for taking the fire that the majority of us are too scared to take. One day we will hail you as a hero. We are all just too conquered in spirit and mind to do that just yet. We are not quite at the level of maturity that values truth above arrogant bullying or understanding over being reactionary.But I have hope we will one day.	5.0	Freedom Of Speech 101	2004-08-05	55	46	9

Even if this movie were billed as a fictional account (it is billed as a documentary) of Michael Moore's vision of President Bush, it was a poorly made film.  It is a film that tries to argue a point of view but yet doesn't quite know how.  It makes random points without establishing any connection from one point to another.  Not only was this poor film making, the filmmaker flat out lied to it's viewers.  Is America this gullible?  I have a hard time believing that Americans could buy into this garbage.  Not only are the filmmaker's arguments random and pointless but they are made up, misconstrued, and false.  I strongly urge anyone who has seen this film to watch another film title FarenHYPE9/11.  Michael Moore is a liar.  From the beginning of the film to the end, he lies.  I have never voted for a republican president in my life, but after viewing this propaganda garbage, this November may be my first vote for a republican.  SEE FarenHYPE9/11.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"In former days, that is to say ""once upon a time,"" the greatest coup in politics was to run an attack ad once and get all of the network news shows to run it over and over again for free.  This has been true from the infamous ""Daisy"" commercial that was run for Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the even more infamous ""Willie Horton"" ad that was used to attack Michael Dukakis on behalf of George Bush in 1988.  But that standard has changed now with Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  As of the last box office report, this documentary has made $119,078,393 in the United States, which does not include the take from other nations or the number of DVDs and videotapes that have been bought.  In other words, Moore has not only created a 2-hour political attack ad against President George W. Bush, he is getting millions of people to PAY him to see it.  Then again, President Bush has an entire new network behind his candidacy with FOX News, so you can also argue that Moore is behind the times rather than ahead.I fully understand that this being a Michael Moore documentary indicting George W. Bush for the War in Iraq is enough for most people to make up their minds about it, but I still think everybody, regardless of ideological persuasion, should see it before they bury or praise ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  I also do not want to get into the maelstrom around the documentary and restrict this review to just what I saw when I watched it this morning.  Yes, it is a political diatribe and like any political statement during an election cycle (the battle lasts longer than a year) it is filled with distortions, omissions, lies, and every other sin associated with political rhetoric.  But we know that the judgment for such things is not whether they are ""true"" but whether they are ""real"" enough to make a difference.Ultimately I found ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was a bit too disjointed in constructing the coherent argument it appears to be actually making in the end.  Just like is the case with most of the papers I get from my students, the true thesis comes near the end when Moore contends that we should never send our troops into harm's way without knowing they are fighting for the right reasons.  That particular point is implicit at best for a lot of the film and you have to retroactively go back and connect the dots.  The reasons why the war is wrong in the first part of the film are not the same reasons that are offered at the end.  I am sure Moore abstains from providing a linear argument as part of the creative impulse, but I think there was one to be advanced here that would better serve his purpose.Some of the most affecting parts of the documentary speak to things that transcend this specific war.  Pictures of dead and wounded children are always going to be upsetting (add the long distance shot of a beheading and the charred corpses of Americans being dragged through the streets in Iraq and the R rating is easily justified).  American soldiers are always going to be too young to go off to war and kill or be killed.  Politicians are never going to want it to be their children who go off to die in the wars they vote to authorize.  I thought Moore trying to get Congressmen to sign up their kids to go fight the war was the lamest part of the film, partially because you know it is not going to happen and also because the technique has been done to death on ""60 Minutes"" and all of its kindred news magazines.  Nor does the idea that young American troops get psyched up by playing obnoxious heavy metal songs offend me because I have long understood that soldiers will do what they have to do to get through a battle.In terms of what is happening in Iraq since the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner was put up on that aircraft carrier to be seen behind Bush when he declared victory, Moore decided slants everything towards what American troops are doing to outrage the ordinary Iraqi citizens who are supposed to be overjoyed by being freed.  However, I think Moore missed a potent line of argument by becoming fixated on the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner instead of Bush's invitation to the insurgents to ""Bring it on,"" which I think is clearly the most regrettable thing the President has said while in office.  All of this just underscores that the ""war,"" however you want to conceive it, is obviously much more complex than can dealt with even in a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour including all of the extras on the DVD, the best of which are the comments and jokes of the Arab-American comedians).His techniques are no different from what we are seeing in the relentless onslaught of paid political advertising.  The parody of the title credits for ""Bonanza"" redone for ""Afghanistan"" is good for a laugh and any politician or ordinary human being having make up put on them before appearing on camera is going to look like an idiot.  I was thinking that combining slow motion shots with ominous music and an equally ominous voice over would do to Jesus of Nazareth (""""Render unto God the things that are God's'?....another religious fanatic from the Middle East..."").  The most persuasive person in the film for me and I suspect for many is Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a Flint, Michigan boy who dies in Iraq when a Blackhawk helicopter is downed.  A lifelong supporter of the American military, she changes her mind about Iraq, haunted by not only her son's death but also his last letter in which he lashed out at Bush and the war.  In the end it is impossible to tar her with the same brush that can be used to castigate Moore for his political polemic.In terms of being provocative there is no doubt Moore has clearly achieved his goal.  The question is whether he is actually persuading a significant number of people to adopt his view or whether he is simply preaching (and selling) to the choir.  Ironically, we will probably no more know the answer to that question than he ever will the real reasons for the decision to invade Iraq."	4.0	Michael Moore's two-hour political message plays for pay	2004-10-11	56	34	22

The film appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections.How come the Bush administration lowered taxes AND went to war in Iraq?  Just something to think about.

This is exactly what Michael Moore does with the tools of film and cinema. What was presented visually was common knowledge to those of us who choose to be inform and was consistent with The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include; Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265 After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, continuing to read with the children. Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 35, 38-39. Bush failed to have even one meeting to discuss the threat of terrorism with his head of counterterrorism Richard Clarke. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 201. Bush failed to react to the August 6, 2001 security briefing, ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 260-262. 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country after September 13. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 556, n. 25 [Note that Fahrenheit 9/11 understates the number of Saudis who left.] Individuals were interviewed by the FBI before being allowed to leave (although the report confirms that most individuals on these flights were not interviewed.) Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 557, n. 28. White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329. It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including: What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government? Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: ""At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections."" Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who ""was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth"" (WAMY), which the FBI has described as ""a suspected terrorist organization,"" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that ""has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush.

It is propaganda, to be sure, but it is honest and sincere propaganda. I have yet to see a credible and factually accurate rebuttal in the legitimate media. There is no need to defend this film; it stands on its own. Truth has a way of emerging from under the pile of right wing feces hurled at it. Time will demonstrate the validity of the claims made in the movie.Knowing the truth requires more than just listening to the spin of your favorite pundit. I have read over sixty books regarding this administration, both on the left and the right.I vociferously watch all broadcast media, including, but not limited to, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, and the major networks. My conclusions regarding this administration are a result of my analysis based on the evidence available to me.What I have seen from the right wing concerning this film is fear. What are conservatives scared of? It appears that with the absence of the Soviet Union as an adversary, our paranoia has made us fabricate a new enemy.There are 18,000 Al Qaeda terrorists WORLDWIDE, operating on an annual budget of 10 million dollars. Because they are so small, they will occasionally succeed against overwhelming opposition. They WILL attack again. This is a given. However, I am not frightened of my own mortality. If a terrorist kills me, so be it. However, I would be willing to wager my life's earnings against this possibility. To say such a scenario is a remote possibility is an understatement.It is perfectly natural to fear that which you are ignorant of, or challenges your belief system. Truth is scary. To recognize it requires reasoning and an ability to accept ideas that may be contrary to your own. You must have the intelligence and flexibility to be able to modify your point of view if the facts change. Being resolute is functionally useless if you make bad judgements and are not willing to modify your outlook as facts change.Michael Moore, and the rest of us ""left wingnuts"" were not waiting in the bushes to ambush the president. In fact, we were reluctantly brought into this arena due to the poor judgements, deceptions, and outright lies foisted upon us by an arrogant leader to whom the average American is beneath contempt. Record deficits, a net shrinking of the American workforce, the collapse of our booming economy, and the spread of fear and ignorance; this is George W. Bush's legacy. Tell my daughter as she spends the rest of her life paying off the incredible deficit this charlatan has foisted on our children, and their children. When poor leadership decisions destabilize the world and take away everything you have worked for and believed in, then it becomes your patriotic duty to defend and protect those basic rights that separate Americans from lesser primates. Today, many career professionals have seen their industries crumble through no fault of their own. The administration's answer? Go back to community college. Tell that to people with advanced degrees, whose jobs have migrated overseas. Tell that to any one 50 years old or older. Some of us don't like shopping (or working) at Wal*Mart, or being thrown a bone by our leaders.Respect of the presidency is not a given; like any public servant, the president must earn the respect of his employer, the people of America. If he is doing a poor job, making bad decisions, using poor judgement, and killing Americans in a war based on premises now conclusively proven by the president's own appointee, Charles Duelfer, to be totally false, then he should be fired. He must show respect to the American people, not arrogance. He must perform to a certain standard. Make no mistake, he is not a king; he works for you, he works for me. We pay his salary, and he must be accountable to us, ALL OF US, not just his base.This is why Michael Moore does what he does, and why ""liberal"" America feels as it does. This administration must be torn down if America is to endure; we can do better and we will do better."	5.0	Not for people in denial, nor for right wing idealogues.	2004-10-14	37	24	13

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	I was prepared to be critical of this sell-out film. I?ve seen Michael Moore's other films and I know he distorts things to his own agenda. He seems to be a bit of a bully. And I don?t like the fact that he?s going around the world bad-mouthing America.Yet, I'm concerned about the future of my beloved country. I sense deeply that George Bush and his administration have messed things up. There has to be a change in leadership. And this intrusive filmmaker looks like a catalyst to make that happen.Mr. Moore knows his craft well. He knows how to select just the perfect film clips that will make his subject look ridiculous. His background music makes us laugh. And his voice-over commentary is cutting and sarcastic. There are also images of horror, such as the victims of war with devastating wounds. He?s kind to the American soldiers though. They?re victims too and we meet the double amputees who are languishing in hospitals and not getting their proper benefits.The central theme of the film, however, is the tremendous wealth that the Bush family and other corporate executives are acquiring because of their ties to the Saudis. He makes our country look like a war machine with nothing but profits on its mind. Mr. Moore has first-hand experience the result of corporate greed in his hometown of Flint Michigan as he illustrated many years ago in his film ?Roger and Me?. And, indeed, he returns to Flint again in this film. Here, like other depressed area of the country, the military is a way out of poverty. We meet a woman whose son is in Iraq. She?s a proud American and even flies an American flag outside her family?s modest house every single day. Some time during the filming, her son is killed. The war now become up close and personal as we all share her grief.I did expect this film would manipulate my emotions. I wanted to resist and watch the film from a point of rationality. That was impossible though. I got caught up in the frenzy of Mr. Moore?s mission, which is to bring down the Bush administration. And at the end of the film I was applauding loudly with the rest of the audience.I know that this film had a hard time getting released and this just adds to the hype and publicity about it. And, in a way it is truly an American story. Because only in America would anyone dare to do this kind of hatchet job on the President. In other countries, Mr. Moore would have had his tongue cut out, or worse.This is an important film. See it. Think about it. Talk about it. And understand.Highly recommended. Don?t miss it.	5.0	An important film to see, think about and talk about	2004-07-22	195	142	53
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2ACTAIKVAP5KY	Lissa Parker	Michael Moore is a hero to me, and to many other college students who are already cynical about American politics. He is truly a patriot. I would not disagree with anyone who called this film propoganda, but it's incredibly high-quality, thought-provoking propoganda. Moore's objective is obviously to paint the most unflattering portrait of Bush possible. For example, by using numerous clips of Bush lounging at his ranch, sipping beer, always looking unpresidential. But Moore does shed light on the truth in many ways and continues to amaze his fans with his boldness and his willingness to explore the most unsettling aspects of our country.Seeing Moore at the Republican National Convention made me so happy! This is proof that he Moore is a true journalist; he can get anywhere. He will do anything to expose the lies of the Republican party and to fight on behalf of average Americans.	5.0	best movie of all time, brilliant director	2004-09-06	43	36	7
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1JJ8R0NTMF8DE	Little Old Me	"Fahrenheit 9/11 was my introduction to the works of Michael Moore - and what an introduction at that!  I was a little hesitant to attend the movie at first, thinking Moore's documentary would be simply preaching to the choir.  After all, I find most of us are completely divided down the middle - we are either supporting the war and its ideals OR are completely against it.  I've met very people who are truly lost in between.  But after 2 hours, I was convinced that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an essential American movie right now and plainly delivers some hard facts that the White House has censored since Bush's inauguration.Michael Moore makes the ideal narrator, able to describe countless layers of information in plain English.  Personally, I've found myself dumbfounded with countless articles and news reports that are constantly delivering conflicting information.  Moore plainly goes through each layer of deceit, without fully stepping into conspiracy theories.  Though many extremists would like us to believe that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were completely staged by the government, Moore doesn't fall into that category.  He shows us how plainly September 11th was the product of Bush's negligence.Moore's documentary succeeds in putting raw facts out in the public eye and showing how each of them (while alone seem insignificant) result in a chain reaction.  Someone who has never followed politics can see step-by-step how an election could have been ""fixed"" and how statements by the White House officials have changed in a moments notice.  As Moore points out, one minute we're told to be on high-terrorist alert and to take all necessary precautions and the very next message is for us to go about our normal lives and still patronize restaurants and shopping centers without any fear.  *Sigh*  One thing, I found most disturbing was seeing how connected the Bush family is with the Bin Laden family.  Again, Moore doesn't try and point out a conspiracy theory here, but when the Bush Jr., Bush Sr. and many of their colleagues are making millions of dollars in profits because of this business relationship, it kind of makes you wonder why the all the Saudi Arabians were allowed to leave the country without be questioned.  An interview with one of the people involved int he Sept. 11th investigations even said, we were not there to point the fingers or make arrests, but its common practice to interrogate family members and friends of a suspect (i.e. Osama Bin Laden).One of the hardest moments are sneak peaks into the war.  Actual testimonies from American soliders and their parents, including snippets of personal letters from Iraq that are usually censored before they even reach the families at home.  But don't be mistaken, the movie doesn't argue against all war, but directly shows how this one was mishandled and was used to protect the Bush Family's personal investments over the lives of every-day Americans.I'll be honest, I don't agree with every detail in Fahrenheit 9/11, but as a whole, there's a lot of truth that has escaped the public's attention.  The true message of the movie is: we have been fooled, lied to, used and abused by a very strong network of political figures and greedy corporate heads.  We can't undo what has already been done, but we can prevent this from happening again!Give Michael Moore a try - if anything, you'll see a whole new side to an already messy situation.  In troubled times, we need all the information we can get to make the right decisions.  Well, take it right from the skeptic's mouth, this movie has got a lot of really important information."	5.0	Revealing the Layers of Deceit	2004-07-09	29	24	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2OKR38QVJVL8R	L. Lopez	Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a movie, nor is it a documentary. It is a tediously long political ad posing as a movie. It is 100% a 'Bush bashing', obviously designed to aid the Democratic party in regaining the White House. As a registered voter who votes for the person and the platform, not for the party, I am thoroughly disgusted with this blatant effort to depict our President as a conniving, evil person who, according to this political ad, premeditated the attack against the United States; provided no aid whatsoever to the survivors of those killed; premeditated the war in Afghanistan; and now the war in Iraq.  According to Fahrenheit 9/11, he did all thisfor money (as if he needed any). I am sickened to know that many thousands of voters in this country, who vote based on emotion, good looks, charisma, etc., will take the infomation contained in this political ad as totally factual, without even questioning the veracity of the information presented. Incidentally... I would like to know who paid the bill for the research the 'movie maker' did, as well as the costs involved in obtaining the various news clips, both public and private, and the production of the so-called movie.  Could it have been the Democratic party???In ending I would just like to say this:The Democratic Party must not feel very confident that the inept candidate they have put forward for the office of President Of The United States is capable of carrying the election.What other possible reason could there be for such a disgusting political ad as Fahrenheit 9/11????	1.0	Blatant Abuse Of Entertainment Media	2004-07-27	28	11	17
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	"When Farenheit 9-11 first came out, I was not emotionally ready to see this film.  I was afraid it would bring back the trauma I felt in 2001.  I had visited the World Trade Center as a child and a teen.  New York City was one of my favorite places to visit.  I went there about twelve times before I turned 18.  I finally decided that I would never really be ready, so I decided to watch it.Moore devotes very little screen time to the day of 9-11, having only a minute of audio and another few minutes of stunned N.Y.C. passersby and a shot of the missing persons' wall.  In a way I was both disappointed and relieved.  I did want to see that day from Moore's perpective, but then again, why relive the images we all saw that day and for days after?  I was not traumatized, but I was deeply disturbed - for political reasons.Michael Moore's Farenheit 9-11 is unquestionably anti-Bush and biased.  But Moore's evidence of conspiracy-like connections between the Texas Bush family and the Al Saud royal family of Saudi Arabia is brilliant.  The volume and scope of Moore's research is staggering.Saudi Arabia is one of the most controlled and restrictive countries in the world.  The government follows a fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam that no other country adheres to.  The U.S. State Department says in their Human Rights report that Saudi Arabia is guilty of torture, violence towards women and children, and throwing people into prison for circulating petitions.So disturbing is the fact Bush allowed all of the Bin Ladens in the U.S. to flee the country two days after the disaster, without letting law enforcement question the family members.The Saudi-Bush connection is not the only target of Moore.  He targets the military for actively recruiting young, poor minorities in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Moore also interviews some troops who have deep reservations about the war and about their commander-in-chief.In the beginning of the documentary, the botched Florida election results and the plea of African-Americans to the U.S. Senate brings shame on George W. Bush and the Senate.  Moore portrays Bush as a yokel, but a sly one, with vast power and connections that seem to make him unstoppable.I am incredulous that even after Farenheit 9-11 was such a big smash at the box office, that Bush was re-elected.  After we viewed the film, my husband said, ""Bush has no conscience.""  Isn't that a scary thing to say about your president?  But after seeing this film, it is the logical conclusion."	4.0	Farenheit 9-11 Burns	2005-03-28	27	12	15
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3K448HPOG6QXY	"""lnoonl"""	"Michael Moore should get more work after this movie, or at least the offer of more, especially for editing.  He's good.  He knows , just as many actors have to do for their trade, how to invoke an emotion.  That's why we pay to go see a movie.  To get our endorphins runnin' around and get that natural high going.  So he did a good job at this, and appears to have gotten a lot of people sparked up with elated emotions.  All good movies can do that.  That's why we take the time to get online or on the phone and share our experience.That's why I gave it 2 stars.  Because he did good in that area.  Because it invoked an emotion.He also distorted the truth. Because, in a very large part, this movie is affecting  millions of people to a degree that they viewed this almost soley as a documentary.  I don't think a view of wounded and dead Iraqi children followed by U.S. soldiers exclaming what a rush it is to fight a war is telling a documentary.  It's invoking an emotion the filmaker wants you to have.  Fighting a war, conflict,etc. (give it whatever name you want), is not edited, it's not something you see in your daily lives unless you are THERE.  If you want to take this film and others like it (Monster is one...great movie, I had tears in my eyes, and I also researched this too and found a lot that the movie takes great freedom not to tell you(will part of this be edited out?)) as telling the truth in 2 hours, that's your right.  To push that view to others by not researching it is your right too.  For other's to believe this view is their right.  And people are going to disagree...some who have not researched it, and others who have.  I have read about a dozen of the reviews.  And with the  exception of one (partially), they viewed this with great awe and adimiration to the point of believing what this movie had to say was truth and nothing but a true documentary; this lends creedence to me that people will jump on anything to keep that invoked emotion going because they will not accept truth.The truth I see, that I have researched, is:  This was an exceptionally edited, well filmed movie.It's also a personal attack on George Bush by Michael Moore.Regarless how many people Michael says supports his same or similar views  both before and after the movie was made, this movie is pretty much that.  He hates Bush.  So much so that the truth is clouded up on what's really happening.  And what is really happening is not a movie that many people are duping themselves about; it's about getting up off your couch, out of the establishments you frequent to get the ""word"" of other people you like, and look up the truth.  It requires some time.  But I would rather have an informed opinion, which I do have here, than to declare something to be true because of emotions governing me.  That makes me human.  It makes me intelligent.  It makes me know myself.  And, emotionally,""I like that"".I ""feel"" people reading this review will get an emotion from that last line.

The topic of this film isn't fiction. We are a nation at war. September 11th was not a dream. As American citizens we must review ALL sides before drawing any conclusions. With Moore's film, we as the American public get to see a side of these travesties not covered by the media. (...) There was too much footage of September 11th and the present War in Iraq of the dying soldiers, wounded soldiers, Iraqi women and children, and families from both Iraq and America. If you laughed, that's disgusting because no matter how you feel about Bush, you have to give those people some respect. A good friend of mine is presently serving in Iraq. She's 27 and has 2 children. She also 3 siblings also in the military and 2 of which are also in Iraq. This is a REAL war for some of us and I encourage everyone to please keep an open mind when watching this film. I did subtract a star in my rating simply because I did feel that Michael Moore did unnecessarily bash Bush in a couple of moments by taking what he said out of context. I'm not even a Bush supporter and I will admit to that. I also think to some more easily influenced, it will give a false impression that Bush is somehow in favor of this war for profit or just trying to cover his own butt. I don't buy that at all. I really think HE believes he's doing the right thing for the better cause of the USA and for the rest of the world, but just because he thinks he's right, doesn't make him right.I think many people oppose this film because they are afraid of not necessarily the ""truth"" but because it WILL make you think. We're used to being told what we should think and when you watch this film, even if you still support Bush in the end, I know that for at least a moment, you WILL question what's going on in this country. It obviously impacted enough people to come on here and write a review. It obviously impacted enough corporate  giants and politicians to try and steer the public from seeing this film.

I never read the reviews or the hype on either side, and I'm not a big fan of Moore's, so I had no preconceived notions about the film. I was surprised that his documentary didn't really focus on the events of September 11 other than to frame them as a pretext for invading Iraq, which any literate person knows by now as an irrefutable fact. I think Moore exploited 9/11 to market his movie, but I disagree that he would be averse to any conspiracy theories that suggest that 9/11 was an inside job. Who knows, maybe he's working on a new film to highlight the 9/11 Truth movement; if not, he should be.I remember watching ""Roger and Me"" on video back in the summer of 1994 that inspired a trip to Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan to see for myself the wasteland portrayed in his first (and perhaps most authentic) documentary. Moore uses some of the same techniques in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" that he used in ""Roger"": interviews with senior citizens, the disenfranchised poor, various authorities, and a family of military veterans, interspersed with comic relief in spoofs, pop music backdrops, and unflattering innuendo of his target. In ""Roger and Me"" it was Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors; in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" it's George W. Bush. Both are portrayed as avaricious, secretive demagogues oblivious to the plight of the common man. By all accounts, this is an accurate assessment.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is even more relevant now than it was in 2004 because of the subsequent release of the disappointing and disingenuous 9/11 Commission Report, and the surfeit of evidence that points to counterfeit intelligence and deliberate duplicity that led our nation to war. It's also more disturbing because the situation in Iraq is worse than it was two years ago, the death toll is rising, and there is no end in sight.Critics of the film have produced a rebuttal entitled, ""Fahrenhype 9/11,"" featuring conservative shills like Ann Coulter and Dick Morris, claiming to ""tell the truth about terrorism."" Director Alan Peterson's answer to Moore's award-winning film is utterly laughable in light of all we have learned in recent months about the so-called ""war on terror"" and the role of high level government conspirators who likely engineered the ultimate ""wag the dog"" scenario to launch their arrogant campaign of global domination. But, it's always enlightening to see both sides of the story, especially once you're informed. Unfortunately, ""Fahrenhype 9/11"" is already an anachronism, whereas ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" should be required viewing of any concerned citizen."	4.0	Required Viewing by Thoughtful People	2006-04-01	16	9	7

It may be the first film ever made that has a direct influence on an American election and on the outcome of a war.  For that, Moore deserves respect as a filmmaker, whether you agree or disagree with his message.I was surprised that the movie revealed nothing that most of us haven't heard before. The beauty of this film is that it outlines a damning scenario with a singularity of vision that is so clear, no one can miss it or even misunderstand it. In some ways Farenheit 9/11 reminded me of a campaign commercial on steriods.  It put the opponent in the worst possible light, avoided any nuance, and rarely gave voice to the opposing view.  But so what?  All meaningful documentaries have a point of view.  Many people condemn this film as propaganda, but what they are really saying is that they don't agree with its point of view.

We need something to balance out the frankly fascistic propaganda we see and hear everyday in the right wing media. Most talk radio shows are 10 times more indifferent to facts in the service of their agenda than is this well-made if slanted film. Truth is obscured far more outrageously every day by FoxNews than it is here by Moore.Besides, who really forms their social and political opinions based purely, or even primarily, on facts anyway? Facts are tools for justifying those opinions, views already formed emotionally and on a largely subconscious level, informed by upbringing and psychological makeup, not by a dispassionate review of unadorned facts.We're fighting a cultural and philosophical war in this country. Moore is a soldier. And he's on the side of the angels IMHP. If his selective focus and clever editing further the cause of stemming the tide of fascism, let him keep spinning away.Still, if you want unvarnished facts, here's one. Nearly 2 thousand American families have lost a child due to Bushs war. Almost 2 thousand young men and women, most just starting out on what could have been long and fruitful lives, are in the ground, their deaths studiously ignored by the administration.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A18AYRYL1TY8VP	LuelCanyon	Not much new can be said in praise of this superb film. I'm always struck by the beauty of  Jeff Gibbs' score. The successful use of other music, including Jarvo's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' and most of the pop elements, is indebted to the deeply felt original score Gibbs has created. Synth effects, maybe, but the pieces are beautifully conceived, if not entirely without precedent. The brutal effect of the film depends so tenderly on the musical score, one is reminded of Britten's high valuation of the usefulness of music. Moore's vision is commendable, and beholden in turn to the musical tableaux of Jeff Gibbs. The soundtrack CD is fine, but needs the film as much as the film cries out for Gibbs' music.  Highest recommendation for both film and musical score, both Moore and his composer. [2007 update: It's unfortunate, isnt it, how the conservative/fascist think tanks that blight the American social-political landscape actually hire people to scour [...], among other sites, in order to vote 'negative' on reviews that repudiate their vicious political agenda? This is a well documented fact. The 'votes' against this review are one example - negative 'votes' for what is really a non-political review of a film, a review focused almost entirely on the film's musical score! One can find this tactic throughout the amazon site. No matter. This is a great film that exposes Bush for the fraud he is, something the American public finally realized in 2006. Still, these cheap and honorless tactics are like food and drink to these people. What a comment on American life in our time. I gladly wear 22 'negative' votes like a badge of honor.  ~J.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A20UP6WWHZY1S2	"Luke Nuke ""Luke"""	"Moore goes for the gut (no pun intended) with a somewhat simplistic view of an extremely complex web of intrigue. It's simplistic in part because to delve into the details you might first want a degree in 20th Century geopolitics. It's simplistic also because many of the details are, frankly, unbelievable. If you watch the film, you'll learn about ""Bandar Bush,"" the Saudi prince who is treated like a member of the Bush family. And I don't know about you, but I never heard of ANY bin Laden before 9/11, so isn't it a strange coincidence that the Bush family had business dealings with the bin Ladens? Moore doesn't dig much deeper than that; however, if you care to do some reading elsewhere, you'll find that the details are even more incriminating. Not incriminating in the sense that George W. Bush knew in advance about 9/11, or that he caused it in some way, or even that he let Saudis leave. It's incriminating in the sense that over the course of history, actions have consequences (mostly unintended). And if you examine the interrelationships among the players in the Bush administration, you see very clearly the web of ideology, mistakes, and power that inexorably led us to where we are today. The chickens have come home to roost. Is any individual responsible or evil? No. But in a sense, our country itself is not the TARGET of ""evildoers."" It is in the crossfire. There's no way to explain all this in a movie review, so here's one factoid in the form of a question: Who's the highest ranking Afghan in the U.S. government? Zalmay Khalilzad. He works for Condi Rice on the National Security Council. He was one of the officials in the U.S. State Dept. who lobbied to arm the Muhajadeen with Stinger missiles against the Soviets. He was also a Unocal advisor in the 1990s working on risk analyses for an oil pipeline that was to traverse Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Muhajadeen was the forerunner of the Taliban, and Khalilzad supported the Taliban as a stabilizing force. Now don't get me wrong. I am not making any insinuations about evil intent or duplicity. I'm pointing out that this ""web of intrigue"" is very real. You can't dismiss it simply by calling Michael Moore a liar and that's that. We are now fighting the same people that individiuals in the Bush administration armed and supported. And we deposed a dictator who was our friend when it served our short-sighted interests. And the justification that you get from our leadership is that ""they hate our freedom"" and ""they hate our way of life."" It's not that simple. They hate specific things that have been done, and you should be shocked that these same people leading our country are so deeply entrenched in the roots of the conflict.

To be honest, I didn't actually want to see it again at first, because I had thought of the film primarily in connection with the 2004 election and was afraid it would remind me of how depressed I was when Bush remained in office in 2004.  However, I was really amazed when we did order and view the DVD recently to find out (three years later) how much Michael Moore could have said but refrained from saying.  By now, for example, it's abundantly clear that there is no ""free press"" any more. All media is owned by the corporations (it always was, of course, but now -- with Republican crippling of the FCC on things like the ""Fairness Doctrine"" and with the presidential debates becoming ""out-sourced"" to a private company instead of being run (as in the past) by the politically neutral League of Women Voters -- they've felt free to strangle anything resembling news completely, since they don't have to fear that they'll have to answer to the public during licensing hearings. (Remember those? We used to have regular renewal-of-license hearings for TV and radio stations protecting the public interest in the past, and citizens could show up and complain if they felt the networks weren't being truthful.  That -- as well as Congressional oversight -- all ended about the time Rupert Murdoch bought the Fox Network.)I had thought that I kept up with the news pretty well, but -- when we saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" again -- I was reminded of how surprised I was on first seeing it to find out about the protests made by the African-American congressmen about irregularities blocking the black vote during the 2000 election -- where was that broadcast on the national media? (Answer:  It wasn't.) Nor had I ever heard -- before viewing Moore's film -- about the protests that halted Bush's 2001 inaugural parade. Because of personal observation (i.e., the difference between what I saw out my window vs. what the media was saying was happening), I did know that the national media did not report the huge protests just before Bush started the war in Iraq, when millions of peaceful protesters filled the streets in most major cities in America as well as around the world.  That event was not reported in major American news media at all, or if it was mentioned at all the story was buried in the back pages.So -- I'm glad we have documentary filmmakers like Michael Moore to show us what American corporate media is NOT showing us.  If it weren't for the Internet, and for books and documentary filmmakers like Moore (whose publications and films we can find through new distribution channels like Amazon), we would have nothing like a free press at all anymore.  Take, for example, when V.P. Cheney got caught in a blatant lie -- such as vehemently insisting in an interview that he didn't ever say that Saddam Hussein was connected to Al Quaeda and the 9/11 attacks -- and then to have comedian Jon Stewart, on The Daily Show, run a film clip of Cheney saying precisely that ... That's all we have left that's close to ""truth-telling"" in the public media anymore.  YouTube is helpful for distributing clips like that, too.We desperately need Michael Moore -- and many others like him  -- to show us what's really going on out there.  When looking back at ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" it's amazing how much worse things actually were than even Moore said at the time the film came out.  We need an informed and alert citizenry to protect our country -- as well as for us to protect ourselves and our constitution.  Can anyone doubt (for example, with several recent Supreme Court rulings) that our Bill of Rights is under serious attack??So -- carry on, Michael Moore.  We need you, and your documentaries."	5.0	If not for this kind of documentary, there's no free press any more	2007-07-10	18	11	7

Having read extensively about most of the historical material, I really did not see much with which I was not familiar.  I was very grateful to Moore, however, for encapsulating this information into a 2 hour film and presenting it in a form which those unfamiliar with it could easily digest. I would have preferred that the entire film was an examination of the various connections between the Bush family, Arbusto/Harkin, Saudi Arabia, OBL, Halliburton, 9/11, etc.  If you are one of those for whom this information is completely unworthy of being seen because you will never believe there to be any connection (despite painstaking and extensive verification) then you should see the film and be pleasantly surprised that the whole film is NOT about these things.  On the other hand, if you are afraid that the very real words (on tape) of your own candidate will be used against him and his political allies, then do NOT see this film.

Why are they constantly on the news stations with the time and the newscrawl?  What purpose do they serve?  Does it make sense to ban toenail clippers on airplanes but allow butane lighters and matches?  Someone in a state of fear will agree to almost anything; someone in a state of fear told to do two contradictory things will just give up.  Cheney tells us to be on the alert, Bush tells us to go shopping. So the American public is terrorized, but it isn't by who you think.  And that's one of the many things Michael Moore reminds us in Fahrenheit 9/11.There is little here that hasn't been said, yet this may be the most important film of the year.  What Moore has done is skillfully weave a funny, tragic, and shocking tale out of a complicated series of claims and counterclaims.  Beginning with the 2000 election and the complete rollover of the Democrats during what was a silent coup, Moore reminds the viewer of everything that happened if only we had paid attention and gotten angry instead of fearful.There are two kinds of people who watch films like these: those who go in already agreeing with Moore, and those who haven't made their minds up.  (The third type, the ones who already ""know ""this film is full of bias, lies, and distortions, won't bother watching it at all.)  There's plenty of red meat for the liberals: Bush looking clueless when told of the second plane crash on 9/11 (and the 7 minutes he sat in an elementary school classroom, waiting to be told what to do); the Bush family's ties to the Saudi royal family and the surprising revelation that the Secret Service guards the Saudi embassy (but no others); the Fresno peace group full of cookie-baking fiftysomethings that was infiltrated by an undercover sheriff's deputy; the mom on the plane forced to drink her own breastmilk because it might be a weapon.But it's what's there for the fence sitters that's more important.  It's not just the War for Oil story; it's the contrast between Bush and his tuxedo-clad elites (who Bush jocularly refers to as his ""base"") and Moore's devastated hometown of Flint, Michigan.  (Longtime Moore fans will remember all Flint's woes from his seminar film Roger & Me, which chronicled the city's collapse when GM closed a huge auto plant.)  There in Flint, Moore follows two Army recruiters who attempt to sign up its unemployed youth, who clearly have nowhere else to go.  And from there, Moore lets Lila Lipscomb, a former welfare recipient who pulled herself up via job training, tell her story.  She encouraged her children to join the military because she had no money for college.  Her daughter served proudly in Desert Storm.  Her son went to Iraq, and his last letter home questioned why the troops were there.  The most powerful moment in a film chock full of them was Lila facing down an angry woman who accuses Moore of ""staging"" an Iraqi woman's makeshift shrine to her family members killed there.  Lila turns on her, revealing that her son was killed in Karbala on April 2nd, and then storms over to stare at the White House.  Armed snipers patrol the roof, and we are reminded of the mindless terror alerts that were not there to fight terrorists but to make us fearful.If you are not 100% convinced that Bush is absolutely right in all things, this is a film you must take the time to see.  You will be angry, you will laugh, and you will cry.  But all of these are far more cathartic than being afraid.  15 July 2004 Maddi Hausmann Sojourner"	5.0	Don't be afraid.  Be angry.

I think America has fallen from the great country it once was politically and socially, mainly due to 40 years of mediocre presidents and inept and venal politicians who care very little for the welfare of the American people and only about lining their own pockets. I don't see much reason to care at all anymore or to vote, which is too bad, since at one time I was quite patriotic and really loved this country. Sure, we have freedom and free speech, which is great, but sadly that hasn't prevented the country from still going to the dogs over the last several decades.I heard so much about this film, so I had to finally rent it. It's a decent film but I didn't find it as engrossing or interesting as it had been made out to be, but I will give him four stars for effort since, if all the allegations about the Bush family's ties to the Saudis and Bin Laden family are true, this needs to be said. But there's no doubt about Moore's central premise, that the U.S. is mostly in Iraq for oil and money. As Major General Smedley Butler said two generations ago, when the dollar gets tired of making 6% at home, it starts looking for ways to make 100% abroad, and the flag follows the money, and the soldiers follow the flag.Whether one is liberal or conservative or independent or whatever, it's time for the American people to take back their control of the political process from the special interests and politicians who have no other interest but their own.Actually, at this point, I would be happy to embrace with open arms a president of almost ANY political stripe as long as he had some geopolitical and economic smarts and at least had a coherent plan. I'm tired of the clueless office spaceholders we've had for almost 40 years. We used to have giants for presidents in the past, at least once in a while--Lincoln, a Teddy Rooseveldt, FDR, even Truman was pretty cool. Now we get pygmies 100% of the time. Only it's more like totally clueless and inept pygmies. At least a good pygmy knows how to shoot a blowgun.By the way, on the oil and money issue, most people don't know that many years ago, when Saddam was bombing the Kurds, Rumsfeld met with Saddam, long before he was Secretary, not to complain about his killing Kurds, but to negotiate an oil deal. The meeting was secret at the time but it eventually got out that he'd met with Saddam during this time. Guess what, Rumsfeld didn't say anything about the Kurds issue but we were concerned about getting a juicy oil contract.Oh well, that's all I have to say on this depressing issue of present America's moral, social, and economic decline (the current war expenses and deficit and high gas prices will likely cause inflation and serious economic consequences eventually. There's a reason why economics is called ""The dismal science""). I hope America eventually finds its moral compass and goes back to being the sort of great country it once was, but I doubt that will ever happen. Great countries don't just happen, they are built by great people working with great leaders.

One moment we find ourselves laughing or shaking our heads bemused by yet another Bush malapropism, the next moment outraged as Moore makes his case that the war was merely a way of finishing off what his father began in 1991 and as a way of enacting what many civil libertarians consider draconian limits on personal freedoms in the name of public safety. For me, the most poignant parts of the movie revolves around a woman from Flint Michigan who's children were serving in the military at the time of the Iraqi war. We watch unfold this mother's progression from a supporter of the President Bush and his war efforts to someone who, after being transformed through  tragedy, wholly rejects the President's case for the war in Iraq.The other perspective is from the observer who coldly examines the facts as they are presented. From this perspective, I have to give the movie a 4/5, not because it was not factual, but because Moore really doesn't contribute a great deal new to the story (save the personal stories of some of the people presented in the documentary). For example, I watched a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company) documentary on ""The Fifth Estate"" which detailed the family connections between the Bush's, Bin Laden's, and the Saudi Royal Family, a full year before ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" arrived in theatres. The same can be said of the BBC expose of the Florida election scandal; the BBC documentary came out only a few months after G.W. Bush became President. Rather, Moore re-packages this information, adds some human interest stories, and skilfully injects humour, to create a very good, though not entirely original in content,  documentary.Does this movie have an ideological slant? Certainly, and to expect otherwise would be unrealistic. Does Moore want Bush defeated in the next election? Absolutely, and to his credit he's said as such on numerous occasions. However, I would ask those individuals who have given this film a negative review to do one thing. If you say he's lying, please provide examples, as Mr. Moore has documented his claims. Unfortunately, I have yet to read a negative review which claims Moore is lying in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" to provide evidence to back up this claim."	5.0	An impressive effort by Mr. Moore	2004-08-29	32	24	8

It shows vividly how fragile the line between ""freedom"" and ""tyrany"" is (to quote Bush's best loved terms). Who has freedom? Who is the tyrant? Does the US Patriot Act protect the freedom of ordinary Americans? Why did the Bush go against the majority of the UN to go into Iraq? Why do so many Americans still believe the infamous ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" will still be found? Why do so many Americans still blindly follow a man like Bush, who most people outside the US despise (yes, including myself)?Michael Moore shows Bush at his worst, and shows why its so good not to be an American right now.The really scary thing about this movie is to read all the 1-star reviews here on Amazon. How can so many people be so blind to the truth? America is definately a great nation. What a pity it has evolved into what it is now."	5.0	The movie the world had to have	2005-10-02	20	16	4
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AQ87K9HZATRII	Marcus Twin	"I've never much liked Moore's work. It's usually clear that he's trying to make some point in his ""documentaries,"" but he never clearly states a point and defends it with evidence. He prefers to crash gates and rattle people and use the awkwardness of the situations to make the subjects look bad rather than arguing a point or smartly dissecting an issue.In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" however, Moore produces his most journalistic piece of work to date. Yes, there are plenty of moments in which he has injected his bias, his commentary. But there are plenty of facts -- evidence, anecdotes, quotations, records, first-person accounts, etc. You might not always agree with Moore's tone or how he has pieced together things, but you will be hard-pressed to challenge the facts he has presented in F911. And that's what it's all about, anyway -- putting forward more facts than are typically given by the mainstream media, who, quite frankly, are fearful of losing their access to the White House and who, like the general action-movie-going public, really do enjoy the excitement of explosions and battles and sexy news.Moore gives us more. And he does it in more than the 20 seconds you might get from TV news while not going overboard or muddying the waters with information that is not relevant to the core story. The core story is that that invasion of Iraq was not about Sept. 11. You're still left free to draw your own conclusions, too.Even when you do think Moore might have set someone up or taken something out of context, you still must remember that he uses multiple sources. OK, assume that the comments from the tank soldiers were stretched a little -- maybe a little out of context. Dismiss them entirely if you like, because they are just one example in a string of examples that Moore uses to show the humanity (or lack of humanity) with which the war was conducted -- in response to Rummy's on-the-record comments on the war's humaneness.Again, Moore gives you more than one example for every point he addresses. If you don't like one of the examples, there are plenty more. It doesn't make the whole work without merit. (Remember, it IS still a work designed with a message in mind. It's not totally neutral -- but then the movie itself even gives strong evidence to show that mainstream reporters are not reporting the war in a neutral matter.)So don't throw out the baby with the bathwater here. Recognize a fact when you see it. Dismiss the tone if you don't like it. But do think for yourself. Keep an open mind. I did, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things."	5.0	"Much better than the crap that was ""Bowling for Columbine"""	2005-01-10	21	13	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AUKQDHE7DDNA5	Maria Hornstein	Michael Moore has created a courageous film, giving an in-depth look at the connections between the Bush family and Saudi investors. Whereas any chief executive I would be willing to vote for would leap to the aid of a city under attack, Moore shows that Bush nervously sat by, perhaps wondering whether his connections to the Bin Laden family would come to light.With this film, they have. Whether it is Halliburton, Enron, or Unocal, Bush seems to have a hand in every company that becomes famous for malfeasance.The film was particularly effective in showing the lack of a connection between the September 11 hijackers and Iraq. It was continually surprising how Moore used the film medium to portray underlying truths that are so easily lost in a haze of jingoisting reporting and isolated bits of information.This movie is a triumph, and it seems to open new avenues of creative and journalistic expression for filmmakers.	5.0	What USA Today didn't tell you...	2004-07-08	24	16	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1JDT2VPCZVQW9	"Marie Anne A. ""Mary"""	but it's still a nicely done propaganda piece for leftist Moore. I saw this movie twice, maybe two weeks apart, in September 2004. I loved it, mostly because I was very liberal at the time.Moore claims that the Bush family's many connections enabled W to steal the election from Gore. The Bush family had dealings with prominent Saudi families, not limited to the weapons sales during the 80's. Bin Laden is Saudi, but resided with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Bush invaded Afghanistan after they attacked us, but since he couldn't or wouldn't capture Bin Laden, he decided to inflict more fear on the American people. So, it's off to make war on Iraq, and when soldiers become disillusioned and don't re-enlist, Bush pulls new recruits from the poor and minority communities. Naturally, Moore uses this to advertise his adopted hometown of Flint, Michigan.It's been six years, and I rented this documentary from my library. I'd just seen and reviewed 2004's Michael Moore Hates America, and thought it'd be good to revisit Fahrenheit 9/11. I'm conservative now, but I still give Moore credit for creating this piece. He knows how to put together a propaganda piece. He interviews the right people, gets the right footage, the right music and edits them to prove his point. He's a droll narrator, too.BUT, it's been six years. I think most people who would want this DVD already own it. If you like collecting propaganda pieces from the all sides of the American politcal spectrum, add this one to your collection.

"Although I'm a life-long Conservative Republican, I'm also an American, and I recognize that ""The American Way"" has not only allowed but actually SUPPORTED the right to say what's on your mind.  It was Voltaire who said ""I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" And that philosophy heavily influenced Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers.  More than any other nation in history, America is a country where the rights and beliefs of the citizens - even those who disagree- are protected.If you believe that Michael Moore is a big fat liberal nutcase, you have every right in America to believe that. If you offer any opinion on ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when you haven't even SEEN it - you're showing off your ignorance, and in America I get to believe that too.Certainly Michael Moore made the movie to bash George W. Bush and to prevent his re-election.  But not only is his right to do that protected in America, (And I thank God every day to live in a country with rights like ours) but Mr. Moore brings up some very legitimate concerns.When the first plane hit the first Trade Center Tower on September 11th I heard about it on the radio immediately and I remember thinking ""isn't that odd? Maybe somebody was impaired - pilot had a heart attack or something...."" But this report was followed minutes later by the crash into the 2nd Tower and I immediately knew ""this means a terrorist attack of LARGE proportions"".  The President received this word while he was sitting in front of an elementary school class, and I've heard that his explanation for his actions were that he ""didn't want to alarm the children"".  I'm ALL for not alarming children any more than they need to be - but when you're the President and your country is being attacked on a scale that you don't know of yet - I think it's okay to say ""sorry kids, I need to go be President - I know you'll understand""..... or something like that.  Instead, Mr. Bush just sat there - for seven minutes.  Not the ideal response from my Commander-In-Chief.Mr. Moore also makes a pretty convincing argument that ties between Middle Eastern Oil, the Bin Laden family and the White House don't look very good.  Perhaps things are utterly innocent between the Bushes and the Saudi's.... but members of the military are taught to not only do no wrong, but also to not do anything that has even the APPEARANCE of wrongness.  This movie has it's own agenda, but I give Mr. Moore credit for skillfully highlighting the appearance of impropriety.His editing and writing are skillful, and he has a real knack for catching folks at inopportune moments.  I like the moment when he is standing across the street from the Saudi embassy - far away from the White House - when the White House Secret Service suddenly pulls up and asking what they're doing there.  Mr. Moore seems to politely say ""we're just here shooting a documentary, and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.... I didn't know that the secret service guards foreign embassies."" ""Not usually"", the secret service guy replies.  ""Do they give you much trouble - the Saudis?"" Michael Moore asks.  ""No comment"" - the officer says.  ""I'll take that as a 'Yes'"", Moore concludes. It couldn't have gone better for Michael Moore if he had staged it himself.For those who say ""don't watch this!!!!"" I say: Why not?  It's not obscene. It doesn't threaten national security or my religion.Coming away from this film my thought was ""I'm not certain Mr. Bush is doing the best job that he could as President.""  And I don't feel disrespectful or unpatriotic to want my President to do the best job he (or she!) could.  I remain hopeful - hopeful enough that I still voted for Mr. Bush in the recently completed election.You can disagree with Michael Moore.  But please don't try to say that he doesn't have a right to say what he likes.  Thomas Jefferson and I would disagree."	5.0	Dissent is as American as Thomas Jefferson	2004-11-12	33	20	13

""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. It's also profound, passionate, persuasive and penetrating. But more than all that, it's courageous! Like him, or hate him, no one can deny this was an incredible act of courage.He takes on George W. and his administration so convincingly, so thoroughly, Howard Dean must be standing on a street corner somewhere in Vermont screaming ""Amen!""Interestingly enough, the movie wasn't nearly as slanted as I assumed it would be. And he didn't limit his wrath or criticism to Bush alone, or even the Republicans alone. Fingers were pointed and jabbed at both sides of the isle as well as almost all facets of the media. He painted a picture, albeit not a pretty one, step by step, stroke by stroke, meticulously and hypnotically. And by the end it was to this viewer an unqualified masterpiece.He goes to great length to make it abundantly clear that all Americans should and do support our troops, even if we don't support this war. He effectively illustrates the horror of which they've been thrust into, and the futility of what they're up against. Only one child of the entire Congress of the United States of America is actually over there in Irag fighting. The look on the congressmen's faces of which he was interviewing when he asked if they would be willing to enlist their children in this war to show their support was priceless and telling.He goes on to fill this canvas with such shocking persuasive anecdotes, interviews and news clips that most of the audience is left in horror, disgust or laughter.There's no question that Moore is biased, but he's so thorough, so passionate, so sincere that by the end of the movie one can't help but wonder if there's not a whole lot more truth to what he's conveying than anyone was ever willing to admit out loud.Every American, of every political, cultural and racial persuasion should see this movie for themselves. And from there, let their consciences be their guide. If the standing ovation and applause at the end of the near sold-out show my wife and I attended this morning in Del Mar was any indication, we're in for turbulent summer.Kudos to Lions Gate for being so instrumental in bringing this vitally important work to the screen.

The truth is nobody is perfect, and we will never have the perfect President. They will all make mistakes. But Bush has made one too many mistakes and ones that are major. War is something that should only be done in times were it is the only answer. Oil and money, are not good reasons for war. I wouldn't even call this a war. I pray every night for our troups, and wish them the best of luck, but we can't let this war go on.Ive been rambling on and need to stop. I hope you will all buy or rent this movie. No matter if your a ultra-right wing neo-nazi or a ultra-leftwing flaming-homosexual (wich by the way i have nothing against homosexuals, but the conservitive right does) you should watch this movie, wether you belive it or not it will make you think about how to make this country a better one."	5.0	not propaganda just a look at how most people feel thesedays	2004-08-30	21	16	5

I mistook Michael Moore for ""Supersize Me"".The joke is on the consumer here.  If you dropped one penny on this DVD, you have been duped.  It is not difficult to figure out that the American government needs massive change...especially from within.  Too bad integrity and truth did not enter this picture.  Documentaries are shamed by exploitive self-serving egomaniacs like Michael Moore.As an editor, beginning on the 26th Avid Media Composer, I have learned how to generate an alternative truth with images and sound bites.  A very dangerous and dishonest approach for those with eager eyes and ears.  There is an important word I have been taught -- Veritas.  Anything less is a waste of time.So, if you're a leftist who thinks Micahel Moore is a genius -- flush your brain with some Listerine and unlearn.  Quit whining, blogging, drinking overpriced coffee and do something that actually produces results for the betterment of your fellow citizens -- don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.  And if you're on the right, do sound research and learn why many people on this planet have a difficult time digesting the thought process of the current administration.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2M2BHFX37OHM7	"Mary Ellen ""&#34;Say NO to GMO&#34;"""	"I keep hearing critics of Fahrenheit 9/11 saying things like ""lies"" ""distortion"" ""inaccurate"" ""pornagraphic"" (I don't get that one... lol)... Not one of the criticisms has included an example.  Okay, so, you think Moore's lying... about what???  Give me one example of a ""lie"" from the documentary.  They can't do it because facts are facts.The criticism that Fahrenheit 9/11 is biased is really funny.  Michael Moore makes no bones about the fact that his political views are an open book.  This is not a news report (which is expected to be balanced).  This is a documentary (which ALWAYS has a point of view).  It doesn't matter whether the subject is about a lake being polluted or whatever, every documentary has a point of view.  Moore lays out a number of separate facts and then shows footage of the Saudis and the Bushes shaking hands.... the criticism is that the footage doesn't relate to the facts presented!  Well, DUH... any idiot can see that that particular footage is all from official state functions.  Unless Michael Moore's research team is comprised of CIA operatives hiding in closets on the Bush ranch, there will never be any footage related to the facts he is presenting!  Moore lays out the facts like dots on paper and we connect them.  That's as close as anyone can ever get to the backroom agendas.Those are the only types of criticisms I have heard... nobody has disputed any of his facts because they are just that.... facts.  He is ready for it.  He has a ""war room"" ready to back up any statement that anyone tries to dispute.  And nobody has, so far.  They only try to ""justify"" what we see on screen.  And, there are SO MANY gut-wrenching points in this film that for anyone to be walking away talking about the stupid stuff (as mentioned above)... well, that just boggles my mind.Most of what I saw I already knew because I do pay attention to alternative media, but there were some things I didn't know.  Anyway, I hear there are some owners of small theater chains who are refusing to show it.  God, that's scary!!!!  While they may have the legal right to deny the film because they are private businesses, it is the film equivalent to book burning.  It sounds like the days of Hitler when you have someone telling you  ""I watched this and I decided you don't need to see it""It's just like voting... if you don't vote, you don't have a right to complain about the person in office.  It doesn't matter whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Libertarian or whatever... open your mind and go see the film for yourself.P.S.  I take serious exception to the few who say that Bush's famous 7 minutes of staying in the classroom after the 2nd plane hit is okay because he didn't want to upset the kids.  Get your heads out of your asses!  Simply excusing himself would have been fine.  The second grade teachers were there to deal with the second grade children and tell them ""Mr. President has some important president stuff to do"" or however the teachers (skilled in talking to 7 year olds) chose to explain him simply excusing himself.  Teachers are for talking to the children... presidents are for running the country in times of crisis.Then there are those who say the 7 minutes wouldn't have mattered anyway.  Well, gee, hindsight sure is clear!  But, at that actual moment in time when he was told about the second plane, seven minutes is a long, long time.  I know how long it felt because I desperately tried to get in touch with my husband who was at his office one and a half blocks from the Sears Tower.  Three planes were still unaccounted for... all I could picture was the Sears Tower toppling over onto my husband's building (the Sears construction is different and I believe it would topple rather than collapse) - or- a plane being shot down on top of my husband right before striking the Sears building.  This anxiety went on for a couple of hours.  We can all analyze the situation in hindsight.  However, the fact remains that when all of this was taking place, nobody knew what was happening next and YES, every second counted.  I expect a president to stand up, excuse himself (not wait for someone to come in and get him), and TAKE CHARGE of the situation.Even after the first plane hit... when Bush was still in the hallway, having been informed of a plane hitting one of the largest buildings in the country, (even if it was an accident) I believe he should have chosen to find out what the hell was going on instead of proceeding to spend time on a photo op.And, why the hell was Cheney the one giving the orders to shoot down planes when ""the commander in chief"" was readily available?  Now there's some food for thought...I believe Moore could have made an 8 hour documentary and still not covered all of the lies and unethical, immoral actions of this administration.There is just SO MUCH.  Everything seems to be ""under investigation"".  Like what came out several months ago during the Richard Clarke discussions.  In November, 2001, when congress approved attacking Afghanistan, why was money ILLEGALLY taken out of that appropriation to start early actions against Iraq?  That's just one of a dozen reasons I believe Bush should be impeached.  They say it's ""under investigation"".  I'd like to know if some of these ""investigations"" will be concluded before the election.God help us all.  And, God, please protect Michael Moore after having stepped on some very rich and powerful toes.Thanks, Michael... if you have made it through the media censorship to open even one person's eyes to the un-American misuse of power perpetrated by the most powerful Americans... then you have succeeded."	5.0	Moore's Critics are Full of Hot Air	2004-07-12	44	30	14

Believe me, there wasn't a dry eye amongst the five of us women.  The emotional rollercoaster took me from laughing at the ridiculous things Dubya and his cohorts say and do, to anger at what this administration's decisions have caused, not only for Lila and her family and all the American soldiers and their families--but also for the innocent Iraqis. The theater was packed, and everyone stood and applauded when the film ended.I could understand why we went to war in Afghanistan--but why has Dubya quit talking about bin Laden?  Iraq was a war of Dubya's choosing, not a war to keep Americans safe.

Probably a combo of being tired of politics and thinking it could not tell me much more then I already knew at the time.For the most part it's a good film.  Moore does a great job in that it's a great vehicle for questions, discussion and debate.I am only knocking it a point for some of the ""antics"" Moore did for the film.  I didn't care of the bit with the ice cream truck where he drove around reading the patriot act since congress didn't read it.  The everpresent ""ambush"" of congressmen is a rather tired bit and overused.  I think it took away from a well crafted film.  I liked the cabinet people going through makeup, the bit where Ashcroft was singing and theBushisms.  One thing that was really well done was the seven minutes where Bush sat there doing nothing or reading to the children.  I remember it when it happened and it showed the difference between a leader and this man.  A leader acts.Other parts of the film where sad and gave me an impression of exploitation.  Such as the woman talking of the loss of her son and later appears at a protest upset and can only mention loosing her son.  Even though there are hints of exploitation, Moore didn't go full into exploiting the collapse of the twin towers.  There is only a couple after shots and a blacked out image with sound tracks.  Very effective I found as even though I had seen it; I still listened.One thing I found interesting was his section involving homeland security and the Oregon coast.  One man for a large territory.  There was even an extra about old volunteers trying to patrol South Florida.  Very pertinent info when thinking of the current reports of the lack of security on our borders.Probably one of the most provocative things was his explanations of molding the people by instilling fear.  The use of the terror alerts and reports of eminent attacks.  I think it did mold people for the war.The addons are interesting.  I found the axis of evil comedy troop interesting and yet alarming how people are treated.  There were interviews of Bush and Rice which do offer support to the claims of cover up.  The PDBs and the ""Hairsplitting"" of definitions.  Politics I guess.Overall; I can put of with the bit's that were pandering and I would recommend the film as it's a good provocative piece that will cause discussion and debate."	4.0	Finally saw it and it was ok	2007-11-20	11	5	6

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A25ACLV5KPB4W	"Matt Hetling ""Matt"""	"It seems that a film documentarian has two main jobs. First, to shoot or find some compelling footage that keeps our interest; second, to assemble that footage in a way that tells a larger story or makes a significant point.Moore has accomplished these two goals in spades, using footage from a wide variety of sources to build a damning case against President George Bush as pertains to the so-called war on terror.My main criticism of the film comes from a conflicted frame of mind. On one hand, Moore has exaggerated facts and manipulated situations to such an extent that his film can't be truthfully labeled anything other than propaganda. On the other hand, the propaganda is in line with the daily rants of popular right wing radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. When a liberal like Moore uses extremist methods to build an argument, it balances out their right wing extremism. But it also rings a little false now and again. I guess it's just not possible to have it both ways, but the coloring of the facts did leave me cold at times.Highlights of the film include footage of a woman who lost her son in the Iraq war, which left my girlfriend and I wet-eyed. Testimony from US soldiers in Iraq also paints a picture of a majority who have desensitized themselves to the deaths they are causing through the use of bravado, and others who are miserable at the carnage they see around them.In another segment, Moore shows the footage of Bush when he is told that the nation is under attack. Rather than respond with authority, Bush sits there for several minutes, reading a storybook to children as part of a promotional visit he had planned. Moore notes that no one told Bush what to do, and that his response was therefore to just sit there. Close ups of his face, slowed down to emphasize a nervous rocking, lead us to wonder what thoughts Bush was thinking, and to conclude that they were probably not the thoughts that we want our leadership to have.Also of great interest to me were interviews with Iraqis, which humanized them, and footage of the aggressive recruitment tactics that Marine recruiters use in poor neighborhoods.Some of the other segments worked less well for me, and the string of connections between the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia, and big oil was almost boring for me, since I had already read that the ties existed.There is one great scene, however, in which Bush is seen joking at a dinner that he is addressing ""the Haves, and the Have-Mores...some people call you the elite; I call you my base.""

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Some love Michael Moore; others hate him. Hopefully we can all agree on at least this much: because America allows freedom of speech Michael Moore was able to make this film and find help getting it to the public.As we know, in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore decries what he considers to be Bush's lack of initiative to prevent terrorism before the fateful September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation. He then proceeds to demonstrate that the Bush family had long standing business ties with the Saudis. He cites sources (including, of course, Richard Clarke) to demonstrate that the Bush administration intended to attack Iraq from almost the first day they took the White House. All in all, this film is Moore's scathing attack on the Bush administration and the Republican party for what he sees as their lack of true concern for the welfare of the American people, putting their personal business interests above everything else. Moore also attacks Cheney for his connections to the Saudis through Halliburton as well.I admire Moore for his bravery in taking on the powerful Bush family. Freedom of speech allows this and Moore had the right to make this film just as anyone has the right to speak their mind in our nation.There are times in this film when Bush does look inept, as when he takes seven minutes to have any response to the news from his chief of staff that the second of the two twin towers in NYC had been hit by a plane. Moore takes great pains to interview soldiers in Iraq and he succeeded to getting them to truly open up about their feelings both pro and con against the war. It was especially refreshing to hear the candid mixed feelings soldiers had about the Iraq war since our news media typically does not cover that angle of this story. I personally felt broken hearted for Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son killed in Iraq. Moore succeeds in bringing an emotional element to this film both through the soldier interviews and the interviews with Lipscomb. It makes one wonder about the necessity of this war, especially in light of the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. (Indeed, on this afternoon's CNN.com web site there is a major story as I write this that ""top U.S. arms inspector reported Wednesday that he found no evidence that Iraq produced any weapons of mass destruction after 1991."") One thing was absent, however: never once was it mentioned that Clinton also ignored terrorist warnings for a long time--it wasn't just Bush!The DVD comes with a slew of extras that are also very captivating and interesting to watch. One extra was filmed outside the now infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq the day they released 100 prisoners. I was disturbed at the prison abuse they received. Perhaps American soldiers over there have to be extremely careful and protect themselves by rounding up potential resistance people; but prisoner abuse is not the American way and it brings us down. We also see Condoleezza Rice's 9/11 Commission testimony as well as Bush saying not much after a ""conversation"" with the 9/11 Commission. There is a troubling look at the inadequate security patrol of the coast of Florida as well as the lack of protection in Oregon state.I recommend that people see this film if they can. The DVD and extras are thought provoking. If you agree with Michael Moore, then it will make you feel great that he got his message across. If you disagree with Moore, see the film anyway--a thorough understanding of his stance will help you think and sharpen your opinions and beliefs to the contrary. Moore has indeed made a significant contribution to the very hot issues of the Iraq war and politics as it relates to big money and big business.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore is a master showman. His documentaries have always done well at the boxoffice, but ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" proved to be a runaway hit. It will probably be a long, long time before any movie of this type again takes in so much money.Its success is also a tribute to his abilities as a filmmaker. Many argue that he doesn't play fair, that he's a left-wing nutcase. Others see him as a great essayist who readily admits his works are biased by nature. To me, the fact that he can stir great debate proves that he is ingenious.What makes ""Fahrenheit 9//11"" so controversial is that it takes direct aim at George W. Bush and his administration. It is perhaps the most savagely satirical documentary about a sitting President ever made.The opening of the movie makes fun of Bush, who, having learned of the 9/11/2001 terrorists attacks while he visiting a Florida school, sits for a full nine minutes reading a book about a goat to a group of kids. This is an example of the `unfair' Moore. Why should the President be any less stunned by the event than the rest of us? When unreal events occur, it takes awhile for us to adjust to the `new' reality.Where the movie really takes hold is later, when Bush and company decides to invade Iraq. People all over the world, including America, asked themselves what this had to do with the war on terror. Moore's point that the invasion was based on an agenda other than fighting terrorism is fascinating. [He zeroes in on the cozy relationship between the Bush family and the rulers of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 9/11 hijackers.] His focus on the REAL sacrifice of our troops is fascinating. His juxtaposition of our government's assertion that the war is surgical, precise and humane versus the real suffering on the ground in Iraq is brilliant.In an era in which all media outlets are controlled by giant corporations, Moore's voice, irritating as it can sometimes be, is refreshing. [Case in point: The movie was to be released originally by feisty Disney subsidiary, Miramax Films. The head of Disney decided that the film was too controversial, reportedly because, at the time, Disney was vying for some tax incentives in the state of Florida, whose governor is Jeb Bush, brother of George W.]"	4.0	An exceptionally fine example of the documentary genre	2004-10-10	29	20	9
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V	"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri"""	It opens up semi-quietly, showing Al and Tipper Gore celebrating a &quot;Florida Victory&quot; after the 2000 election with a huge crowd of supporters. We don't really hear them cheering and having a great ol' time, though. Instead, we hear director Moore lamenting about how the last four years have seemed like a big dream and to many of us in the audience who were ready to see this movie, it does indeed feel that way. I still remember George W. Bush making promises and proclaiming that he would &quot;be a uniter and not a divider&quot;. He also said he would bring dignity back to the White House...You can call this film a &quot;tired liberal argument&quot;, a &quot;liberal soapbox&quot;, or anything else that comes to mind, but you would be wrong on just about every front. Michael Moore may be a liberal, but he didn't say that liberals have the solution to everything. His interviewee's say that and some of the war-injured say that and the mother whose son was killed over the current struggle in Iraq say that. Moore's whole idea is to say that the man we have serving us in the White House is NOT the man for the job. For this, I applaud Moore and I call him a braver man than I. He hangs not just his private parts out there but his entire body.Michael Moore's documentary makes intelligent connections between the Bush White House and Saudi oil interests which include the Bin Laden family. He claims that one of Cheney's companies made a profit off of 9/11 due to new war contracts. He shows us that the war in Iraq is both unneccessary and quite deadly mainly because Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with 9/11 and never had the tools that terrorists would love to get their hands on (the famed &quot;WMD's&quot; that have become a household name).Of course, none of this will come as unfamiliar news since we have all heard the crazy things viewers have said about Moore and his ability to &quot;stretch and distort&quot; certain truths. Here, I've seen Moore do nothing other than what any other documentary filmmaker would do: persuade you to believe his viewpoint by shooting archival facts your way and showing you why you should care about it now. He has the right, as an American, to question his government. Everyone (even the Repub's) exercised this right not once(in 1992), not twice(in 1996), but THREE TIMES (in 2000). We do so everytime we vote. You will probably do it again in 2004 when you choose your leader for the next four years.What Michael Moore does NOT do is exactly what Pro-Bush sheep say he and most liberals do: Michael Moore does not hate our military. He does not use 9/11 to his advantage or to any other advantage. He follows the military on their exploits with curiosity and then questions why they continue to fight a war that doesn't need to be fought when the MILITARY begins to complain to the camera. Moore also meets a nice woman named Linda Lipscomb who works in the Unemployment Office in Flint, Michigan, the subject of Moore's very first movie. Her son has gone to war in Iraq and she supports him and the reason the troops fight all the way. She even confesses that she misunderstood the anti-war protesters, saying that she considered their protests as &quot;a slap in the face&quot; until she realized that they were protesting the reason Bush led us in there.Later in the film, we discover that her son was killed in Karballah in a Blackhawk helicopter downed by enemy fire. She no longer supports the war or Bush and her and Moore take a march up to the White House which is almost cast as a big, powerful building that taunts its opponents. It's been fenced off completely (due to construction) so nobody can even approach the gates and that's when Linda's emotions begin to get the best of her as she sobs uncontrollably, remembering her son, doubling over in an almost painful way. This brought tears to the eyes of many an audience member, including me. Not because I don't like the war but because you realize that actual human beings are needlessly dying.Moore also does NOT sympathize with terrorists. He wisely does not show what we have already witnessed hundreds of times: the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. Instead, he lets us HEAR it with just a dark screen to keep us company. He points out that over 3,000 people, even a friend of his was killed in the attacks. He points out that Bush rightly sent troops to into Afghanistan to &quot;smoke 'em out&quot; (repeated over and over by Bush in a cleverly-edited sequence) but that he sent only a mere 11,000 troops. This is incredibly alarming since, a) Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban are supposedly still alive and well in Afghanistan and b) just under 1,000,000 troops are in Iraq, fighting seemingly multiplying insurgent forces everyday.Michael Moore's film takes you on an emotional journey that will force you to laugh, make you cry, and encourage you to get mad and do something about the sad state of affairs in this country. This, despite what others will no doubt say, is a very important film and one of immense patriotic passion and such power that you might find that you've made an impression of yourself in your theater seat by the movie's end.**** out of ****--Matt(Note: There are two sides to every story. Many call Moore a liar. The National Review's Dave Kopel has written an article apparently showing the &quot;deceits&quot; in the film (59 of them, he claims) but Kopel does not often address the heavier claims made by Moore's film and hits on the minor ones. Because of that, it would be easy to call Kopel &quot;deceitful&quot; and &quot;manipulative&quot; as well.)	5.0	Bowling for Bush	2004-07-30	28	23	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1BKGKT0L0G3JJ	matttttt	First off, this movie is not in any way a documentary, it's a biased piece of anti-bush propaganda, released conveniently close enough to election time to sway the 18 year old confused voters into voting bush out of office.The movie does nothing but make bush look like a fool. For example, the first ten minutes of the movie shows the bush administration making themselves look pretty for the camera. Are we supposed to believe that the bush admin. is foolish for wanting to look proper for the camera? Would michael moore go on live TV with a piece of asparagus stuck in his teeth?Second, it showcases Bush's relation with the Bin Laden family (sans osama of course). Which part is supposed to make us hate bush, the fact that he took money from them, or the fact that they hate bin laden too?Next they show video clips of things such as bush talking about terrorists then saying 'now check out this swing.' Why is that funny? Can the president NOT talk about terrorists and then play golf? It seems to me that he was playing golf FIRST, and was then interrupted. That's rude on the cameramans part for getting in his way. You need quiet for golf.There is a slight bit of gore (not Al Gore slly, blood and gore), but it is enough to wrench your gut, it's disgusting and seems to serve no purpose but to get our feelings out, frankly I was disgusted by the shots they showed and they have no place in a movie such as this.Probably the funniest part of this movie, is the woman who lost her son. NO it's not funny that she lost him, it's funny because she blames bush and iraq and everyone else she can for her son's death, but forgets to take into account the fact that he signed up for the military(or whatever branch of the armed forces he was in) voluntarily. Yeah, she should be sad he's dead, I don't blame her for that, but she should have accepted that as a possibility the second he announced he was joining.The movie then goes on endlessly with interviews and boredom about the war in iraq and how Saddam had NO WMDs and never did. But we already knew that, they pre-empted TV to announce these things to the world, I don't need a self-righteous director reiterating this to me with some fancy editing.I'm far from pro-bush, but I'm not anti-bush. You people don't know how Gore would have handled sept. 11th, so don't act like you know everything. When you're president, and you have the control, then you can tell me how easy it is. Otherwise, shut your mouth.The long and the short of it is this: If you're a swing voter who needs any reason to vote one way or another, go see it. If you want to get some cheap laughs at the expense of bush, because the media told you to hate him and so you do, go see this movie. If you like movies such as Rush Hour, or XXX or any other movie with mindless explosions, no plot, nudity galore, and other sorts of entertainment you need no brain to enjoy, go see it. If you want to see propaganda at it's best, go see it. If you actually want to learn something about the american government, read the newspaper, watch the news and cnn, frankly, do anything BUT see this movie.	1.0	Propaganda anybody?	2004-09-19	78	22	56
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1SZF1ZLUZGU56	Matyas Kiraly	"Having seen Bowling for Columbine earlier, I was pleasantly surprised that in Fahrenheit 911, Michael Moore did bring the end of the movie to a full climax. Unlike Columbine, which left some nagging questions untouched, in Fahrenheit, the ultimate answer was delivered (in the form of a quote - make sure you don't miss it!), in the last few seconds of the movie. Bravo.As a citizen well-informed how corrupt and discredited the last 20 or so presidential administrations are on Capitol Hill, I did not expect any major new revelations from Fahrenheit 911. I was wrong. In the first hard-hitting episode that I have not seen anywhere else, black voters protest in the Senate from being scratched from the voting rolls and not one senator, even a Democratic one signs their bill. It reminded me of the early stage of the disenfranchisement of the Jews in Hitler's Germany. In both cases, ""representatives"" of the people ceased representing their constituents to favor personal enrichment. (They obtained ""special"" loans, mortgages, and other favors from the ruling clique to pay for their obedient going along. History repeats.)The second scene that recalled shades of Nazi Germany even closer was a meeting of corporation heads organized by Halliburton where a bunch of CEOs discuss the financial windfall of Iraq ""once the oil starts flowing."" It was eerily ressemblant of Hitler, Krupp, Otto Ambros of I.G. Farben and other CEOs discussing the financial windfall of WW2 ""once the Romanian and Russian oil starts flowing"" in 1933. Perhaps the French writer (whose name I forgot) was right and capitalism DOES inherently decay into fascism over time? To judge from this scene, our biggest present-day corporations  sure appear eager to embrace this form of militarized robbery. Will those CEOs be as eager to face a war tribunal and potentially a firing squad for it? Funny how that didn't came up. Just like in 1933.Overall, Fahrenheit 911 is definitively a movie worth seeing and thinking about. I could add only two small wishes. 1.) I wish Moore read Al Martin's book ""The Conspirators"", to understand that none of the Bush company failures were failures, but successful financial scams to drum up financial contributions, and 2.) It took 40 years after WW2 for the truth to come out that the Nazi war effort would have never amounted to anything without the huge financial infusions from the Rothschilds and the US Federal Reserve - the very circles making a windfall on the ensuing massacre. Will it take another 40 years for the truth to come out whether  the same financial circles who pushed us into Iraq this time? The day the perpetrators face a war crimes court will be a day of victory for human decency."	5.0	Moore goes all the way, this time	2004-06-26	16	10	6

It shows what we already knew in the rest of the world, but only half of Americans knew (and know) - that Bush has played half of Americans for a fool, and that the war in Iraq was always about oil (not ""WOMD"") and taking out the man that made daddy look like fool. Bush's close ties with the Bin Ladens was an eyeopener though. One politician I feel a bit sorry for, who was portrayed as one of Bush's corrupt elite henchmen (ie Dick, Donald, etc), is Colin Powell - he's already expressed regrets over his part in the war, something that Bush and his posse will never do. Also, seeing who the ""American Soldiers"" were fighting over in Iraq (young kids/adults similar if not a bit younger than me) put a new perspective on reports of them being killed or injured (this was the first time I've seen footage of injured soldiers out of Iraq). And of course one has to feel sympathy for the innocent Iraqies killed and injured by the military action, and those that have been and are being taken away for no just reason. I would've liked to have seen something on the Gwantanomo (?) Bay prison though."	5.0	What we already knew, plus some	2005-04-13	23	8	15
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A4PM93415ULZK	M. Beahm	I saw this movie in the theater and have read 200 of the reviews already posted on this site before posting my own.  I soon noticed that people who gave poor reviews to the film stated how much the film lied and how biased it was. You can make those statements but you have to support them. It's not enough to say the film tells lies, you need to tell us what the lies are and support your claim with evidence. Few reviews do this. Also, many of the people who gave the film one or two stars admit to not watching the entire film, some admit to not watching it at all.This documentary does a good job, if anything, of raising questions. It explores the connections of our current government to big oil companies currently at work in Iraq and Afghanistan, it explores connections between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia, it explores the social and economical makeup of the kids surving in our military, and it explores our efforts on the homefront to keep our country safe post 9/11.Was there some fancy editing? Of course. Every good movie has good editing. Were there some lies told? Of course there was. The decision to pull the Bin Laden family out of The U.S. after the attacks was not Bush's. One of the great things about our system of government is that through checks and balances, Bush, or any president, does not have that power. Be smart enough to realize you're being lied to, but then ask yourself why you hadn't heard of any of this before the movie came out. Who's hiding what?Also, anyone blaming George W. for the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center wasn't paying attention in 1993. Remember, the car bomb in the basement that injured a few hundred people? Bin Laden had an obsession with the WTC and wanted it gone, and would stop at nothing to get it done. In my own mind, I assume that Bin Laden attacked on 9/11 not because he hated George W., but because he failed to level the buildings in 1993 and it took him almost nine years to come up with a plan that would work. If Gore had been in office on 9/11, the buildings still would have been attacked and we would have tapes of Gore sitting in a classroom instead of Bush. Michael Moore draws some of his own conclusions in this film and I did notice how careful he was to point out his own opinions when he wasn't presenting fact. I encourage anyone watching this film to draw their own conclusions as well.This film does do a good job of raising questions about our current government. At times it gets long and drawn-out. At times it gets confusing. The plot at times jumps around like a Quentin Tarantino piece and doesn't always make it back to home base.Once again, unlike most who reviewed this, I'm not making a political statement. I have no left or right wing. I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet. I'll wait until after the debates to do that, as any American should. If Bush is as dumb as this film makes him out to be, it will show in the debates. Keep in mind that even if you come away from this movie hating George W., you have to ask yourself if Kerry can do a better job, this movie doesn't do that for you. If you walk away from this movie and don't have some serious discussions with your friends about it - whether you agree with it or not, I think you've missed the point.	4.0	A review of the movie, not a political statement.	2004-09-27	21	16	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AOUA3YPECKL47	M. Bouchard	Michael Moore's new documentary puts together lots of known facts about Bush in a way that is very damaging to this hale-fellow-well-met Prez who has not the brains, creativity or courage to be a real leader for the country. Too bad for us. I read a lot of reviews before I saw the movie, so I was prepared for most of it (some of the war scenes were pretty horrific, though).  But the part that made me most proud to be an American was the coda at the end where he talked about the brave sacrifice our troops were making, most of them from the middle and lower classes, and for what? $17K/year and the chance to get killed for a pointless revenge trip on the part of the President.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AESY8NCX6VS6O	M. Burns	"The smartest comment in Michael Moore's newest one-sided diatribe comes not from a high-level anti-Bush official or Moore or some Washington insider...but George W. Bush himself. Moore is attempting to get a word from him and - get this - Bush says, ""You'd better behave yourself. And get a real job!"" That's somewhat the way I felt after sitting through two mind-numbingly boring hours of 9/11 - the movie that won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Beats me. In this little review, I don't plan on discussing Moore politics, things said in the movie, whether the fat schlub is right or not, or anything like that. I'm treating it like it deserves to be treated (and how it wasn't treated at Cannes) - as a movie. And as a movie, it's dull.And that's really the most surprising thing about Fahrenheit. I went into it prepared to go any way on the movie, though, I admit, I'm not a fan of the way Moore manipulates facts (read: lies) to get his point across. I possibly anticipated getting upset with his blazingly manipulated facts, manipulative filmmaking techniques...but no; that stuff is alright in some ways. The movie is just a snoozer. Which surprises me, considering Bowling For Columbine, though shamelessly manipulative and annoying, was at least highly enjoyable and full of a zest for filmmaking. I recently commented on someone's xanga, kind of defending Moore, saying that even though he does bend the truth, at least he does it with a passion and flare that some fictional filmmakers can't match. CrzyMuthaRugger just needs to see Fahrenheit to prove me wrong. Though Moore seems more fired up about this whole situation than anything else he's ever done, the movie feels like a two-hour-long Dateline special. And I think I just insulted Dateline.But don't think that he's thrown his shameless audience manipulation away for, well, boredom; that's here too. In the entire first half of the film, he spends a great deal of time putting thoughts into Bush's head via narration. I don't like the hick, but it's just plain unfair; Moore has no idea what the man was/is thinking, and it's not something that should have been done in this documentary. At one point, Moore asks, paraphrased, ""Would it be rude to say that the Bushes wake up in the morning and think 'What's best for the Saudi's,' not 'What's good for the United States?'"" I said out loud, ""Yes, it is rude."" But Moore has a penchant for turning rudeness into snarky charm, something that worked for a good deal of Columbine. In a scene toward the end, he goes to Congressmen asking if they'd enlist their kids to fight in the war in Iraq. Think about this for a second: would any person, without hesitation, stand on a street corner and sign their kids up for the war just like that? No, and Moore knows that. He just does it anyways, to get them running away on film (running away is the best idea anyone Moore attempts to interview can have).The only section of the movie that really, truly works is a sequence past the halfway point in which Moore explores how the U.S. began the war with Iraq. Here, the dude really has some solid ground on which to stand, and he does relay the facts with the video footage in a way that reminded me of what a good documentary can do. And I give him his due credit for that. But it all goes down the tube soon when he starts making broad parallells in his narration and veering off again...and 9/11 is where it was when it started: Dullsville.Don't think that I'm giving this a bad review because I don't agree with Moore. I do - Bush is a douchebag, and I hope come November things change. But just because this movie loosely follows my views doesn't mean it's automatically good. Fahrenheit 9/11, a film that could have been intriguing, exciting and relentlessly probing is simply a monotonous presentation of facts that achieves the full effect of numbness upon the viewer. I am baffled at the fact that this won at Cannes, but it's pretty easy to explain why: the coveted Palme D'Or is nothing more than a show of political support. That's kind of sad, considering the fact that I'm sure there were many other films that had a zest for filmmaking, a desire to tell a story, and the power to move their audiences. Fahrenheit 9/11, despite what you've heard, has none. GRADE: C-"	2.0	The facts are here, but the movie is relentlessly boring!	2004-07-15	11	2	9

Looking up info about his film, if you're any kind of regular net-surfer, you will likely have seen verbal volleys directed back and forth between democratic supporters and republican supporters.  What ends up happening is the equivalent of an elementary school name-calling contest rather than any discussion of the film as is.  Yes, there are parts of this movie presented out of context.  One example:  When the Taliban visit Texas in this film, they were there by invitation from the Clinton administration, even though Bush is Texas governor.  However, what works in this film is seeing a result of one presidential administration's decisions (and indecisions in one almost tragically comical scene) and its effects on people in two countries.  The interspersal of Lila Lipscomb's patriotism to outrage to utter sadness are the most moving parts of this film.  Seeing the effects of the war on those who were on the front lines and discovering what is never mentioned on US newscasts is a powerful series of images.  The interviews with shell-shocked, amputee soldiers in rehab are frightening to behold, knowing that there are what is nearing 10,000 of these men returning to the USA, and to what kind of reception?  Seeing Moore on the streets of DC telling members of congress to sign their adult children up for military service is hilarious to watch, especially seeing the reactions of the congressmen.For me, all of these changes in mood, from disbelief, to horror, to unbounded laughter are what make this a 4 star film.  Taking it in context of just a theater goer, and not a potential voter, make me agree with why this film won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Festival.  There are powerful messages here, despite personal politics and should be seen by anyone who is a citizen of this planet, not just the US.	4.0	A film that brings out the best and worst in reviewers.	2004-10-07	91	80	11

When one congress person tried to explain that he did have children in the armed forces his mike was cut since that didn't help the story line.In this movie, George Bush is shown speaking to a crowd saying something like ""You are my people/base."" Made Bush look like he was an elitist hanging with other elitists. In the Farenhype counter movie they show how Moorer took this speech completely out of context. They don't show Bush leaving the podium and going to sit down right next to Al Gore. Al Gore and Geroge Bush were at the same meeting.Please Michael Moorer you don't need to lie or fabricate. Just tell the truth. The facts are strong enough. This doesn't take away completely that there is much good in this movie."	3.0	Some Grains of Salt in Otherwise Good Documentary	2011-03-13	4	2	2

It's about George Bush and how the Democratic party is going to save America from that Christian Texas cowboy.Not a word about government involvement in September 11. Moore simple continues the myth that Muslim terrorist thought this all out from their caves in Afghanistan because ""they hate our freedom"".Not a word about the fact that George Bush, just as Michael Moore's Savior John Kerry, is a member of the satanic and fascistic Skull and Bones cult.No, this is not the kind of movie that you put on to educate yourself or others. It is a school example of how the establishment tries to spin their version of events with an alternative image.But sure, you can watch it and see a great portrait of George W. Bush, including many of his famous quotes such as ""Saddam tried to kill my dad"" and all that.And then look at some real movies about 9/11 and the new world order: ""911, the biggest lie ever sold"", for example.

I think more conservatives should take off their ideological blinders so they may see that the conduct of this administration is not as perfect as the Sean Hannitys and Rush Limbaughs of the world would have you believe.  With that, I found the facts presented in this film to be disturbingly rank with bias.  One could easily make a scathing indictment of the Bush administration by presenting all the facts, not just the negative ones.  For example, while it is clear that we have not been ""greeted as liberators"" as predicted by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, there are those in Iraq who are eternally grateful for the job our soldiers are doing.  I am just scratching the surface.  Research the facts presented in this film, and you will find that they only tell half of the story.  I gave this film two stars because it did bring to light a few interesting points and I thought the piece on the grieving mother of the fallen soldier was very well done.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"The above quote, from George Orwell's fictional book ""1984"" that was published at the onset of the Cold War in 1949, is a sad commentary quoted in Michael Moore's 2004 documentary entitled ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  The book, which depicts a dystopian society that is always at war that is never meant to be won, is used as a comparison by Michael Moore with the current state of affairs by the U.S. Government.  The documentary begins with a brief look at the highly questionable results of the 2000 presidential election that permitted with the candidate with the fewer number of popular votes, George W. Bush, to become president of the United States.  While on a very lengthy vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas in August, 2001, Mr. Bush ignored U.S. Government warnings about a potential terrorist attack that would use hijacked airplanes only weeks before the dreaded terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 that saw the destruction of the World Trade Center in NYC, an attack on the Pentagon and leaving about 3000 people dead.  The notion that all domestic flights in the U.S. were grounded immediately after the attack is incorrect, as a number of secret flights carrying Saudi citizens (including blood relatives of Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the attack) were allowed to leave the U.S.  Hence, Mr. Bush ensured that even though 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001 were Saudi citizens, no departing Saudi citizens could be questioned by U.S. law enforcement officials that were investigating the horrific attack.Within weeks of the attack and Americans living in fear, it was then easy for Mr. Bush and his White House staff to promote the Patriot Act (especially former Attorney General John Ashcroft), which reduced the rights, freedoms and privacy of all Americans and the Taliban-controlled nation of Afghanistan was attacked by U.S. forces to weed out al Queda terrorists.  However, as Michael Moore points out in his documentary, some officials in Bush's administration wanted a bigger target to attack, and the preferred choice was Iraq.  In less than a year, Mr. Bush and other White House officials were repeatedly calling for an invasion into Iraq; and on March 19, 2003, they got their wish as U.S. forces did invade that nation, which had never attacked the U.S. The justification used by Mr. Bush and other White House officials to invade Iraq was the claim that its former regime possessed weapons of mass destruction in violation of United Nations resolutions.  However, in the months following the invasion, no such weapons were ever found, nor were any facilities found where any such weapons could be built.  In other words, Mr. Bush lied in order to justify the sending of thousands of U.S. troops into harms way in costly war.  Since the invasion (at the time of writing this review), over 1870 American military servicemen and servicewomen have died, over 14000 have been wounded and an estimated 23000 to 25000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.  It is interesting, as Michael Moore pointed out in the documentary, that of all 535 members of both houses of Congress, only one (at the time it was filmed) had a son or daughter serving in the U.S. military in Iraq.  With Mr. Bush thwarting efforts to investigate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the close ties between the Bush & bin Laden families and the involvement of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney with the oil industry and military-industrial complex respectively, the reasons for invading Iraq become quite blurred; but the killing continues unabated while Osama bin Laden remains at large.Overall, I rate Michael Moore's 2004 documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  What has kept the U.S. a free country for more than 200 years is the right of its citizens to question the actions of the government, which is exactly what Michael Moore did in this very insightful documentary.  Just watch out for John Ashcroft singing."	5.0	"""The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous."""	2005-08-23	11	7	4

Michael Moore shows us lies, he shows us truths and he shows us a thought provoking subject. Suffice to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 is seriously controversial and seriously should be viewed wheter your for Bush or not. Moore tackles subjects like commerical adds for big cooperate places, footage from many different things, like the war in Iraq, or the bombings in Baghdad to Bush putting around the golf ball. He tackles issues in his home town of Flint, Michigan. A lot of people may hate this movie but I thought of it to be a button pusher and a sure fire winner.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	"The most controversial film of the year has finally arrived to theatres.  It's the movie that A LOT of people don't want you to see, hence why it had to go through so many obstacles to get a public release.  It's also a movie that people cannot stop talking about, whether they love it or hate it.  What I'm talking about is none other than Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" which is an unrelenting assault on the Bush Administration.  There is a very clear purpose of this movie, and that is to show the incompetence and the unspeakable acts perpetrated by G.W. and company and their handling of the Iraq War.From the get-go, you know that Moore has an agenda and he doesn't shy away from it.  He never backs down from it, as well.  From the very first minute, President George W. Bush is shown to us in a very unfavorable fashion.  We see him as a slacker who really hates being at the White House since he's always vacationing.  We see him sit in a classroom for well over seven minutes when he is told that our country is under attack, holding a very bewildered expression on his face.  Moore brings us some pretty devastating evidence that points to a relationship between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia.  Not only that, but we are told that while every plane in the U.S. was grounded, the Bin Ladin Family was able to catch flights out of our country without ever being questioned by the FBI (according to Moore).  The film has some very humorous moments in it, which include Moore trying to get members of Congress to enlist their own children to go to Iraq--the expressions on their faces are absolutely priceless as they run away in horror and in disgust from Moore.  However, there are gut-wrenching and devastating moments like seeing dead and injured soldiers, and the breakdown of a mother who has lost her son in the war.  When you add all of these elements together, you get a very thought-provoking and disturbing portrait of the Bush Administration.Make no mistake, as Michael Moore never shies away from the fact that he has made this movie to get Bush out of office.  He admits that.  His agenda is always clear and he never tells you otherwise.  And yet, he doesn't just simply tell you that G.W. is an incompetent guy and leaves it at that.  He gives you his reasons and he backs them up with his evidence.  I cannot verify the accuracy of this film, as I am not a political analyst.  What I can verify is that Moore makes a pretty convincing case and this movie raises some serious accusations that really need to be answered, even if they only turn out to be nothing more than accusations in the end.Is this film nothing more than propaganda?  I don't think so.  Usually, propaganda is used in hopes that it will have everybody coming to the same conclusions.  You won't find that with this movie.  People who are for Bush will most likely still be for Bush after seeing the movie, and people who are against Bush will still resent Bush after the movie.  There is always a chance that the movie may change some people's opinions, but I don't really think it will change people's minds all that much.  However, what I do hope is that the film will have people thinking and asking the hard and tough questions that this administration should have to answer.I think that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a big triumph for Michael Moore.  He took a lot of chances and risks making this movie.  It is clear that it is a project that he absolutely believes in since he handles it with absolute care.  Whether you're on the Left or on the Right, I think this is something that should be seen by everyone, even if you don't agree with Moore's tactics or opinions.  Nobody should tell you how to feel about this movie, it should only be you who comes to such a decision.  A very well done and powerful presentation from Mr. Moore.  As always, he did not disappoint me. -Michael Crane"	5.0	"""He did what anybody else would do... he went on vacation."""	2004-07-05	35	23	12

Miramontes ""mjmpolo"""	Despite what Moore states this is not a documentary, but a personal and planned attack by Moore upon the President of the United States. Moore's film is so filled with caricatures of the President that he implies that everything his film presents is fact. From the very beginning the intelligent viewer sees that this is Moore's attempt to influence the 2004 election. His attempt is no better than Al Queda's attempt to do the same. This is nothing more than entertainment terrorism, for its purpose is to lie to the people to affect changeWhen stating that Iraq has no WMD's Moore fails to mention the fact that Hussein did in fact gas his own people using WMD's. The mere fact that the WMD's have not been found does not dismiss the fact that WMD's were used and that Iraq fired upon authorized flights over the no-fly zones, kicked out UN authorized weapon inspectors and refused to comply with 17 UN Resolutions. All of these facts were ignored by Moore's filmFinally, those who are considering seeing this film and are unsure as to the truthfulness of this so-called documentary should decide on the basis of Moore's lie to the public when he stated that his party affiliation was neither a Democrat or Republican but that of an Independent. Yet when Fox News did its research, it was discovered and reported that Moore is in fact a registered Democrat. Even the NY Times calls Moore's motives in question. Need anyone say more regarding Moore's personal agenda? Therefore, anyone paying to see this film is nothing more than a participant in promoting Moore's personal propaganda and agenda.If the French applaud this film, then let Moore secure the investment capital for his next film from French President Chirac.	2.0	Moore's Personal Agenda	2004-07-16	28	4	24
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A33Y11434WD5HH	Michael J. Rapson	Michael Moore nearly nails it with this one. If anything, he doesn't go far enough to indict the criminal extremist Republican corporate-military branch, as part of an international cabal of beyond evil (military-industrial complex; neocons; robber barons, assorted psychopaths and neoliberals) and its almost certain perpetration of 9/11. Surprise, surprise that the ministry of oil is the only building not damaged by the invasion of Iraq. I suppose, Moore decides to allow the viewer to 'connect the dots', which is reasonable because dot connecting can be fraught. What is less known is that between the two gulf wars, British and American planes bombed Iraq,s sewage plants and other vital utilities in order to provoke aggressive reprisals and justify another invasion.The Democrats don't escape unscathed either, when they are shown complicit in the flawed election results in Florida, as they betray the black members of Congress one by one.People always fall into the trap of cheering for one side or the other or playing off the relative moral merits of Democrats vs Republicans, Conservatives vs Labour etc but the truth is more complex and less black and white when considering the double games of the ruling elites that most people don't seem to notice.	4.0	Promising Expos&eacute; of Unspoken Establishment Evil	2014-01-31	0	0	0

In the feel good atmosphere of the post-911 days, when everyone was an American it was the responsibility of the media to go beyond the ribbons, flags, pomp, and circumstance, and report the news.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AL4MKKO24563R	Michael K. Beusch	"At about the midway point of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore includes a clip of an interview with Britney Spears. In it, Spears voices full confidence in President Bush and his administration and says that she believes everything he says. If enough people in this country see Fahrenheit 9/11, Spears is going to be among a very, very, very small minority in the United States.Moore clearly shows how the Bush administration, from day one (and even before that), has manipulated facts, played on the nation's fears and flat-out lied to the American people in order to further its political and financial goals. With almost unnerving precision, Moore shows how the Bush family cultivated business ties with the Bin Laden family and sought to preserve those ties even after 9/11. Clips of testimony and interviews by members of the Bush administration asserting the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction are followed by clips of those same people, before 9/11, asserting that Iraq had no such weapons. He shows how the Patriot Act has given the United Government license to pry into the private lives of its citizens and execute a measure of control and manipulation that should be illegal under the Constitution. And, in footage CBS, ABC, NBC and, especially, Fox News never show the American people, Moore documents how the war in Iraq has dessimated lives, both American and Iraqi.This is clearly Moore's most somber and sober film yet. Roger and Me, The Big One and even Bowling for Columbine had moments of great humor and big laughs. In contrast, even when Fahrenheit 9/11 uses humor, the film still maintains its tone of anger, anguish and despair over the corruption of the Bush Aministration and the lives lost or ruined by the war in Iraq. By the time Moore interviews the mother of a soldier killed in the war, the audience isn't laughing and is instead on the verge of tears.Moore thankfully spares the audience the horrible footage of 9/11/01, not because he feels it is irrelevant, but because he doesn't want to exploit our memories. The sounds of the attack, the reaction of bystanders to the horror and the grief of the survivors and family members of the victims tells the story powerfully. He knows that no one who was old enough to be aware what was happening that day will ever forget what they saw and what they felt.In contrast, the footage of the Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded shown is often very graphic in nature and might be too much for some viewers to handle. It shocked me, but I thought it was necessary to show how much the media, even the supposedly liberal leaning mainstream media, slanted its coverage, omitted footage that could be construed as un-American or negative in nature and essentially became an unofficial cheerleader for the Bush Administration's cause.By playing upon the nation's post 9/11 fears, the Bush administration was able to sell a war on Iraq that was already in the planning stages before the attacks. And worst of all, Moore shows that, in many instances, the root reason for waging war wasn't idealogical, but instead for financial gain through the awarding of fat government contracts to help rebuild Iraq. While watching Fahrenheit 9/11, I kept thinking of Donald Sutherland's statement in Oliver Stone's JFK that ""the organizing principle for any society is for war."" It's easy to dismiss such a statement when watching a dramatization. However, it's not nearly as easy when it's shoved into your face with supporting evidence during a documentary.Before I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, I expressed doubts that a documentary could influence an election. Now, however, I'm not so sure. Michael Moore has crafted a film that trashes President Bush, but presents a lot of evidence to back him up. George W. Bush had better hope that Britney Spears can get a lot of pro-Bush voters to the polls, because Fahrenheit 9/11 is going to make a lot of people angry at him.NOTE: My only criticism of Moore is that he berates Bush for the way he won the election in 2000 without also acknowledging that had Ralph Nader, who Moore strongly supported, not run, Bush might now be just an ex-Governor instead of President."	5.0	Well, At Least Bush Has Britney Spears' Vote ...	2004-06-30	44	27	17

I was really wanting to see this film when I heard about it and I saw it the first day it was in the theatre.  I was a fan of Michael Moore until I saw this film with my own two eyes.I believe that if one is going to complain about its government, that one has to vote.  If you are of voting age, and you do not vote, you have no right to complain about our government.I am still a Democrat, I have proudly served my country, I was disabled in the war that began with the collapse of the World Trade Center where I could have died (I got out about 90 seconds before the tower collapsed).  I voted for Clinton and for Gore. I am an active ""first generation"" Christian (I was raised a conservative Jew and I am now very active in my local Metropolitan Community Church, which is gay friendly and gay pastored).  But this film and the behavior and pandoring of my party's candidate for propogandists such as Michael Moore and this film... I am sorry that I have no choice to vote for a man that may be for an amendment to prevent my husband and I from being recognized as a married couple (since we are both male), and who is too conservative to me.  But between the two candidates, at least I know where President Bush stands.  I never thought I would EVER vote for a Republican, but this film and John Kerry's rhetoric has shown me that I can not trust my own party during this election.  But, I can not vote for a candidate that panders to such a liar as Michael Moore, during this election.  At least I know where President Bush stands.Michael R.

The fact is that most people who have bashed this film, have made up their minds without seeing the film first. Sort of like the people who voted for this president. They made up their minds without thinking about the issues. I think this film raises more questions than it does answers. What if Moore is right about Bush? What is the appropriate thing to do? I always love reading the stupid comments made by the Limbaugh idiots, and the right wing religious nut cases, who have no clue, or don't want to look at the real issues.

I was able to see the hidden agenda before the attack on Iraq, but everyone around me, including my partner, were all gung ho for it. They were totally brain washed by CNN, Fox and others. I felt alone. Now Michael has vindicated that feeling, and everyone is able to see what I felt and believed (of course I was following the international media and that helped).

What a stunning indictment of the Bush administration, and his heartless, conscience-less approach to promoting personal gain (the acquisition of oil and billions of dollars) hidden behind the banner of ""protecting the world against weapons of mass destruction."" Moore clearly reveals the stark lie that Bush and associates have told. What great shame Bush has brought to America, and what immense suffering he has caused the world. He and his entourage of oil mongers, along with our pretend senate and house who have continously turned a blind eye to his behavior, all of these have reversed whatever good name America had, and now it is up to us, the people, to reverse this tragedy."	5.0	The truth hurts	2004-07-08	34	18	16

If it is to convince others and bring them around to your own way of thought, then this film fails.  If the goal of such a film is to intelligently contribute to the debate/discussion at hand, then this film fails miserably.It took me four tries to sit through this entire movie.  The first time, I left when Moore not only implied, but flat out stated that all Republicans and Conservitives (by which he means anybody who does not think exactly like he does) are racist and malicious.  It became abundantly clear that Moore was in no way interested in saying anything worth hearing.  Eventualy, however, through pure force of will, I managed to sit through the entire thing, much to my chargin.  The rest of the movie was, in my opinion, no better than the first few minutes.To say that Moore plays fast and loose with the facts (as we have already seen him do with his many other films and books including his Academy Award Winning ""Bowling for Columbine"") is obvious and, most likely, besides the point: all documentaries do fudge the facts, if only a little bit.  They all of them present selected and carefully culled facts to emphasize the point they are trying to make and minimize legitimate criticism.  Moore, though, turns what is often a fine tool into a blunt instrument, clubbing viciously at opposing viewpoints and even more viciously at those that hold those viewpoints.  In fact, it seems that the target of Moore's ire is not the view, but the person, which is a major blow against his credibility as we can hear very distinctly the sound of Moore's very large axe being ground.The hostile atmosphere and vague, often incorrect, ""facts"" of this film create the overal impression that Moore is doing nothing but preaching to an already shrill quire and, perhaps, attempting to affect national politics in his own, blunt and obvious way.If you're looking for reinforcement of preconceived notions and a hearty pat on the back, this is a film for you.

Calling the movie ""lies lies lies"" etc. when there is no script, and regardless of editing, bush really said all the moronic things he said all on his own. The bush supporters need to bite the bullet and at least rent it. It's not about money, it's never been about money. In fact, Mr. Moore donates the majority of his profits.The scene of the infamous 7 minutes will instill anger in anyone who watches. I'm surprised I did not vomit in disgust. However, the most moving scene was no scene at all. A blank black screen in a dark theater was definately the most memorable movie experience of my life. If you missed it in the theater, I highly suggest watching this DVD in complete darkness.Those that call Michael Moore unamerican, fat, and other juvenile names, need to view his other work.  Watch his show ""The Awful Truth"" (which is on dvd in a 2 season boxed set). Seeing that effort in full will put your foot in their mouth, and deep.  Mr. Moore has helped so many, changed the rules of corporate slime, and made many lives better.  This Oscar winning film maker is much more than ""Roger & Me"", or ""Bowling for Columbine"".Fahrenheit 9/11 has won and deserved so many awards including the Golden Globe and People's Choice Award for best film.  I love all these other ""films"" trying to make a buck off of Moore's success by going straight to unwatchable video.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1PRIYYL60HIAM	Mikarvey	"It seems the rightists, with their pretentious parroting of the same phrases, continue to go to the extreme.Journalism? No, this film is a documentary, and as always, presents the filmmaker's perspective. A documentary is always slanted so, presenting its subject as the creator sees it. For example, a documentary about a charity might present it as needy, effective, misguided, or, perhaps, even futile - presented as the documentatian sees it and wishes to present it. In other words: his/her opinion, using supporting facts. It is important to note that documentaries are NOT scientific research.Certainly the speculation (of course not facts) of what may have been in the President's mind at that school on 9/11 were the authors opinion; however, the President's words, as recorded, were his own.Some have said this film was ""lies"", but obviously those writers had either not seen the film, or else they do not know what the word ""lie"" means. It is obvious to any observer that Moore's opinions (and those of others in the film) were merely opinions, not facts. But then the right does has trouble distinguishing between fact and interpretations thereof, as can be seen on Fox News.One writer commented that Moore is a ""great filmmaker"". I suppose this is to imply fairness on that writer's part. In my OPINION, while Moore is intelligent, cares about people & fairness, is a strong opponent to neo-facsism, an excellent investigative documentarian, and an all-around decent guy, he is not - again, my opinion - a ""great"" filmmaker.  Whatever his ego may be privately, Moore is unlikely to classify himself as a peer to Fellini, Bergman, Almodovar, etc.For eaxmple: I thought there was actually one film here that should have been two. The first half was clever, witty, funny. The second half was quite serious & sad. But given the scope of the material & subject matter, I don't know what Moore might have done otherwise. I strongly recommend the movie, whether one agrees or not. What it presents is certainly worth pondering."	4.0	Reviews are entertaining, some uninformed.	2004-08-07	45	34	11

It is difficult to disentangle truth from fiction in this movie, but it is worth approaching it in a balanced manner, since Michael Moore is anything but balanced in his approach.  This movie is NOT a documentary; Moore has no interest whatsoever in approaching his subject manner from a neutral standpoint.  It is purely propoganda, but as far as that goes, it is entertaining propoganda.  Just don't automatically take what Moore says at face value.	3.0	Worth Watching	2005-01-09	17	11	6

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"If I were judging Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" strictly for its quality, I would give it four stars rather than five. It meanders too much in its mid-section, as Moore simply goes on too long with his polemics about President Bush and his ties to the bin Laden family and other wealthy Saudis. ""Bowling for Columbine"" had a more concentrated impact and took (or at least seemed to take) fewer cheap shots. But for historical importance, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" flies off the charts in a way that few films in history ever have. Is Moore preaching to the anti-Bush choir here? Of course, but he does so in a way that his opponents cannot afford to ignore--in a way that Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe preached against slavery in the 1850s. That's because Moore's essential purpose is bigger than simply to bash Bush; once Moore gets to the war in Iraq, he sweeps away all criticism in a heartbreaking, horrifying depiction of the carnage of war. (Warning: Moore does not flinch from showing the burned, mangled bodies of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians, so the squeamish should stay away.) The film's most heartbreaking section depicts Lila Lipscomb--a nice, upright, patriotic mom from Moore's home town of Flint, Mich., who slowly succumbs to grief and despair as she comes to the realization that her son died fighting an unnecessary, ill-conceived war. (Some have accused Moore of using Lipscomb for propaganda purposes. Did he? Perhaps. But Lipscomb clearly wanted her story to be told.) Of course Moore wouldn't be Moore without a few merry pranks. At one point, finding out that none of the senators who voted for the Patriot Act had actually read it, he rents an ice cream truck and rides around Capitol Hill reading the bill's text over the truck's loudspeaker. A little later, he and a disillusioned young Marine walk around Capitol Hill, trying to get congressmen to sign their children up for military service in Iraq. But those merry pranks, as always, have a point as deadly serious as the war footage. You can quibble with specific points of this movie, and it can't be taken as straight reporting. But as an ""op-ed piece,"" as Moore himself calls it, it makes a very persuasive case that our current president and his Cabinet have been led by greed, stupidity and vanity into making grievous errors of judgment that emperil this country. This is an unforgettable portrait of a moment in American history, etched in acid, tears, and blood."	5.0	Not a perfect movie, but an extraordinarily important one.	2004-06-26	15	8	7
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ANH955RONWQDC	MinnieBannister	This is a brilliant film.  What is most damning is not any political slant that Moore may be projecting, but the video footage of George W. Bush.  Nothing Moore could say could make him appear any more incompetent and foolish than he already is.  I also loved the numerous clips where Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell and Rumsfeld all link Iraq to 911 and Al Quaida.  Juxtapose that with Cheney's whopping lie during the VP debate where he denied linking the two.The connect the dots with the Saudi's and Bin Laden family was fun.  But the film has a lot of poignant moments as well, including the military mom that lost her son in Iraq.  Perhaps the scariest moment of the film wasn't the sound and footage of the terrorist attack of 911 or Karl Rove putting spit into his hair (yuk!), but Bush sitting there for 7 minutes continuing with his photo op after being told the country was under attack.  Most people would have politely excused themselves and looked into what was going on.  AWOL again.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A13PH2F9LAMASI	M. J. Kenoyer	"First off, I am amazed by the one-star reviewers on this forum who spend their one or two paragraphs' worth of commentary on Michael Moore's character rather than on his FILM (which is supposed to be the subject of these reviews). One, this is oddly typical of right-wingers to indulge in character assaults when they can't form coherent arguments to back what they support; and two, this is telling in that most of said one-star reviewers probably haven't even bothered to see the film.I have to admit, I am not a huge Michael Moore fan and was initially reluctant to see his most recent movie. I had viewed him as somewhat of a blowhard, albeit a mostly well-intentioned one--a Rush Limbaugh of the left, as is oft his comparison. I was already against the war in Iraq even before the first boots hit the ground there, so I felt that his movie was ""preaching to the choir"" when my husband and I went to see it for the first time, and didn't feel Moore's movie would offer anything I didn't already know or think for myself.After having seen it (and afterwards buying the DVD), I am glad to admit that I'd judged this movie--and Moore--quite wrongly. Fahrenheit 9/11 not only takes a compassionate view of the 9/11 victims and families, but also of the soldiers going to fight a war that a lot of us Stateside, and all over the world, didn't want. By taking the focus off of himself--which is thankful, given that he can ""grandstand"" a lot by pulling some really cute ice-cream truck prankery that doesn't do a whole lot of good)--he's able to send home a lot of compelling messages about the rife corruption in the Bush administration and how it is tearing not only the Iraqi people, but our own people, apart.Although I didn't previously dispute the wrong reasons for going to war in Iraq that Moore brings up, I was really surprised (and frankly sickened) to learn about how deeply our administration (and the Bush family) is entrenched in the oil biz and the Saudi government--which is arguably equally as oppressive as the Taliban, especially in its treatment of women. The right-wingers' hair-splitting of how Moore ""twists the facts"" is lost here; he has clearly done some great research and backs up his claims with interviews and official documents that underscore the coverups and corruption in the Bush administration.Thus, most of what Moore presents in this movie is believable and credible; it blows my mind that many on the right can dispute the perspectives of military officials' interviews, documents, and film strips of the President himself in action--or inaction, is more like it. The most compelling of these perspectives is that of Lila Lipscomb, an admitted conservative Democrat who supports the military fervently, but mourns her son's death in a war that was not necessary.All of this being said, the movie is not without its problems or flaws. I already mentioned the ice-cream truck shenanigans--typical Moore of anyone who's ever caught his cable show--and also his portrayal of the pre-war Iraq being an almost Western-like fairyland in which everyone was happy and complicit under Saddam's totalitarian regime.This latter portrayal is disingenuous; but it underlines the point that replacing one totalitarian regime with another, especially under the false pretense of ""democracy"", is wrong--and this is the crux of what I think Michael Moore is trying to say. I really came out of the theatre after watching this movie with a renewed respect for Moore and his filmmaking. He has a big heart and a profound message, and this movie is definitely worth seeing."	4.0	Has its problems, but overall is a worthwhile watch	2004-10-21	41	29	12

Mainly it is about political, militairy and economical manipulation and about the cynical and macabre way this game is played. Offcourse it is aimed at the Bush administration and US policy in general. I think Michael Moore does a terrific and courages job in showing the machinations behind the Bush election and his war efforts. It mercilessy gives us a look at a stolen presidency (with the shocking footage of a hammering Al Gore in the Senate while us representatives try to oppose the outcome of the elctions) and the range of lies, crinimal intentions and acts by the Bush administration. For me, it confirmed things I already was worried about. For instance, the support Bush senior gave to Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Also the war on Iraq was a deliberate attempt to attack this nation, for reasons which had nothing to do with arms of mass destruction.Moore does not go as far as accusing Bush for ignoring or 'staging' the 9/11 WTC attacks, but he clearly points out the (hidden)plane flights for the Bin Laden family after the attacks, and the way (public and private) investigations to the causes of the attacks were blocked. The question remains: what did Bush c.s. know or deliberatly did't WANT to know in relation to the WTC attacks? just look at the benefits for the administraion (patriot laws, wars on taliban and hussein, oil reserves in iraq, profits for us business, safety of israel) and one day, as every US politican or priest always claims, the truth will set us free.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A350RQ2HO91890	M. McGraw	"I think the best comparison I can make regarding Moore is that he is a magician. Magicians achieve their goal through diversion. Instead of a stage and disappearing (attractive) lady assistants, Moore is a magician whose medium is film and politics. And like most magicians, Moore puts on an entertaining show.Fahrenheit 9/11, the latest in Micheal Moore's successful line of ""documentary"" films, is cunningly edited. I give it two stars for that. Unfortunately, I have to with-hold the other three because it's masquerading as something it's not; a documentary. Moore's trademarks are his crafty editing to lead the viewers to the wrong conclusions and ""facts"" without context.It starts right away, when in the beginning of the film, Moore makes it seem that FOX News called Florida for Bush when all of the other networks were calling for Gore. In reality, FOX called Florida for Gore just minutes after NBC and CBS did. When it was realized that the vote was too close to call, CBS and CNN retracted their call for Gore at 10:00PM. FOX retracted their call for Gore four hours later, at 2:00AM. It's obvious that Moore was trying to tap into the perception that FOX News is partial to President Bush.A bit later, Moore insinuates that President Bush had not read the security briefing on August 6, 2001, which contained information that Osama Bin Laden planned to attack America by hijacking planes, because the title was vague. He then shows a video clip of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice announcing the title of the briefing as ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US."" Only Moore claims that Pres. Bush did not read the briefing. Further, Moore doesn't show the viewer that the briefing's *contents* were vague. It did not say that Bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft for attacks, but instead to use the hijackings to demand the release of US held associates of Bin Laden. The briefing did not specify what kind of attacks Bin Laden was planning, just that the planning was taking place.One of his facts without context in the film is the segment on the Saudis, including members of the Bin Laden family, who were flown out of the US. Moore creates the impression that they were flown out with special treatment on orders from the White House while all other flights were still grounded. In fact, all of the Saudi flights took place after airspace was reopened. Also, the 9/11 Commission found that each flight was properly scrutinized by authorities (including the FBI) before they departed. There was nothing sinister about these flights, no matter how hard Moore tries to imply otherwise.In all, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an entertaining film. However, Moore cannot be taken seriously as an arbiter of truth. He arranges and manipulates video clips, newspaper headlines, and commentary to lead the viewer to false conclusions which support his political worldview.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ASTPJBNLHPE87	mmcmullen007	One thing I must say about all of the Michael Moore films I've seen so far as a sixteen soon to be seventeen year old, none of his documentaries are dull. Even if I disagree with some of Mikes points (one of the great rights of being an American)his films still catch my attention the whole time. However, you aren't reading this for an essay on how muych I love and praise Michael Moore. You're most likely here to read my opinion of the movie. Well, the movie was very entertaining (very important for documentaries) and informative at the same time. Many documentaries are all facts but no fun which is almost pointless because no one wantys to listen to the monotone Biology teacher talk about the wild life. (or Ben Stein sell Eye Contacts or whatever) The movie at time can be bias which isn't anything abnormal. (Spoiler alert, everyone has a personal bias of some degree, so get over it) However, once again Michael Moore does not pull any punches. This movie is next to flawless and I encourage mostly anyone to watch it. I hope you find my first review helpful.	5.0	Michael Moore at it again (Excuse all spelling mistakes, never said I was the spelling bee champion)	2011-08-03	4	2	2

What Moore has done is taken bits and pieces of creditable news and chopped it down into very small pieces and tainted it. For example, during one point of the movie Bush is talking about how he doesn't think about ""him,"" very often. Moore implies that this is Osama BinLaden but, Bush never states that this is who he is talking about or implies it. Moore has created a movie that is very similiar to the type of propaganda the Soviet's used in their own country, or even the propaganda in Nazi Germany. This movie is filled with clips to stir emotions. He uses these emotions to try to lead one to a conclusion that has no fact. This movie is just meant to misinform Americans who do not keep themselves informed on a regular basis. Moore has created one of the greatest pieces of propaganda in Soviet history.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A228JH8V9Y700G	MortensOrchid	I had to watch this movie twice the first time.  It was so confusing I had to sit down and write out a flow chart of who was who and what each connection was to each other.  That was the only way I could even attempt to grasp this huge conspiracy theory.This is Michael Moore's masterpiece, a throughly researched and picked apart documentary of how September 11th could have would have should have and how it's lead to our Iraq occupation.  After having watched this, I didn't feel one way or another about it.  I don't feel conspired against, I don't feel deceived, and I don't feel angry.  It was clear to me after the Gulf War of the early 90s that we thought there was going to be a revolution and Saddam Hussein would be ousted by his own people, but it didn't happen.  We were wrong, it was a lightening war, and now our gas prices are through the roof.  We thought that we were going to find Ousama Bin Lauden quickly, we haven't yet.  And, perhaps most importantly of all, Michael Moore wanted to vote out George W Bush, and he didn't.Having looked back on all these things, I am rather amazed yet at the same time I feel an odd understanding of things.  The reason I do not give this movie 5 stars is because it is a personal attack against George W and not truly against his political stance.  On the day that the towers were hit, he was in an elementary school class and they timed his reaction once the news was whispered to him.  If I were him, I would sit there with a blank look on my face too.  Who's in charge here?  I AM.  I'd just be glad I didn't wet my pants.  He likes to portray George as stupid, I don't believe he's stupid.  And when I am looking at the state of the economy I don't blame him for it unlike everyone else.  I blame myself, like a lot of others should do.  You choose so many things for yourselves, world.  You blame George for your state of unemployment, rising costs, and dwindling finances, but those who yell the loudest don't get off their lazy asses and put our shoulders to the wheel.And, I write this long after George won the second election.  That I was shocked at, because the people seemed so angry.  But why did he win again when Michael Moore made such an effort to call for a coupe?  Because people are angry, but they don't care enough to vote.  I was amazed as angry as people are that they simply do not care.Still, this is a good movie.  Michael Moore did a fine research project inflected with his black humor.  It's a good time.  Power to the people.	4.0	Where's my flow chart?	2005-10-21	13	6	7

Bush becoming President.  Also protests during the 2001 inauguration which we were not shown on any of our TV stations.2.  Then it is about Bush's business ventures and his family and associate links between the Saudis.  (This movie touches the tip of the iceberg - House of Bush, House of Saud or Dude, Where's my Country are highly recommended)3.  Fear used by the media and government to promote the Iraq war.4.  How are civil liberties are being taken away. An old man is questioned by the FBI for merely saying that he does not agree with President Bush.  A peace group is infiltrated.5.  If we want to stop terrorism - we should start with our country first.  We are shown the awful excuse for homeland security in Oregon.6.  A little snippet of Iraq before we invaded.7.  Soldiers, their pay cuts, disabilities.Overall this movie shows us stuff that our media is either to lazy or too scared to show us.  Please don't think that this is a movie which bashes Bush. You will be missing out tremendously by not seeing this documentary.  The most important part of this film, in my opinion, was the last 5 minutes. When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not understand what the heck Mr. Moore was trying to get at in his narrative towards the end.  The second time I saw this movie, I finally understood what he meant/ and what point he was trying to make. I'm not going to ruin that part for you.

While he makes great arguments, I just felt like he was forcing my hand a little too hard to have me believe everything.  Some of his theories are convincing, but on a general level, I found his documentary extremely opinionated (then again, it's Michael Moore right?).  It just felt like I was being pressured into believing something, which sometimes seemed a little far-fetched.While I appreciated Michael Moore's ""gesture"" by trying to open everyone's eyes to the reality of the situation and different quite probable theories, it felt a little too like ""force-feeding"" for my taste.

Despite the almost weekly barrage of negative news reports, Govt. reports, Book releases and even movie releases, depicting a President that is woefully over his head, these supporters are as rock solid, ""steadfast"" if you will, in their faith of Bush as many of them are in their fundamental faith of God.Is this good? Well maybe. It shows character but it also infers a certain amount of innocence. President Bush could be characterized as ""steadfast"". Well, Merriam-Webster defines ""steadfast"" thusly, firmly fixed in place : IMMOVABLE b : not subject to change. As you can see being ""steadfast"" depending on application can be a good or bad thing. Let's look at a related word ""intransigence"" refusing to compromise or to abandon an extreme position or attitude : UNCOMPROMISING b : IRRECONCILABLE. To the Bushphobes, this word describes President Bush more accurately. If you are a Bushphile have you really checked the overwhelming amount of unfavorable independent information coming forth. Have you read or viewed any of the less than positive information available regarding our President, have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?Fahrenheit 9/11In a surreal scene, our President, G.W. Bush is reading a book to a class of first graders in a Florida elementary school. After having been told that an airplane had hit a World Trade Center Tower in New York previously, George went into the classroom as not to keep these six and seven year olds waiting. While in the classroom, he is informed by a subordinate, that a second plane has hit the other tower. Does George excuse himself stating that he has an emergency to attend too? No, George sits there, sometimes reading ""My Pet Goat"", sometimes staring off, for almost SEVEN MINUTES!Michael Moore's controversial film begins by rehashing the equally controversial and extremely polarizing 2000 Presidential election. Though rushing through the Florida shenanigans, making some interesting points but with time restraints barely touching on the variety of previously reported inconsistencies.From there, Moore moves on to the 9/11 catastrophe itself and thankfully, he tastefully refrains from showing actual footage of the disaster instead concentrating on bystanders reactions, generally showing people looking up but resisting the temptation to go there with the camera.Then, in the previously mentioned schoolroom scene, Moore suggests that maybe the President is reflecting upon his missteps, such as not having at least one meeting with his own head of counterterrorism or not reading the briefing of Aug 6, 2001 stating al Qeada intended to attack the United States soon by hijacking airplanes.Michael Moore goes on to characterize other facets of previous and following events which, in his and my opinion, illustrate the questionable actions of the President and or his staff.Moore indicates that in each of G.W.'s failed business ventures he had Saudi and even the bin Laden family financial backing, which in Moore's opinion have extended a dark Bush/Saudi/bin Laden alliance, ultimately the reason 142 Saudis including bin Laden family members being rushed out of the United States after Sept. 13th.But Moore's real salvos are reserved for the ill conceived, ill planned and ultimately unnecessary invasion of Iraq. This segment starts out with White House, counterterrorism chief, Richard Clark basically saying the Bush administration wanted to and planned to invade Iraq from before they took office and that Afghanistan and al-Qeada were an inconvenient diversion. Of course Moore extrapolates that for his case that Bush marginalized the continuing hunt for bin Laden to gear up for the now infamous Bush War.But hey, I'm giving away too much of this fascinating movie. See It!CONCLUSIONMichael Moore is truly in his element as he excoriates the clueless G.W. Bush. This movie reminds me of a roast except for this recipient, the jibes are real and not in fun, however, there are indeed many humorous moments albeit satirical in nature.My favorite humorous part was when Moore initially depicted a burning map of Afghanistan set to the theme song from the popular TV show, Bonanza, then showing the cast (G.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfield and Tony Blair) dressed in Bonanza style cowboy attire.Of course, the Bush clan paints this movie as a pack of scurrilous lies with no basis in truth but then, why does it jive with the facts I do know and why does it have a conspicuous ring of truth?Back to our Bushphiles. If you intend to vote for G.W. but haven't seen or read anything negative about the President, at least see this movie. This is the most important presidential election I can remember in forty years. If you see this movie and still want to vote for Bush, fine I can live with that. What I can't live with are the pig headed uninformed sheep who like three famous monkeys, refuse to see, hear and speak any ....! Those people aren't Bushphiles.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1TDE5O3TK91ZH	Mr. G. Hill	"Just by reading some of the hysterical reaction to Michael Moore's work, you can see how important his work is. Michael Moore - much to the chagrin of some politicians and some of the people on this web page -  has carefully and methodically collected and verified a wide range of evidence that could completely change your view of the whole `War on Terrorism'.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent piece of journalism and research. It is a documentary presented in an intriguing and energetic style. At times, the work contains a touch of lightheartedness, but this is derived from the almost surreal actions of the government rather than any disrespect to the 9/11 victims. Indeed, Moore himself lost a colleague in the attack, and he documents the heart breaking loss of the mother of a dead US soldier.Sure, Moore ironically resembles a politician at times, with plenty of slant and bias mixed in with his work. But the fact remains that the evidence is hard and solid. Moore reveals a series of remarkable and at times shocking facts about the US government's behavior up to, during, and after the tragic events of 9/11.America (and my country, Britain) profess to be the `land of the free', a country that promotes freedom of speech and press. From seeing some of the people on this site you can see how important that is. You can bury your head in the sand and scream ""Moore is a liar! It's not true!"" or you can watch the documentary, check the evidence, review the facts, and decide for yourself."	4.0	An important and interesting piece of work	2004-09-12	11	0	11

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1977ZR4KQYZ4J	mrgrieves08	This film is for all of those people who still naively believe that we live in a free and just society. The facts that Moore details in this film, the myriad of connections between the Bush family and powerful families in Saudi Arabia, including the bin Ladens, the events surrounding the virtual overthrow of free and fair elections in 2000, the lies promoted by the administration in order to promote a pre-planned war with Iraq, the feeble attempts to bring to justice those responsible for the attacks and gross mismanagement of the so-called war on terror, the rape of the US constitution and erosion of civil liberties after 9-11, the ignorance, hypocrisy, and above all the gross arrogance that President Bush and his cronies have displayed for the citizens of this country and the world, even if only 10% of it were true, would STILL make the Bush Administration (Corporation, perhaps, more fittingly) the most corrupt, devisive, disingenuous, immoral and socially destructive administration to ever hold power in the United States.Given the current state of the American media, where the ability to question what our government tells us has know become almost non-existent, Moore's film comes as a much needed voice of reason and sanity at a time in American history that is most dark. Some may come away from this film thinking that the forces of evil will always triumph, which is understandable considering the events of the last four years; however, this film also shows that there are still many people willing to stand up and fight for those sacred American ideals of freedom and justice for all, no matter how determined the powerful interests are to silence them. As citizens in a free society it is our duty as Americans to be informed about the events that Moore chronicles and whether one is a republican, democrat or independent, it is every person's responsibility to face the ugly facts presented here. In this film Michael Moore has simply given a perspective that is all but dead in American journalism; it is up to each American to determine what those facts mean to us. No matter how strong the forces of evil seem to become, they can only attain and extend their power with the willing assent of the individuals in society, which is ultimately where the true power lies. It is up to each of us to determine just how this power will be expressed, if we fail to recognize this we have only ourselves to blame for the results.	5.0	An Explosive Expose of Bush's Ominous Rise to Power	2004-07-10	22	16	6

We all know that Moore is a bit of a windbag and can exagerrate (for instance, the segment detailing pre-war Iraq as a child-friendly wonderland is too much to believe)- but behind all of the bluster there is a solid foundation in fact. And if you're going to claim that the film is nothing but lies, try actually... I don't know... WATCHING the film first.From Saudi oil friendships... to inattention in office... to corporate conventions to decide who gets what part of Iraq's remains... to the pain of parents whose child died for no good reason... to the manipulation of the American public by fear and terror... It's just a shame. It makes me embarrased and ashamed to be an American.The general sense I get about Bush is that he is out of touch with reality, while his admistration and family know *exactly* what they're doing and uses him as a mere figurehead. Whether Bush is a knowing conspirator playing dumb or an unwitting accomplice who is genuinely incompetent, I am not certain. What I am certain of is that this man does not deserve the presidency.I am not a liberal. I am not a democrat. I am not a republican. I am simply a person who wants the best for my country, and that is not something that seems to be on Bush's mind.I voted for Bush in 2000.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1SHPX0VCXMRXT	"Mr. S. A. Lukacs ""Simbob"""	"When watching any Michael Moore documentary, it is very difficult to seperate the politics that inform the film with the actual filmmaking style. Just glancing across the other reviews it is easy to see that he divides people perhaps even more than George W. himself. But are these differences purely down to politics, rather than filmmaking. It would not suprise me to discover that those who so fervently defend the film are Bush sceptics, and those that attack it so vigorously are at least partially behind their president. It is very difficult to make seperate the rhetoric from the technique, but I will aim to do so.Firstly, I should declare that I am staunchly against the war in Iraq. I have attended a protest march when Bush came to London and have not wavered in my stance. However, I have wavered in my stance on Mr. Moore since seeing his One Man Show at the Roundhouse Theatre, reading his books and seeing his latest documentaries, allied with a bit of background research. And so, with this rather rambling introduction, we come to Fahrenheit 9/11.Fahrenheit 9/11 is almost a companion piece to Moore's earlier film, Bowling for Columbine, trading on similar themes of fear, misinformation and corporate irresponsibility. However, while Columbine was sprawling, scattershot and taking aim at more targets than an Olympic archer, there is no doubt that Fahrenheit has it's sights set on one prize - Mr. Bush. And boy, does it get ugly.The film contains copious amounts of footage of Bush appearing stupid, arrogant, insecure, cold and many other negative adjectives. It also attempts to put across the opinion that since 9/11, the Bush administration has used fear to push through a very hardline agenda, culminating with the war in Iraq. Much of this argument is very powerful. Some of it, however, is not.In one respect, Fahrenheit is one of Moore's more restrained works. He keeps himself off camera much more (some of Columbine's more mawkish moments involved Moore pushing himself as a ""man-of-the-people"" at every opportunity, which considering his alleged behaviour at this years' Cannes seems in hindsight a bit rich), and his subject matter is definately more focused, but it also contains some of his most blatantly manipulative work - in particular the scene where the mother of a dead American soldier (who was fighting in Iraq), goes to Washington to protest. When Moore's camera watches as she breaks down, the scene appears to achieve nothing more than make one woman very upset. It is also very crass, insensitive, and devoid of any shred of intellectual argument. Yes, it is very sad that a mother has lost her son, but showing her crying does not automatically make the war wrong. It is also very patronising to assume that the audience cannot comprehend the complexities of the war, and that you have to reduce the entire argument into a purely emotional, and quite crude, stunt.Having said this, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the film also contains some very powerful sequences, in particular the reconstruction of 9/11 with sound only over a black screen. As with several sequences from Columbine, it sends a shiver down your spine, and reminds you that when he restrains himself, Moore can be a very affecting filmmaker. Another effective moment is some disturbingly frank soldiers discussing their choice of music when going into battle. Suffice to say, it is alarmingly tasteless, and the scene serves as a damning indictment of the mindset of some of the troops.Another problem arises with the attacks on Bush. As I stated earlier, I find the man a menace to the world - and the footage of him is very masterfully assembled; both funny and frightening in equal measure. However, it is difficult to see how this boils down to anything more than just a personal attack on the President. The man himself is a prime target for such attacks, and they are legitimate, but the film's continuing reliance on this seems to indicate either an unwillingness or an inability to engage with the subject on any kind of advanced intellectual level, and comes across purely as a more sophisticated version of name calling. This again seems a rather patronising over simplification of the issues.The main problem is the terribly one sided nature of the opinions being aired. Audience's should be given enough credit to judge both sides of an argument and come to their own conclusions. This is obviously not on Moore's agenda, and indeed filmmakers right the way back to Eisenstein have used film to push their particular ideologies, but Moore frequently undermines himself by lurching into ill concieved, borderline extremist tirades. This is made the more frustrating by the fact that he also makes very pertinent points, and is clearly a very gifted filmmaker and producer of propoganda. It is easy, though, to see why many (even Bush haters) find him difficult to stomach, and why many find it easy to dismiss him as a ""nut"" or simply ignore him. There are enough right wing nuts out there, so maybe having a few left wing ones is no bad thing. It could be argued, though, that such basic, simplified, and (dare I say it) sometimes inaccurate and purposefully misleading arguments do more harm to the cause than good.Overall, Fahrenheit is another solid, well constrcuted, frequently funny, and sometimes moving film from Moore. However, it's arguments are extremely light weight and one sided, and it is by no means Moore's best work (Columbine, despite it's lack of focus is much more compelling; and Roger and Me remains his masterpiece). If you want a masterclass in propoganda - then this is the film for you. If you want a well thought out, balanced, intelligent and well informed argument, then you would be best advised to look elsewhere."	3.0	Moore of the same.	2004-09-30	14	2	12
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1KI6L82M5RAHQ	mr. snrub	"Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is definitely essential viewing for anyone who claims to call themselves American. Even after ""President"" Bush's recent re-election, anyone who felt that re-electing him was a good idea needs to see this movie.It begins by presenting proof that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney did indeed cheat their way into the White House in the 2000 presidential election. How so? By disenfranchising thousands of Floridian Democrats who were not Bush supporters (""You can usually tell 'em by the color of their skin"" Moore points out) with the help of his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush. And, with the help of Knucklehead Bush Sr.'s Supreme Court buddies, settle the election in Bush's favor.Moore then takes us to what is easily the darkest day yet in the 21st Century - September 11, 2001.But, there are three key facts that the Bush Administration has supressed from the American public since 9/11.1.) A month ahead of time, Bush, Cheney, and all the White House underlings were well aware that Al Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden, was planiing to launch a massive attack on the United States. Bush apparently didn't want to lift a finger to do anything. Ya know, that might interfere with his vacation.2.) As the terrorist attacks took place, Bush was reading MY PET GOAT with some Floridian elemetary school kids. What e was even doing there to start with is a complete mystery to me, but what is more infuriating is that after being informed of the attacks, Bush continued to linger in the classroom for 7 minutes -SEVEN MINUTES!!!!!!!!! - before getting up and doing something. Any staunch Bush supporter will probably say ""He'd be scaring the little children."" What's more important in that situation-Not scaring the kids, or saving the lives of all those people?3.) The Bush family has had long term relationships with the bin Laden family, all in the interest of money. They have had investments from the bin Laden's in Bush's oil franchises for some thime (this could explain Bush's tip-toeing around the use of alternative, non-polluting energy sources.) Two days after 9/11, Bush had several dozen wealthy Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, transported out of the United States, when they may have been able to lead us to Osama bin Laden, all at the behest of the Saudi government, who, of course, have some financial sway over the Bushes.That's all I really need to say in this review. The film really speaks for itself, and I don't want to take any of Michael Moore's investagatory credit from him. Bottom line-Forget what you think of Michael Moore. You owe it to yourself as an American to see why Bush definetely should NOT have been within 50 miles of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a true eye-opener to the misguided American who is under the erroneous belief that George W. Bush is anything more than a ""lame-duck President""."	5.0	George W.

Michael's Moore film does an excellent job in portraying a point of view, in a way that is more powerful than Faherhype 911. However, as a filmmaker, and with a bit of research, it is a no brainier that this movie needs to be dismissed as a factual movie.I could go through the whole movie to point out how the art of editing was used to manipulate footage so that it would align with a point of view, but I'll only use two examples for the sake of time.Example 1:Moore showed us a crass statement from Bush that said: ""Some people call you the elite, I call you my base"" as he stood there among a bunch of rich folks, despite that the uncropped shot of that speech showed that Bush was sitting next to Al Gore at that fundraiser, not for a campaign, but for a children's hospital where they raised 10 million for the charity.Example 2:Moore uses the article from the Washington Post about bush spending 42% of his first seven month on vacation. Those 42%, as it reported in the Washington Post, include weekends, time traveled for presidential engagements, and time spent with foreign leaders at Camp David.Manipulation of footage was pretty much throughout the movie. As a movie expressing a point of view, as a filmmaker, it was powerful and well done, but as a factual documentary, well, it doesn't hold."	3.0	A fair perspective of 911	2004-10-31	34	19	15

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2Q5SEOBXHEFPA	MsfStl	"I saw this movie on Mon. June 28th with a packed house in St. Louis. I went in trying to view the movie with an open mind knowing that it is not a true documentary where the director follows a timeline of events and lets the viewer come to their own conclusion. No, Michael Moore let's us know from the get go that he has an agenda to sell and he is going to sell his way, with direct, sometimes overhanded, and emotive, but ultimately factual. What Mr.Moore does provide, even though it is sometimes disjointed and ""leaning over the line like the Tinman in the 'Wizard of Oz'"" I.E., He states that Bush allowed a large contingent of bin Ladens and other Saudis, mostly students, to leave the United States immediately after 9/11, while commercial flights were still grounded. 'In fact, the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission has found that most, if not all, of these evacuations took place after Sept. 13, when the ban on commercial flights was lifted.'- New York Post 6/22.In the film, President Bush says of the war in Iraq,.. 'The fight for civilization.' Yet Moore shows the mismanaged and under-trained, and oft immature qualities of our young, 'lower-mid class to poor' soldiers who are doing the dirty work. A point that even the right-wing Fox pundit, Bill O'Rielly,t cannot deride, for even O'Rielly has stated in his own column...""Clearly, something is very wrong when inexperienced, poorly trained military reservists are allowed to run wild and abuse prisoners. Clearly, something is wrong when enormous mistakes are made in the occupation of a country whose defeat was a foregone conclusion. I mean everybody knew the USA would defeat Saddam, so why was the aftermath of the war so screwed up? Is this another intelligence failure? Is this a strategic failure on the part of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his team? We don't know because Mr. Bush rarely holds anyone publicly accountable for doing his or her job poorly.""The 'biggest' (pun intended) weakness of the movie is, Michael Moore. He actually becomes a detractor to his own message when he adds his contrived diatribe to the segement,'What was Bush thinking?' It ran like this: President Bush, with knowledge of the first WTC attack, sits with a classroom of children reading the book 'My Pet Goat', when his assistant breaks in to tell him of the second crash, Moore narrates with a glib cartoonish sarcasm while Pres. Bush sits with a 'deer-caught-in-the-headlights' look for over seven minutes AFTER he was told of the SECOND World Trade Center crash. Michael Moore unfortunately takes away from the classic footage, he should have let the film speak for itself.Another clear idea is the 'elite' tie-in. Connecting the dots is easy, from H.W. Bush to James Baker, to the Saudis, to Cheney and Halliburton and so forth. Clearly, the Saudis have an 'in' with the Bush's and their cronies. Ultimately, with this film Michael Moore preaches to the choir. The crossover audience between Mel Gibson's 'Passion of Christ' and Fahrenheit 9/11 is very small. Is it propaganda? Yes. Is it as Bill O'rielly states, ""na zi-like"" propaganda? No! The points Michael Moore makes are factual and the reality is sometimes disconcerting, but while the un-informed may wallow away in their ignorant bliss, others must fight an unpopular battle for truth and justice, and here, Mr. Moore is at his best. He ultimately gives purpose for anyone with a conscience to want to know 'WHY?....exactly why are we in Iraq?' Moore underscores 'Oil', but leaves numerous avenues open for discourse. I saw this movie on the same day as the 'secret' transfer of Coalition power to Iraq, June 28th. I left thinking the transfer was ceremonial and not another Bush 'triumph for democracy' as several leading news networks have claimed, for we are still losing our countrymen, both soldiers and contractors because....why?See the movie, judge for yourself"	5.0	Are we polarized yet?	2004-07-30	17	12	5

The most important aspect of this film is the heartbreaking footage it contains - if you hate Moore and can't see past this then your not going to appreciate it as he is usually present in either voiceover or person - however if the man himself does not offend you then you should find yourself saddened by much of what you see, and these images are REAL regardless of how they are montaged to persuade the viewer. For example Pre-war Iraq may not have been the quite the free and easy place Moore portrays it in this film yet the dead bodies we see are not staged, nor is suffering of humans in front of the camera - all of it directly tied in with the Bush policies.Moore shows us footage which should disturb, and while there may be violins playing in the background (literally) it is important footage which should be seen.	5.0	Should convert a few fence sitters at least	2004-07-16	12	11	1

It tells us in no uncertain terms why war exists.  If anyone wants to keep someone from enlisting in the military, just be sure the potential enlistee views this documentary first.  All such ""patriotic"" notions will instantly disappear when they learn how cynically they are being used and killed, how for many hundreds of years they have been, like so much meat.  This is an amazing documentary, one everyone should see, required viewing by every high school junior (that would be the day!).

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AWZR0O65DL2Q	Nameless Faceless User	True to Michael Moore's movies, he tends to present a biased and opinionated view of the facts - not that this is so much a bad thing, since the complex issues surrounding 9/11 have been spoon fed to us by biased sources.  For example, I do not believe Moore's presentation of Iraq to be a happy and healthy society before the U.S. bombed it.  Nor do I believe that we intentionally targeted civilians.Kudos for not resorting to shocking images of the World Trade Center, images which are already burned in our minds.  The most terrifying footage of this film is the root menu of the DVD, before the movie starts - video of a confused President.If only 25 percent of this movie is accurate, it is pretty scary.  If only 50 percent of this movie is factual, it is terrifying.  And, if there is any truth at all in this film, then everyone must see it.  Maybe Michael could be a little less preachy in his next film and present an unbiased look at the issues.  Give people more credit to think for themselves.  Then, more would take his films seriously.

This disturbs me for three reasons:1. It means you have too much time on your hands and you have nothing better to do than write a negative review and waste space on Amazon.2. Or this means the people who do it are suffering from paranoia and equate Michael Moore with the boogeyman and they fear him so much that they need to write negative reviews about every single product of his without even reading it or seeing it.3. Or there are people who need some anger management therapy because when they think about Michael Moore that they are about to crap in their pants and they are so angry that they go to all his products and review them negatively - even going into other countries websites!There is freedom of speech in America.

Micheal Moore is to the democrats what Leni Riefentstahl was to the Nazis. For those of you who do not know who Riefenstahl was, she was the director of Triumph of Will, the biggest Nazi propaganda film of all times. Michael Moore shows President George W Bush to be someone who does not know what he is doing. It shows scenes of President Bush before he was president and claims that it was scenes of him on vacation during his presidency.  Obviously Bush did go on vacation during his presidency, but he also used some of his vacation to go and visit wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The tactics employed by two marines to get kids to enlist in the military is shocking, but the real highlight of Fahrenheit 9/11 are the revelations of President Bush and his ties to the Bin Laden's and the Saudi Oil partners.  All the bashing of Fahrenheit 9/11 from pro-Bush supporters should appreciate the First Amendment; something that the Bush regime has been trying to supress since he came to office.  Back on topic though, Moore combines footage of Bush as a Florida kindergarten the morning of September 11, 2001, as well as Bush on vacation, which is just about all the time.  From the negative reviews I've read of the film, most of them are from people who haven't even seen the film, and it's a shame.

It is this sentiment that led Thomas Paine to say, ""It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government."" Noam Chomsky, a critic of American foreign policy, writes:The concept ""anti-American"" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as ""anti-Soviet."" That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture.In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as ""anti-Italian."" It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.It's pretty obvious that the critics of this movie who call Moore Anti-American can't see beyond their Republican noses. Yes, you can be a critic of the American government and a patriot at the same time. Wow! What a concept! If any Repulicans and their chicken hawk friends knew history, they'd know that Jefferson advocated a revolution every 20 years just to keep the government from getting out of control. Moore is a true patriot in the old sense of the word.The ""new"" patriots like Hannity and Limbaugh are totalitarians wrapped in the stars and stripes, depending on followers too dumb to see what they're really up to. Most Americans can't even recall when we were Saddam's best friends - that's when he was gassing the Kurds. Why didn't we get rid of him then?The fact that the US Government encourages trade with China, a Communist country, is and always will be a slap in the face to the veterans of the Vietnam war, who were told they were over there fighting for FREEDOM from Communism. We also do trade with Vietnam, as if they are no longer Communist. Does something stink here? Trouble is, we have had a government that for a long, long time, we can't trust around the corner, and an uneducated citizenry with a very short memory. No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're stupid. I do listen to right wing radio, and never heard anyone knocking trade with China - instead they knock legitimate protests against it, like the WTO protest. Whose side are the chickenhawks on anyway?Whenever rich fat-a**ed chicken hawks are telling you to send your poor or working class kid over to fight for oil for Haliburton under some false pretext, it's time for a change.I disliked Bowling for Columbine, but I have to hand it to Moore for this one.

Instead I will simply state the truth: there are wrong facts in this movie.1. The Saudi flights out of the U.S.A. were cleared by Richard Clarke, not by George Bush, so why even bring it up?2. The Carlyle Group, a military supplies group of which George Bush Sr. was a major affiliate of, was in the process of creating a missile program that would benefit the both the Bush family and the Saudi family when if it was sold to the military. However, this missile program was actually cancelled by the Bush Administration. Kinda hard to get money out of a cancelled program.3. The film suggests that most of the media was swayed by Fox News to say that Bush had actually won the Florida electoral vote. Fox News, however, called the state for Gore during the first count.4. Mr. Moore implies that Iraq was a nice country. I mean, doesn't kids playing in the local parks show that? Come on, Mike. Saddam killed 1 Million of his own people. Do you think that 900 American lives can compete with that? Or did they just die for nothing?Overall, it is my belief that Michael Moore is far too nationalistic to feel the pains of other countries. Oh, and just for the record, can any of you Moore supporters tell me how much money Mr. Moore donated to the families of victims of both the 9/11 attacks and the Iraqi war, the victims who he's trying to defend nobly?

The underlying message of this movie and many of his films is that we as a society should stand up and question things and not blindly accept things based on our faith that these elected officials will do the right thing. The great thing about Moore is that eventhough he is ultra liberal, he is not afraid to criticize poor democrat leaders. Some republicans need to learn from this instead of just blindly following your republican leaders. Quit being a barking seal like Pedroza!!  Hey I don't agree with everything Moore says and Moore does manipulate things to support his opinion. But, so do government officials! wake up people- we've been Bush Whipped.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	Some people would consider this movie a documentary, especially many in Hollywood.  It is more of an editorial than a documentary in that it takes certain facts from a large body of information, and uses it to argue several viewpoints.  These are that the Bush administration did not take seriously warnings about the threat of Al Queda, the Bush administration did not react fast enough or with enough power to destroy the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mistakenly went after Saddam Hussein, and had been planning this for a while, and that the Bush administration's ties with the Saudi royal family is biasing them from really going after the threat of Al Queda and those within Saudi Arabia who support it.  Each of these points is argued in other movies, documentary shows, magazine articles and books.  Examples of the latter are referenced occasionally in this movie.  What this movie does is pull many of these sources together, and present them in a cogent manner.  What the movie fails at is to put forward a sense of objectivity.  From the get-go, the audience can clearly tell that Mr. Moore has no liking of G. W. Bush.  The movie makes little attempt to explain the reasoning of the president or his advisers.  Because of this, the arguments of this movie should be taken with a grain of salt.This movie was released in 2003 after the Iraq War began, and the DVD came out in 2004, probably in hopes of affecting the US national elections.  The election did not turn out as Mr. Moore had hoped, but the failures of the US occupation of Iraq, and the resurgence of the Taliban can only lend credence to the points of this movie.	3.0	Lots of good points, but overly biased	2007-02-28	8	6	2

I do not believe this film helped the situation in America, I would imagine it just fueld the fire and has caused more political rage in america(well, at least around my friends...obvisouly I do not know if it actually stirred up america).

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ	Nicholas Carroll	"For all the controversy surrounding this film, the point is almost missed with a lot of people.  Had the mainstream, corporate media had done their jobs, this documentary would not have to be made.  The myth of the liberal media is constantly perpetrated by the right wing to goad them into being more lax on the conservative views and tougher on liberal views to prove that the media is ""fair and balanced.""  Had the media been liberal, there seriously would have been a tougher fight and challenge to the Bush administration in the days following the 2000 elections.  The lies of the Bush campaign would have been more fodder than Gore's exaggerations regarding Love Story, Love canal, and the Internet.  The most enlightening thing about this film is that I never knew that no Senator sided with members of the black caucus in the U.S. House to formally protest the 2000 elections in Florida (the disenfranchisement of the African American vote).  Why didn't Senator Feingold, the conscience of the Senate, come to their aid?  Is the U.S. Senate that cliquey that they can just tell members of Congress to sit down and shut up if no Senator signed their protest petition?  This was all new to me, because no where in our ""liberal media"" was that story ever mentioned.  Since I don't have cable, I can't see CSPAN to know what's going on in the bowels of our government.  For that reason alone, I'm grateful to Moore for bringing it to our attention.My favorite scene in this film is the use of Bush's ""Top Gun"" type flight to the USS Abraham Lincoln to pronounce ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq, just a month and a half after the war began, and when just around 100 military members lost their lives.  It was a footage that Republicans hoped to use at their Convention but backfired because of the mess Iraq has become.  What made this footage even more brilliant was Moore's selection of the song from ""Greatest American Hero"" (""Believe it or not"") to illustrate his point (I especially loved the line, ""it should have been somebody else""--a not to subtle nod that the presidency does indeed belong to someone else).Some criticisms have focused on ""potshots"", the private scenes of Bush goofing for the camera before announcing that the war is on, Wolfowitz licking his comb to wet down his hair, Condi getting her face powdered, and Ashcroft singing horribly a song he wrote.  Yes, they are potshots, but the administration has brought it on themselves with their not too hidden disdain of the American people.  If people would read the history books, they'll see that this sort of ridiculing of the people in power isn't new.  During the reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the people burned in effigy members of the government, put on adult rated puppet shows showing members of the Royal family in a negative light, and worse.  The relations between the people in power and the people who are governed rests on a mutual respect, and when an administration has shown its contempt for American values again and again, ridicule is sometimes the only way to get back at them.  Besides all that, I don't recall hearing much protest against some of the things conservatives joked about regarding Clinton and his administration.  That's the beauty of living in a free society...our leaders are not above ridicule if they invite it upon themselves.This film is a tad bit long and could have been cut some, especially the parts about the lone policeman patrolling Oregon's long border.  That's all interesting stuff that could have been a side feature mini-documentary on the DVD rather than be a part of the actual film.  I felt that it slowed the film down and sidetracked it just a little from the main focus of the film, which is the war in Iraq.What surprised me most about this film was how funny it was.  There haven't been much to laugh about since the 2000 elections and 9/11, but Moore brilliantly manages to find the humor in these strange times, mostly at the expense of the people hired to govern us, but also in the deceptive manner in which Marine recruiters go about looking for recruits.  I loved how the Marine asked someone his name and address to cross him off their list, while writing it down instead to send a brochure later.  I'm surprised that the Marines would allow themselves to be portrayed making false promises of wealth and fame to college bound teenagers.  That's one part of the documentary I'd like to see documentation on, because its simply too good to be true that Moore caught the Marines being deceptive like that on camera.This film ends on such a devastating blow to the Administration, using the words of Britney Spears and George W. Bush concerning trust and not getting fooled again.  I loved that Moore read some passages from Orwell's ""1984"", the most relevant novel of the times about how the government can switch enemies in the middle of a war and its citizens don't blink an eye, and how war is used more to control the populace at home than to bring about a serious victory in another country.  Yes, when it all boils down to it, why should we send our young and less economically affluent to die in overseas wars for rich men who avoided war when they had their chance to serve?  When are we going to wake up to the truth that we are the ones who will ultimately pay the cost in blood so that a few can get rich and gain evermore power.

It makes me sick to see these conservative republicans come out and review this movie.  Clearly they have no real defense against it so all they do is say that it's full of lies (while at the same time never exactly telling us what those ""lies"" are), and call him fat.  If thats the best they can do then I laugh at them, which infact I am doing right now.So for everybody out there see this movie, and see the truth before November 7."	5.0	Finally the truth will come out!	2004-06-22	55	37	18

He tried, Mr. Moore, to influence this election,to fire Bush,to bad mouth him,and IT DIDN""T WORK. George ""Dubaya"" Bush is back in again for Four More Years.In my opinion,thats great.He's a tough leader and we need his diection agains't those terrorist killers.Kerry may have done a good job,but how could we be sure? Bush has been unwavering on many things and thats the reason for his victory.Well earned and with hard opposition,such as this film. It's all rubbish about Bush blowing up the Trade Towers.Really,how many logical thinkers BELIEVE that for a fact? Moore did and hoped everybody would too so he could so call ""Effect History"". American people have chosen their president,and this ploy floped.So next time,maybe liberals should be more concerned with their own agenda than striking at others in a very childish way. Using bluntly,Lies and mud slinging to promote ideals.Thats one of the things Bush hasn't done.Insulted Kerry or even liberals. Now,I know a lot of people probaley love this film and consider it the truth about Bush,But I consider it a untruth.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AV3AVUPTXV0Y4	nikkiww	"While I understand that Michael Moore had a skewed agenda in producing this movie, I think a lot of what he has portrayed cannot be ignored.The truth is that George W Bush is just as corrupt a politician as most in WA.  He can hide behind ""God"" all he wants but if Jesus came back, he'd be one of the first ones to be thrown out of the temple.To think that we as a country are not driven by power and gain is ridiculous.  Of course Bush shelters the Saudi's just like almost every other president has done because we are not in the business to care about freedom unless there is profit to be gained.  We don't invade other countries unless we can get something back for it.  We don't invest in other countries unless it benefits us.We have no problem giving weapons to monsters, to use them for our cause, even though time and time again those monsters turn those weapons back on us at a later date.We barely fought a war on terroism because of Bush and his Iraq agenda.  People dont like to be lied to and that is where Bush made a mistake.  They concocted a story to get us to back them when the rest of the world wouldn't even back Bush.  I think that if American people truly knew the reasons, agendas, and politcally motivated decision making that takes place in WA everyday, we probably couldn't even handle it.  If we knew the depths of the lies, we couldn't even process it.  It's much easier to trust in our government then to comprehend it's weaknesses.I would never ever enroll in the military.  I think the govenment is disrespectful of these men and woman who put their life on the line every day for us.  When things go bad over there and our children come home injured beyond repair from chemical warfare etc., our government pretends it didn't happen.  And if you are not a lifer, forget getting help assimilating back into society after you've killed and had to watch war atrocities.  You're on your own and good luck finding a decent job when all you've been trained to do is fire artillery.  We as a country fail these miliary personnel every day.So, if it takes a Michael Moore to throw things in our faces to make us want to find out the truth or pay attention to what our pitiful government is concocting, then so be it.

Alex Jones is the original reporter who uncovers the whole new world order and all the conspiracies related to it. For example you don't see Moore talking about how the pentagon was hit by something other than a plane and how the WTC and Oaklahoma buildings had more to their demolitions than the public is aware of. Those are the things that really matter.When Moore was asked by Alex Jones himself why he does not talk about any of the new worlder order issues, Moore said ""it's unAmerican"". So It's unAmerican to talk about the truth? I guess it's only ""patriotic"" if you remain ignorant about reality and do not question anything.Unlike Moore, Alex Jones is not in it for the money. He clearly states you can copy his films all you want."	1.0	Just a tip of the iceburg.	2005-02-28	29	10	19

I've read many reviews on this site that have argued the film is not factual and is blatant lie.  Do some research on your own before spouting the words of the talking heads on Fox News Channel or any other overtly Republican organization.  I would be willing to bet, based on the content of several of the negative reviews on this site, at least 80% of the people have not seen this film.  Most of the facts in this movie are supported by many sources, including: The 9/11 Commission Report, The House of Saud, and Against All Enemies (Richard Clarke).While I don't agree with some of Moore's labor-related ideals or some of his more elaborate conspiracy theories, I believe that there is something better for this country, and George W. Bush is not it.	3.0	Thought Provoking and Very Partisan	2004-10-01	24	12	12
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	...is the root of all kinds of evil.Funny, all the hype about this little documentary. I find it kind of tame. Compared to the fear-mongering, lying, deception, and soulless manipulation of religion that has gone on in the Bush administration, Moore's movie is kind of timid in its presentation.This movie affirms the old maxim that it is impossible to serve two masters. For all of his show in the other direction (playing up hot-button issues like abortion, stem cell research, faith-based &quot;initiatives&quot; etc.--all the while doing absolutely nothing about them by the way--***no doubt since he'd rather keep the issue alive to manipulate people with***) George Bush cares little for God or America, unless he can make a profit by them. And profit he has by the blood of America's bravest and by the blaspheming of all that is holy.Moore is timid because he only plays up the money aspect. He only soft-touches on how Bush and his cronies have used fear to make ostriches and slaves of the once free American people. He leaves Bush's religious hypocrisy largely untouched.Let me begin by noting that Bush has, on a couple of occasions suggested or outright said that Allah is the same God as the God of Jesus Christ. How evangelical Christians--which George Bush claims to be can overlook this is beyond me.But more to the point, how followers of Christ can support a man who has saturated the culture in fear can abide such a leader, and how Moore (also a Christian) did not see this as worthy of tying into his film baffles me. Our God (and even if you are not a Christian but still have a conscience--your &quot;god&quot; is a heck of a lot closer to my God than George Bush's demonic conception of a deity) does not give us a Spirit of fear, but of Sonship and Freedom. These are the very things that Bush and his Saudi/Al-queda allies hate.Wake up people. Moore's film is but the tip of the iceberg. We need only look at the fruits of George Bush, domestically and internationally to know what kind of smiling villain now illegally occupies the White House.Despite Moore's soft touch, I recommend this film very highly.	4.0	THE LOVE OF MONEY...	2004-07-13	35	25	10

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155"""	By now Michael Moore is a true love-him-or-hate-him guy, another face that can ignite rage in some people and smug smiles in others.I liked Roger & Me, back in 1988 when he could get away with making that film and not get noticed by too many people.  I thought Bowling for Columbine was interesting--at least someone was trying to make a film you could think about, bias or no bias.  There've been shouting matches over whether or not this film is a 'documentary', which should tell you something.  Some dismiss it as 'propaganda', others think it's the 'Truth'.My problem with this movie is not the anti-Bush stance, or the questions asked, it's the fact that I can't figure out what the film is about.  This film has no thesis, it hardly has a point to make.  It seems like a long rant about the last four years, starting of course, with more moaning about the 2000 election, suggesting that life would be just rosy if we'd elected the other candidate of the big business party.Give me a break.  As a documentary, the film is not very good.  As a Moore heart-tugger and audience-reaction-getter, it can be effective.  I don't think you'll learn anything from this movie.  It will either reinforce your views, or give you a fit.  What are you supposed to do with this movie?  Picket the White House?  Moore has all of the resources and by now the money to make a good documentary, but instead he wastes our time with a movie designed to get people NOT to vote for Bush, so you can see how much documentary integrity he cares about.I like some of Moore's work, including his TV show The Awful Truth, which pointed a funny bone at some issues (the guy dressed as Hitler going to Swiss banks, or 'Corporate COPS'.)  Yes, Bush is a mistake, the war is wrong, but Moore is not the answer.  I'm betting he still has the ability to make food for thought, but you won't find it here or on the 18 billion extras on the DVD, like Bowling for Columbine, which was filled with so much extra 'Moore' that I sold the thing on eBay.	2.0	One film won't educate you	2004-12-30	20	10	10

Talk about impeccable timing.To the right-wing zealots who have negatively reviewed this movie without having watched it, I suggest you rent it and decide for yourself.  Perhaps you will be inspired to shake off the effects of congenital disciplitis that seems to pervade what is left of your intellect.  The fact of the matter is, that conservatives don't want to know the truth and Michael Moore is hated because he undermines their attempts subterfuge of the common American.  Yeah, it is too bad that the movie didn't result in George W. Bush being a one term Republican.  One thing I'll give credit to Bush for.  He's got this atheist praying again.  Praying for the health of all the supreme court justices (with the exception of Scalia and Thomas).One last thing.  I thought the footage from Iraq was especially interesting.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A13FBTZ8SO8T3D	o dubhthaigh	... this is actually a very funny film. More political satire than documentary, Moore show Bush and Co with their pants at their ankles, and were it not for the fact that this dunce is supposed to be the leader of the free world, the film would stand up exceptionally well with any of Mel Brooks' great films of the seventies. Sadly, most of what is in the film actually happened, and though Moore jumps to conclusions on lots of stuff, in all honesty, his subject is such a complete dullard, I'm sure W'd go to the film and carp about the actor who played the President.There's plenty to be concerned about here, yet Moore steers clear of indicting the Christian Fundamentalist Fascists who also have a large stake in seeing W re-elected. Ashcroft, a modern day Goebbels, Rumsfeld (did someone say Goerring) and Cheney (Herr Himmler, so good to see you again) play W like a fiddle and it shows clearly throughout this film. This is almost a scratch and sniff film, the odious nature of which comes through in the aforementioned quartet's reckless disregard for the truth all the way through to the moronic US servicemen extolling the virtues of some Dokken tune they listen to before they go out to kill. And to think we all thought Kubrik was stretching it a bit with Slim Pickens... (for the infantile ME and X generations out there, it's a reference to a film about nuclear war - ask your parents).Among the questions running through my mind while I was watching this was how in the heck did Moore get his hands on the footage here. And why weren't Bush's handlers turning cameras off before W embarrassed himself and the Office. I was hankering for some trash talk from Potty-Mouth Cheney, but you just get him grousing about Halliburton allegations. You know he wants to wave the digit at someone but felt too repressed at the time.It remains to be seen if the American public has the guts to vote for integrity. There is nothing in the history of the US since Reagan to suggest that the electorate will evaluate the candidates based on reality instead of ideology. More's the pity. The US has dug itself into several holes that it desperately needs to get out of, especially regarding its deficit, its moral standing and its ability to set a role model for democracy throughout the world. All empires collapse at some point. W is very much a Nero for the Twenty-First Century. Problem is that he doesn't just take the Roman Empire down with him as he fiddles about. Those of us north of the 49th parallel have grave concerns. We're way too close to that sucking sound of things going down the tubes.We're all watching you people. Laugh at this film. Think beyond your self-gratification when you go into the polls come November.

It is because the movie is full of truths that the GOP never wanted to be exposed.  You will see republicans blasting Moore for his weight, his eating habits, and other nonsense but they will be unable to destroy Moore's message.  They will try by using their usual name calling, but they will be unable to erase Bush's seven minute dumbfounded look while he sat in front of a class full of grade school children while he looked at the pictures in the child's book, The Pet Goat.Republicans will rant and rave but they can't destroy the truth.  Not this time.  Fahrenheit 9-11 will spell doom to Bush and the corrupt GOP this November.  I hope that Move-On and the Kerry camp use that seven minutes of Bush looking like the dumbest person ever born on earth over and over again.  The airwaves need to be filled with images of Bush looking like the stool pigeon he is.  Bush just sat there, clueless and dumber than a stump.Bush's complete lack of leadership is glaringly displayed during each tick of the clock for seven straight minutes in Moore's masterpiece of a movie.  Remember, Bush had already been told about the first plane hitting the WTC building before he entered the classroom and did nothing.  And while Bush was sitting on a stool in the classroom Andy Card came in and told Bush of the second plane striking the second WTC building.  Instead of Bush acting like ANY REAL leader he just sat there on his stool holding the child's color book ""The Pet Goat"".  And remember, Bush didn't know if there were just two planes hijacked, or a hundred.  Bush did nothing.  I can safely say that every child in that classroom was more competent than Bush to be President of the United States, and Commander in Chief at that moment.Wake up republicans and stop allowing yourselves to be dupes to corrupt GOP propaganda.  Wake up and think for yourselves for the first time in your lives.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Bowling for Columbine was a better documentary than F911, however F911 is a far more powerful motion picture with much wider reaching implications. Forget the slapstick humor, South Park'ish cartoon interludes or much of Moore, because here Mike just lets the neo-conservatives, right wing media, senators and the odd President of the United States of America make fun of themselves without them even having to try that hard. However the moment that a dead Iraqi baby is held up to the screen is the moment that you realize that Moore is no longer concerned with giving us that many giggles and also that this documentary is going to cause significant problems for Bush's reelection campaign.We are hit with a barrage of appalling film reels, excluded by the mainstream US news, that impressed the judges at Cannes, because 99% of F911 is all about what you WHERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. F911 will give you a news update of 4 years from 2001 to 2004 that has been missing from your lives, simply because the material is considered anti-American or unpatriotic to show on national television (but Iraqis have seen plenty of it on their own!)... and ALL of it packs a whopping punch to boot.It is clear from watching the first few minutes of F911 that Mike has one goal in mind - to identify Bush as a problem that needs to be gotten rid off, so Moore devotes massive screen time over to his favorite Texas tongue twister and lets him get rid of himself by simply playing back for us some things that this guy has been jabbering on about over the years.......... BRING IT ON! Those where the 3 words that sent the Iraqi people ape, burning convoys, hanging US civilian bodies from bridges, kidnapping journalists and decapitating foreign workers on video camera. If it is not clear that Bush is an incredibly very stupid leader then WHO OR WHAT IS?After a smashing opening sequence where Bush's cabinet are all seen putting on makeup before they go on camera - showing us that these people are JUST ACTORS!, we learn that Bush had businesses funded by the Bin Ladens and was very intimate with the Saudi Royals. In fact the name he himself blacked out from his army records was none other than his business partner who made the Saudi/Bin Laden deals for him! It is blatantly obvious that a rich Saudi oil businessman is really not interested in financing a small time US oil player, but is interested in the President's son. What Moore points out is that there can be no doubt that this partnership has turned into a very bitter rivalry... with the REST OF MANKIND STUCK INBETWEEN AND GETTING THE FULL BRUNT OF WHAT IS THEIR FINANICAL/BUSINESS PROBLEM! In fact Moore even shows us how the Bush family continued their relationship with the terrorists AFTER 911!F911 is not a conspiracy theory. It is not about how much Bush knew about 911 or even if he was responsible for it. It is not about possible CIA operations to crash planes around America, nor are any conspiracies even touched on. In fact Moore just paints the President as a man who just likes to party with the rich, doing what the rich want him to do, helping them to get richer. On 911 his priority was with his rich friends. He allowed members of the rich Bin Laden family to leave America, because the rich Saudi ambassador asked him. As Moore so aptly points out... would Clinton have let the parents and friends of Timothy McVeigh take a flight out of the country, all together, without at least getting them on the record?The actual events of 911 are treated with dignity by Moore. Instead of replaying everything we have seen a hundred times before, Moore just lets the screen go black and plays us a sound recording from within the Trade Centre at the time of the attack... a deeply unsettling experience. Then we are quickly thrown into Iraq, bypassing Afghanistan as nothing more than an excuse to build another oil pipeline, and we are after Saddam while OBL remains at large. We then get to see troops on the ground playing heavy metal music on their headsets while machine gunning everything in sight, bagging Iraqis over their heads, raiding their homes looking for dissidents and generally showing people what it is like back home!... and we get plenty of that when Mike starts his rant about The Patriot Act.The real cream of F911 however is how the army recruits young marines, by showing up at malls in disadvantaged areas, and with a laser like ability, home in on a poor kid and manage to convince the teen to join up. It is frightening how pro these hunters are (one hunter even hints to an underage teen that he LOOKS much older!). Mike then sets out to Capital Hill to see if he can recruit a Senator's son or daughter for the marines... and obviously fails because no one with any sense would send their kids to that war... but Mike introduces us to a family that does think it makes sense, only when their son is KIA, it all changes very quickly. Near the White House the mother meets an old lady advertising the horrors of war, only to be confronted by protesters who say she is a fake. The confrontation lasts a few seconds with the mother of the marine who was KIA, but the denial on the part of the pro-war protester to acknowledge the mother's dead son at first, and then trying to justify it, shows how terribly ill some people really are.F911 is so full of information it can not be reviewed in 1000 words, however it is safe to say that this is the most important documentary ever made about 911 and the US government.	5.0	F911 - The REAL Super Stealth Fighter	2004-09-25	42	37	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A28WI7M92C0WFN	Pacificus	Before watching this movie I had never seen a Michael Moore film.  Although I had heard much talk about Moore's films being works of fiction or at the very least subjective, I couldn't believe that such films would be labeled documentaries if such were true.  Well I was wrong.  In an extremely egotistical rant Michael Moore presents his version of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan while taking quotes and interviews out of context.  This film is not objective and as a fan of film I am disgusted at the cloaking of the reality of this movie.  Instead of observing the reality of the situation and presenting the facts to the public, Moore begins with a thesis and strives to prove it.All that being said this movie is very well made.  As a piece of propaganda it is extremely effective.  Anyone who is not thoroughly educated on the subject matter will fall into Moore's trap and automatically see the Bush Administration as treasonous actors in politics.Moore is a very shrewd individual and I give him credit for producing a fine work of propaganda, but not a documentary.	4.0	Most definately NOT a documentary, but well made propaganda	2004-12-29	18	7	11

It's almost like getting a whole other documentary (FAHRENHEIT, PART TWO) for the price of one. The special features include amazing footage of Iraqis pleading to see their captive loved-ones outside of Abu Ghraib prison, as well as footage of just-released prisoners describing what they endured inside. (Moore had this footage before the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, and it's mind-altering to see this footage knowing what we know now about what was happening inside.) The dvd also includes more amazing, first-hand, up-close footage of the Iraq war, including footage of the U.S. military busting into homes and rounding up and arresting the wrong ""suspects."" Moreover, this dvd includes extensive footage of Condolezza Rice perjuring herself before the 9/11 Commission, where, among other lies, she claimed that the PDB (""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US"") given to Bush before 9/11 was merely ""historical"" in nature. (The 9/11 Commission discovered that her statement was false by interviewing the CIA analysts who actually wrote and prepared the PDB for Bush. The analysts testified that, far from being historical [as Rice had claimed], the August 6 PDB was ""both current and serious"" in nature. See the 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT, page 260, for their discovery, as well as for the text of the whole PDB.) The FAHRENHEIT 9/11 dvd also includes a press conference that a nervous-looking Bush gave just after meeting behind closed doors with the 9/11 Commission. For some much-needed catharsis, there's a very funny sequence of Arab-American comedians performing stand-up in New York City after 9/11, expressing in comedy what life was like for them after the attack. There's even footage of Moore winning his award at Cannes, and also of the Washington, D.C., premier of the movie. This dvd is worth every penny."	5.0	GREAT DVD EXTRAS!!!!!!	2004-12-12	24	14	10

This movie made me cry a lot at what's being done in my name and with my tax dollars.  I was able to laugh a little -- thankfully -- because Michael Moore can find irony and wry humor in even the most horrifying events.  The winners in the movie are (1) the average Iraqi people who are presented as human beings with lives and feelings and loved ones, and (2) the American G.I.s who may be able to come home a month or two early IF the American people wake up.  The big loser in the movie is George W. Bush because maybe, just maybe, the conservative Republicans will begin asking questions before election day IF they see this movie.The two saddest parts of the movie for me were (1) the happiness and joy of the Iraqis in Baghdad before Bush started bombing them to kingdom come, and (2) the mother near the White House being challenged by a right wing nut case about the death of her son in Iraq.  The destruction of the Twin Towers was handled in a deeply sensitive way, and the sound of the bombs over Baghdad made me shake in my shoes.  The movie theater was packed to overflowing, but you could hear a pin drop when the United States of America began killing the people of Iraq.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2BHCAI6QE3GXO	PAT	This film is right on point.  No wonder it has won so many accolades and foreign and national film awards.  The film chronicles how Mr. Rove and company seized power in the United States in 2000 with their figurehead president: George Bush.  Mr. Bush, a failure at all he touches, not to mention his cowardice shown while hiding out in the National Guard during Vietnam.  Of course clear and convincing evidence has shown that Mr. Bush did not complete his required service in the Air National Guard, even though he was in a safe stateside slot.The film also shows the heartfelt sadness of a mother who lost her son in Iraq.  Complete with a scene of a foolish Bush apologist in Washington, DC trying to persuade the woman who had lost a son that another woman protesting the war was not for real.The film, of course, portends the change in American values set forth by the Bush administration, and their legions of self-serving cronies, apologists, and dupes.  The film also shows how the groundwork was laid for the United Sates to cast off the honorable goals of its framers to become a government of dishonor, torturers, liars, dupes for cash, dupes for free, and arrogant popinjays that thumb their noses at the Constitution, Congress, the courts, and of course the people of the United States.  Further, the film shows how the Bush administration has used 9/11 for constant political gain, and the justification for all manner of questionable and illegal activities by the Bush cabal.We now know that the Bush administration has condoned and committed torture on human beings, unlawful renditions, illegal wiretapping on American citizens, and an ongoing list of desecrations to the Constitution.They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security.  -- Benjamin Franklin	5.0	Truth in Government	2006-02-02	16	11	5

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"Michael Moore is an important individual; one who provides and invaluable service to this nation.  He reminds each and everyone of us the importance exercising the rights granted us by the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, especially during a time when we live with a presidential administration that seems more focused on denying us those rights than dealing with its stated purpose of protecting us from terrorists.  Michael Moore, despite his unkempt appearance, and reputation as nothing more than a leftist rabble-rouser, continues to demonstrate the importance of agitation.  His constant questioning, and some would say harassing, of long-standing institutions and organizations, throws open for debate topics that people may be afraid or unwilling to discuss.  Some view agitation (erroneously) as unpatriotic, and peg individuals who engage in as Un-American.  Yet, agitation is at the very foundation of American principles and is what insures that our rights continue to be protected.  Agitation is what enabled and motley band of outraged colonist to rise up and unite thirteen disparate entities to throw off the oppression of British rule.  Agitation was the method famed abolitionist Frederick Douglas espoused when fighting against slavery.  Agitation enraged the American public against injustices and incited them to force change.  Now, Michael Moore uses agitation to inflame the public to lies, fraud, and general incompetence of an executive administration that claims to only have our best interests at heart.  Michael Moore's chosen vehicle for this is his controversial, inflammatory, and undeniably powerful documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".What happened that allowed the terrible tragedy of 9/11 to happen?  Are we winning the war on terror that was declared in its aftermath?  Why did Iraqi President Saddam Hussein order those planes to be flown in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?...  huh?  Let's back up a second.  It wasn't Saddam Hussein that ordered it. It was Osama Bin Laden ordering his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, to execute those attacks.  So, why are we invading Iraq?  Well, that's a fascinating question and is as the very core of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  It seems that the `reign of error' (and now `terror') of the George W. Bush administration has been insisting on this connection for more than two years.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" opens with that seminal period back in November 2000, when the presidential election was thrown into chaos by those dastardly hanging `chads' (and several thousand disenfranchised voters) in Florida.  Moore sets up the events leading to that terrible September day with his characteristic biting wit and with surprising tension.  He shows clip after clip of Bush administration members indicating that they saw no connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda, yet they insisted the connection was incontrovertible after 9/11.  He shows evidence that Bush Administration considered Bin Laden's threat such low priority that they didn't even hold the first all-hands meeting on potential terrorist threats until a week before the attack.  He chronicles a series of events leading up to 9/11, including Dubya's month long August vacation as events were coming a head, and his early September visit to Florida to visit his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, on Sept. 10th, 2001.  Then, the screen goes black, and Moore lets horrifying sounds of 9/11 tell the story of that day as vividly and powerful as any video.What is most damning about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is how effectively Moore presents the case of how bungled and mishandled the `War on Terror' following 9/11 in favor of promoting their own personal agendas.  Much like in his book ""Dude? Where's my Country?"" a companion piece to this film, Moore highlights the less than kosher connection between Bush and Saudi royal family (15 of the hijackers were Saudi) and to the Bin Laden family themselves.  Then Moore goes on the assault to bring to light the dirty little secret that our government is doing very little to rid the world of Al Qaeda with less than one full division of soldiers being committed to attack in Afghanistan, while most of our resources are being dedicated to an Iraq war that is fast becoming the second edition of Vietnam.  The reasons Moore illuminates for this are thought provoking and scary.Even more depressing than the lack of progress in the War on Terror is the legislation that is being rammed through to Congress to `protect' us.  The inappropriately title ""Patriot Act"" is the worst restriction of rights since the Alien and Sedition Acts, yet it got passed because of on sadly telling reason, as representative John Conyers conveyed to Michael Moore in the most fatherly of ways; ""Congress doesn't read most of what it passes.""  Now that is scary.The most heart-wrenching portion of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the ongoing sub-story of a mother whose son is serving in the Army and is stationed in Iraq.  Moore chronicles the progression of this woman's pride in her son's duty and belief in his mission to her abject grief and fierce opposition to his mission following his tragic death in combat in Baghdad (several months after Bush declared the war over and `Mission Accomplished').It is so tempting to sit here and review every single point put forth by this incredibly important film.  Doing so would far exceed the word limit on reviews, and would do poor justice to the ultimate power of this documentary.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Michael Moore's most accomplished and polished work to date.  So, it should come as no surprise that it is also his most powerful.

It's also obvious that this clearly anti-Bush propaganda film was completely ineffective in taking any votes away from Bush in his 2004 re-election bid.Or, if this pseudo-documentary WAS effective, then Bush would have actually gotten even MORE than the 62-million votes he received had it not been released?  Interesting.Speaking of elections, my favorite part of this entire film was watching Vice President Al Gore telling the mostly black congresswomen protesting the election certification to sit down and shut-up unless they could get at least one Democratic Senator to agree with their protest.  They couldn't.  Gore seems almost contemptuous of their efforts to keep his presidential bid alive.  He looks almost embarrassed.

To call this movie a ""documentary"" is to defecate on every worthy documentary ever made.  Half of the movie is a collection of clips in which George W. Bush speaks like a total idiot, and I agree that he is not a very good public speaker...at all.  But, that doesn't make a movie.  Anyone can watch him do that by watching television.It is not entertaining to watch an overweight man with a greasy baseball cap get into an ice cream truck and read the Patriot Act into a loudspeaker while passing by several people, most of which are probably wondering what the heck he's doing.  The same goes for his little ""stunt"" with the Marine where the honorable Mr. Moore walks up to several Congressmen and asks them to send their sons to Iraq ""to help out over there.""  Apparently, this man has not heard of the concept of ""choice.""What really infuriates me is what happens in the last 45 minutes of the film.  Mr. Moore shamelessly exploits the unbearable grief Lila Lipscomb (a grieving mother who lost a son in Iraq) has to deal with.  He videotapes her while she relates the horrible moment when the phone call came in, and even follows her to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where she vents her cries and screams at the White House.  Everyone who has a heart has been sympathizing with everyone who has ever lost a child.  After viewing this part of the movie, I lost every ounce of respect I had for Mr. Moore.I read right through the Anti-American Michael Moore, and it is very clear that he is trying to get the whole country angry with the current President; he is also trying to get right-wingers to agree with him through the use of shock-value and by distorting the facts.  Congratulations, Mr. Moore!  You've not only failed with me, but you've accomplished the opposite of what you set out to do!The paragraph above was the end of my review, and here comes the recommendation part.  I'm not going to say that I wouldn't recommend it, because this is the kind of movie that viewers will either love or hate.  If you are very liberal (not slightly, because that's where I was) and can't stand Dubya, I highly recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 (I know this is throwing off the whole attitude my review started with, but I'm being fair).

They were hitting the shelves so I was hitting the couch to watch it. And my wife nagged so I hit her too. But not really, I only thought I did, but only 'cuz I was watching Mac Catzzz! Unfortunately, this is the English version and only features commentaries by the English voice-over actors and not the original Japanese voice actors who made the show such a hit in China. But this isn't the Cosby Show you're used to. Oh no! They even added Morgan Spurlock to the mix to jazz things up a bit as he is fly with the ladies. Another downside to the DVDs is the fact that Morgan Freeman is no longer the narrator of the beloved show, but all of his dialogue has been rerecorded by Jeff Foxworthy so they had to change the name of the show from ""Good Times"" to ""You Might Be a Redneck if and Goodtimesv."" Yes, ""Good Times"" is now spelled ""Goodtimesv"" and I don't know why. I think it might be a typing error as this DVD package was clearly rushed to the shelves and doesn't even feature any special features or audio commentaries. And why does it start showing that Coca-Cola documentary commercial whenever I hit ""menu"" and it won't let me skip it?

If you must see this piece of propoganda, be sure to immediately view the REAL documentary called FarenHYPE 911 right after seeing it. I did and i was shocked at how Michael Moore lied to us. He distorted and fabricated the facts, he lied, he twisted the truths all in the self-serving name of making money to help line his pockets with money and help pay for his 2.5 million dollar condo. This guy is a sham. The fact that the public believes him as if he is some kind of truth-telling god is a sin of the worst kind. I'm glad people are starting to come forward with the truth about how he lies and distorts the facts. Books and articles are being written about him, and they are not flattering at all.  What is scary is that before i saw FarenHYPE 911, i actually believed his movie. Thank-you to the producers of the REAL documentary for shedding light on what a liar he is. He totally dishonored and  disrespected the families of the men and women who fought in the war for his freedom by making his movie. He needs to be stopped. And if you want the truth about his other piece of crap, go to [...]. The only GOOD thing about Farenheit 911 is that Michael's scruffy, obese, over-fed disgusting face and body are seen in the movie for less than five minutes.

I am not a flag-waving gun, toting patriot, nor am I a Moore-esque radical leftist.  I, if anything sit slightly on the liberal side of political neutrality.  That being said, there are a few things to know.  First and without exception, when watching any Michael Moore Movie, you need to know a few things.  Moore generally knows what he is talking about, but tends to show only one side of the issue in question.  Second, he likes to exaggerate the truth.  He doesn't outright lie, but he doesn't give it to you straight.  Not by a long shot.  You need to kick everything that comes out of his mouth down a couple of notches, to make up for his inflation of the issue.  This goes for every film he has ever done.  Let's face it.  Very few people have the same views on our country, G.W. Bush, Iraq, Foreign Policy, or our Armed Forces as Moore does.  Moore is an extremist, and comes off a bit too opinionated and radical for some Americans to handle in one sitting.  If you keep an open mind and do your homework on the issues at hand though, Farhrenheit 9/11 provides an interesting look at our advances overseas in the past few years, and our practices here in our own country.  Moore tells you not to believe all that you see on TV, and he is right.  The same statement goes for him, as well, though. If you watch this film and and think either ""Oh, I love George W, so that movie sucked,"" or ""Oh I hate Bush and that was awesome"", you are doing yourself an injustice.  Open-mindedness and reason need to be implemented when you watch this film for yourself.The Final Word - I recommend that you see this film only if you are smart enough to handle it.  Leave your own political views at the door and take it for what it is, a movie made by a man who sees problems around him and wants to see something done about it.

Mainly the hypocritical double standards from my conservative brethren that bombards my sense of fairness on a daily basis. Just contemplating the rage, furor, and media coverage over the Clintons sexual indiscretions, missing files (that eventually turned up and then exonerated), a land deal that went bad, etc. and compare them to the dozens and dozens of far more disturbing and destructive scandals from The Bush Administration and the lack of negative coverage until this year...I felt compelled to see this film and decide for myself and I must say my present feeling with the President I voted for and felt so proud of in the weeks following Sept. 11 were confirmed. Moores partisan commentary is definitely over the top but there's no denying the content of this film. As a self described Patriot in the spirit of Samuel Adams I say Enough! We can no longer sit by while President Bush creates a rage of anti-American hate in millions of young destitute Arabs, who will grow-up, and in 15 years be the new and improved BinLadden army of terrorists.

The class fumbled along, attempting to please him with their answers.  ""When you're able to repeat it."" one said.  ""When you can use it to understand other concepts,"" was another response.  I want to address the fundamental controversy behind Fahrenheit 9/11 using this very question I was asked back in college.  The fundamental controversy behind this film, is that it portrays our government as motivated by the potential to make huge profits at the expense of innocent lives.  The innuendo boldly set forth by Michael Moore is that we invaded Iraq to gain strategic control of the Mid-East oil supply. Moore outlines this point very well: he shows Hamid Karzai, a Bush connection from his oil company days being appointed leader of Afghanistan, and shows how shortly thereafter a pipeline began to be built in that country.  These are facts. If you watch the special features to this DVD, (and I hope you did) than you saw the lengthy interview with former Marine Abdul Henderson, who told Michael Moore that their first duty in Iraq was to secure the oil supply, and then go about ""liberating"" the country.Why is it hard for the film's detractors to accept that our government is greedy and disingenuous? We all know we were told this war was to find WMDs, but it only takes a little research to see what the bigger picture is.So I return to my original point.  How do you know something? How do we as Americans know the government invaded Iraq for control of the second largest oil supply in the world? For some people, they would only know it if President Bush admitted it in a state of the union address.It's time to be active Americans.  We can't rely on the spin that we get from the White House.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good first step for a lot of people to wake up to what's going on.  If documentaries are your thing, there's a whole slew of them that deal with these kinds of issues coming out.

Like most, I laughed and I cried, and left the theater exhausted emotionally, and in a state of alarmA Bush victory in the next election would lend confirmation to their belief that they can do anything to the country, and get away with it because, despite the events since 9/11 as  documented in Moore's film, books and other sources (mainly foreign) they will know with certainty that:1. The media can be ""bought"", and spew only what they want.2. The American public has become passive. It is nicely over-recreationalized, ill-informed, comfortable with the belief that what they hear in the (see above) media is the truth, and reluctant to (or ignorant of how to, or too lazy to) protest or resist what they do. It has surrendered its sovereignty. It's gone limp, even the cynical contingent, and they can lie with impunity. It will be almost expected!3. It is also afraid of appearing un-American, disrespectful of the Presidency and un-patriotic.

The only problem is that they are scattered throughout what is an otherwise blatant piece of propaganda. He is an expert at taking things out of context and distorting the truth to fit his own narrow viewpoint of the world. This is the same man that tells his readers that it is impossible to become a millionaire in this country, all while he reaps the enormous profits of his best-selling books and films. In this particular film, he tells us that black people are 'forced' to live in ghettos and would have us believe that Iraq was a happy, peaceful place before the evil Americans came. He misuses grieving mothers to suit his own ends and deceitfully uses Marine recruiters(one who has since given his life in Iraq) to portray them as heartless predators. Mr. Moore is unscrupulous to say the least. As most people know, there are several ""right-wing"" rebuttals to this film, most notably, 'Farenhype 9/11' and 'Celsius 41.11.' It completely baffles me how certain reviewers can praise this film, and then turn around and dismiss these rebuttals as nothing but extreme right propaganda. When it comes to Michael Moore's film, he is merely ""glib"", but any rebuttal that uses the same tactics, yet happens to have a conservative bias is immediately written off as propaganda worthy of Joseph Goebbels. This is pure hypocrisy.  So, in closing, I would say that while this film does make a few solid points, it's credibility is completely tarnished by it's unethical and deceitful nature. 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is propaganda at it's finest."	2.0	First-rate propaganda	2006-08-21	14	6	8

Kuzma	"In all of his films, Michael Moore misleads and even deceives his audiences in order to enhance whatever point he is trying to make, as anyone who takes the time to actually read anything about the man already knows.  Here, he is at his worst, presenting the wildest conspiracy-nut lore as fact without offering one shred of evidence and deliberatly omitting important facts that do not support his attacks on George W. Bush.  And he is so preoccupied with his crusade against the president that he does not even bother to make sure one claim does not contradict one he made five minutes ago.  Nor does he offer any model of how an administration should conduct itself during a war, or explain how he would have handled the fight against terrorists.  If you think Michael Moore loves America, than you might want to consider that a captured terrorist, Qaidar Faisal, quoted text from Moore's book ""Stupid White Men"" during his trial as justification of the jihad against the West.  This kind of blatant propaganda has no place in a democracy, and the fact that so many people embrace it should frighten anyone who loves living in a free country."	1.0	Nothing but Propaganda	2004-08-17	83	26	57

I love that people say we never should have gone to war with Saddam, that he never posed a threat or attacked us.....WRONG!  I have a big glaring fact to back that up.  Remember back in 1991 when we beat Iraq in the first Gulf War and he signed a treaty with the U.S. and U.N.?  Remember that?  Ok, good.  Now, during the 12 years between that treaty and the launching of the 2nd war, how many times did Iraqi armed forces fire on British and American aircraft in the no-fly zones?  Hmmmmmm?  I seem to recall that the International Rules of Engagement do specify that an act of war is considered when one country commits an attack against another.  So, according to the rules, we had HUNDREDS of reasons to invade Iraq.  This fact is so poorly missed in Moore's distortion of factual truth.  If you watch this film, it does get to you, but it is so anti-Military that this ex-marine did all he could from tearing down the screen.  His interview with the mother who lost her child in Iraq is sad, but here's the thing....HE WASN'T DRAFTED!  HE CHOSE TO GO!  Let me run that by you again, just like I did in 1992, I CHOSE TO JOIN.  Meaning, that as an adult (not children like Moore calls us, an 18 year old may be young, but is still a legal adult) I knew the consequences of joining the military.  I knew that I may have to go to war if the country calls for it.  I'm saddened to see the apathy that permeates our society.  The youth of today have no concept of history, they don't know what it takes to defend freedom.  Telling me, as Moore does in the movie, that Saddam didn't consort with terrorists is like saying that Steven Speielberg never directed ""Jaws"".  Shame on Moore for capitalizing on the deaths of my fellow soldiers who removed one of the most BRUTAL dictators next to Adolf Hitler.  Bravo to the soldiers who wouldn't give Moore the time of day.

Enright	"Since copies of ""Farenheit 9/11"" are available inexpensively, I've been buying extra copies and giving them out to co-workers, second-hand stores, and to US troops serving overseas.  I've been pleasantly surprised by how thankful people in the military have been to receive a copy of this film.  Despite the immense effort of Pentagon PR firms (like the Rendon Group) to trash this film, there are simply too many powerful insights for it to be ignored (hence, all the rageful reviews from those who have been ""Hannitized"" or otherwise intellectually handicapped).  These insights anger war profiteers and moral cowards, but many free-thinking Americans can handle the truth.  For instance, the truth shared by George Bush in the film when, at a fat-cat fundraising gala, he tells the audience, ""Some people consider you to be the elite, I consider you to be my base.""  A rare moment of honesty from the figure-head of corporate power, the chief gopher of Big Business.To read the opinions that dozens of US military members and their families have of Moore and his work, check out ""Will They Ever Trust Us Again,"" a compilation of letters Moore has received from US troops.  I'm sure he could've also done a book of hate mail he has received, but those comments are so predictable and boring there wouldn't be much of a point to publishing the thoughts of self-righteous lemmings.Much more interesting would be the thoughts of Iraqis on this film.  I'm sure they appreciate the efforts of US citizens to question an illegal invasion that has killed over 100,000 innocent people.My only criticism of this DVD is that there is no option for Spanish subtitles.  Spanish speakers, including undocumented immigrants, are a growing part of our imperial forces.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"There's no way to review this alleged ""documentary"" without getting into a political battle.  Of course, confrontation is the goal of Michael Moore, a provacateur without peer, who has acheived new heights--or depths, depending on your point of view--in manipulative propaganda. I saw it and was impressed at Moore's wily skills and at his grasp on the gullibility of certain sectors of the American public. Moore has craftily cobbled together a very compelling screed against George W. Bush with the explicitly stated goal of removing Bush from office by any means.  But the greatest victim of Moore's filmmaking, not only in this film but his earlier efforts as well, are not Moore's targets, but it is truth itself.  Even Liberal icons such as Chris Matthews have noted that many of Moore's specific accusations are ludicrous and without merit. With that in mind, can I call this a great film, even though it is definitely skillfully made?  Moore has, after all, marketed it--not as fiction, but as a factual documentary.  It strikes me that the best example I can cite in terms of comparison for this film is ""Triumph of the Will,"" a documentary about the sixth Nazi Party Congress of 1934 directed by Leni Riefenstahl. That film is widely lauded for its technical and directorial skill and its carefully aimed imagery. ""Triumph of the Will"" is, in Susan Sontag's words, ""the most successfully, most purely propagandistic film ever made.""  Well, ""Triumph of the Will"" may be technically a brilliant acheivement in filmmaking, but it's goals and results were evil, and there's no way, if I were reviewing it for Amazon, that I would not give it the lowest possible rating.  Therefore, Michael Moore, despite his obvious skills as a filmmaker, his faux folksiness, his charming, scruffy ""everyman"" act, and his passionate ""beliefs,"" also deserves nothing but scorn and derision.  For a clearer picture of the charlatan that is Michael Moore, read MICHAEL MOORE IS A BIG FAT STUPID WHITE MAN by David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke."	1.0	Brilliant propaganda	2004-09-27	62	13	49

This film is full of quotes that Bush never said and it is a perfectly good example of all the garbage people hear from the biased liberal media every day.

He blames Bush for September 11, and he thinks we were sent to Iraq for the wrong reason. Don't be fooled by what this overstuffed hot air balloon says. The 9/11 comission report contradicts everything Michael Moore says in this film about September 11. In the issue on Iraq, Moore goes on to claim that Saddam Hussein was a perfectly innocent man, yet he never tells of his record of genocide and torture, even though Moore knows he used chemical weapons (a WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION) to kill 100,000 Kurds. Saddam also launched 50 SCUD missiles against Israel during the Gulf War, which were chemical warheads and he was also believed to be behind the plot to assasinate George H.W Bush in Kuwait in 1993. Remember when Saddam said he apologized for invading Kuwait, and then he started firing SCUD missiles at Kuwait during the recent Iraq war? Get real here! Quit listening to this guy. Moore has defintelely given in to the liberal socialist agenda. He will not admit that socialism is a failure. Moore wants Bush out of office because he wants to make America a socialist country.

Steen ""Raquelita"""	"If a picture tells a thousand words, imagine what a 120-minute of politically-fueled documentary featuring never-before-seen 'war on terror' footage and Bush's oligarchic-life's scenes would say.From the disenfranchisement of African American voters in Florida to Saudi-Bush shady business connections, to 'winning hearts and mind' myths in Iraq and tough-on-terror fallacies of the Bush's presidency, Michael Moore takes you for a ride in a forbidden territory the corporate media so far hadn't dared to step in.Moore takes you back to 2000, the year George W. Bush became president in the most disputed, criticized elections in U.S. history. It was the elections where the Supreme Court, the governor of Florida, and the U.S. Senate cast the conclusive vote.'Farenheit' not only has succeeded in keeping the debate heated over the past elections; the film also will have you wonder about one of the most upheld premises most Americans have taken for granted since kindergarden: ""The United States supports freedom in the World.""The Saudi-U.S., or to be more specific, the Saudi-Bush relationship is a perfect example to attest the opposite. Here you have a monarchy made up of almost 5,000 princes, who along with their local associates, have investments in the United States worth a stunning $860 billion. This number would make approximately 7 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product.Besides the big money involved from the Saudis, what do you think is the Bush administration's main priority in its 'war on terror'? How much of a 'black sheep' is Osama in the Bin Laden Family? What are the Bin Laden-Bush links? What deals existed between the Taliban and a major Californian oil company? Was the Taliban ever given the red carpet in Houston, back in 1997, when a well-known individual was the governor of Texas? Does Halliburton play a big role in Bush's government corruption or is this just another leftist diatribe?'Farenheit 9/11' probes into these and other questions with staggering details and a big dose of sarcastic humour injected by Moore's narrating and acting (check Moore handing over applications to U.S. congressmen and talking them into having their children enlist for military duty in Iraq)Iraq could not be left out of 'Farenheit.' Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke could not put it more bluntly when it came to demystifying the rationale behind invading Iraq: he was being pressured by the administration to fabricate incriminating evidence that would link Saddam Hussein to the Sept. 11 attacks. He even went so far as to say that Bush had plans to invade Iraq even before 9/11. Recall that Clarke's statements were made during a senatorial commission (included in the film) months before the most revealing documentation to date rebutting Bush's casus belli in Iraq came out this October.In spite of huge anti-war protests worldwide and the constant flip-flopping of pretexts and all other nonsensical rant to justify the invasion, little could be done to stop the war machine. But what happens when the 'freedom-poised'- U.S. and coalition soldiers take over Iraq after six weeks of 'shock and awe' blitzkrieg?'Farenheit' includes some disturbing scenes that the media for some reason neglected: Iraqi mothers and fathers crying hopelessly for their dead children,whose blood -stained, torn bodies are being pulled out of what remains of their homes after an air raid; entire families being terrorized in the middle of the night all while marines drag off men from their homes in the most humilliating fashion all while their children, women, and relatives stand by in panic; hooded prisoners being paraded around and fotographed as if they were trophies of war, with all the chauvinistic and dehumanizing attitude that surely nourished the prisoner-torture atmosphere that sufficed later in the Abu Ghraib case.Most war correspondents in Iraq have said that their being embedded with coalition soldiers has put restrains to portray a balanced, objective picture of the conflict. Yet, the Swedish cameraman who provided most of the takes to Moore was an embeddded journalist himself, and blames CBS, CNN, MSNBC, and others for refusing to accept his material. More interestingly, he says that most of his takes showing U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners and night raids are commonplace and not random incidents, so he questions why aren't the embedded journalists reporting them as they should (For more complete info, check the Swedish journalist's interview on the DVD features).Now, the documentary falls short of 5-star rating because it fails to address one of the most fanatic and dangerous driving forces behind the shaping of the Bush administration's foreign policy. These missing dots are crucial understand the present Afghan, Iraqi, and U.S.-U.N-Europe diplomatic crises. First, the  agenda of militarizing the world oil-rich regions and the unilateral 'preventive war' doctrine as stipulated in neo-con  manifestos(for example, the Project for the New American Century). Second, the role of Israel's hardliners for regime change in what it deems unfriendly countries (Iraq, Iran, Syria)and their policy of ethnic cleansing in Palestine's occupied territories.This important omission, however, should not deter you from buying or seeing this film; a whole lot of important material still is shown uncensored in 'Farenheit 9/11,' which besides exposing how scandal-ridden and disastrous the Bush administration has proven so far, it also puts the heat on the media's reluctance to distinguish fact from unchallenged government propaganda.To make a long story short, 'Farenheit 9/11' remains a living testimony of why Michael Moore's at the top of political documentary-making in the United States and why you need to cast your vote in November.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2Y4C6TCO9BV5W	raisethebar	Several people here have loved this movie, because it sheds light on what has really been happening in the white house, and in Iraq.However, many people that have left reviews here that were bad, did not actually rate this film based on the FILM, but rather their political opinions.But the same goes for those who have said the film was excellent, but only because they dislike President Bush.The truth is, everyone needs to see this movie, regardless of what other things you've heard, and especially regardless of whether you fall to the right, left, or somewhere in between.It is also important to remember that 95% of this film is factual information. The other 5% being the 'action' that makes this film worth watching, and not like an extra long version of the nightly news.Some will argue that there is little or no truth to this film. However, the proof is out there.I was a republican. I used to be very far to the right. After seeing this movie, I wasn't convinced that all of this was true, because my republican friends said that everything in this movie was a lie. However, it was interesting enough that I did some research, and found that all of what this movie presents is indeed true! None of this is made up. A lot of this information was later confirmed by the 9/11 Commission themselves!I also discovered that on MichaelMoore.com, he has posted pages upon pages of facts from the film. But, it's not just him saying it, becuase otherwise I wouldn't have believed it, if it was just HIM saying all of this. However, there is a link under each and every fact that will take you to an INDEPENDENT site that backs up these facts, such as CNN, MSNBC, The Wall Street Journal, and hundreds of other sources.As I said before, I used to be a republican. A hardcore one at that. When I saw this movie, I hated Michael Moore, and did not want to see this film, except to see the 'lies' that were in it. However, I now can see that what this man is saying is the honest to God truth.So regardless of your previous opinions, or your political standings, you really should see this film.It is incredibly interesting, and it really exposes what has really been happening in Washington, to the point that it is scary.I mean, this man, our president, George W. Bush, truly scares me now that I have seen what he has done!And I will not lie. I did vote for him in 2000, but I did not make that same mistake in 2004.Regardless of what you have believed, or what I do, you should really see this film.I hope this helps, and I do hope that everyone sees this film, and realizes that we need to take a good look at the way this country is going, and this film definitely shows that.God bless you, and God bless America!	5.0	You need to see this film, regardless of what you've heard	2005-05-19	21	14	7

In fact, about an hour in, I knew the old pitch sold by the Dems pretty well from the popular press, and was fixing to walk out, go home and do some laundry.  I didn't care much for the attempts at conversion of so much archival video to the more robust 35mm format, either.  But I did like the intimate coverage of George W. Bush, ""The Man"", and I must thank Mr. Moore for producing such a fine portrait of this most remarkable American.  In his older days, he bore a striking resemblance to James Caan--or so I thought.  I didn't care for all the attempts to pull on what are left of my heart's strings with all the anecdoctal tales of individual woe, for indeed, the world is pretty woeful in a lot of ways, and the Bush machine must have hardened me to all of that, years ago.  If this is all a big racket driven by oil and the Saudis, well, it looks like the train to be on; count me in.  Bush has become much better known to me as a result of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", and this is the film's greatest contribution to the campaign.  What else was there...hmm...Albert Gore and the sore losers.  And of course, there's candidate K., about whom we know even less.  Want to win--well, let's let George do it.

Since Michael sees so much wrong with our country, his film topics will be endless. Michael's persona fills up each frame in this latest street-guerilla-with-a-film-crew documentary.

Very accurate indeed.

I cried non-stop, admittedly the only one.He, Moore, was BRILLIANT with the way he did 9/11. NO towers, no planes, what a relief. But even sadder.I do not agree with those formal reviewers who praise him for staying out of much of the film. He's not like Woody Allen, except which do you prefer: When Woody is IN a film or not. Right, IN. Same for me with Michael Moore, who manages to be essentially sweet if also salty and funny.The potshots re: his not being levelheaded and giving two sides is a total joke. He got part of the jig saw puzzle we will never fully get. MOST interesting is all the help he got with facts and footage from I'm guessing--least likely sources. Amazing range of non public material, often not shot, never, by Moore.To those who think he's a wacko, I say, He's OUR WACKO and from Flint, to rise to this level of imagination (NOT LIES) is so brilliant.

Sorry to be quoting old movies but the last few months of blogfests have taught me how true Obi Wan's line was.  Moore has many facts dervied by many papers and stated by many authors.  His critics have the same thing, facts from others that support the opinion they want to express.  More often that not, p[eople will choose who to beleive based on who they WANT to beleive and not question the authenticity of any fact that supports their side.  And to be fair, this applies to both fans and critics of Moore.This movie (for simple labeling purposes) got mislabeled as a documentary.  It's actually an editorial piece.  The quality of an editorial piece is in it's power to persuade people to it's opinon.  I generally like Moore's movies and books, and generally support his opinion, but the premis of Farenheit rubbed me the wrong way.  It tried to paint Bush as the kind of villan we don't see outside of Satuday morning cartoons or 1960s comic books.  Not to mention the president being involved in vast conspirices for money and world domination seemed so implausible when the last guy with the job could cheat on his wife without it being all over the news.Watching the move at release was interesting.  It painted a rather convincing picture, and taking into accounts the CBC news I watch, I was finding it harder to completely dismiss the conspiracy theories.  With the more recent news, from studies stating faulty intellegence about WMDs to freudian slips made by Bush during the live debates, from lost explosives to fresh hate mail from Bin Laden, I get afraid Moore may be right.  I'd prefer to think that Bushes less than stellar desicions were made due to a recationaly attitude to the irrational fear we all had after 9/11, but in the grand scheme of things, that isn't any less damning.This movie is very powerful.  That's something that can't really be denied regardless of your political opinions.  It's simply Moore's version of events.  History will be the one to decide if he's the Pied Piper leading us to our death, or the lone voice chanting the Earth revolves aroung the Sun.  This movie will probably make most of us uncomfortible, and some may dissmiss Fareneheit because of those feelings, but I'm reminded of some words from one of my teachers: ""If I ever find myself in the position of being 100% ethically corect, I know my thinking's screwed up somewhere."""	5.0	Many of the truths we cling to..	2004-11-01	28	13	15

Dr. Marvin SHouser sums things up well with this hypothetical: suppose there is a forest fire in progress and a conservative and a liberal are sent in to put it out, and given complete discretion in how to do so. the liberal will likely fill a teacup up with water, then run to the fire and throw it on. obviously this will do nothing. the conservative, on the other hand, will build a fire break and sacrifice the portion of the forest already engulfed to save the rest. however, the cameras will film 2 things: the liberal throwing the teacup of water on the fire and the fire going out. the liberal will then claim that what he did put out the fire, even though it did nothing. he will even go so far as to accuse the conservative of doing nothing to help. some even go so far the delude THEMSELVES into believing what they did worked! it the world of the liberal, appearance is all that matters, and if you dig down past the top layer, you get slammed with PC nonsense. this film in comparison to celsius 41.11 is THE prime example of this. Celsius was criticized for being too right wing and not entertaining enough. the first words in celsius is ""we begin with the premise that john kerry is an honroable man"" and all the speakers maintain a professional repsect for the opposition. the closest anyone comes to breaking that is Medved, who says in regard to bush's statement that we need to fight terrorism by doing something other than turning the other cheek by saying, ""Bush understands this.

I already harbor anger over what I witnessed and survived on that day, but the true horror has come only from the hands of those who had authority handed to them on the backs of disinfranchised Floridian voters. Together with others who on that day walked for miles, getting comfort from others along the way, I seethed as I watched President Bush in this documentary, listening to a story in a school for a photo opportunity at the very moment I watched people die on Trinity Street.Michael Moore, currently reporting on the RNC, I thank you for making this documentary.  Thank you also for being witness to the exploitation and prostitution of that horrific day currently taking place by this administration at this event.  I look forward to your next project.	5.0	A reminder to those in complacency	2004-09-01	30	18	12

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AKETKFTDLB3P2	Renaldo Rigatoni	"I give ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" two stars because it was edited well, and I always find Michael Moore amusing.  I was a huge fan of Moore's ""TV Nation"" program back in the '90's.Let me speak freely, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a work of propaganda.  Some folks cringe when they hear the word, ""propaganda.""  It's not a bad word.  The third ed. of THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE defines propaganda as: ""The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.""  Moore's detractors use the term ""propaganda"" constantly to discredit him.  Moore's supporters are afraid of using the term, although it accurately reflects what his film is.Moore's film holds a mirror up to its audience.  Those of the left who wish to see the work as a factual account of the wrongdoings of the Bush administration will see this reflected in the work.  Those on the right who wish to see this film as an unfactual account concocted to knock a sitting president will see this.My biggest concern about the film is the lack of critical thinking amongst its audience.  News departments around the country were interviewing scores of audience members who had just left the theatre after seeing the film. There werwe so many who said they were going to change their vote because of the movie.  Many said that the film finally showed the truth about the Bush presidency.  Anyone who changes their vote or declares a propaganda film has just altered their interpretation of the truth worries me.  How many Germans were swayed to accept the anti-semitic ""truth"" of the Nazi party back in the '40's when ""Jud Suss"" was released?Our nation urgently needs to be critical of propagandistic films.  After watching ""Fahyrenheit 9/11"" my first impulse was to run to the library to do some serious fact-checking.  It would be insane to think that this film is entirely factually accurate.  Moore is a muckraker, and thank God there are muckrakers on both ends of the political spectrum.  Would Moore be more forthcoming with his sources or his editing techniques if watchdogs on the right weren't putting his feet to the fire?Watch ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" for the amusement value.  Moore is a funny guy.  I cracked up when I saw the ""idyllic"" scenes of pre-invasion Iraq.  Whatever you do, viewer, please, PLEASE view Moore's films CRITICALLY.  Do not believe every single event in them.  Go to the library, do some fact-checking, after you watch a propaganda film from either the left or right.  Don't tell the hometown reporter that you're going to change your vote.  Don't be stupid- DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!"	2.0	Amusing, but annoying...	2005-02-03	16	11	5

I agree with him 110%.A documentary can have a point of view, it cannot present 59 lies as the truth, By definition this is not a documentary but it is propaganda; and its a shame people will see this and think its the gospel truth. There is plenty to criticism the Bush Administration on, but believing in these ""black helicopter"" conspiracy theories, just puts one out on the fridge. Lets just take one example. We invaded Afghanistan so we can build a pipeline. Well, we have been in there three years now and NO PIPELINE is being built. The truth is two company's back in the mid 90s considered building a pipeline in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration even helped one of the company's bu talking with the Taliban about it. But it never came off. if was considered unfeasible and not worth it. So its a lie by Mr. Moore.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3IHE2BQQQEQS1	Renie Britenbucher	Riveting is an understatement for this movie. There are some who stay on top of the news and know most of what is presented in this movie and those of us are infuriated at the current administration. Now maybe more people will have knowledge and become less complacent about what is happening to us as a country.What I think is so wonderful about Michael Moore putting this information in movie form is, for those who do not read, who trust what is spoon fed to them on a daily basis from the media and a media which is pretty much under control of the Bush White House, will have their eyes open.My only complaint, and this is a very small one, is that Michael Moore sometimes finds it necessary to edit things to emphasize his position, when it isn't necessary at all. The truth can stand on it's own. Example being the Senator who was asked if he would send his child to Iraq and had a surprised look, then it cut away to the next scene. I saw him interviewed and he is upset because he does have family members in Iraq (I believe nephews). It would be more advantageous to show things as they are, because, let's face it, it's pretty darn bad, all on it's own.Great movie that will have a big impact.	5.0	Valuable Film with Invaluable Information.	2004-06-26	25	17	8

Michael Moore does this in spades!He uses some facts and then turns them around for entertainment...not truth.An excellent DVD, if you've seen this picture, is ""Fahrenhype 911"".  At least you will get more honest facts and not have them turned in a certain way to exploit your way of thinking with any regard for what's the truth.Michael Moore has a political agenda and he uses it to slant this film.If a film crew were to follow him around with their own agenda, they could make Michael out to be a right wing anorexic, with traditional values (using Michael Moores style of journalism)!If you look at this film for entertainment only...then it has some humorous moments and some shocking moments that could entertain...but that was not the goal of this film project and that is why this reviewer gives it one star at best!"	1.0	Fahrenhype 911 More like it!!	2004-12-15	34	17	17

Both try to take the work of tring to think yourself. As I heard on the beginning of the Tool cd on the video collection, &quot;Think forself, question authority.&quot; Who knows what really is going on, only the people involved know. Until you get a unbiased opionin about anything, then don't go parading your judgement around. Also, Bush isn't as any worse a President as any other in the past, he just seems to be bad at being miscevious(sp?) about it. There's always a hand in the cookie jar, no matter who is in office.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A5M3MLF0FSWZV	Rex Bennett	Fahrenheit 9/11 not only broke box office records for adocumentary on opening weekend, it was the first time in moviehistory that a documentary out performed regular movies at thebox office!  Fahrenheit 9/11 opened to sell-out crowds and isstill filling theatres after the weekend.I was unable to go during the weekend, so I waited and went thisMonday afternoon to the 4:00 PM showing.  You would expect that a4:00 PM Monday afternoon showing would be just about empty orsparsely populated.  It was fortunate that I arrived early enoughto get a good seat since by the time the showing started, thetheatre was packed.  It was mostly adults and some families withyoung kids.I can tell you that this is a  P O W E R F U L  documentary.  Itfar exceeds anything that Michael Moore has done in the past.  Bythe time it ended two hours later, there was thunderous applausefrom a theatre full of people who could not tear themselves awayfrom the screen during the entire showing.  Even though it wastwo hours long, it seemed quite short since the images captivatedthe viewers with scene after scene of compelling information, andsometimes, outright shock.  But Moore went even further with anuncanny ability to produce comedy amid tragedy.  One did not wantto miss even a second of what was showing.Moore has proved himself to be a genius in production andediting!  Some of his special effects gave a dimension rarelyseen in a movie.  During the actual attack on the twin towers,the screen goes black with no image at all, but what you hear arethe actual sound recordings of the planes crashing into thebuilding and the the horrified sounds of the people.  The effectwas awesome!  It took an image that Americans have seen hundredsof times before and turned it into something totally new and withpowerful results!  Even when the image finally returns, he nevershows the twin towers.  Instead he shows the people.  The effectwas truly awesome.You will be genuinely shocked by some of the information heprovides about George Bush and his Texas business ventures.  Doyou have any idea at all who was bankrolling GW Bush's businessfailures?  Take a guess.  I won't tell you, but you may beshell-shocked when you find out.  Not only that, but GHW Bush isinvolved as well.  Guess who provided the Bush family and friendswith 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS!?From the audience participation, you would think you were seeingthe latest Hollywood blockbuster thriller.  There was not apassive soul in sight.  The audience shrieked, they cried, theylaughed, they howled!  And when it was finally over, they showedtheir approval with a thunderous applause that I have rarely everseen at a theatre anywhere.There was no quiet stream of people passively leaving thistheatre.  The sound of people talking, communicating was almostdeafening.  They were roused.  They were energized. And this isone movie whose word-of-mouth will spread far and wide.  This isa movie, a true documentary, that no living American should miss.This is living history on the cinematic screen.  And it will makeyou think about what you have been told.	5.0	Fahrenheit 9/11 Will Win Every Film Honor There Is!	2004-07-02	25	15	10
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ALF49A9DLXQSO	RF	Out of curiosity I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 recently for the first time, after the election. I am informed enough to realize that much of the information presented in the film was cherry-picked, which resulted in a heavily slanted take on events. It's not that it's necessarily wrong, but there's always two sides to a story and this film only shows you one. It is entertaining at times and if you're a Michael Moore fan you'll enjoy it. To call this film a documentary is a stretch though. I have to agree with those that are calling it propaganda. As a moderate Democrat (I don't HATE Bush - I just don't care for his policies very much, and I'm hoping for the best in Iraq.) I found it somewhat repulsive to be associated with this film and embarrassed that Moore was displayed so prominently during the convention. Looking back on the election I think that this film worked against us, firing up the Democratic base, who were already going to vote against Bush, and repelling everyone else. In the end, I think that history will not look very kindly on Mr. Moore. A deceitful ideologue at best. A traitor at worst. 1 stars for skillful manipulation. 1 star for content.	2.0	A deceitful ideologue at best	2004-12-19	36	22	14

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3F0FQZO07I3CY	Richard A. Kalm	"This is a must see.  George Bush is a most dangerous man.  This movie only touches upon the secrets which are glossed over by the mainstream media.  Check out the picture of the young George Bush at an oil well dedication in the book entitled ""The Prize.""  It's easy to see what the motivating factors are behind this war.  Iraq has the 2nd largest known oil reserves on this planet.  I really find it hard to believe Bush wishes to see democracy in a predominately Islamic fundamentalist society.  We really have more in common with the minority Sunni's (which is why we supported Iraq in the war against Iran).  Do a search for a classic photo of Rumsfield and Saddam shaking hands during Donald's visit to Iraq.  The US military was completely aware that biological weapons were being used against Iran at that time.  Currently, our media is not covering the Niger yellow cake story because it would be inappropriate before the election.  Talk about forged documents.  So, thank you Michael Moore for getting a very small yet disturbing amount of information to those who are not afraid to ask the difficult questions for fear of being labeled ""unpatriotic.""

If this film is true (of course it's also part of the fault that Clinton didn't do anything either)I have much discust for Bush.  To see our soldiers fighting and dying while Bush is entertaining was a deplorable act.  I was also amazed by how many of our US Milatary also don't like him and why none of this wasn't covered or shown on network TV.  It seems like both our media and political leaders are in bed together in this love/hate relationship.  Personally i do not vote anymore because no matter who you elect they are all crooks.  Things you see on TV never seem to be what really is happening in this world.  Which brings to me my next statement of Television.  I have pretty much STOPPED watching news programs because of lies from the media and our political leaders which is also why i don't vote.  I have also changed my religion which states in the Bible that we shouldn't get politically involved anyway.

Yes, parts of it are presented in a very one-sided fashion, but the overwhelmingly compelling evidence and connections that Moore makes throughout the whole movie are very convincing and very intelligently presented.  He is a master of presenting the horrible atrocities of the Bush administration with wit and entertaining humor that you almost feel guilty laughing.  The music is also fantastic (like the few bars of the Eric Clapton version of ""Cocaine"" that get played when they hint at Bush's drug problem, and the most fitting song of all at the end, Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"").The fact that Michael Moore can make a film this compelling and exposing makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs to question why we let this Bush administration do these things.  This movie was not a total shock to me, as I must admit that I already agreed with Moore long before I saw it, but this movie made me so angry and upset at the current state of America.  It filled me with such a sense of urgency which has stayed with me for months and months afterward.  Everyone in America should sit down and watch this movie if they haven't.I'll bet a lot of the people who posted negative reviews either never took the time to watch this movie or turned it off early just because they initially didn't agree with it.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  Whether you love Bush or hate him, watch this movie.  Use your head and think about it.  If you want to argue with Moore's points, and if you think he's wrong, then your right as an American is to never watch the movie again and vote however you want in November.  Just don't blindly dismiss the movie as useless propaganda just because it's opinion is different than yours.  And don't dare call it unamerican.  While he disagrees with the cause of the fighting, Moore makes a point to support the US soldiers in Iraq, and if you watch the whole movie you'll see that.  In fact, Moore wants the troops out of harm's way because he believes the cause they are fighting for and dying for is not worth the lives of these young men and women.  What can be more American and more Democratic than questioning your leaders and speaking out when you see something that you believe is wrong?Watch this movie with an open mind and it will open your eyes.

Time after time Michael Moore uses his liberal view of the world to distort the truth.  He is still stuck on the election of 2000 and whining because his candidate didn't win.  At the hieght of this fabricated drama, NOT documentary, Moore asks congressmen if they would sacrifice their child to secure Baghdad, or Iraq or capture Hussein.  This question poses a myriad of options and opinions to me, but the main question is what WOULD you sacrifice your child for?  It is my beleif that any parent who loves their child would say NOTHING.  This question has so much spin on it, I can't believe it stays on the video.  It also implies that we send children to fight a war as if we have toddlers patrolling Baghdad for WMD's. This movie is not a waste of time however, I think it must be viewed to see what garbage the left is pulling out in their campaign to ruin George W. Bush at any cost, even lying.  Be CAREFUL and watch this movie objectively and do YOUR own research, don't take the things Michael Moore says as fact, or what I say for that matter, just question every word of every sentence uttered in this quagmire of horse manure.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AK4MCY9LT3ZAC	"Robert Conroy ""Con' Conroy"""	"Rush Limbaugh is fond of saying that liberals hate him because he shines the light of truth on them.Apparently that explains why conservatives think Michael Moore is the worth thing that ever happened to them.After his previous film, Bowling For Columbine, right wingers were up in arms, especially because Moore himself confronted NRA spokesmen Charlton Heston in his own home and asked him why that orginization always held rallies right after a gun tragedy happened...and the rally would be in the same city as the tragedy.It was powerful stuff to watch, not because you wanted to see Heston shrink and stumble for words, but instead because certain questions need to be answered. In Farenheit 911 Moore is doing a lot of asking and a lot of conservatives are doing a lot of dodging,i.e.especially when Moore tries to get Congressmen to explain why none of their kids are in Iraq fighting the ""good fight""Moore, as a documentary film-maker is ruthless and that's why he is effective.Nowhere else will you see footage of a perplexed George Bush sitting in a schoolhouse chair on the morning of 911, seemingly frozen after getting word that something big was shaking out there.Painful to watch, but necessary.It used to be the presses job to give us the facts but these days there seems to be a gag order on members of the media, especially when it concerns this administration and the war in Iraq. You don't want your wife outed for being in the CIA, do you?Moore made no secret of the fact that he was trying to influence the outcome of the  2004 presidential election by putting this film out when he did...and it almost worked. But in the end Carl Rove and the other masterminds who work for Bush managed to prevail through smear and slander. They managed to trash Moore and his film and sent the swift-boat vets to take care of John Kerry.Republicans everywhere condemned Moores'film as a pack of lies but they had no real way of explaining away the facts presented in it.Limbaugh condemned the film but admitted to his listeners that he's never seen it himself...instead he took the advise of people who told him it was a ""cut & paste job"". Strange coming from a guy who often complains that people critisize his show without ever having heard it. But let's get back to Moore...""911"" is a must for people who want to try and make sense of what happened in Washington and around the country after...and in some cases before...September 11, 2001. It becomes apparent that the Bush administration was not focused on the terrorist threat before that tragic day and after it was history they tried to take advantage of it in the form of convincing Americans that the country of Iraq and it's leader, Saddam Hussein, were an ""imminent threat"" that needed to be dealt with immediately. But ""911"" is also about much more than that. It is about corruption in all of politics and how that effects those of us in this country who still believe that America is a great place and freedom is a great blessing. The caveat in this movie is that our freedoms are under assault, not from without bit from within(,e.g the Patriot Act, illegal immigration, the silencing of the media)and the only way that we can protect that freedom is by dealing with the cold, hard facts.So we can harp on the fact that Michael Moore is an overweight guy who dresses like a slob or we can attest to the fact that he makes one hell of a documentary and forces us to think."	5.0	The Heat Is On the Neo-Cons	2005-07-20	20	13	7
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1S8AJIUIO6M9K	Robert David STEELE Vivas	"My teen-age son specializes in techno-art and his comment to me costs this film one star--he says that the out of context mixing of video clips is very low rent and almost unethical.  Seems like a very good point.The film does, however, offer many important points that I summarize here for those who have been--as I was--reluctant to invest the time or money in this controversial film.  It *is* worth buying or renting and watching.The most important point early on is many Members of the House of Representative demanded Congressional action in the aftermath of the known illegal disenfranchisement of people of color across Florida, and not a single Senator, including Al Gore as President of the Senate, was willing to sign on and force the issue.  For this alone Al Gore will never get a vote from me, and I am fairly disgusted with the entire body.  I am *very* surprised that Senator Byrd did not sign on, and wonder what kind of deal was made in the back rooms of the Senate.  From that one decision have stemmed 6 years going on eight of a half trillion dollar war with thousands of dead and tens of thousands of amputees and disabled veterans whom Bush has been trying to sideline, cutting their benefits and medical care.He reminds us of the eggs thrown on the motorcade on inaugural day, and the documented fact that Bush was on vacation 42% of the time in his first 8 months.Not one meeting on terrorism in all that time.  The film is in error in claiming Bush did not read the 6 August report.  As James Risen notes in ""State of War"" Bush got a frantic personal briefing from CIA, and then blew them off with the obscene comments ""OK, you've covered your ass on this.""The film traces the connection between Saudi money, Bush, and his National Guard flying buddy Bath, and the later the Carlyle Group, where partner George Bush Senior was the ONLY President to continue to demand CIA briefings after retirement.  The film correctly points out that $1.4 billion dollars from the Saudis invested in the Bush family carries a lot more weight than the $400K a year salary from the taxpayer, one reason, no doubt, why 142 Saudis got to fly out of America on 6 private planes after 9/11 while all Americans were grounded.We are reminded of George Bush Juniors obstruction of justice in the 9/11 Commission investigation, and pointedly reminded that Iraq was put in play on 13 September despite strong assertions from Dick Clark and others that Iraq had nothing to do with the attack.We are reminding that Attorney General John Ashcroft lost his Senate race against a dead man still on the ballot, and that Ashcroft pointedly told the FBI he did not want to hear about terrorism.The movie overall highlights Donald Rumsfeld as a fraud, with clips of his speaking about the ""humanity of precision targeting"" followed by clips of mass destruction.There is a fascinating discussion of how poverty across America is producing recruits for the military who would not normally volunteer, and then pointedly shown Congressmen ducking interviews because only 1 of the 535 has a son in Iraq.There are moving interviews with people who lost children in Iraq, and two points jump out: the first is that the general public does not distinguish between the need to honor their loved one's sacrifice and our Armed Forces, and the need to condemn and hold accountable the political leadership that lied to all Americans, to Congress, and to the United Nations.The second point is that those who lost children do not blame Al Qaeda; they blame the political leadership of America, but not in a strong enough manner to demand impeachment (yet).The movie concludes that the object of war is continuous war to keep the current hierarchical system of wealth, power, and privilege in place.It's a very strong creative effort, marred only slightly by what my teen-age son considers to be video editing slights of hand."	4.0	Too Glib By Half, But Many Important Points	2006-08-18	13	10	3

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	"The good news: I just came back from watching a great Horror movie. The bad news: the Horror is real. Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker famous for his flat Midwestern accent, his girth and brilliant muckraking films such as ROGER & ME (1989), THE BIG ONE (1997) and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002, this one unseen by me as of yet), has crafted what may be his ultimate depiction of sad reality. This is about our nation's present situation in Iraq and how we came to be there, how it is currently being fought, how it is justified by those who are in power but don't have any children serving in Iraq, etc. It begins with a pre-title sequence showing the horrific event that started this ball rolling: the stealing of the Presidency by George W. Bush.From the early days of the Bush Administration, which show Georgie out fishing in Kennebunkport, Maine, relaxing in his ranch in Crawford, Texas (and claiming to be ""taking care of business"" in the meantime), to the aftermath of September 11, 2001, we are presented with the facts as they unfurled before various videocameras and live cable feeds. We are presented with an administration run by men whose families have strong business and personal ties with Saudi Arabian government officials and billionaire businessmen, with a Vice President whose oil company he chaired (immediately before his current job of serving the public as the nation's #2 man) being granted one no-bid contract after the other, and reaping billions in dollars in profit in the process, with soldiers being targeted for recruitment out of the poorest neighborhoods (that were, ironically, made even poorer by the current administration's economic policies) by slathering Marine recruiters to fight a war---a war that they had nothing to do with, against an enemy who had never laid hands on American soil or an American citizen, for a cause that was misrepresented to begin with, to fight a war that supposedly ended on May 1st of last year, and which is still being fought as these words are being typed today. As you are reading them on some other day. Perhaps while one of your loved ones is fighting. Or being killed. That, I believe, is the point of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 (2004), a film made---believe it or not---to honor those who face this daily hell, either as a soldier or an agonized family member. A hell that they did not create, yet are expected to ""win.""Some of you reading this review may be among those who accuse Michael Moore of politicizing this war, or 9/11 itself. Yet by actually *watching* this film, it is clearly seen that George W. Bush (along with his entire entourage of Cabinet members such as Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Assistant Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice) has politicized the war by sporadically using the ""Security Level Alert"" system (or whatever it's called) to create fear and tension throughout the American populace, and using that fear to hype-up support for a war that has been waged almost entirely for business reasons; ironically, for reasons that hold no benefit whatsoever for the average American. As one war-supporting woman in the film says, you may think the events in this film are all ""staged."" Sure they were staged; by the President, his Cabinet officials, by the U.S. military, even by the national network TV news stations. Lastly, some of you may decry this film as ""propaganda."" Oh, I *love* that one! You want propaganda? Turn on Fox News Channel any day of the week, any time of the day---there, you'll get Bush Admin propaganda 24/7.Still want to accuse Michael Moore of political propagandizing? Fine, but think about this: at least his ""propaganda"" hasn't directly led to hundreds (perhaps soon to be thousands) of American soldiers losing their lives. Or to thousands (perhaps soon to be tens of thousands) of innocent Iraqi people being killed by their ""protectors."" All Moore is doing is encapsulating reality, by shrinking down the millions of hours of broadcasting and giving us the facts. The facts like the Saudi Arabian embassy being across the street from the Watergate hotel and prominent U.S. Government buildings (the only such embassy, by the way, that has continual Secret Service protection). Facts such as arch-conservative (and former Nixon administration official) Richard Perle confessing that Bush had gotten it all wrong when he decided to go after Iraq. Facts like a self-proclaimed ""conservative"" from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan who had been a strong war-supporter, until that very war took the life of her son. Other facts too numerous to mention here. For more information as to how wrong our current path is, please see this film.

If you are an American, no scratch that, if you are a human being with you MUST see this film. I saw this film on 07/19/04, weeks after it opened, and the theatre was sold out. People are still pouring in to see this controversial film by an even more controversial Moore. Luckily the controversy is what's bringing the audience in, and what they get is a dose of reality, and two hours of hard to phathom information.I was moved beyond words by this picture.

At the end of the full contents of the dvd, including features, etc., I sat back and in my mind I let it all sink in.  I must have spent an hour just digesting all that I viewed.  The opening, showing a close up of Bush, sitting there in front of the children, with his usual photo op, staged and choreographed as has been the practice of this presidency, worked in reverse and actually showed the naked truth for a change. Here was the seven minute void, showing an presidential aid whispering in his ear that the country had been attacked. The close up showing Bush's expression and demeanor,the eye movement and freeze, captured by the video was startling, the picking up of a book and the vacant stare, all that was missing was a, ""dunce cap."" Without someone pulling his strings and feeding him hidden written notes.  Here was the birth of a self proclaimed, SUPER SUPER COMMANDER-IN CHIEF."" This video clip when viewed world wide will definitely not leave a positive impression to all the terrorists lurking in the shadows.  The aforementioned was in my opinion a highlight of this dvd.  Of course all the other video clips and speeches were also of great significance.The vido clip which described  the joint appearance of Bush and Cheney re:9/11 so called investigation by a committee held behind closed doors, not under oath, was described by Bush as he appeared before reporters, ""as a friendly conversation,"" or words to that effect, was extremely revealing.  A reporter asked if appearing jointly with Cheney was a way to keep their stories straight, Bush as is his wont, fixed a sickly grin and uttered something ridiculous.This documentary was excellent and I would personally rate it in excess of *****.Finally, this documentary has been critized by many of the younger generation who with adoring eyes, wave banners depicting, ""we love Bush,"" and, ""four more years,"" which to me equals, ""four more arrears.""  If there were a draft, and there was a strong chance that these banner wavers would follow their Commander-in-Chief and share the agony of what is going on in Iraq, I truly believe the displays would take on another meaning.I mean to share this dvd with a few friends of different ages, just to see and learn their reaction.My profound thanks to, ""Michael Moore,"" who made this possible.Robert Lyons, Reno, Nevada"	5.0	Fahrenheit 9/11: A thought provoking experience	2004-10-08	7	5	2

Go to the library, read some accurate history books, think things over and then decide if our leaders are being elected in truth and justice and are really serving the best interests of the citizen, or whether they are serving the intrests if the civilization which in the end is nothing more than the few who have sublime control over the masses.	3.0	A New Form of Coercion	2004-07-30	40	16	24

George Bush--whose daughters, like their father, have found campaigning in safety more attractive than going to war for the cause they supposedly believe in--is a greater president than Lincoln? Roosevelt? Truman? What has he accomplished except to squander the sympathy the world showed after 9-11, spend the surplus, and make the wealthy even wealthier? As Moore points out, Bush is inspiring more terrorists than we can kill while he turns a blind eye to our allies' (like Musharaff) giving a free pass to the man who we know sold nuclear weapons to Iran, the very country we armed Saddam Hussein to weaken. I have a suggestion, If Bush's war is just, why don't you guys head on over to your recruiter. Or would it be harder to be for the war--as Moore implies of Congress--if fighting actually cost you something!	5.0	Greatest President Ever?	2004-07-14	33	21	12

I'm undecided about Michael Moore, but I can say that what he's promoting is mostly to be against Bush, and I agree with that.  However, I would suggest Greg Palast's film Bush's Family Fortunes: The Best Democracy Money Can Buy as a better film to show, if you want to expose Bush.  Greg Palast might not be as entertaining, but he clearly has done more research and interviews both sides.  Michael Moore does that as well, but he really tries to push them to look bad.  Greg Palast also lets the story tell itself, Michael Moore tries to tell the story.	4.0	Entertaining, but not the best Anti-Bush film	2009-11-28	4	2	2

But I can not say that.I do know that what was suggested to me was that MONEY RULES the world. The rich keep the poor exactly where they want them. And there is a balance that must be struck. Oh it is ok if a few slip through and make it up to the big time. They are not a threat. They always join the club and quickly forget where they came from.I guess my being raised in an orphanage and being treated like a piece of crap, for many years, has made me aware of what the rich can do to those living below their standards.Could what happened in Russia, Iraq and Germany, as well as many other countries in the world ever happen here in America? Of course it could. The citizens of those countries thought it could never happen there either. One day they woke up and the monster had appeared it's ugly head. By then it was to late for the common-man to do anything about it.POWER is a strange creature. It makes men very greedy and very selfish. Some in high places think that power gives them permission to steal, cheat, lie and even kill.Are there no common-men, or women, who are not wealthly, who are smart enough to serve in the Congress or the Senate? If so, where are they? Why is it that the rich always seem to grab power in almost every country in the world?What are the chances that any one family can be smart enough to have two Congressmen, or two Senators, a Governor or even two Presidents come from the same family? How is that possible? It is possible because of money and power. Of course it is...It happens in both political parties. And it will happen in a third party should one ever be formed.The film to me is not about what is TRUE or FALSE. It is about what could possibly become TRUTH if power is not kept in check. And if it does happen it will be because we did it to ourselves. One day your brother, or your sister might rise up against you. If and when they do; it will be because it is the only way that they can save themselves. This has happened many times in the course of history.One must look far beyond the film itself.I sometimes wonder when I watch television and see Hilter speaking to the massive german crowds. If the people attending the speech looked at that gathering as a political type convention. I see those same looks, screams and yells coming from both the Republican and Democratic convention attendees. But maybe that's just stupid old me.I rate this film FIVE STARS."	5.0	What the hell let's go for it	2004-09-10	36	21	15
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A36U9E0UK45U32	Roger F. Graves	"I saw an interesting stat on the web recently.  We have approximately 3200 people in our country die every month in auto accidents.  That's about the same number that died in 9/11, but it's never brought up in the news, nobody goes out to protest car dealerships, I don't see anyone tearfully pleading with their loved ones to not drive to work when they get up in the morning.  So why is it that we have a couple buildings knocked down, we suffer the same number of casualties that happen on a regular basis every month on our highways, and it completely transforms our country and culture into a profound state of fear and paranoia?  Over 400,000 of our people died in WWII and our population level was about half as it is now.  During the civil war, a whopping 2% of the entire U.S. population died.  How on God's green earth could the deaths of 3000 people, .0012% of our population, shake the foundation of our culture to the point where it's unpatriotic to have a difference of opinion and we adopt a policy of attacking countries for what they ""might"" do?  I've heard historians wonder if 9/11 is the beginning of America's decline in history, like when Rome first fell.  Well let me tell you something -- if we're to the point where a few buildings being knocked down gets us to start back treading on civil rights and reverting to hair-trigger foreign policies, we are going down in a friggin hurry."	5.0	The overreaction of 9/11, finally brought to light	2004-06-24	41	25	16
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2IQEPHXINU8YS	Roger	The film is a well-organized gathering of information - most of which I knew but with a few nasty surprises. Whether you think of yourself as patriot or nationalist, whether intelligent or just  having common-sense, I don't think you can honestly complain about partisanship here. If the editing helps make a point Moore clear, it pretty much follows independently verifiable facts. We know from past experience that when government tries this hard to censor and control information it's pretty deep in the muck. Moore actually just  compares and contrasts excerpts from the Administration's own movies pretending to be History in the Making - e.g.: the Mission Accomplished banner on the aircraft carrier (haven't more people died since that stunt than had before), the constant, non-stop, repeated insistence that Saddam and Osama are buddies (Bots in the White House?) - and this, along with the breathtaking arrogance of these leaders, is what makes the film so hair-raising. The grief is not over -  its worse than ever now that our own government has been hijacked.	5.0	Pay attention; stay alive	2004-06-26	12	8	4

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A134FLH2KNA0JU	Roger McEvilly (the guilty bystander)	This is a documentary which presents the view that the US-led war in Iraq is a tragic and purposeless waste of time and life, which ultimately only serves to suit the financial and political power structures within the US. I don't agree with Mr Moore's team on everything, but I agree with what he is trying to do - paint the full picture of the tragedy that is modern day Iraq (which is always difficult to get from the press). Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good and timely film. Open discussion of such complex issues itself justifies the film, despite what some ultra-conservatives might think. But at the end of the day, his lack of impartiality and blatant selectivity, including the derisive and selective theatrical style, will not, in the end, suit his ultimate cause (which is 'reality'). In the end he uses techniques and a selective style which he also accuses in those with whom he has disagreement.My advice is, if you want a rule of thumb for these kind of political documentaries, you would do well by simply believing the truth is somewhere in the middle. Much of what Mr Moore implies is difficult to substantiate, which by any measure would mean that some of it is probably true, some isn't. People are not very good statisticians by nature (let's face it who is), therefore you often get polarised views from such documentaries - one is either very much in agreement, or very much against. A little moderation does not go astray here.You could argue incessantly about the details, and Moore's attack on the Bush Administration might well contain strong elements of truth, however this doesn't necessarily justify blanket accusations and the blatant selectivity. Carefully placed and themed music, selectivity of example, bias justified by humour (with ridicule), camera angles (also justified by humour) and at the end of the day, the same applied to his conclusions, means truth becomes subservient to polemic, the cause, or cinematic effect. This is not really the answer to a tragedy such as modern day Iraq.Nevertheless there is a lot of good stuff here that is worth mentioning. This includes that having business or family contacts doesn't necessarily translate to astute political leadership or social understanding, that the poor and the young often seem to get the raw end of the deal, that fear is often at the root of political or social strife, or that mineral and oil resources, and who owns or uses them, play a bigger part in our lives than we often think.Selectivity of example includes the following: other people than the poor and unemployed go to fight in Iraq, and the portrayal of Iraq that all was well and happy prior to the US-led invasion was grossly inadequate. What also is not mentioned is an important security issue with regards to the Iraqi style of government-regardless of WMDs- there was, (rightly or wrongly), a perceived potential of future terrorist complicity, something that was difficult if not impossible to minimise through the former regime. One of the best ways to minimise terrorist activities is through resources available to government and through international co-operation, the fact was, that Iraq was perceived (rightly or wrongly) to fail in all such respects from this perspective-regardless of the presence or non-presence of WMDs. However this doesn't necessarily justify what might be labelled, in this circumstance, a 'pre-emptive' invasion.The level of Saudi involvement in the US is, at best, ambiguous in nature, as such trade relationships have benefits for many on both sides (not just those who own resources or trade with them). Put simply, the irony is that less business integration might create more, or different problems.One final point-there is no such temperature as '9/11'-the title contains mixed, non-compatible concepts (ie temperature mixed with date). A small, completely irrelevant technical detail one might say, where concepts have been mixed within a title for obvious dramatic effect. But this is the difference between drama and reality. If you apply this technique to the rest of the film, Mr Moore's film becomes, at least partially, self-defeating. Small, (apparently) irrelevant truths and non-compatible concepts have been altered or mixed for dramatic effect, which is pretty much what he accuses others of doing.	3.0	Hot and cold	2004-07-25	7	5	2
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"****1/2When Michael Moore`s controversial documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was released in the summer of 2004, it hit a readiness reaction with a large segment of the American public, people who found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the country was taking under the Bush administration and who believed that, in this film, someone for the first time was finally giving voice, in a mass media outlet, to their deepest held fears and concerns.  Let's face it; no fiction writer could have concocted a more bizarre and surrealistic series of events than what actually occurred in the United States in the first few years of this millennium:  a contested Presidential election followed by a terrorist attack of unprecedented proportions followed by a ""retaliatory"" war aimed at the wrong country and based almost entirely on faulty intelligence.  These three incidents converged to create a near ""perfect storm"" for Moore's documentary.  It also didn't hurt, from a commercial point of view, that the film was released in the heat of a bruising Presidential campaign, one in which the stakes never seemed higher for both ends of the political spectrum in the country.  The 2004 Presidential election would be a fight to the death, one whose motto was clearly: may the better ideology win.Well, it has been a year since Moore's film hit the streets and almost as long a time since Bush won reelection for a second term as president.  The question to be asked now is, with the passions on both sides cooled down to at least some extent (or are they?), how does ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" play in a post-election world?  The answer is pretty damn well actually, mainly because most of the issues Moore raises are still as valid after the election as they were before (mainly because Bush WAS reelected).Moore is, of course, an unapologetic liberal and a self-appointed gadfly for the powers-that-be in our society.  As such, he aims his sights directly at the Bush administration and all those who support it.  He starts off brilliantly by recalling the horrors of 9/11 in a unique way: showing us a black screen while the sounds of the planes crashing into the buildings are heard on the soundtrack.  With memories of that horror still lingering in our heads, Moore then proceeds to expose the Bush family's long standing connections with the Saudi royal family, a fact that few people seemed aware of before this film was released.  Moore then goes on to criticize the way in which the Bush administration has exploited the ""War on Terror"" for maximum political effectiveness, culminating in the Patriot Act which, he argues, has had a draconian impact on the civil rights of ordinary American citizens.But the greatest part of Moore's wrath is saved for the second half of the film, when he confronts what he sees as the wholly unjustifiable war in Iraq.  Moore is to be given credit for being one of the first and only people to have shown us actual on-the-ground pictures of the death and carnage that occurred in that country immediately after the initial bombings.  Watching these gruesome images, we are immediately struck by just how antiseptic the media's coverage of the war has been here in the United States - a fact that Moore blames not only on the Bush administration but on a press that has allowed itself to become little more than an extension of the rah-rah, war-rallying propaganda machine set up by the government (a government, for instance, that refused to allow any pictures to be taken of flag-draped coffins coming back from the war zone).The section dealing with the Iraq War is the most emotionally devastating section of the film, mainly because Moore is able to bring it home to us personally through the ordinary individuals who have been most directly affected by it - soldiers on the field, amputees in the hospital and, most heartbreakingly, the mother of a boy killed in a helicopter crash in April, 2003.  Her unbearable grief, so nakedly exposed on camera for all to see, becomes an emblem for a war that not only need not have happened, but has, as Moore points out in various ways, been largely bought and paid for with the blood of brave men and women from the lower, underprivileged tier of society.  He ends his film by confronting a number of congressmen who voted for the war but who seem reluctant to send their own children over to do the actual fighting.  Actually, there is so much going on in this film that it becomes virtually impossible to convey even half of it in a short review such as this one.As with his previous films, Moore once again proves himself the master of facile irony, pointing out, in darkly humorous fashion, the absurd inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisies that abound in the world around us.  These moments are what keep Moore's films from becoming dry-as-dust jeremiads against what he sees as a corrupt system.  He makes us laugh even when we know we should be crying, but this is the way a polemicist reaches his audience.  And no one understands that better than Michael Moore.Is the film ""fair,"" ""balanced,"" ""nonpartisan"" in its approach?  Absolutely not.  Does it need to be?  Well, I can certainly see where people of the opposite political persuasion might find themselves wanting to yell back at the screen or lob a few well chosen projectiles where they feel it would do the most good.  And that's fine too.  After all, it's a free country and the Bush supporters have every right to launch their own rebuttal against this film if they so choose.  I would truly love to see it.  But until that time both liberals and conservatives will have to be content with kicking the set every time ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is appearing on the screen.  The funny thing is that they'll be doing so for entirely different reasons."	4.0	knockout documentary	2005-08-08	10	2	8

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A34DQ4GKCNIF43	"Ron ""Skeptic"""	Fahrenheit 9/11 is an important and powerful film.  It indicts the media almost as much as it does President Bush.  Its facts are very well backed-up -- see the free web-based encyclopedia for an excellent and thorough review.  [...]The movie is important because it shows the footage and quotes that we should have seen elsewhere.  Colin Powell saying that Iraq was not a threat was footage that we should have seen before the war.  For those with any ability to show skepticism, we saw that the threat from Iraq was being exaggerated.The film also gives a peek behind the curtain of national politics in the United States.  You start to realize how much the presidency (this administration and earlier ones) are so much about acting and show business.Reviewers talk about the air space being open on Sept. 14, 2001, but it was still very difficult for the average members of the public to get air tickets.  (I have a friend who was trying to get out of New York City at the time.)  And hundreds of people were being detained for weeks on relatively flimsy connections whereas whole plane-loads of Saudis and bin Ladens were allowed to leave with very brief interviews almost certainly because of their connection to Bush.One other important message from the movie is that war is horror.  It should always be a last resort.  Invading Afghanistan was necessary; invading Iraq was not.  It is morally wrong to use war as just another tool of foreign policy.  If you think that war is no big deal or that it is exciting or fun to bomb and shoot people, please see this movie.I give the movie 5 stars for powerful content, excellent editing, important facts, and moving music.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ADKA2MJQQCMTO	Ron Sullivan	"Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it.There were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film.  I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece.  That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it).  I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument.So how did he do?  Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test.  On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.Granted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment.  The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves.  This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?).The thing that Moore really has a knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times.  I'm thinking of the segments with the ""office parachute"" or the sealed ""anti-terrorist pot-a-john.""  There's not enough though, I would have loved it if there was a little more of this kind of humor.Moore still jumps subjects a little too much.  I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used in today's society.  As it is in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some interesting work winds up feeling half-finished.As a whole, if you take this as an Op/Ed piece, it instantly becomes a lot better.  For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit ""fair or balanced"" as Fox News would say.  For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point.  Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't mean that it's good.  Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own.  What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions.There in lies the value in a piece such as this.  It will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves.  The challenge for either side is to not just take it at face-value."	3.0	Take it for what it is ...	2004-10-11	19	14	5

Just as people will rubberneck to catch a glimpse of an accident, people are driven to see this movie to witness the unvarnished realities of the Bush administration: massive debt, overwhelming government growth, rampant militarism and the loss of world respect (just to name a few).Moore uses a good balance of humor and pathos to paint a portrait of how an unsuccessful businessman can ride the coattails of his wealthy friends and family all the way to the Whitehouse.  He goes on to show how this rich cabal uses their privileged position to further their agenda around the world with sometimes disastrous results.  Bush himself said it best when he addressed the audience at a fundraiser as the ""haves... and have mores"".  The unabashed hubris of this so called Christian is on display like feathers on a peacock.I can see from the one star ""reviews"" that many right wingers have not seen this film.  That's too bad.  They are depriving themselves of some truly first class humor.  For example, there is the hilarious introduction to our attorney general: ""In the year 2000, [John Ashcroft] was running for re-election as Senator from Missouri against a man who died the month before the election.  The voters preferred the dead guy.""  Even an Oxycontin addled ditto head should be able to appreciate the humor in that line.There might even be a few republicans capable of comprehending some of Moore's more subtle jokes.  Take for instance the scene where he presents the military records documenting Bush's suspension for dodging a National Guard medical examination.  As the camera zooms in to show the condemning sentence and highlight Bush's name, the narration is interrupted for a couple seconds to play the guitar lick from Eric Clapton's version of ""Cocaine"".  Get it?  Now that is funny!My favorite laugh-out-loud section is Moore's introduction to ""The Coalition of the Willing"" including Palau, Costa Rica, Iceland, Romania, The Netherlands, and Afghanistan.  If I'd had a mouth full of something when the clip from Nosferatu appeared, I would have spewed it all over the screen.Of course there are more serious moments that were just as effective.  The scenes that show how the war in Iraq is being fought by the economically underprivileged (definitely not Bush's haves and have mores), the gruesome footage from the war itself (surgical strikes -- nice clean war, yeah right Rumi), and the personal accounts of unnecessary loss of life drive home an unmistakable message: Bush and his cronies have made huge mistakes and the ""have nots"" are the ones paying for it."	5.0	Succeeds on all levels	2004-10-22	34	22	12

Right from the start I could see this was going to be far too biased and misleading to be taken seriously.  Moore's efforts to discredit the Bush regime are pretty laughable in places.  Then again, footage of Iraqi civilians killed and injured by the American army are powerful and moving, and interviews with soldiers who seem to find the whole thing &quot;awesome&quot; and a &quot;rush&quot; really do stir the anti-American, anti-war sentiments.  All the more confusing when, after showing them to be such a brainless and dislikable bunch, the film turns into a tribute to the soldiers and the sacrifices they make.  It all peters out rather disappointingly.  Still, Bush does come across as a bit of an idiot, and you wouldn't trust that Rumsfeld chap to make a cup of tea.

Or are we a nation that brings health, security and prosperity to its citizens? Should the taxes paid by the american people support the american people?

Although I appreciate and respect both of these great thinkers, their ponderous intellectualism is a long way from the world of the average american auto mechanic. Chomsky and Vidal are slightly cool breezes in the great hurricane of hot air that is ""Academia"", but Michael Moore is, refreshingly, YOU AND ME.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	Fahrenheit 9/11 is far from a classic piece of film rhetoric or propaganda, but for an indie film produced with limited finances, marginal film stock, and limited access to government records, etc, it's not bad.  Like Eisenstein's Odessa Steps or D. W. Griffith's Piedmont, S.C., Moore uses place (Flint and Washington) as a microcosm for abstract ideas about the inequality and incalculable costs of a nation's war-making ways.  And like both of those acclaimed directors, he uses montage effectively.  In fact, the shot of children playing in a near-bucolic Baghdag prior to the American bombing is reminiscent of Coppola's shot of a pastoral Vietnam village just before Robert Duval blows it to smithereens in Apocalypse Now.Less effective are Moore's own appearances in the film.  Far from the subtlety of a Hitchcock, they bear the sophomoric heavy-handedness of a Saturday Night Live skit.  Moreover, doesn't Moore understand that this much attention brought to the messenger can only serve to detract from the strength and lasting impression of the message?Also, I'm surprised that the film spends so little time implicating Cheney and the President's men.  By concentrating so intently and frequently on an obtuse and arrogant-looking Bush, the film makes him a more memorable, colorful character than he deserves to be.  As far as the war's supporters are concerned, this film could actually strengthen true believers' attachment to the present leader as a misunderstood, misrepresented banner carrier.The best-written, most effective parts of the film are the beginning and end, where Moore is able to make the point that neither in Florida nor in Baghdad could the conservative base and keepers of the corporate store tolerate a loss, much less a conclusive victory.  Quoting Orwell, Moore leaves us with a chilling reminder of why war in itself serves the interests of the privileged and the powerful.	4.0	He's No Eisenstein, Riefenstahl, Griffith or Coppola	2004-07-08	34	17	17
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" teems with passion and patriotism, and it is a triumph of American individualism: Here is Moore and his small team firing one of the strongest volleys against the Bush administration over its handling of the terrorist attacks, the invasion of Afghanistan and, to the filmmaker, an unjust war in Iraq. Moore, fat and shabby, reviled by an entire political party, is not only crafting a small personal gem (""Roger & Me"") or a scattershot rant (""Bowling for Columbine"") but a politcal lightning rod setting theaters afire.With comedy and outrage, Moore articulates the liberal mood in ways mainstream media and political columnists cannot: It is that moment in ""Network"" when Howard Beale calls viewers to their windows to yell they're mad as hell, and they're not gonna take it anymore. Like Beale, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is manic and conspiratorial; it goes all the way. So far, in fact, as to explain an undermanned, half-baked invasion in Afghanistan as a dual mission to install some natural gas pipeline running through the region. But while Moore explictly indicts Bush and his ""warmakers"" - Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft and George H. W. Bush chiefly -  his movie thrums with indictment and instruction for most Americans, and to ignore or skip it for its liberal viewpoint is to ignore or miss Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" for its Christianity.If you care about political discourse - or even your place in the machine of this republic - buy a ticket.The movie is Moore's comprehensive argument against all that has happened since Bush's election, beginning with the ratification of that election, as Al Gore, still head of the Senate as Vice President, gavels black Congressmen and Congresswomen into silence as they protest W's narrow, Supreme Court-approved victory. The scene runs underneath the entirety of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"": Most Democrats tacitly agree, or remain timid, in the face of Bush's bull run after 9/11. Moore never relents in showing Bush's financial connection to the Saudi royal family - which may have allowed members of the Bin Laden family to leave just days after 9/11 - or his administration's seemingly deliberate use of the terrorist warning system to ratchet fear up and down as if the public were a violin. But, as Moore shows, the media tags along. Fox News touts poison pens. Dan Rather admits he's rooting for ""my country"" to win. After the Iraqi invasion Ted Koppel marvels at the remarkable American killing machine as it races its way to Baghdad. And Democrats preach about ""staying the course,"" fearful of the conservative backlash, certain - correctly so - that liberals are too couched in defeat, too busy watching ""Trading Spaces"" or reality TV, to voice their support.We have digested the last four years in pieces: Two dead today, insurgency last week, Dick Cheney's podium pounding tomorrow. In tiny bites, the crucible isn't tasty, but it is manageble. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the big, full-mouthed gulp and chew - the completed, grotesque puzzle when the footage is spliced together. The editing and juxtaposition of the film is overwhelming. A member of Moore's team, Jeff Gibbs, overlaps ""The Roof Is On Fire"" over shots of dead Iraqi children. In another scene, soliders touch the genitals of Iraqi prisoners. In a third, Marines raid a suburban Iraqi home while the family, gripped with fear, screams in vain.In its most powerful segment, Moore returns to Flint to interview Lila Lipscomb, whose son dies in Iraq. Lipscomb is waking up to the realities of this war - she originally describes herself as a ""conservative democrat"" - and when she is challenged by a Republican in Washington D.C., Lipscomb brings the debate to a halt. She bawls and rages in front of the White House, and you'd like to look away for privacy's sake. But you can't. Lipscomb personifies a growing, virulent anger in previously silent Americans tired of the dismissive attitude of the esblishment and their many so-called ""patriotic"" supporters.Is it propaganda? In portions where Moore depicts Bush as bumbling, crooked fool, yes, although Bush's own words do more than half the work. The pipeline theory is the stuff of Internet Web Blogs. Moore attempts to tie cutbacks in the Oregon State Patrol And yet - the Bush administration doesn't cuddle to any detractor. It pursues its agenda with zeal and force, and has an army of radio and television commentators working the trenches while Bush shakes hands and gives cabinet members pet names.  It takes a certain kind of energy and critical eye to counteract that machine, and Moore - not the networks, nor the editorial pages - has it.He takes his movie to the streets, and though his facts and melding of footage may occasionally present a blurry line, let's not kid ourselves: The lines have been forever blurred, and gentleman truths no longer prevail. For better or worse, the dueling voices Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore are the future. In such partisan times, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" puts the ball back in the conservative court. It cannot be ignored."	5.0	Love it. Hate it. See it. An essential film for Americans.	2004-06-29	13	0	13

Moore basically states in his film that the Bushes are in league with the arab oil merchants, I suppose to eventually own and rule the world. The implied conspiracies ramble on like some asteroid hurling towards earth to a quick and sudden demise of all humanity. If Moore had worked on Oliver Stone's ""JFK"", there would have been twenty gunmen on the grassy knoll, and car bombs exploding nearby to kill all the witnesses, with a teenage George Bush calling Jack Ruby to do ""his thing"". It's unfortunate that society, even the conspiracy nuts, have to be exposed to a humorless, sour,untruthful, unpleasant movie like Fahrenheit 9/11. The closest ""filmmaker"" to Moore would be ED WOODS, but even woods tried to make sense of his pathetic attempts.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3OPCQYY5JM2TJ	"S B ""sdb70"""	By way of introduction, I consider myself a true moderate.  That means that I watch BOTH CNN and Fox News, and I listen to BOTH local AM radio and NPR.  Apparently, I am in the minority, as most Americans seem to want to listen to only the people who support their existing viewpoint.At the time this film came out, I looked desparately for a detractor who had ACTUALLY seen it.  Much to my chagrin, even John McCain, my favorite national politician (at least until he started serving as water-boy for the Bush re-election campaign), dissed the film without having even seen it.As a piece of film (for which it is rarely judged), this is a very well put together - with a nice contrast between the comic and the tragic.As a political commentary and indictment of the Bush administration, there is a whole lot of stuff that I took with the requisite grain of salt.  First of all, the fact that only one officer patrols the entire coast of Oregon is not only not within the jurisdiction of the federal government, but is not really that significant.  Secondly, I do not really think that the Bush-Bin Laden family connection, and financial gain to be had from a war on terrorism, inhibited the administration from stopping 9/11, as is implied by parts of the film.  The problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they assume a level of competency that is probably not there.Ultimately, however, I believe that there are parts of this film that are effectively indisputable and ultimately cemented my opposition to the Bush administration.  The most telling part of the film is the footage of Bush, continuing in his photo op with grade school children, for several minutes after being told the U.S. was under attach.  Just watch the blank stare of a deer in the headlights, without Moore's commentary, and tell me that this is the guy you want to be the next president.  It says alot about the true nature of his character and the tremendous influence of his handlers that he did not get up, right then and there, and do SOMETHING.  We already knew from the 2000 election that this guy was no Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, or Reagan, but that footage (conspicuously absent at the time 9/11 occured) has convinced me that this has got to stop.  And I still haven't heard a rebuttal from the Republicans on THIS part of the film.	4.0	Well done . . . if you are open-minded.	2004-10-05	22	18	4

However, I tried to view Moore's piece objectively and independently.The movie itself was absolutely brilliant, Moore's witty and clever narrative conveys the message that he tries to bring across to his audience with clarity and humor. His choice of startling and sometimes shocking photos and video clips have a raw, truthful, and real-life feel to it.One of my favorite scenes was when Bush was given the news regarding the attacks on the twin towers while sitting in a classroom, reading a storybook titled ""My Pet Goat"". He sits there for SEVEN MINUTES, unsure of what to do, making faces and looking worried. How did we ever elect this man to be our Commander-in-Chief?Moore exposes what he calls the ""lies"" of our current administration. He depicts how Bush ""stole"" the election in Florida, how Bush went into Iraq only for profits and not for the supposed weapons of mass destruction (what, a few hand grenades?), and how Bush's close ties with the Saudi royal family affect American taxpayers.I would advise everyone to see it first, before making a pre-bias about Moore or the film itself.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	"I avoided this documentary for quite some time, particularly due to all the hype over how powerful it was, and from other voices how lame it was.  Well, I finally watched it to discover that I found it to be neither overly powerful or overly lame, but a fairly normal documentary put together much like others, focusing on the Bush family.Ignoring the Republican/Democrat verbal boxing matches (lets face it folks, there is no discerning the two parties apart any longer, all we have are Republicrats) this documentary did actually have some information that all Americans, regardless of partisanship, should have knowledge of.Most important, in my opinion, are the Bush/Cheney ties to the Bin Laden family.  Perhaps it is true that they have cut off their black-sheep son Osama, but there was no reason to personally, and at tax-payer expense, fly Bin Laden family members out of the United States before the public caught wind of their presence.Also, a personal opinion, is that there should not be that much camaraderie between supposedly ""competitive"" oil sources, meaning American/Eastern oil sources.  If this high-level billionaire club competed more than co-joined, I believe we *might* see lower prices.  No promises though.  But it does seem like a horrible friendship to keep during wartime, which is what makes Moore's presentation of ""hand-shaking"" Bush/Bin Laden pics so funny when presented to the tune of 'Shiny Happy Faces'.  That was a nice touch.But the Bush's (both SR and Bubba) oil connections to the Bin Laden's should, IMHO, have been made available to the public long before any elections were held.  Plus, the tie in with the powerful Carlyle Group and their connections to Bush, Bin Laden, Cheney, and the new Middle Eastern Oil Pipeline project (a major project never covered by the media in the USA) should be of interest to everyone.  And, not to surprise anyone, but also Enron's Ken Lay's involvement.To me, I found the most humiliating moment of this documentary to be when President Bush addressed attendees of one his high priced political dinners, referring to him and those present as the ""Haves"" and ""Have Mores"".  How smug of a statement to make at an elite mixer while it is the ""Have Nots"" who are dying in his war.  This was the one piece of text, that, IMHO, makes this DVD worth a rent and a watch.  Unbelievable in its arrogance.The other alarming item I find with the new Republicrats is that, during the Clinton administration, millions of people died in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, which was/would have been, a virtuous cause to aid a foreign country; but in the next administration outright war is declared on a country that was unproven to have executed the terrorism, the families of the terrorists were freed, and war was declared against a country that needed much less of our aid than Rwanda, all because they happen to have oil underneath their land.  Would that Rwanda have had oil, or some commodity to interest the 1%-Extreme-Wealth of our planet Earth, perhaps not so many would have died.Again, just my two cents.  I believe this film is worth watching as a documentary on war politics (not just Bush or Republican but Past, Present, Future Republicrats) to inform yourself of the behind the scenes schemes of the wealthy and some heart-breaking reality's of the ""Have Nots"" who never made it to Bubba's little dinner party.

Of course, no one could ever fight that dirty or lie that much, so its still unbalanced. It also makes me laugh out loud how so many of the one star reviews from republicans are from texas. HA, classic. Anyway, if you are liberal you will probably like this film, if you are conservative, you probably wont. Personally, Im a green, and while republicans are an abomination to our environment, I dont particularly love democrats either. So basically Im prone to enjoy this movie. Ok the politics part is out of the way.I used to be a film student, and Im still an ardent film buff, and love or hate his politics, Moore is an EXCELLENT filmmaker. You can hate the point he is making, but the way in which he makes is amazing. I have seen some great documentaries. Haxan, nanook of the north, american movie, etc etc; and moore is a great filmmaker, period. so if you are liberal, see this movie, if you are conservative, dont. If you dont care either way, and you want to see a powerful well made documentary, i reccommend this one, and definitely see American Movie...few movies are so heartfelt as that one."	4.0	This is pretty much propaganda	2004-10-16	23	17	6

You have a few deeply rooted mentalities doing battle in this country. It has never been this polarized. Those that manage the information flow are working overtime to silence or discredit the other side. Despite any negative things that can be said about this movie, here are the things that are true:* A lot of the information in the movie is very valuable because the press wouldn't touch it out of fear of reprisal.* NONE of the information in the movie HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. Period. There are plenty of radical attack sites with a bunch of strawman arguments, but NONE of them have actually disproven a single fact in the movie.* Even a staunch Conservative (such as myself) will be very moved by this movie unless they are so blinded by rhetoric that they don't want to challenge their worldview.* You can't argue with the footage. It's there. You see it.* The movie is a rollercoaster of sometimes funny, sometimes very sad, and sometimes over the top scenes. At times it will make you angry if you have a heart beating in your chest.* Much like the recent Presidential debate, there are scenes that simply make you shake your head, close your eyes, and just feel really sorry for our President. It got so bad at one point I almost had to stop watching. It's the kind of eye-opener that is necessary, but it doesn't make it any easier.* The soldiers are the real stars of the movie. They steal it. As much as I dislike Moore, I have to thank him for showing our soldiers the way they really are. It made me proud.* It's doubtful the movie is going to change your mind on much. If anything, it's an entertaining look behind the curtain covering the corridors of power. We ALL know that the Gov't does things they can't tell us about, and can't always be straight with us on the reasons behind reasons. You don't have to fear that you'll turn into a bleeding heart tree kisser with berkenstocks or whatever just by seeing this movie, unless you are truly worried you are that easily manipulated.However......There is definitely Mr. Moore's spin on things. I almost wish at points you could turn off his commontary and just watch the raw footage to draw your own conclusions. It's very easy to decide which parts of his dialog to pay less attention to. And to be fair, at certain parts there is only ONE conclusion to make, and he nails perfectly. This movie should be seen by anyone planning to vote this year. Oh, and it has a very impressive soundtrack as well. Although he doesn't give equal time to bashing the Democrats, he does do it often in the film and doesn't hold back. If anything, this movie made me respect Mr. Moore enough that I'm starting to add his work to my library so I can gain the benefit of an alternate perspective. I'm STILL voting the way I had planned, but I'm paying much closer attention now. This movie accomplished what it set out to do, and more. That's why I give it a perfect score. At one point in the movie, our President tells Mr. Moore to his face ""Hey Mike, GET A REAL JOB!"". It made me see a different side of our President that I hadn't seen before, and made me laught out loud. You see a human side of our President. Definitely a good show."	5.0	Not for the biased at heart.	2004-10-06	26	20	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3U4Q7TP4P1OSP	Scotty A	"Please, oh please, if you plan to vote on November 2nd primarily on the basis of Michael Moore's arguments, please do some research.  Spinsanity.com and FactCheck.org (both non-partisan) are great places to start (Spinsanity has a couple massive debunkings of Michael Moore, as well as excellent critiques of right-wing sources).  There are plenty of valid criticisms of the Bush administration, but Michael Moore's films and books are not the place to get them.Just so everyone is clear on who we're discussing:  based on everything I have seen, Michael Moore deeply dislikes the United States, and apparently is a believer that socialism works.  Example:  on his web page a week ago, he made a comment about how he'll be happy when the `means of production are in the hands of the workers', which equates to socialism.  Maybe you think socialism is a good idea.  I have no problem with that--economic justice is a complex, debatable issue; I just want people to understand Moore's background.All of today's popular pundits (Limbaugh, Hannity, Franken, Garofalo, etc), have a strong ideology, and when it's as extreme as Michael Moore's, it is vital to understand their ideology while listening to their argument.  THEY WILL NOT REPORT WHEN THE FACTS DON'T GO THEIR WAY.  Thus, you will almost never see Michael Moore or Sean Hannity admit when one of their claims is proven false, and they will never competently present both sides of an argument.  Ever.  They sometimes present a straw-man argument for the opposition:  a poorly constructed position built only so they can convincingly tear it to pieces.  This is not the same thing as a reasoned debate.Worse yet, when pundits try to make a strong point at all costs, as opposed to properly reporting events, they will knowingly and directly twist facts.  This is what John McCain meant when he referred to Moore as `disingenuous' during the republican convention.  One clear example from Fahrenheit:  the Bin Laden family was NOT allowed to leave the country while commercial traffic was grounded.  Moore slips in a key phrase in this sequence:  ""At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13th. In all, 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country.""  The key phrase is `AFTER SEPTEMBER 13TH.'  Commercial traffic resumed by then.  Thus, his statements are technically accurate, but it is ABSOLUTELY CLEAR that he is trying to sneak that phrase by you in his rapid-fire film and leave you with the feeling that the Bin Ladens left the country before the rest of us could fly anywhere.  See Spinsanity.com or Factcheck.org for lots more information.  Is this a minor point?  Maybe, but put a lot of `minor points' together, and you've got a seemingly powerful argument built on horribly mangled facts.Bottom line:  Spin is everywhere.  Information is power.  Be critical of EVERYTHING you read and hear, get the facts, make your own decision.  That's the freedom Michael Moore talks about."	2.0	Do your research--then go vote	2004-10-29	7	2	5

What is so disturbing about it is the fact that it uses real footage. Yes, our president did sit there, a little cross eyed, for 7 minutes. Yes, soldiers representing the American people took pictures with bound Iraqi prisoners in an inhumane manner. Yes, that is an Iraqi child's arm sliced to ribbons. Yes, our sons and daughters are dying while the Bush twins wear fancy dresses.Step back from Michael Moore and just look at the movie. He really only appears as a narrator and an interviewer, cutting his stunts from ""Bowling for Columbine"" down to one chuckle-inducing trip in an ice cream truck.One thing Moore's detractors keep bringing up is the fact that he's wealthy. Frankly, this is a hilarious claim to make considering the fact that George W. Bush and his entire family is not exactly self-made. I think making money off of your art is much more noble than through your oil tycoon family. So what if he was born into a middleclass family? Most of Americans *are* middleclass. He made his money, he didn't inherit it. Isn't that the American dream? To rise through your own efforts?You can't claim something is totally fictional when it uses real footage. I'm sorry but, YES our president SAT there. If you really want an un-biased look at the film, just mute whenever Moore talks. Listen to the president. Listen to the mother. Listen to the soldiers. That's America talking.Frankly, I find it very odd that everyone who supports Bush has the time to write reviews here. I mean, you support the war. Shouldn't you be signing up? Or is that just for innercity kids looking for college money?Then there's the Christian approach. Hooray for you. The dirty homosexuals won't get married.

Its an epiphany many of us are waking up to now, thanks to a fat white guy who currently happens to be more dispised by the religious right then Marylyn Manson or Anton Levay.To hear it from the naysayers, Michael Moore stands in front of a camera for 2 hours launching vicious slander against righteous George. The truth of the matter is we almost never see Moore, Bush himself is the ""star"" of Fanrenheit 9/11 and whatever opinion the audience ends up drawing, it is based on Bush's own words and actions. The religious right has us so transfixed we find ourselves saying things like ""even if the movie is only 90% true..."" Well i went through the exhaustive reference material available on [...] and every assertion, every statement has been published somewhere before in the mainstream media based on traceable data. Unfortunately with just 5 guys controlling this information an article about the White house flying the Bin Laden family back to Saudi Arabia where 15 of the hijackers originated came from quickly dissapears from print and funnily enough is NOT the lead story on FOX news, I wonder why.Moore plays his cards just right, I have watched this film with several groups of republican voters and fundamentalist Christians who would typically vote for George the anti-choice pro descrimination conservative. When Lila Liscombe reads the final letter from her son before he died serving in Iraq she breaks down in the point of his letter ""Thank you for the Bible"". It suddenly begins to dawn on these conservatives that Bush and his republican cohorts have behaved in a decidedly Un-Christian way in sending thousands of innocent men and women to unnecessary deaths, while Osama Bin Forgotton. I have watched every single Christian conservative melt like an ice cube thorugh this section of the film, indeed anyone without a heart of stone could not help but be touched by the Liscombe family. My female friends weep and the men sit in stunned silence ""Im flaberghasted"" is all one could manage at the conclusion.This is as heavy handed as the film will get, the documentary itself is incredible not just from the content but in that we almost have a new doco genre here ""tragi-comedy"". What we witness in Farenheit 9/11 makes you angry enough to jump out of your seat and enrole to vote (even when you live on the other side of the world like me), it makes you want to weep at the injustice, all while you cannot help but laugh a hysterical laugh at the complete absurdity and stupidity we ourselves remain responsible for. I can not imagine a more important film being released this decade.Ps If you think Michael is in it for the money he is losing millions in DVD sales to rush the release and attempt to have the film shown free on TV.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	"Moore turns up the volume in this relentless assault on President Bush, but when we get past his overt bias, and the fact that a film of this cadre has been allowed to play in the first place during a reign that he denounces with such vitriol, we recognize that F-9/11 does have a lot to offer.His antics (such as reading the Patriot Act over a loudspeaker from an ice cream truck outside the White House) are as funny as ever, and some of his questions (why exactly WAS a Taliban official in Dallas in 2001 anyway) really do merit consideration.Even the most staunch critics of this film's message and ideology will have to admit that Moore did his homework this time around. Unlike BFC, even if the chronology of the footage in this context was altered, it would still be equally incriminating. The film is a blistering indictment chock full of factual information (service records, taped interviews, real video footage) that cannot be categorically labeled as false.My gripes have more to do with some narrative decisions:(1) We spend a lot of time showing Bush and Company combing their hair and primping for TV. Doesn't everyone undergo similar preparation before going on air? The sequence is of no real value to the film and inflates the running time by several wasted minutes, especially when a single frame of preening is repeated over and over again.(2) Seems a little unfair to rope in a teen popstar to support the idea. She's a kid and for what it is worth, I believe she handled an unexpected question that was clearly out of her league rather graciously.(3) The episode asking senators to sign their kids up for war was a bit messy. If you were a senator and had a documentary film producer walk up to you with an application form and a TV crew, would you say, ""Gee since this may be in public view, and since you are such an important and appropriately authorized person for this job, here, let me sign up my daughter to be shipped to Iraq""? Can't see what the idea behind this was, especially because the senator says that he HIMSELF was in the navy.(4) The scenes at the end with a bereaved woman are a bit drawn out (even if moving at first) and seemed to blame the Republicans for sending her son to war. This to me comes across as self-contradictory as the woman herself had said earlier that army was a good workaround lifestyle for people in her impoverished town. When one signs up for war, isn't he expected to know what it entails? Sounds a bit convenient to want the best of both worlds.Anyway, these are minor gripes in comparison to the bigger picture that the film addresses.You may agree or disagree with its assertions, question/deride the validity of its arguments, or use it as a point of reference, but at the very least Fahrenheit 9/11 hits all the right nerves. Some of the footage from US blanket bombing (oops, precision bombing) of Iraq is gutwrenching.A movie I highly recommend regardless of your political or ideological stance, if only for the perspective of the innocent being maimed in a land that posed or poses no threat to the US, even if they have WMDs hidden somewhere deep in the bowels of their natural oil fields."	4.0	HERE'S A REVIEW OF THE FILM, FOR A CHANGE	2004-09-18	22	17	5
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1U441Q60DRZKR	Shaun W. Taylor	Yes, Moore has certainly exercised his First Amendmant rights in making this movie. It is interesting to note, though, that he has a stable of lawyers at the ready to set upon anyone who speaks out against this  entertaining film. Ironic?This was an enjoyable piece of fiction, but calling it a documentary is a stretch. Some sources are misquoted, some facts are misstated, some are patched together in a misleading fashion, and I'm sure that some would argue that some are falsified. But falsified is too strong a word -- the fact is that Moore has taken some creative liberties to support his viewpoints, as he has mentioned in the press and on his web site.That doesn't take away from its entertainment value. Watch it, enjoy it, but do your own research instead of accepting what's being thrown at you without question. And don't be incensed when you learn that the film is misleading -- it is just a movie after all. Moore takes the pseudo-documentary craft to a new level.

The quality of the film and the choppy editing made me feel like I was watching a film version of a Schizophrenic's scrapbook.Moore's winning the Cannes film festival Palmes D'or doesn't prove that he is a great filmmaker but rather exposes the political leanings of the judges.

Like another reviewer mentioned, it seems to only be the patriotic (and maybe rather naive) Americans who object to this film.They cant see that their leader is a terrorist himself. I think Michael Moore did a fabulous job with the film, and presented all the FACTS. He didn't make any of it up, he should it for how it is. Of course it was made to represent Michael's point of view, but that can't take away from that fact that nothing in this film is a lie.This is indeed a shocking film, and includes very graphic scenes of war. I think he did need to show this though, as so many people turn a blind eye to the poor victims of war.(...)Good job Michael, just a shame more Americans didn't watch and believe in your great educational film.	5.0	Shocking -  A Must see!	2005-01-28	22	11	11

If Moore were any more desperate for the attention he is so clearly seeking, he'd strap a webcam on the bill of his cap and webcast himself ranting 24-7.  Just because someone says it doesn't mean it's so, and this movie is no exception.  If Moore told you that the gravel in his front yard was actually moon rocks, would you believe him?

I find it very brave for a filmmaker to go and do such a good job in a documentary that might cost them their own life in a country that claims having freedom above all. I also find it great how Moore manages and expresses his own point of view, while others criticize him for having one. I guess many people cannot handle the truth especially now days. Many of those who criticize this filmmaker's point of view should consider thinking about this movie with an open mind. Just focus on the subject and forget how much you agree or disagree with Moore. How about this film as a documentary? Is it good? Is it bad? So how bad is it? Actually I might disagree about some of the points raised by this movie but that's deep inside my head and it was meant to be raised. You're free to think. It's actually much better if we do think. And to tell you the truth, my life was shocked few hours ago and this shock still affecting me.Ignoring the technical details in my review for now and focusing on the emotional side I got. This documentary kept me interested minute by minute and second by second. I loved the way music was used. I also noticed something else about me there in the dark room (cinema theatre that is), and what I noticed was being touched as a human much more than focusing on the technical stuff as an amateur movie critic. I guess the beauty about Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) is that it was meant to make us think, feel, raise questions, and mostly know (or get closer to) the truth in a positive way that might change your life.Sometimes it is political and sometimes comic. It's even sentimental few times, but thought provoking after all and trying to stay as close to the absolute real truth as possible. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's daring, brave, great masterpiece that is JFK (1991) in many ways. I note here that both of them had great masterwork of editing using materials which we all surely saw on TV here or there and it involves conspiracy too.In short: Important piece of work that needs to be seen by everybody	5.0	Important film that shocked me to the bone and needs to be s	2004-07-19	27	23	4

Yes, in other words, I have not seen it yet, and I can certainly not comment on its content. In fact, Mr. Moore has a clean slate with me since I haven't seen any other movies of his either. What propels me to write a comment anyway is the content (or lack thereof) of many of the negative reviews presented here. Why do so many reviewers have to resort to name calling and insults? Why are so few negative reviews containing any substance, i.e., factual contradiction of the opinions expressed in the movie? Mr. Moore must have made at least that much of an attempt to present what are facts in his mind, otherwise it would have been a pretty short movie!One cannot help but wonder - simply because of the lack of factual rebuttal - if there isn't more truth than fiction to the movie. However, whether one agrees or disagrees with the movie's theories, likes or dislikes Moore's opinions, name calling and insults are inappropriate! It is downright scary, given their vast number, that those people who resort to such inappropriateness are exactly those that declare they support Mr. Bush. Even if one knew nothing about Mr. Bush, wouldn't one have to wonder what kind of person or leader he might be if he appeals so strongly to people who demonstrate such poor judgement when it comes to inappropriate behavior and, by extrapolation, values and ethics?Even if this movie were to be based on nothing but lies and misrepresentation of facts, the simple fact that it accomplishes to reveal this particular character flaw, if you will, in a great number of its opponents DOES make it an excellent movie in my opinion!!

I think this film is good, but it doesn't go far enough for me, the government lie to people constantly, using mass mind control (religion, media, patriatism)to stupify the people into thinking murdering 100, 000 iraqi people, in furthering the american empire is a good idea. Being imbuded with patriatism from birth, (mind programming) makes a lot of people easily controlled by the government, all they have to do is say somebody is threatening our country (lie), and immediatley millions of people will think going to war is a good idea. Same with religion, how to get people to think war is a goos idea? say it's gods work, in the name of god. The bible says killing is wrong, yet millions of 'christian' americans supported murdering iraqi's, why? pure mind control. What micheal moore doesn't realise is that when John kerry gets into power, which he will, he's going to use his four years to advance an agenda to crearte a one world government also, democracy is a lie, we live in a one party fascist state unfortunatley, until we decide to do something about it.	5.0	new world order	2004-10-31	18	10	8

Bush, Bush's buddies in Saudi Arabia, and the massive corporations benefiting from the tragic war in Iraq.But it's not just the corporations, Saudis and Republicans that Moore criticizes.  It becomes obvious early on that he's sick of Democrats rolling over and doing nothing whenever their Conservative counterparts break yet another law.Fahrenheit 9/11 is patriotic, brave, controversial and essential viewing for anyone who loves their country and world.  Michael Moore exposes truths that have been hidden in alternative print media, underground books, and FSTV (Free Speech TV), for far too long.If you're an avid follower of ""alternative"" news, nothing much about Fahrenheit 9/11 will surprise you.  What will blow you away is the incredible job Michael Moore did piecing it all together for a two hour film.A couple of things are edited for time.  Moore almost entirely ignores George Bush's British lapdog, Tony Blair.  Blair has been nearly as bad as Bush in this corporate conspiracy for oil.  There is one fun poke at Blair, but Moore's obviously focusing more on the leader than the pathetic follower Tony has turned into.There is more than enough incriminating evidence in this film to impeach George W. Bush three times over.  The Neocons have it confused, in all their complaints regarding this film:  Michael Moore didn't make Bush appear to be impeachable; George W. Bush IS impeachable.Michael Moore didn't lie about WMDs.Michael Moore didn't order attacks on innocent civilians.Michael Moore didn't sign the ""Patriot"" Act.Michael Moore didn't commit war crimes.Michael Moore didn't cut taxes for the rich.Michael Moore didn't trade America's youth for cheap oil.Michael Moore didn't exploit people's fears.All Michael Moore did was capture what George W. Bush did.  For that, Mr. Moore should be commended -- not criticizedThis isn't the Michael Moore you remember from the groundbreaking Roger & Me or the Academy Award winning Bowling for Columbine.  There is humor in this picture, but it's sprinkled in with so much sadness and gloom, you can only force a laugh as a form of release.Fahrenheit 9/11 is no flash in the pan.  Moviegoers won't forget what they witnessed during the two hours they spent in the theater.  The revolution has begun.  Brought to us courtesy of one filmmaker with the nerve to ask, ""Why?""Moore's revelations will trickle down upon the masses.  And then the questions will begin.  Why are innocent Americans dying?  Why are innocent Iraqis dying?  Why is all this death and destruction making the richest corporations even richer?  It won't be long before nearly everyone in America will wake up and ask, ""Why?""

I am just going to say first that I am not a Republican or a Democrat. I'm an independent. So when I saw this movie I came from an un-bias point of view. Rating a film is hard, esspecially a film like this, where there are so many counter-acting views. That said, when you really examine this film, it is certainly not a good as Bowling for Columbine or Roger and Me. The problem here is that Michael Moore, like most people, choses only on side to look at. Despite what Pro-Gun people said about Bowling for Columbine, that was a very important and well done documentery about guns and their influnce on our culture. Not that the film didn't have its flaws, but really, what film doesn't. When it comes to this movie, though, Moore seems to have already chosen what the movie would support and what the movie would denouce. What I think he should have done, and this is just my opinion, is to have examine both sides of the issue over Iraq, homeland security, the 2000 election, etc. When it came to Iraq, he forgot that the only reason it was really a soverign nation was because Saddam Hussien chose to make ""his country"" a soverign nation. When it came to homeland sercurity, he only showed us only one place where there is a problem with homeland security, expecting us to think that all homeland security is just as bad. It is in poor condition, but that doesn't mean that you should only focus on the negitive. His issue with the disenfranchisment of more than serveral thousand African-Americans was a much stronger point, considering the substancial evidence. The problem with that is usually it's the groups who are incharge of trying to elect the President who do that sort of dirty work, the same ones who stuffed the Chicago ballot boxes for JFK. They would probably not involve a canidate when it comes to illegal tactics like that, because then the President could say that he had no knowlege of such activities. I could be wrong, but I think that what they did because that is an old polictical technique. All in all, this movie didn't really examine the entire picture, chosing only to focus on certain things. I think Michael Moore should remember, you don't really know other people untill you've walked a mile in their shoes.

I used to think Michael Moore was a big fat, disgustiung ogre who had a chip on his shoulder against President Bush.  Watching him up there on the stage at the Oscars giving his acceptance speech in 2003 enraged me at the time. But one year after the Iraq war, things started coming unraveled that would change my faith in the GOP and give this movie an honest look.More and more, I started hearing about bad intelligence.  One was the fact that Iraq had ""NO"" weapons of mass destruction, as alleged by the Bush Administration.  Intelligence made up by the CIA had us believing Hussein was manufacturing Uranium in the African country of Niger.  That intelligence was rebuked by PBS's Frontline story, ""The Dark Side"" and lead to the outing of CIA agent, Valerie Plame by Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, L. ""Scooter"" Libby.  Another was the fact that the Patriot Act was ""NEVER"" scrutinized when it was passed.  This was information I already knew prior to watching this film.  Democrats never stood up and questioned the blatant violation of the First Ammendment for fear of being, ""Unpatriotic"".  But what put me over the edge was the fact that Saddam Hussein was made a scapegoat to coverup the Bin-Laden/Bush linkage.I sincerely wonder if the Administration knew about 9/11 and did nothing to stop it.  There are so many questions that Michael Moore asked in this film that were never asked by the mainstream press (FOX, CNN,NBC, ABC, CBS). That leads me to believe that either Americans are dumb or just plain stupid for not questioning anything.  Judging from the results of the 2004 election, Americans have only themselves to blame for this debacle for not getting rid of the problem.  Me included!Whatever your feelings on Michael Moore, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Take the name ""Moore"" out of the mix and imagine it was made by someone else.

Given the preponderant ideological direction of much mainstream, especially US, media, that's no bad thing. But it is indeed hit and miss. I found it hard to work out much outrage about the cosiness of the Bushes with the Saudis being a matter of concern, not just in the general way cosiness of American leaders with plenty regimes around the place with shocking human rights records is, but specifically because many of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Without further argument, that seems beside the point, given that we know Al Qaeda would love nothing more than to overthrow the Saudi government. And we're far from above Moore's often irritating love of silly gimmicks. Reading the Patriot Act to Congress from a megaphone on a van outside didn't really get us very far. Nor did the silly asking congressmen to enlist their kids gimmick. (I think the US is still enough of a free country that it's left up to kids to enlist themselves and their parents can't do it for them.)So much for the prosecution. If that was the stuff to dislike there was plenty to like. Lila Lipscombe's account of her soldier son's death was extremely moving. Footage of a US soldier describing how they went into battle to the strains of Bloodhound Gang's `Fire Water Burn'  was intensely disturbing. Britney Spears was, oh dear, well, as the credits might say, herself. And Bush. Well, here there's really no answer to Moore's case. When Senator Kerry tells you Bush is costing you respect overseas, my dear American friends, do please believe him. Over in Europe we are scratching our heads trying to figure out how such a great country ever came to elect (well, ok, in a manner of speaking, elect) such an outrageous moral and intellectual pygmy as its leader.

Moore twists the reality of this little place I call earth, and warps it to play his version of life.  Newsflash:  Iraq was not a nice little suburb filled with kites as Moore claims.  Saddam gassed, poisoned, beat, and terrorized those who opposed him, and he also had many a person shot in the streets for defying him.Now, Tambo claims to be a Vietnam Vet.  Well, I am a veteran too, but I am a veteran of Iraq's war.  May I ask you something Tambo?  How would you feel about Michael Moore if he took video and photos of you while you were having your arm amputated, so that he could slap it into his ""mockumentary"" and make a cool 100 million off of your misery?  And may I ask you how you would feel if he did all of this without your permission, so that when you ask him to apologize for doing so, he refuses?  Michael Moore is a real American hero?

Thomas JeffersonNo better example currently on DVD can be found proving Jefferson's timeless truth.  It is not the opinions or interpretations by Moore that his vociferous (compensating with volume for what they lack in numbers) detractors have a problem with, it is his undoing of millions of dollars worth of corporate propaganda and censorship by his exposition of facts.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the original ""inconvenient truth"", inconveniencing right-wingers, a complicit media, and derelict journalists alike with a litany of non-repudiated inconvenient facts such as: the billions of dollars of Saudi investments in American real estate and business and Bush's cozy relationship with some of those investors, the Saudi billionaire bin Laden family and the supposed black-sheep member of their family, anti-Russian-CIA-operative Osama, who strangely offered his assistance against Saddam Hussein when the latter threatened Saudi oil by invading Kuwait, the many bizarre and now notorious events preceding and following 9/11, etc, etc.The corporate media monopoly takes a major hit by Moore's exposure of facts they deliberately excluded, as does the post 9/11 reality they had created for mass consumption.  How does Moore's famous video-clip of Bush staring like a deer trapped in a hunter's headlights after being informed of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center gel with the media's heroic portrayal of the Great Leader, arm draped around a battle-weary firefighter, shouting soundbites from the 9/11 rubble?  People investing millions of dollars manufacturing 9/11 ""truth"" are not pleased.THIS then, is the reason to see this film.  To see and hear facts, stats, and pictures that you have never, yet, seen or heard in the mainstream media, no matter how often they repeat the lie about their being liberal.  Whether you agree with Moore's often-implied opinions and interpretations of those facts is irrelevant.  (I, e.g., think too much was made over Bush's strange, possibly suspicious, stupefied stare.  However, in a country with a free press it would have received much media coverage.  Like most of the material in the movie, I had never seen it or heard about it before this movie!)Many people, of course, don't deserve to have a democracy and avoid the truth because, as Jack Nicholson famously memorialized to Tom Cruise (portraying military prosecutor Iglesias): ""You can't handle the truth!""And many are thankful that they have corporate media lackeys to protect them from the truth.

I'd be the first to admit that.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" even contains some of that kind of grandstanding, but not a lot. This movie finds Moore comparatively restrained. He lets his facts and documents speak for themselves, for the most part. Theatrics and confrontational stunts take a back seat here. (Although, the scene of Moore reading the actual text of the USA Patriot Act through the loudspeaker of an ice cream truck on the driveway of Capitol Hill after being told that many members of Congress had simply not read it by a member of the House is particularly choice, and an example of Moore's trademark style being a very effective satirical tool to illustrate his point.)But that's the thing about this movie. If even a half...a QUARTER...of the allegations made are true, we already have what John Dean called ""Worse Than Watergate"" in his book of that title. And Moore is more than willing to show his sources and back up his factual assertions, leading one to believe that the ratio is far higher than that.Look at the poor reviews on these boards. The vast majority of them are simple pot-shots. Pure ad hominem, with no real critique of the actual content of the film. The few that do address the contents, and cast them as distortion and flat-out lies, do absolutely nothing to back up their assertions.What's clear is that Michael Moore loves this country enough to be outraged, and put his money (and celluloid) where his mouth is when those in power betray it, as he sees it. Last I checked, this is simply participating in the public dialogue at a level he's earnbed with his previous efforts.  The current President is not the institution of the Presidency, George W. Bush is not ""America"" and to take issue with the former is not the same as taking issue with the latter.As a sidenote, some may take issue with the whopping 10-15 seconds of film which might, to some, give the impression of Iraq under Saddam as being somehow idyllic, but he never says that, or even implies it strongly. Rather, I saw that sequence as a somewhat ham-handed visual depiction of ""calm before the storm"", and only the tiniest part of a much larger (and more relevant) whole.Don't miss the forest for the trees in evaluating this movie and making up your OWN mind.

The majority of the movie contains archival news footage with Moore narrating but there are some interviews.  This is balanced with Moore's own brand of humor and satire.It's title comes from the 1953 novel entitled ""Fahrenheit 451"" that depicts a society where independent thinking is discouraged and books are burned.  (451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that's needed for paper to burn.)This movie was written and released just before George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 as president of the United States.The end credits of this documentary reveal who it is dedicated too:""This film is dedicated to...all the soldiers from the Flint [Michigan] area who have died in the Iraq war...the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our [that is, the American government's] actions.""As a very brief overview, this movie begins with the strange events that occurred during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush.  Then we hear and see the horrors of September 11, 2001 and the president's response to these horrors.  From here, the documentary tells and shows us key things with respect to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.  The movie ends with a ""Congressional Recruitment"" by Moore.Moore also has some candid interviews in the movie.  Most revealing is the interview with a serviceman that had recently returned from Iraq.  When asked if he'd return to Iraq if asked he said ""No"" even if this decision meant ""possible jail time.""  His reason:""I will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people [e]specially when they pose no threat to me and my country...I won't do it.""As I mentioned above, the majority of this documentary contains archival news footage, some of it graphic.  Despite Moore's occasional narration, this footage speaks for itself.  (I found it helpful to turn on the English subtitles when viewing this movie.)Of all this footage, one thing stood out for me: when Bush referred to himself as the ""war president.""Who will you see or hear in this documentary?  I'm not going to list all the names but here are some:Michael Moore, George W. Bush, George Bush, Britney Spears, Ben Affleck, Colin Powell, Bill Clinton, Robert De Niro, Al Gore, John Ashcroft, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Dan Rather, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice, Laura Bush.As a piece of filmmaking, I think Quentin Tarantino (who was the Cannes' president) said it best when this documentary won best picture at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival:""You [Michael Moore] won because we thought it was the best film that we saw.""(The above quotation was obtained from the first extra found on this DVD.)As the more than 1800 reviews below this one attest, you will either dislike (even hate) or like (even love) this movie.  But isn't this a sign of a good movie--to illicit strong emotion?Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.

I live in NYC and remember 9-11 vivdly. When I saw this film in the theatre I was unable to hold back the tears when the footage of the attack was shown. It reignited the outrage I felt when the Bush administration decided to attack Iraq while continually kissing the ring of the Saudis.A vote fo Bush is a vote for perpetual war. Al Queda is established in over 50 countries. Countries that ""tolerate and harbor terrorists"" are too plentiful to list. The war on terror cannot be won with military might; our best bet is to build stronger alliances who will willingly share intelligence with us and who share our interest in democracy. I believed this before John Kerry said it and i believe it more strongly than ever.OK, maybe that was a tangent. The point is simply this: I liked this picture; the argument was solid, the pacing was right on point and I feel the same anger that Mr Moore does. However, if you're looking for a ""fair and balanced"" (sorry) documentary, this probably won't satisfy you."	4.0	Opinionated, but also correct.	2004-10-19	61	36	25

In a country of Fox News and the rest of the right winged media that is used by the government for it's propaganda (tanks on their easy going way to Baghdad, Terror alert levels, not allowed to show pictures of dead or hijacked americans...)it is definately needed to see the other extreme. Moore never denied that this movie was an anti-Bush campaign movie.After watching Fox News for a few hours and this movie afterwards you can find your own truth somewhere in the middle.The only criticism I really have is the patriotism in this movie. I guess you have to see that the audience this movie was basically made for is american. And I experienced when i lived in the US that you don't have a chance in the world to get anybody on your side if you don't include how much you love your country and how patriotic you are. As soon as people might think you are not patriotic you are most definately gonna loose them. You are unamerican.... hey, what is &quot;american!&quot;?? Is it not to ensure that everyone has health insurance? Or to bomb countries for oil or to ignore the rest of the world and dictate it? well, than Michael Moore is definately unamerican. Thank God he is!What I also did not like was aying that the american border is not patroled enough, at least the part that Moore shows in this film, is just another way to frighten people. It also does not go with the main message that I read in this movie - that danger is not coming from outside the country, it's ruling this country.Well, just some random thoughts that are on my mind. If you live in America, go and watch this movie. if you live in Europe you probably already know everything said in there. It's worth watching anyways.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"What's with all the right-wing vitriol being expended on this film? For a bunch of people so apparently resolute on spreading the joy of ""freedom"" throughout the world, it's odd to see conservatives getting so enraged when an American exercises a bit of it at home. Sure, you might disagree with Moore's views. Sure, you might accuse him of presenting only one side of the story. But go make your own movie. Isn't that what a free press is all about? I'm sure you won't have trouble getting financial backing or a distribution deal. Fox News runs equally biased, equally risible ""news"" every day. I rarely agree with most of what Moore says, but I adore the fact that he says it and the way he goes about the task. His work is both a consequence and a cause of a truly functional democracy. Look at what it's achieved - people are finally talking about the issues; they're wondering if what Moore says is true; they're doing their own research and making up their own minds. If the conservatives are right, then truth will out and they'll be justified - so what have they got to worry about? If the conservatives are lying, then truth will out - and they'll get what they deserve. That's the way it's meant to work, even in Florida. So what's the problem? Moore isn't anti-American, he's simply anti the abuse of power. For my money, that makes him a true patriot. Like Gore Vidal, Moore sees the difference between the American Republic, and the American Global Empire which is its most dangerous enemy - and until conservative Americans learn to separate the flag, the Presidency and moral righteousness, and see that unthinking worship of any one of them can be used as a smokescreen for the debasement of the others, then the fear of seeming ""unpatriotic"" will be used to frighten and manipulate Americans to whatever ends those in power choose. I'm simultaneously delighted and disgusted by the existence of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"": delighted that America is still a nation where a citizen can mount this kind of attack on the government and live to tell the tale, and disgusted that the Presidency has been dragged to such depths by the Bush-Cheney junta that a wildly accusatory film like this is needed as a corrective. And as far as the claim that this is ""propaganda"" is concerned - sure it is, but give me a break ... conservatives still stroking their decks of ""Iraq's Most Wanted"" playing cards have lost all right to that claim."	5.0	What's all the fuss about?	2004-11-13	32	19	13

In the last four elections, however, my votes went to:  Nader (twice), Kerry and then Obama.  It's hard for me to imagine that history will not come to judge George W. Bush as our worst president ever.Be that as it may, I doubt that there have been many worse documentary film makers than Michael Moore.  To cite just one example from ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" there is a short clip  where Bush appears to be standing in the midst of a bunch of  fat cats, talking about his ""base"" (i.e., the ""haves and have-mores""); this clip was plucked, misleadingly, from a massive fundraising event/dinner put on by the Catholic Church in which both presidential candidates (Bush and Gore) were in attendance, and at which both poked a little fun at themselves for the purpose of giving these donors to Catholic charities a few very good laughs.  Moore's film cut made it look like Bush was SERIOUSLY pandering to this group.  He did this throughout the ""Fahrenheit"" mockumentary, and I would recommend that you watch the rebuttal-film, ""FahrenHYPE 9/11,"" to see just how extensively Moore's ""end justifies the means"" philosophy makes an absolute travesty of documentary filmmaking.""FahrenHYPE"" was hastily put together in only four months after Moore's picture came out, and it has its own over-the-top right wing political ax to grind, but it's quite straightforward with its message, and it doesn't use gimmickry and duplicity to push its pro (2004 pre-election) Iraq war agenda.  If, however, you can get beyond having to watch some clips of the shrill Ann Coulter, and a few others, the film's real value--amounting to well over half its 80 minute length--consists in pointing out the many spliced, diced, and edited fabrications and distortions (lies, really) that Moore used to go after a president who so sorely lacked the intellectual heft, the ecumenical breadth, and the moral gravitas for the job."	1.0	Creep!	2009-11-23	15	5	10

I think that using our freedom of speech in such a way is only fair, since Bush, Inc. has used every unfair method at their disposal to pull off the garbage which they're still trying to get away with.

This sort of movie is going to have lulls.  It is a documentary.I find the same thing on the net, basically it's ""Don't see it, it's all wrong, it's all lies.""

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3TEH90X39WC8F	"Stuart W. Mirsky ""swm"""	I watched this at the invitation of someone who insisted I do so, saying it would convince me Bush was a disaster for the country. What I saw, instead, were Moore's usual diatribes, cleverly constructed to misrepresent the truth. We all know Bush was inexperienced in facing the camera during his early years in office and highly self-conscious about it to boot, all of which tended to make him smirk foolishly at inopportune moments, stumble haltingly over his words and look beseechingly around, as though seeking approval. Often he would pause in mid-sentence, as though painfully aware that his enemies were all around him, waiting for him to blunder. The resultant linguistic hesitancy he evidenced inevitably made Bush blunders a nearly self-fulfilling prophecy.He came into office without a lot of seasoning and it showed, though he seems to have gained more poise as a result of his nearly four years in office under the relentless fire of a demonstrably partisan media and his equally partisan Democratic opponents. The result of his early lack of seasoning, of course, was that he provided the camera with plenty of footage that made him look and sound kind of dopey. Moore used whatever he could find of this footage, along with some of his own rather ingenious interviews and commentary, to construct a picture of Bush the fool, using innuendo and out-of-context shots to suggest corruption on Bush's part.So Moore makes the case that Bush is laughably stupid and, at the same time, cynically conspiratorial. Of course, if he is that stupid how much danger can he present to us as a cynical conspirator? He's either Bozo the Clown or Machiavelli, but he can't be both. (Moore gets around this conundrum by suggesting Bush is really the puppet of other, even more nefarious interests, including the infamous Carlyle Group, an investment company in which his father and James Baker, his father's crony, have interests, and, of course, those sneaky Saudis.)Adding a number of outright falsehoods for good measure (such as the claim that members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. unquestioned, when other planes were being grounded, immediately after 9/11 . . . definitively shown to be false), Moore shot a film that is highly entertaining but also demeaning to this nation and president. It's regrettable that he has such vitriol for his country or that he is unable to scope out a position of opposition based on fact and reasoned argument. But it's more regrettable that so many today have clambered on board his outrageous propaganda train and see nothing wrong with his distortions and misrepresentations and have even elevated him to a kind of cult icon. Lots of money in it for Moore, I guess, so he has, at the least, found himself another lucrative niche. But I'm sure the money isn't what interests him, right? He's in it for the betterment of society, isn't he, even if that means pushing the level of political discourse down into the gutter.Well, thankfully, this is all just about over and we'll soon know who the country wants as president for the next four years. Unfortunately the odds are that Michael Moore is unlikely to give up this particularly profitable niche. So brace yourselves for more of the same from the man who told our friends in France that Americans are really stupid.	1.0	Utterly Brainless Tripe But Cleverly Compiled	2004-10-28	67	20	47

The pathetic attempts to downplay this cinematic phenomenon are as transparent as the attempts to slander its director and as disingenuous as the administration that it exposes.  Of course, the film's political and social impact would not be possible if not for its artistic excellence.As for the charge of propaganda, I think John Berger addressed this quite eloquently in his recent article in the Guardian:""To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite.This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former.""Like Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 911 is alternately humorous and gut-wrenching.  We laugh at our inept and clownish president and then shudder at the consequences of his policies.  Moore hits hard with images of dead and critically wounded Iraqis.  One scene, in which a furious and indignant Iraqi man places a mutilated baby in the back of a corpse-filled pick-up and vows revenge, is particulary affecting.Moore also interviews a mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq.  She is disillusioned - lost.  ""Why?"" she asks.  It is the right question and one answered quite thoroughly by this movie.  Are you not curious?"	5.0	Propaganda?  Yeah, right.	2004-09-01	33	26	7

The movie portrays Iraq as this desert oasis that the United States destroyed--filmmaker and poseur Catholic Mickey Moore didn't bother to interview any of the women that Uday Hussein had raped, or relatives of people who were tortured to death in Saddam's meat shredders. This movie was more of a hatchet job than an objective presentation of facts, except this time, propagandist Moore isn't trying to befuddle a gracious Charles Heston (""Bowling for Columbine""), and then later re-editing his footage to make Heston appear in the worst possible light. He pulls the same trick on anybody outside the Democratic Party tent, who by the way, voted to invade Iraq, although they'll now tell you that President George W. Bush was so beguiling that he fooled everyone. If the Democrats were fooled by Bush, whom they ridiculed as a poor public speaker, they should not be governing.

With that, if Moore has the facts to back this up, then the discussion is correct. However, to start pulling in Kerry and other presidential comparisons is a little far-fetched.People focus: we (as the general public) have HAD the right to speak up, to be activist, etc. I wish americans would stop blaming their president for the countries short-comings. Remember, HE is human. That's why we have that nice, complex government structure. Checks and balances. Now if you disagree with the GOVERNMENT, then state that as such. Leave the actual man out of it. News flash: of course Bush (like all the presidents and founders before) are looking for the fast buck. Nothing new. You do it as well. So stop being a hypocrite. And don't tell me that he is our leader and should know better. Because I have a lovely response for that as well: you should know better as well.

I am saying that we need to improve the system. If a president is ""caught"" with misbehavior, then we need to have a plan B. But having the only option to impeach is just not feasible. Takes too long and effects too much of the economy during the annoying trial. My suggestion: prove the infraction, assign a cost, take the money back and put it back into the country debt.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP	Takis Tz.	So let's see here: for all the predicament of the Iraq war, for all the dodgy and ultra suspicious happenings, hampered investigations for 911, for all the innocent lives lost both from the american perspective and the world in general, for the quaqmire of the american economy, well, basically for everything we can blame it all on one person. Da current president.Michael Moore either doesnt understand or pretends not to, that the system under which the U.S functions does so despite of particular persons. Nothing much would change had Kerry for example been elected and to propagandise the opposite is actually naive and suspicious in itself. Capitalism, communism, whichever such system based on classes functions the way it does regardless of who's in power.The fact that this is ignored by Moore who launches a rather cheap offensive on Bush as if he is the critical part of the puzzle is enough to dismiss his film alltogether as populistic propaganda to be consumed only by the politically uneducated.If one thing impressed me about this film is that Moore does touch (at the beginning) some thorny issues only to suddenly leave them be and proceed making jokes about Bush being on vacation too much. But Moore and anybody for that matter would also be on frequent vacation if his agenda was going according to plan and if he wasn't really needed to begin with. And lastly, there are more facts being ignored on this film than the ones actually revealed.Moore is without a shred of a doubt a great entertainer as well as a very good filmmaker. But a political mind he's not, at least not a deep-delving one which is exactly where his problem lies: he has convinced himself that he's both.	1.0	Does more harm than good...	2004-11-28	49	16	33

Bush, and goes out of his way to make him look bad in this film, but making him look bad doesn't seem to take much of an effort.The most amazing part of the movie was the film of the president sitting in a classroom, listening to kids read a story, when one of his aides told him the country was under attack.  He sat there for seven minutes, frozen, before getting up to do something about the attacks.We always hear about the ""liberal media"" in this country, but if the media is so liberal why didn't we ever see his failure to react to the news until this movie came out?  Obviously, there was no time to show this at the time, but why didn't the networks go back and show us this lack of reaction a month or two later?Anyway, if you haven't decided how you will vote you should watch this movie and it might help you decide.  A few of the points Moore makes in the film include:1.  There was no reason to go to war with Iraq.2.  Only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.3.  Most of the soldiers are from poor areas like Flint, Michiganwhere there are no other jobs.4.  The Homeland Security Act makes very little sense.5.  The greed of companies like Haliburton is disturbing.  Theyare the big winners in this war.Of course if you back Bush, you'll say the film is totally biased and a waste of time, so you probably won't want to bother with it.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	Shame on Disney for blocking Miramax from releasing Michael Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11,&quot; the explosive documentary that exposes the Bush White House as a lot of blundering fools that goofed up before, during, and after the World Trade Centre attacks.  By caving into pressure from the right, Disney not only failed to honor Moore's right to free speech, but it also let a blockbuster smash slide through its fingers.  Is Moore an opportunist for deliberately releasing this movie during an election year?  Probably.  Is it biased?  Only a fool would say &quot;no.&quot;  But regardless of what side of the political fence you're on, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; will arouse fierce debate, and its images will alarm, disturb and unnerve.  Not to mention that the movie is funny as hell.  The opening sequence outlines, with strong conviction, how the 2000 election was manipulated to portray Bush as the winner.  Other interesting clips are a ditzy Britney Spears blindly endorsing the president, evidence that links the Bush family to the bin Ladens, footage of Bush reading nursery rhymes to grade school kids for SEVEN MINUTES after he got word of the 9/11 attacks, as well as Moore vainly trying to persuade congressmen to get their children to enlist in the very Iraq war they endorsed.  But the heart of &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; rests in Lila Lipscomb.  Lila is a working class mother in Flint, MI, and is aggressively supportive of the war in Iraq until she learns that her son, a soldier, was killed in battle.  Witnessing her anguish onscreen (and in front of the White House where she vents her frustration and mourns the loss of her son) is truly heartbreaking.  Moore rocked several comfort zones during his infamous 2003 Oscar speech for his previous documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; will no doubt do more of the same.  Good for him.  Moore's truth may hurt, but Bush's lies kill.	4.0	Truth Hurts.	2004-07-06	45	30	15

I feared that it might be a proganda film, filled with inaccuracies.  My fears were quickly quelled.  There is no doubt that Moore only exposed that which he wanted us to see.  In the opening seqence he showed Gore winning a variety of states but failed to show a single state (besides Florida) being called for Bush.Everything he did show, however, was accurate to the best of my knowledge.  Moore did not engage in any of the silly accusations of the recently retired CIA agent that accused the administration of blackmailing the CIA into presenting false intelligence or any other wild accusatisions.  Intsead he focused on the Bush family's ties to the Saudis.Fahrenheit 911 is also informative.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	"After all the hype about Michael Moore's new movie, I am surprised about what *isn't* here.  This is a relatively tame indictment of Bush.  --If only Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter were so gentle with their targets.  Moore could have talked about the Wolfowitz Doctrine, about Prescott Bush's ties to the Nazi regime, about Guantanamo Bay and the mistreatment of prisoners by the U.S., about Rumsfeld's attempts to evade the Geneva Conventions.  And while Abu Grayb did not happen in time for the release of this documentary in theaters, it could have been a supplement on the DVD.What's more frustrating is how Moore often feels compelled to exaggerate for dramatic effect, when just telling the facts would be damning enough.  For example, he buries the fact that the planes of Saudi and bin Laden families were permitted to leave only on 9/13, when regular air travel resumed.  He shows what appears to be a newspaper headline saying Gore won the recount, when in fact this was a letter to the editor and not the official position of the paper.  He did a lot more of this sort of thing in his last film, Bowling for Columbine, than he does here; still, his reputation is so tarnished by it that many now choose not to believe him no matter what he says.  And this will give the Ann Coulters and Rush Limbaughs plenty of ammunition (as if they were bastions of factual purity!).And in this film he doesn't say as much that's shocking, if you keep up with current events from sources OTHER than the cable news whores.  Fahrenheit 9/11 tell us Bush is a twit.  Anyone who's ever seen his press conferences knows that.  It tells us the people around him lie their asses off.  Wow, ya think?  Some people may not have known about the cousin at Fox news who called Florida for him in the 2000 elections, or seen the video of the egg-peltings at the inauguration.  (Funny how little the ""independent"" American media reported that.)  The story of the Oregon border patrol was great; the story of Lila Lipscomb was not.  In fact, it felt a little like a cheap shot.  How would one EXPECT a monther who's been through what she's been through to react?

Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a ""1 + 1 = 3"" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is ""If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.""As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right?  Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.  Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President."	2.0	The magic of Moore	2006-08-10	8	5	3

For example, the 7 minutes of Bush sitting there reading a book about Goats after the second plane struck the WTC is not as compelling on film as I had expected.On the other hand, I agree with everything said in this film (except how unemployment is calculated) and I think a lot of it just needs to be said.  I don't think that Bush and Bin Laden conspired to wage war exactly and Moore doesn't say this, but the family ties between the Bushes and the Saudis is a story that has been ignored for the most part by the mainstream press.I really liked the ending and his conclusion that perhaps war is being waged as a way of suppressing the lower classes, how the lower class produces the people willing to fight to preserve the property and freedoms of the upper class.  I have been thinking much the same thing about the Bush changes to the federal tax code, which force working people to pay for the federal government while taxes on unearned income (dividends, capital gains, inheritances) are taxed less and less."	4.0	Not as entertaining as I expected, but still good	2004-07-08	14	6	8

Much of the film is about Flint, MI, which Moore claims is his home town -- a theme that runs through Moore's films, although Moore was born and grew up in an upper class, affluent community about 50 miles from Flint.Then Moore kind of bombed with an unfunny comedy, ""Canadian Bacon"" that wasted the talents of a fine cast (John Candy). Moore returned to the pseudo-documentary style with ""Bowling for Columbine"" finding comedy in tragedy and proving again that with clever editing and taking statements out of context, you can make anybody say just about anything you want them to say.In his most recent entry, Moore's comic touch is applied to presidential politics. It is hard to tell if he is motivated by a desire to be funny, or just raging hate. In either case, Moore creates the fiction that President Bush, not Middle-Eastern terrorists are to blame for the September 11, 2001 attack on America.

When a director takes on a project, his goal is to relay the emotions and themes he chooses to his audience in the most effective method possible.  Moore has succeeded in this film to a degree rarely achieved by most filmakers.There are two major camps of critisism with respect to this film.  The first claims that Moore's film is factually inacurrate.  Moore certainly uses the film to support a political agenda, but his pain staking fact-checking belies critisism on this front.  Those claiming a large number of factual mistakes are simply so wed to their own dogma as to make their ability to freely view any information that critisizes their beliefs impossible.  These are dangerous people, for they are willing to disregard truth and relpace it with blind faith.  This is all right (and actually essential) in a religeous context, but unforgiveable in a political context.The next group critize Moore for not making an unbiased film.  These people miss the point.  Moore wasn't trying to make an unbiased film.  He did a brilliant job of making a very biased film.  That was his intent.  Anyone hoping to be successful in making films themselves should watch this film intently to see how much it takes to be so successful in achieving one's vision.As a vehicle for Moore's vision, this is a brilliant film.  Proof is how well this film has connected with the general population of this country.  As much as people who disagree with the philosophy of this film want to Bushize the film (that is, keep repeating that it is a bad film over and over and over in the belief that if you say it enough times it becomes the truth), it is a magnificently directed film; and one with important lessons, even for the people that are offended by its partisanism.	5.0	Seeing Past the Political Rhetoric	2004-10-06	27	25	2

Only a moron like Michael Moore could argue that Iraqi's were happy under the rule of Saddam Hussein.Moore's hatred for George W.

HOW ON EARTH CAN I SAY SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE?Michael Moore's movie, while incontestable on the subject of Iraq and WMD's, the ridiculousness of the supreme court actions regarding the recount, and no senator signing any African-American protest to the vote, has no business borrowing from Ray Bradbury or 9/11 for titular material. Sure our military is in Iraq allegedly because of that day, but he should have titled it BUSH/10W-40 instead. Eyewitness accounts of the ""attacking"" planes having no windows and not even being American airlines at all have less credibility than Moore's manipulation of the 2000 election coverage? Not a single clip of the collapsing WTC tops in a free fall because the bottoms of the towers disintegrated underneath? Why wasn't the preposterous fact that the Bush administration and most media networks propagated such utter nonsense by  telling us that  the collapse of the hurricane force resistant  WTC was because the burning jet fuel (basically the kerosene in our heaters) melted steel and the tops came crashing through the rest of the towers? All of this in complete defiance of the of the laws of nature?Yes, this movie is patriotic in that it reeks with dissent which I believe is VERY American. But to absolutely positively ignore the science of planes hitting buildings and having those buildings selectively preserve or destroy terrorist DNA and two of the buildings undergo total pulverization because their tops on September 11, 2001 were all of a sudden too heavy to support were some things that really needed attention.

The film was supposed to start, I thought, at 9:30. At 9:10 there were already about 60 in line, though, I found out, it was scheduled to start at 9:50. By then, the line was all around the block, and this in a small, relatively convervative community!First, for those all hurt inside (sniff, sniff) that Moore criticized poor George, so what? He made no claims to the contrary. From the very beginning, he said that's what he planned on doing! It's an anti-Bush film, for crying out loud!And for those challenged by the film's role as a ""documentary,"" I say the same I did for those who challenged the ""truth"" to ""Bowling for Columbine."" ""Documentary"" is a misnomer. It's an op-ed piece--or ""polemic"" as an academically inclined colleague calls it. And I've been saying that for longer than Moore has!Sure it's propoganda, like a colleague screams. But, as an article I liked said, ""So is the front page.""True, it's an entertaining film. I didn't laugh as hard as I did as in a few scenes in ""Bowling."" But nor did I shed as many a tear---though I might have for those many who're being perverted by the excuse for a ""war"" in the Mideast. Toward the beginning, Moore mentions the time Dubya has spent on vacation. Bushies are insulted by that? If I were to attempt the same, I'd be on a street corner with a cup!The scene with John Ashcroft singing his song--right before the comment that he ran against a dead guy and the dead guy won shortly before Dubya appointed him attorney general--had me in stitches. And Moore renting an ice cream truck to read the Patriot Act to Congress--who apparently hadn't bothered to read it before they enacted it--was a gem. But the consequences of that act--surveillance of obviously innocent people for innocuous comments about Bush--now that's not so amusing.There's some ""conspiracy theory"" for which the film is criticized. Well, how seriously do you take any conspiracy theory? And, if the Bushes have nothing to defend themselves against, then let 'em say that.Most important, the film DID evoke some questions. Hmm...how much money are the Bushes making off the Saudis? I have been inclined to challenge hawks, particularly young ones. If you're so behind the war, then why aren't you at the recruiter now? So, why is there ONE congressperson with a son in Iraq?I'm most amazed, I guess, at where Moore got some of his film clips. One that comes to mind right off is when Dubya was speaking to a room full of people, all of them in tuxedoes. He proclaims that ""Some call you the elite. I call you my base."" And they all laugh. Sorry, but I don't find that funny. That's dangerous, a sample of Bush's economic mindset, and the source of his economic advice.And the observation that it's the poorer among us who're being recruited into the military (from which nearly all of the Bush administration escaped conveniently during the Vietnam era) has been true at least since Vietnam, maybe even moreso now.Nearly all the criticism I hear of the film is either extraneous, irrelevant, or from those who haven't seen it. Even a conservative colleague--who liked ""Bowling"" for the same reasons I did--admitted that too many of her peers criticize a film without seeing it.If you don't like Moore, or think he ""hates America"" or other choice platitudes, then don't go see the film. If you see it, let us have some substantive criticisms, then maybe we can all learn from each other."	4.0	Funny to see the ire Mike stimulated	2004-07-14	38	31	7

I am Canadian and I didn't have much respect for Michael Moore after hearing I had been living in a national paradise all my life - as he promoted in ""Bowling for Columbine.""  My dim view of his film making ability is entirely reversed by ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""Moore has made a film that really transends the documentary genre.  Everybody agrees that films like ""Thin Blue Line"", ""Radio Bikini"", and ""Fog of War"" are all incredible - I have seen them a number of times.  Fahrenheit 9/11 leaves them in a dustbin as far superior.This film provokes a lot of emotion, that is was distinguishes it from most documentaries that stir up only outrage, horror or intellectual sadness; although the movie brings in all those feelings in too.  The film doesn't have the professional polish of a production like the ""Fog of War"" but I think that is intentional - it is clear Moore's object is the superficial productions and the polished presentation of the government Moore dislikes so strongly.Granted, I am more sympathetic to Moore's political stance than perhaps a conservative American would be.  I do have the perspective of my American and typically Republican voting wife to add objectivity to my review.I really did laugh at some parts: John Ashcroft singing is really funny.  The movie provoked the fear of September 11th without images, leaving the experience as personal and as unique as each viewer.  I cried like a grandmother at the horrors of war and the parallels between the Iraqi woman and the Michigan mother.Few dramatic movies have done what ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has done.  I can more than sympathize with the political obstacle faced by a conservative viewer would have to appreciate this movie.

Moore is a tool, right wing and left wing is horizontal thought.  Think vertical, think of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and the truth of what the government, and its fourth branch, the media, is telling you.  We are deciding between to candidates for President that are both skull and bones members, and from very wealthy families.

Like most people in the world today, Americans want things to be simple, and in order for that to happen, they close their eyes and stick their head in the sands.  It's a little too easy to deceive people in this country, but the people in this country are a little too eager to be deceived, just as long as for the moment, they can feel a sense, though false, of security.George Bush represents the worst in this country, and if he gets elected again, that might be a good thing.  That way, Americans can't claim to be some city on a shining Hill, because the whole world will be able to see our true hideous face in the smirking vsage of George W.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2TP9UI31YNP91	Tom	Thank God for Michael Moore!  He's a true American hero and this film proves it.  I especially liked how he emphasized the Bush/Saudi connection.  There's several gruesome scenes that aren't for people with weak stomachs, but they help to tell the story like it really is.  As an American citizen, you would always like to believe that your Government is trustworthy and does the right thing, but this film shows just how untrustworthy the Government can be.  It makes you realize that if you, as an average citizen, don't take control of your government, the government will take control of  you.  It wasn't like the film suddenly turned me anti-Bush; I was against him ever since he stold the last election from Gore.  It just added many more reasons to support my views.  I think that anyone who watches this film and still plans to vote for Bush is in great need of a trip to the nuthouse.	5.0	A real eye-opener	2004-10-14	26	16	10

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3C08T5K46E4QU	"TommyBoy ""TommyBoy"""	Some background, I have a college degree in CIS, I used to be a republican I even (regretfully) voted for Bush in 2000.  I met Dole once and voted for him as well. But soon after the Patriot act was signed I started to wonder about our good friend Bush and Ashcroft.  I wondered why they would push the Act that destroys so much of our privacy, and our rights in the name of 'security'.  That was the beginning of my research.I started to realize things were not as they seemed.  As I watched Bush, I started to see his faults, his unbelievable ignorance and certainty which can be seen by any footage of him, but more specifically in the recent debates with Kerry (9/30/04).I began to see his lack of diplomacy and realized after talking with my Indian friends at work how much the world really hates us, because of our policies and our [lack of] diplomacy.The invasion of Iraq was mind-boggling to me, I wondered why  would we involve ourselves in such a thing?  My ignorance at the time didn't tell me about the the massive oil reserves in Iraq.Which is clearly the plan.Since 2001 I notice Bush constantly talking about terrorism and I realized that it sounds a lot like fear mongering after a while.  I admit I was duped too, I felt very afraid for a long time after 9/11.  Not saying we are safe from terrorism, because there could be more terrorist attacks.  Mainly because of our foreign policies and their affect (read Chomsky's Hegemony of Survival).Bush has pushed me so far to the left it's ridiculous.  Keep in mind I have a deep distrust of the democrats in power as well.  As Chomsky says, the two party system is deeply connected to huge corporations and their interests.As for the movie, yes, it is opinionated and political, but it is also rooted in fact.  I knew a lot about the movie before I saw it from reading/news etc.  So much of it was NOT a surprise to me.  The movie is excellent, and I have to seriously question anyone that says Moore is not a patriot of the highest degree.The day that the Moore's of the world are silenced is a very frightening day indeed.  Rush Limbaugh gets to speak every day, and so does Moore.  One should hear both sides, then watch the news (more than 1 source), then listen to foreign news, then make decisions.The movie is a must see.  I have learned to look at all points of view before making decisions.  Look at actions of the politicians not their words.The movie shows a human face to the war- what it's really like.  Not 1 life is worth a single barrel of oil.  And you can see that millions of lives are affected by this need for oil.  We won't talk about ridding ourselves of oil dependency.  Hmmm... I wonder why?The movie is enlightening (for those that don't do their research other than political ads on tv), but I strongly urge everyone to see this movie, read the patriot act, try to understand it.  Take a close look at Bush and understand how scary it is the way our government treats other people.  Look at Guantanomo bay prisoners and their treatment.  Are they innocent or not?  They are being held illegally, and without representation.  What if Ashcroft decides to do that to you or me?  If they don't follow the rules there, why would they follow them here.In the movie, there is a scene where the soldiers break down the door of a home, and come in to arrest some guy, and they hold everyone at gunpoint.  This is especially scary, because it shows a use of force that is blatant and random.  And it can very well be in your own doorstep some day.  I've seen it.Celebrate the Moore's of this country!

Did he intentionally lie about the weapons of mass destruction being in Iraq?  Is the whole 9/11 response in Afghanistan and Iraq really an elaborate scheme of the President to create favorable business for his wealthy business acquaintences?  Is Bush in the pocket of Saudi investors?  And the bottom line question:  is the current war in Iraq without purpose?Those inclined to distrust Bush will love this work, and grant a quick five stars for its collage of facts, emotions, and righteous indignation, combined with winning sarcasm.  The few remaining neo-conservative partisans will trash this as a psuedo-documentary that traffics in wild conspiracy theories, and which treats with childish disrespect a very serious war and terrorist threat.  Furthermore, they will decry as unfair this very deliberate hatchet job on Bush.My own bias is that Bush went into Iraq hoping to plant a beach head for democracy in the Middle East.  The war has proven far deadlier and muckier than expected, but hopefully a stable government can still be erected in that suffering land.As for this work, it is decent.  As a propaganda piece, the war mom's conversion was powerful, and impossible to ignore--probably the highlight of the show.  On the other hand, even with this winning segment, I constantly felt that Moore was using everyone he encountered.  Additionally, some of the scenes were sophomoric, such as the director riding around D.C. in a truck, reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone.  His effort to recruit congressional members to enlist their children in the military also came across more as peevishness than serious commentary.Bottom-line:  Anti-War activists should buy this movie and watch it weekly--perhaps on Sunday mornings, after singing Kum By Ya with friends.  Die-hard Bush fans should avoid this like the plague.  Those with ambivalence--probably the vast majority--will find this an uneven, but ultimately intriguing film.	3.0	Political hit piece that is intriguing, yet at times childish and obscure	2005-09-12	16	10	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1MI36X4UCL5VM	Tom Paine	"Michael Moore was considered so dangerous to the US status quo that he inspired a far-right cottage industry backed by a huge amount of resources (legally, and not conspiratorial) which emerged to prevent the film from being released - for which they almost succeeded.When this strategy did not work, they attempted to smear his film with innuendoes and lies - while they saturated the media with the meaningless accusation of ""bias"". Indeed, it is clear that many (who it seems have not even seen the film) have loaded this site with such ""flack"".Michael Moore is certainly biased. He has stated many times that he wishes to oust Bush. However...being ""biased"" does not mean he is wrong. He has a considerable and commendable fact finding team all on line at his web site. In fact, all the criticism against him is petty at best and simply wrong at worst.Members of the women's suffrage movements were ""biased"" when they struggled to attain political equality with men. Galileo was considered ""biased"" (to the point that his ""bias"" caused him to be put under house arrest) when he stated that the earth went around the sun. What all these people have in common is that they have bravely dared to defy what was then conventional wisdom.I too, am not totally convinced by Moore's film. In my opinion, he pulls his punches far too often to placate Middle America. For instance, he avoids using the persuasive, strident arguments of the intellectual left (such as those of Noam Chomsky). He focuses on a grieving mother far too long. However these are minor criticisms; I would recommend all to see this point of view - if only to see the side of this story that is not permitted within the corporate-state ""conventional wisdom""."	5.0	NO WMD AND NO DEMOCRACY -  MUCH OIL AND DEATH	2004-10-18	11	0	11

People will continue to distribute articles designed to keep people from seeing the film while at the same time, people who have actually seen it will continue to read them knowing full-well that they are bogus and are rooted in a fear that Moore may be on to something.  I found the film far more unbiased than I expected.  The film is closer to the Green party than the Democratic party.  The movie points the camera directly at the Democrats at times showing them as weak and spineless.  We watch Al Gore cower as he ratifies the 2000 election while 10 different members of the House beg for a Senator (which Gore is, as President of the Senate) to allow them to vioce an objection to the results.  Those who have not seen the film do not understand that the movie is mostly about the state of America today, the unfortunate state that we find ourselves in, and how we got here (and by proxy, who got us here).

There has been a lot of hue and cry about Moore's political ax to grind and this film wears it on its sleeve.  There is no doubt that Moore despises everything Bush stands for and that is the beauty of the film -- its unambiguous disgust at the current administration and their web of lies and deceit.Granted, Moore pushes the envelope in terms of making his points.  Some of his facts are indeed somewhat exaggerated and the juxtoposition of imagery is obviously manipulated to reinforce his points.  But that's OK with me.After watching hours of Bush's political spin and mischaracterization of Senator Kerry's record, statements and war record, I find it amazing that the Republicans find their own medicine distasteful when it's delivered from the other side.Buy this DVD and watch it.  Distill it down 50% and you will still end up disgusted by the lies of the Bush administration and the dangerous path they are taking this country down.

This is the most important documentary (and yes, it is a documentary) in my lifetime, in any of our lifetimes.Whether or not you're a dyed-in-the-wool Moore-phile (and believe me, I have reservations about the man), this film will make you think twice about our sitting president. No other filmmaker would've dared to take on the Bushes like this, and Moore should be commended, no, thanked by every American who loves this country and loves it honestly (not the kind of ""Mommy can never do wrong"" style of the neocons, possibly the most un-American group since the John Birch Society).I found the film just as powerful as I had heard (living in the South, Fahrenheit had a limited run around here at best, with some theaters not even showing it). The scenes of Iraq during the war (and the human toll it is taking) will break the heart of even the most diehard Bush-lover. I challenge anyone to question the mother who lost her son in terms of whether he died for the right cause. It's all well and good to say that this is a ""just war"". Just be sure you're honest enough when it strikes home.The issues I have with the film are the suggestions that we entered Afghanistan to erect a pipeline, and nothing more. That to me is too awful of a premise, too ""Dr. Strangelove""-ian for me to fathom, but I can't help but wonder. Also, the ties to the Bin Laden family are slight, in many ways, but again you can't help but wonder if Moore is really loony or not to suggest them. It's a damning document of the Bush Administration's efforts to have it both ways (stay on alert, but shop), and the inefficancy of the Administration to combat terror in ways that are effective (as opposed to harassing a man in a gym simply because he questioned the President's motives in Afghanistan, which is shockingly something I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think).Whether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure. I'd like to think no one could be so close-minded as to not even consider seeing it, but I've been wrong before. This is far and away the most important movie of this year, and it is a masterpiece.Some might argue, ""Moore made this film simply to unseat Bush,"" but after seeing it, I can't say I don't blame him.

However, he is obviously needed in a country where FOX dominates the media.His methods are a bit crude, but nowhere near as crude as the methods of the Bush administration. From where I`m sitting (Northern Europe), it is immensely frightening that the babbling monkey who got crushed by Kerry in all debates got a clear majority of the votes.Why, America? Anti-intellectualism? Fear of the big bad terrorists(the people here comparing Moore to Goebbels should consider how this statistically completely irrational fear is exploited methodically by Bush in every speech he makes)? Sheer stupidity?Why is it that the US spends enormous sums trying to salvage an arbitrary middle-eastern dictatorship (f.ex Saudi-Arabia, home of the hijackers, are just as bad) while millions are dying of war and starvation in Africa without as much as a squeak from Dubya?

And as I left the theater I felt Angry and also ashamed, ashamed that I had known nothing about any of this period!The day after seeing this movie I started watching CNN; I started carrying more about what my government was doing and how they did ""business.""I have three friends in the military; two are in the navy-one in the air force. When they had leave and were home to visit. I sat them each down and showed them this movie. Well to say the least they didn't care for it at all. (Personally, I'm just glad they watched the whole thing). They were after all the perfect candidates for the military. They got crap grades in high school, they never got jobs so they just blew there savings, and really like shooting things (seriously).Later on while we were watching T.V. A GO NAVY commercial came on and all three admitted that if they were sent to Iraq they wouldn't re-enlist and just take what ever jobs they could when they got home.Now on to Michaels film. Personally I don't see Bush as a criminal mastermind (Dick Cheney maybe) I see bush more as a puppet. Now on to the part of the film that I loved ""The War On Terror.""The fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction and the fact that were stealing there oil basically proves.....yes we are in this war for all the wrong and greedy reasons.

Regardless of political beliefs (I am somewhat conservative), I have to say this is one of the most entertaining movies of recent years. Michael Moore has seemingly done the impossible, and that is he got people to talk about and examine politics in the midst of an election year.Yes, the media is biased on both sides. It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to understand the motives of the New York Times and the Fox News Channel.But calling parts of the film outright lies, may be premature, especially considering that certain claims are backed up by the presentation of the documents themselves, i.e. the National Guard Report.I did want to see more on the alleged business relationships with the bin laden family. That seemed like a missed oppurtunity.More perplexing, however, was the idea that the Patriot act was so scarcely read. (I only know one senator who admitted to reading it, a republican, no less.)That's the genius of this film. It raised questions I wouldn't have thought about asking.The comedic elements were also effective, especially the Hee-Haw themed election coverage and John Ashcroft's absolutely atrocious singing.Whether you Love Moore or hate him, you will not be able to stop talking about this movie. I'm currently undecided as far as the election goes, but I will definitely be doing more homework leading up to it.See this movie, if not just to have more to offer in criticism than fat jokes and calling someone a liberal, which seems to have replaced &quot;Communist&quot; in political vernacular.The literal definition of liberal, by the way, is a person who favors change and progress.

I was spit on by Americans while I was in uniform and have never trusted my government since Vietnam.Moore presents truth and fiction in this movie, more truth then fiction though.  I cannot believe that the American public thinks it is unpatriotic to critize the Iraqi war and its conduct but this is the same people who see no wrong in how Bush and his administration have disobeyed their oaths of office, to whit:  I swear to protect the Constitution of the United States.  When you lock up Americans without due process you are violating their rights under the Constitution but Bush and his cronies dont give a damn as long as they get their money & power.  Then along comes Moore who attacks Bush and his conduct of the war.  I truly think that Moore was soft in his attack and had he really driven the point home could have awaken up some of the silent patriots who are scared to open their mouths against the government.  Speaking out is not unpatriotic, in fact it is patriotic to keep our government obeying the law.

I kept asking everyone I know if they noticed the jump from the bombing by Osama bin Laden to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and search for Saddam. Osama, Saddam, Osama, Saddam, not real easy to accidently mix up! In fact, its quite a jump! Is it really a jump or accident or did the bombing give the Bush administration an opportunity to attack an oil rich country whose military was already compromised?  I was amazed that so few didn't know that there was not a real connection but rather an elaborate lie.  Still the invasion and the search for ""weapons of mass destruction"" went forward against the better judgement of U.N. inspectors who did not find anything.  Most of the rest of the world was against U.S. forces being sent to fight an imaginary war. I have the highest regard for our military personnel and my heart breaks everyday when I read the names, ages, and home states of each of the soldiers that are killed. The loss of American and Iraqi life is saddest part of this war. Our sons and daughters are living the horror of war daily and some are losing their lives while Haliburton and Bush oil are reaping record profits.  Their lives and the lives of their families will never be the same. The families of innocent people in Iraq are in the same boat and we cannot deny, as responsible Americans, that we have dirty hands too.  No matter what your political affiliation, I dare you to see this movie with an open mind and see if maybe there is some material you should check out yourself.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ACVLLA37BN9KY	Valjean	"Nanny nanny boo-boo...First off, let's get something straight. While many critics here are hung up on the politics of the film, let's not forget that documentary making is an art-form and should be approached as such.  It is a artistic means to examine a thesis.  During the late-1980's Michael Moore developed a style of presentation of fact that relied on sharply contrasting public relations rhetoric with cold hard fact.  Watch the camerawork as he cuts from pretentious regalia to cold hard fact.  It's like being in a car going 90 mph and then slamming on the brakes.  A devistating effect!Moore has not done anything too original since Roger and Me in terms of presentation until now.  The master of the muckracking documentary-style is back with the afterburners on.""Bowling for Columbine"" (arguably) did NOT deserve an Oscar (although I'm happy for Moore) because the thesis in ""Coumbine"" is somewhat muddled.  The thesis in F-911, however, is as crystal clear as the thesis in Roger and Me.  Like Roger and Me, on the other hand, the film may not get an Oscar, but you can be damned sure that it will get massive airplay in thousands of college classrooms dedicated to the pursuit of truth in Global Conflict, Sociology, Criminology, Political Science and Documentary making. In F-911 Moore displays skills exhibited by Sociological researchers of the highest order a la C. Wright Mills, who was the first American to point out the intertwined relationships between the upper echelons of: a) military; b) industry; and c) government.In F-911, Moore simply reaffirms his status as a ""Karl Marx for the masses"", in that he examine the nature of power, but in such a colorful way that uneducated persons can actually ""grasp"" some of it.  As Marx predicted, when revelations of these true relationships of power are laid out for these masses, they are shocked into a rude awakening and behave much like a person who is awakened from a deep slumber.  In other words, they are pissed-off because Moore ""woke 'em up"" (to what? To the truth, of course).Well, here's another truth: Calling Moore a ""fat slob"" and saying that he should be ""silenced"" does not markedly increase the credibility of his critics.  In fact it reveals them for what they are: small-minded reactionaries.  Also, saying that Moore ""eats too many Dunkin' Donuts"" does not change the fact that the Bushster is squandering about $390 billion dollars a year on the ""War on Terrorism"" while education, hospitalization, space exploration, local law enforcement and social security programs for the elderly and poor are having the life choked out of them.It is also inaccurate to label Moore's work as ""propoganda"" as the term propoganda is defined as an organized scheme for the propogation of doctrine.  By definition, propoganda does NOT acknowledge any ""middle ground"".  In F-911 Moore does examine both sides of the thesis, thus calling F-911 ""propoganda"" is similar to calling Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" an ""anti-drug statement"".  By the way, for all the numbskulls out there who think that they ""could make Hitler look good"" if they twisted the facts enough, you should watch Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"".  The irony here is the remarkable similarities between the type of Nationalist propoganda that Hitler was pushing and the type of colorful Nationalist propoganda that the Bush administration used to fuel its ""war efforts"".If you hated F-911 and you hate Moore, then you must love paying $2 for a gallon of gas and $3.50 for a gallon of milk to feed your kids.  If Dubya steals the vote again in 2004 the US will continue to fight an Orwellian War against enemies that are hidden and globally disbursed.  As Moore implies, prices will continue to rise at the expense of the middle and lower classes.  Industry will have the power to do whatever it wants to America.  (Now, who is our enemy again? I forget.)  Hats off to the first president elected by the supreme court and not the people!"	5.0	he's not fat, he's just big-boned	2004-07-11	34	26	8

I'm aware that no one will ever know the whole truth but there are things that can't be ignored ie. "" did he really use 9/11 as an excuse to invade Iraq ""? (since he never had a problem with them when they were on good terms). Because all the Iraqi oil is going into his hands, IMHO greed and self-gain certainly do play a role.IMO a leader of any country is elected to:1. Protect and defend his Country2. Better the Country and the lives of his people3. Be a good role model to his peopleYes, I think being a leader is a hard job but I also think that if someone is going to run for this position then they should truly want to do it for those reasons. It always surprises me that a majority of people who end up as leaders have led such priviledged lives. How can they know what the general population needs? I wish that someday someone honest, noble and inspiring will lead my Country. I guess there is a reason why people say ""there are no honest politicians"".

I really expected this film to be an indictment, but the movie was just transparent spin, cut and pasted.Michael Moore should have tried to tie everything up more neatly. I also found the extended segment on the dead soldier's mother to be exploitative and beside the point. If decisions to go to war were determined by how much mothers loved their children, no one would ever go to war.And just why did he include a Saudi beheading? How does that contribute to Moore's argument that the government is scaring us with terror alerts?This movie is high on stimulus and low on cohesion.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ	Vato-Curandero	"I will never forget the first time I saw Michael Moore's anger-provoking film, Fahrenheit 9-11. It was June 2004, and I was sitting in a jam-packed theater in ultra-conservative Lancaster, PA. I went to see the movie with a buddy of mine, and the two of us were the only non-right wingers in the theater. We were also only two of a handful of people under the age of retirement in the theater as well. What my friend and I thought was well-placed sarcasm and humor, the right wing Republicans thought was anti-American, biased, Bush bashing. I remember laughing hysterically at certain points of the film...only to encounter the look of death from countless white, right-wing extremists who were dead-set on their blind patriotism. Upon leaving the theater, the real fun began as heated arguments escalated between spectators as they exited.Regardless of your personal politics, or your thoughts on Iraq, or your thoughts on Michael Moore, the record needs to be set straight on a few things. Does Moore promote a particular agenda in this film? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Does Moore distort certain facts and stack the cards to favor his particular point of view? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Wouldn't it be nice if those mindless sheep (Republicans) who scream bloody murder over Moore's ""factual inaccuracies"" in F-911 would get equally heated and steamed everytime Bush or Cheney or Rumsfeld spout lies to the American people about war or weapons of mass destruction?Those who oppose this movie have a particular agenda of their own...they want to stifle any and all opposition to the current militaristic, ""my country right or wrong"" philosophy that has an iron grip on this nation. To them, a free press and freedom of thought and speech is ""dangerous"" and ""unpatriotic"" and aids and abets ""terrorists.""  What a joke!Now...to the film itself. I have always liked the fact that Michael Moore dares to ask the tough questions to the people who most need to be asked them. However...Moore goes one step further and catches them on tape. Remember in Bowling for Columbine when Moore confronted Dick Clark and Charlton Heston over welfare-to-work policies and gun issues? Moore offers us another dose in F-911 when he camps out on the U.S. Capitol Building trying to encourage Congressmen to send their sons and daughters into the military to fight in Iraq. Their Congressmen's silence is deafening.Moore employs plenty of his smart-alecky, sarcastic humor in Fahrenheit 9-11 to underscore several points: Bush's secret financial relationship with the Saudis, America's historic partnerships with Iraq and Bin Laden, the Bush Administration's botched response to the 9-11 Commission, the ridiculous ""Coalition of the Willing"" nonsense, the Patriot Act's true intentions, and the invasion of Iraq as a decoy and diversion.As with all of Moore's films, Fahrenheit 9-11 mixes drama with satire, humor with gripping seriousness. The most poignant parts of the film deal with 9-11 survivors and their relatives and also the relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq. These scenes are almost too painful to watch.F-911 has some fairly violent and distrubing images, however. One scene shows footage of a public decapitation in Saudi Arabia, and there are several other scenes that depict images of innocent civilians injured and maimed or even killed in the current Iraq war.The only part of 9-11 that I thought should have been left out was the first 10 minutes of the film when Moore recounts the Bush presidency from Election Day 2000 up until September 10, 2001. It is clear that this was intended to smear and humiliate Bush, and served no overall meaningful purpose in critiquing Bush's policies post-911.Overall, if you are open-minded and want to explore the current situation in Iraq from a different angle than the everyday spin you get on Fox News, then this film is definitely worth checking out. The DVD is packed with plenty of nice extras, including footage on the release of F-911 and the notoriety it garnered. There is also a great extra on Arab American comedians and how they have incorporated the post-911 backlash against Arabs into their routines. Other extras include footage of Condoleeza Rice's cherade in front of the 9/11 Commission and Bush's press conference spin following his private meeting with the 9/11 Commission, along with a segment on Abu Ghraib and the handling of prisoners by Army personnel.Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, isn't it?"	4.0	The film the Bush Administration does NOT want you to see!	2005-12-12	19	13	6

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A38TC59GM2WW1X	"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts"""	"Michael Moore's magnum opus ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has become the de facto anthem of, in particular, anyone anti-Bush, and in general, liberals everywhere.  This is for good reason.  Just as the 9/11 attack was a wake-up call to the American people towards the threat of terrorism, Moore's scathing indictment of the Bush Administration is a wake-up call towards the threat of America's own current government.""Fahrenheit 9/11"" seems to be neatly broken down into two ""acts"".  In the first act, Moore weaves a scenario of political intrigue, conspiracies, and cloak-and-dagger what-ifs.  He makes some indisputably disturbing points; for example, why was the Patriot Act printed in the middle of the night, and voted on in the morning, effectively preventing any congresspeople from reading it?  However, I don't give Moore 5 stars, because I honestly found the first half of the film/documentary/political statement to be somewhat convoluted and difficult to follow.  Moore's soft, difficult-to-hear voice does not help.  The ""conspiracy theory"" involving the Bushes' connexion with the Bin Laden family and the Saudis seem a bit speculative and circumstantial, although they do make you think.That said, there is nothing short of genius in the second half of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", which begins after Bush launches the Iraq war.  There is nothing confusing or speculative about the inhuman atrocities suffered by the Iraqi people.  There is nothing confusing about the Iraqi father carrying the mutilated corpse of his young daughter.  There is nothing confusing about the American mother Mrs. Lipscomb's inconsolable grief over the loss of her irreplaceable son to the war.  Lipscomb's journey from being a steadfast conservative to her ultimate disillusionment and complete loss of faith in the current administration is both sobering and heartbreaking to watch.  And there is, last of all, nothing confusing that both sides are dying for the greed and evil of one unjust administration.  Really sit down and think, ""why are we fighting this war?""  None of the 9/11 terrorists had any connexions with Iraq.  There are no WMDs in Iraq.  But there is oil.  And now there ARE terrorists in Iraq; we have become the terrorists.Moore's command of the mood and tone of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is masterful.  He begins with the feature with his characteristic brand of hilarious, scathing social commentary.  However, the tone of the documentary gradually and imperceptably becomes increasing somber in tone.  The ending is overwhelmingly poignant and powerful, leaving nary a dry eye in the house.  Moore brilliantly ends with this statement (not verbatum, from my memory):  ""Our brave fighting men and women sacrifice themselves to defend our freedom, so that we don't have to.  And all they ask for return is that we never send them into harm's way unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Can they ever trust us again?""  On behalf of the American people, I apologise to our brave soldiers dying for an unjust and pointless war.  I apologise to the Iraqi civilians for our rape of their country.  One person I will not be apologising to is George W. Bush and his posse of oil investors.  May God, Allah, and Buddha save us all if this man wins the re-election."	4.0	Everyone in America needs to see this documentary	2004-10-02	29	23	6
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1A6VNCH6JT5KZ	Victoria	While I can tolerate that Michael Moore has to right to express his opinion, I find it incredibly unethical for him to call this film a documentary.  A documentary is typically made to be as objective as possible.  In particular, you would not find many honest filmmakers intentionally including misleading films clips in a documentary.  The only thing Moore documents is how fanatical he and others are with their hatred of Bush and his administration.  Their treatment of this medium says more about them than it does about the president.	1.0	Bias attempting to pass itself off as documentary	2004-12-07	50	22	28

How did everyone forget the attack by an Iraqi jet using French made weapons, two exocet missiles, fired from a French made mirage jet fighter on the USS Stark that killed  thirty-seven sailors March 17, 1987 ?

And yes I have seen the film because I had to watch it last year as part of a class. The attempts at humor are not funny and in bad taste as well. I didn't laugh at any one of those stupid attempts at a joke. The most disgusting thing though was when Micheal Moore used the images of a mother crying over her son who was killed in Iraq to make a political statement. He also edited footage that contradicted him. Go watch ""Farrenhype 9/11"" if you don't believe me. And the mother who was exploited in this film even criticized Moore for his potrayal of her son and her. Mr.Moore represents everything that is wrong with the American left these days. Hopefully though, he'll continue his stupid attempts because he only succeeds in making every left-minded person look bad. Guess who he's going to exploit next in his new movie ""Sicko""? The mentally handicapped! Wait to go Mike! Your gonna profit off of someone else's suffering as well. Michael Moore is a propagandist, not a documentary film maker.

The film's objectivity is not to be questioned, cause Michael Moore gives clear evidence on everything.

This movie is erratic, incoherent, and sometimes just plain pointless.  The way Moore uses war images and people crying to ""move"" the audience is cringe-worthy.  I thought the one thing that would at least entertain me during this movie were the funny Bush screw-up scenes, but it actually ended up being the middle half of the film where Moore ties in the Bush family's relation to the Saudis.  This was eye-opening material and if Moore had decided to stick this subject for the entire movie and make it a true documentary it could have been something very important.  Instead we are stuck most of the time with Moore's annoying narration and images that tell us nothing new."	2.0	Truly Disappointing	2004-10-09	48	8	40

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	ASJ89T42CIUHU	V. Marshall	"Love him or hate him Michael Moore really puts it all out there in this film. But one must watch it with an open and honest mind to grasp its true value to America.After months of anticipation and media hype (most of it bad) I couldn't wait to watch this DVD. I will say that one should watch this film after having formed their own opinion because I imagine it has the ability to make up the mind of the entirely clueless. Moore portrays President Bush as an arrogant bumbling idiot without one good quality. Personally I don't believe that to be so but I also have a healthy perspective on where his administration has erred America as well. Every one can be filmed during their worst moments and made to look foolish so the scenes filmed by Moore about President Bush didn't impress me. I don't believe ANYONE could have known how to react on 9/11 and not look foolish, we all paid a price on that day that shouldn't be mocked, it is history and that day will never be changed it is only our futures that stand a chance. I believe this film will force you to get involved, to take a stand and to care how America is represented, the fog has been lifted and now we are all responsible.This film does not get interesting, unless you like to ""Bushbash,"" until the Iraq war comes into play. We see children playing on swing sets and women going to market, Iraqi smiles and laughter and then BOOM! For people who have chosen to watch the war only through the eyes of our popular media this film will open your eyes to a truth really too horrible for any of us to imagine. Moore manages to show the devastation that Iraq has felt because of American decisions. Their blood drips on each and every one of us especially our precious soldiers. It is important to realize here that the poor and uneducated are fighting the same. An effective moment in this film is when Moore attempts to recruit the children of American congressmen for service in Iraq.....and the answer is? As for our soldiers they are trained to kill, asked to kill and faced with death every day something unfathomable to imagine dealing with. Moore presents the difficulties that our soldiers face in Iraq as well as the abuses that Iraqis are suffering. The footage is not easy to get through without feeling touched and often ashamed. Watching a mother read a letter from her son killed in battle is almost impossible to endure but we must in order for it all to change. Regardless of your political beliefs allow this film to affect you!This DVD has many very interesting ""extras"" that further the horror of what is taking place before the world's eyes in Iraq. But what can be done? Moore is doing something, taking a stand is doing something, developing compassion is doing something and asking questions is doing something. The only bad question is the one not asked! Moore asks and even answers many questions with this extraordinary film. The fact that it was accepted so well internationally must mean something. Like it or not being a proud American doesn't just stop at our own borders, our pride exists in the universe as well and maybe after watching this film that fact will matter. Allow your temperature to rise with knowledge and compassion and realize that the answer cannot and must not be found in hate."	5.0	Don't Be Afraid To Raise Your Temperature A Few Degrees	2004-10-11	47	36	11
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3GGDAIEUHRNUG	V. Natarajan	Michael Moore himself says that he made this film specifically to get George W. Bush out of office.  Of course, he also is out to make money.  No one can deny that this movie really cashed in on the latter goal.With regards to the first goal, this film does an excellent job.  Rarely is the most effective way to gain votes for a particular candidate to actually cater to undecideds by rationally convincing them to vote for the desired candidate.  Rather, it's to energize those that already support the candidate in question to actually get out and vote.  As such, the movie does an excellent job energzing Kerry Supporters to get angry enough at Bush to vote, and in some cases, actually get involved in the campaign.Ifyou're an undecided voter looking for rational guidance, this movie is clearly not for you.  No one that either already likes Bush or is undecided is going to see anything compelling here -- far too much of the movie is intentionally biased and overtly presented in a way as to deliberately make Bush look worse than he deserves (which is quite an accomplishment, since he is quite adept at making himself look terrible without any outside help).  This movie is quite humorous in the process, so it definitely earns high marks as a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  However, it earns poor marks for actual informational value -- which is of concern in a movie that bills itself as a documentary, and why I docked it a star.  This movie will make Kerry supporters mad enough that they'll be more likely to vote, but won't actually cause anyone to learn anything they didn't already know or believe anything they didn't already believe.See this movie cause it's fun, and, if you're liberal, to get energized.

But DO NOT IGNORE the facts just because they are presented in a way you don't like.This film was made for people to talk about it.  People should know who their President is and why he makes the decisions he does.  And Moore presents enough information for more than a short discussion by the watercooler.I say gather a few friends and see this film with them.  Afterward talk, argue, criticize, condemn what you have seen, I don't care what you say as long as you discuss the information.

It concerns me that most of the reviewers are not aware that creative filming and editing are telling a story whose truths can be quite twisted. But none the less, it is fine entertainment. However, it doesn't hold a candle to ""Bowling for Columbine,"" which was witty, poignant and funny. Moore's anger showed through in this film, a quality that was out of character for him. I may not be able to be very objective about the subject matter of this film, since I am on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Moore. But you can't take away his talents in story-telling. Moore missed an opportunity to show how little power the politicians really have once they get sucked into the system. People should not come away from this film thinking that they have experienced a indepth analysis of the Bush Administration and how it operates, although I think they will anyway. Keep in mind that if the depictions here presented an honest and true picture of George W.

The tale would be almost unbelievable if not for the fact that reality -- e.g., the catastrophe in Iraq -- intrudes rudely into the neocons' fantasy world. It's hard to believe that anyone could steal an election. We don't want to believe it. But as we watch the unfolding of recent events and the president's addled campaign performances, we find that our disbelief begins to wane. Fahrenheit 9/11 only began the process of demystifying the web of intrigue surrounding the Bush administration. To Moore's credit, he serves up just enough detail to move his audience.

Moore's newest documentary, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' won the Palme D'Or, and now that I've seen it, I find the award to be an undeserved mention as a result of political fervor, despite some of my personal opinions concerning both the presidancy and Moore's film making. But let's be honest, here: 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a biased account based on intense political opinion, through and through. Though there are moments that are undeniably powerful, undeniably real, there were other segments where I could not get past the blatant, overly-obvious jabs at Bush's reputation. They were a bit too unskilled in their upfrontness, even for a director such as Moore who doesn't seem to take himself as seriously sometimes as others do. If Moore is attempting to persuade the American public to convert to an anti-Bush standpoint or allow people to see what he believes is really going on, I wish he would have been more careful and mature in handling such delicate situations (namely the book-reading incident on September 11, 2001). Instead, Moore's hate becomes a malignant force, eating away at moments he could have used to his advantage. Luckily, these previously mentioned ""powerful, real moments"" were just that, as well as finely crafted and documented. However, the film as a whole still lacks the masterful control of 'Bowling for Columbine' and in turn loses much of its potential for change."	4.0	I wish Moore had taken a better approach	2004-12-08	21	11	10

Instead, this movie represents the highlights of what Moore saw.  Anyone who had taken in all the events in sequence and perspective would not have come to the same overly biased opinion of the events.  This movie is like putting George Bush on trial for only two hours and never giving him a chance for defence.  Its a good thing Michael Moore didn't design our court system.Sadly, Americans too often lack the disipline and the intelligence to look for the story not told.  Michael Moore is obviously a film maker and not a analysts or political strategist.  He excells at portraying his vision, but lacks even the desire to be an objective story teller, thus this is not a documentary.  He needs to read more books about politics and economics from multiple viewpoints, not just the liberal viewpoints that tell him what he wants to hear.  Pathetic really.

Pandering with nonsense like gay marriage, god-in-the-classroom idiocy, they've successfully installed blinders on their followers, all the while feasting on the public trough, raping the environment, etc. Despite all of this in PLAIN VIEW, conservative loyalism hardly wavers. The mind reels. I'd recommend to those who hate Moore and his film to watch ""Triumph Of The Will"", but they would simply fail to make the connection between then and now. I'm not a ""believer"", in the religious sense, but if the current administration retains power (or refuses to cede it), I would say that prayers would truly need to be said for the frightening direction this nation would be steered toward."	4.0	Astonishing reactions from the Right mesmerize	2004-10-19	57	39	18
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A4UKBG3M5U5TI	Westley	"Obviously, Michael Moore wanted to make a provocative film, and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" succeeds on that score: Endless debate has centered on this film. However, I was surprised by how leaden it was compared to his more entertaining (and effective) ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Roger and Me.""  Although some scenes were undeniably powerful - such as interviews with the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, other sections did not work very well, particularly snippets of political speeches taken out of context.However, to me, the biggest flaw was Moore's mixed messages about the armed forces. He repeatedly hammers home the message that the men and women sent to Iraq are from poor neighborhoods and signed up because of a lack of other opportunities in their lives, making them sympathetic.  However, in interviews with soldiers in Iraq, he depicts them as ruthless killing machines - carelessly killing Iraqi civilians while listening to Drowning Pool.  Why does Moore undermine his message so severely?Overall, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a middling documentary, but the fact that it was so successful cannot be denied. The American public was seeking out in a film the answers they didn't think they were getting from politicians and even the media. Perhaps that's the legacy of this film, especially as it seems so outdated already, just weeks after the election."	2.0	No Moore	2004-11-20	21	5	16
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AAD2DYRK43BYF	Weston J. Kathman	George W. Bush is not a great president; in fact, he is a major expansionist who will likely blow up the federal deficit into the tens of trillions, especially now that he has won a second term.  Part of the reason that Bush has not been effectively defeated is that his opponents have become too unhinged, just as many prominent Republicans seemed to lose their sanity during the Clinton years.  In politics, it is often not that one side clearly prevails, but that the other side, due to its own excesses, manages to completely alienate a majority of the American electorate.  What we have seen since the 2000 election is the rise of several rabid leftists -- George Soros, the wackos in Hollywood, etc. -- who foam at the mouth and generally make complete asses of themselves while attempting to discredit the president.  Michael Moore may be the best example of this collection of hotheads and malcontents.  Many observers have voiced their outrage at Moore's antics; people like me, however, realize the man for what he is: a pompous fool who does more harm to his causes than any Republican ever could.  Rather than rail against this filmmaker, Bush loyalists should offer to subsidize his next feature film.Moore's latest offering, the amazingly dishonest FAHRENHEIT 9/11, may be his most ridiculous project to date.  The same idiot who told us that terrorism was not a problem has now made an entire film excoriating the Bush Administration for not going after Osama Bin Laden.  As usual, the filmmaker has presented a number of themes, many of which completely contradict each other (BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was even more notorious in its dreadful lack of consistency).  At one point in the movie, Moore implies that the American troops in Iraq are cold-hearted neandrathals who derive great pleasure from torturing and murdering innocent civilians.  Later he feigns sympathy for those serving in the armed services, portraying them as a bunch of poor kids who had few options in life but to join the military (and thus, Moore also plays the standard class warfare game).  Again, consistency has never been a staple of this man's work.Much of the rest of this shoddy picture is nothing more than a tribute to manipulative film splicing.  Any hack with the proper equipment can edit footage in such a way as to make even the most intelligent person look like a buffoon.  Moore is a master at this.  Such sophomoric tactics are most fully on display near the beginning of the film.  There is a whole sequence that features muted footage of various members of the Bush Administration, including the commander in chief himself, primping themselves just before going on camera.  In one shot, Paul Wolfowitz, that hated Neocon and Zionist, licks his hand and then uses it to fix his hair.  If Moore expects his viewers to laugh at such silly cheap shots, he has even less respect for the audience than I originally assumed.  There are plenty of valid ways to oppose the current cadre that controls the White House; unfortunately, none of these ways are explored in this shameful attempt at discourse.Most of FAHRENHEIT is either comically false or mildly irritating.  However, some of the film is beyond merely obnoxious.  In one of the most outrageous scenes in the movie, we are treated to images of pre-war Iraq, which is (surprise!  surprise!) a blissful utopia where carefree children fly kites and elderly women sit on their porches soaking up the joyous atmosphere.  Sympathy for tyrannical dictators -- in this case, Mr. Hussein -- has always been a characteristic of the left.  Moore has taken this bias to a whole new level of sophistry.  Wicked regimes that murder their own people in the millions are never as nefarious as capitalist America's vicious imperialism.  The filmmaker also spends much time exploiting the sorrow of a woman who has lost a son in Iraq.  The ironic thing is that the woman strongly encouraged each of her male family members to join the military.  One can easily sympathize with her pain, but shouldn't a person know that those who join the armed services are taking the risk of dying in battle, whether just or unjust?  Having witnessed Moore's attempt to milk this poor woman's grief for all its worth, the average viewer may be more enraged at the filmmaker's grotesque behavior than saddened by the tragedy of a young man's untimely death.Like all Moore pictures, FAHRENHEIT is a manipulative piece of propaganda that a certain, feeble-minded percentage of the public will undoubtedly buy hook, line, and sinker.  What is actually in the movie is not nearly as ominous as its fairly impressive popularity: the debate in the nation is increasingly being hijacked by duplicitous self promoters and clownish bunko artists.  The snobbery and self-righteousness of the left have finally caught up with them.  While many of the right's most prominent figures have sacrificed their traditional principles of limited government in order to support a president who constantly seeks to expand federal power,  the narcissism of America's statist liberals have rendered conservative hypocrisy insignificant.  We have truly reached the point where the inmates are running the asylum.  That Moore is a mainstream figure in today's media world speaks volumes about our current state of affairs.	1.0	Lunacy of the Left on Full Display	2004-11-03	90	37	53

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2Q457CES5ZUZ	William Hare	"After Michael Moore received a twenty minute standing ovation at the recent Cannes Film Festival and had its highest honor, the Gold Palm Award, bestowed on him, Quentin Tarantino explained to him that a significant number of Cannes' voting members were not the least bit political.  Tarantino assured Moore that the award was given on the basis of filmmaking expertise and not due to the film's political message.  Even at Fox News, a conservative cable network, the film was given a positive review on the basis of the technical expertise displayed on screen.From a purely technical standpoint the film is a masterpiece, moving briskly from emotional scene to scene, the camera's all-seeing eye recording all.  The technical virtuosity, highlighted by excellent photography, delivers to viewers a close-up of government at its nastiest ""it's all for sale"" level along with the consequences of those brazenly materialistic actions, that of sending young men and women from the least affluent areas of our society, victims of the social rip offs of the privileged top dogs, to do their fighting after destroying avenues to a better future in pursuing their greedy agenda.The charge has been raised that Moore's film is not objective.  The objective of any film about any serious subject is to make a statement in the eyes of the filmmaker.  Commentators of the right reveal their viewpoint regularly.  What is unusual therefore for Michael Moore to do the same?Those who criticize have the opportunity to rebut the content of what appears on screen, as well as the chance to present an alternative film presenting what they consider to be a correct statement of they way things are.  As for Moore, it is impossible to rebut the touching segment of the woman from his hometown of Flint, Michigan who changed her opinion of the war after her son serving in Iraq wrote from the battle zone and sharply criticized Bush administration policies.  Not long after he wrote the letter he was dead.  This woman was not a performer.  This was real life.Were those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?  The emotional scenes included individuals shouting emotionally about destroying the enemy as well as those regretfully relating how big a mistake America had made in invading Iraq.  Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?  Were those evening missions breaking into houses of innocent civilians actors playing fictional roles?Were those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?  The emotional scenes included individuals shouting emotionally about destroying the enemy as well as those regretfully relating how big a mistake America had made in invading Iraq.  Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?

Did Bush serve in the National Guard with James Bath, who in turn set him up in business later with Osama bin Laden's chief American representative?  Are Bush's father, along with his longtime political associate and friend, James Baker, active members of the Carlyle Group?  Does the Carlyle Group, which also includes Henry Kissinger, maintain the closest possible ties, and lucrative ones at that, with the Saudi government?  Does the Saudi government behead people, one of the reasons stated why we needed to liberate Iraq?  Was the man who handed the big aid bundle with a smile to Saddam Hussein in 1983 actually who he appeared to be in the picture, none other than ""liberate Iraq from its oppressors"" Donald Rumsfeld?  Did we not hear Bush and Cheney assert 1) that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and 2) that Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were linked?  Did they furnish verifiable proof?Go see the film and decide for yourself about Fahrenheit 9-11 regardless of your political persuasion.

The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Millions of people across the world have now seen the film.Moore tells us about the botched war against Al Qa'ida, and how the US state was completely unprepared for the attack, even though bin Laden had declared war on the USA in 1996. He details how the Bush administration, although repeatedly warned of an imminent attack, prepared no counter-attack and took an amazing two months to launch a military response.Moore reminds us that the 9/11 Commission found `no credible evidence' of any link between Iraq and Al Qa'ida. Vice-President Dick Cheney responded to this Report by repeating robotically that there was `overwhelming evidence'. President Bush added helpfully, ""The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and Al Qa'ida is because there was a relationship between Iraq and Al Qa'ida.""Moore denounces Bush and Blair's diversionary attack on Iraq, a country which has never attacked the USA or Britain and has never threatened to attack the USA or Britain.

It is like saying I was born in May so was JFK, I must be his reincarnated spirit.  Of course Moore is able to make this argument a little more effectively with relatively clever wit and use of very clever music.I will hand it to him, he is bright, but the people that enjoy this and buy into perhaps are not or are just grossly uninformed.  I by no means am defending the President or saying that this administration has been perfect- but come on!!!!I got my graduate degree in public policy and one thing I can say for sure is that it should definetly have focused a lot more on rhetoric and distorting the truth b/c that sadly is what people are now letting their votes be swung by.And just by this movie, but by ads (on both sides of the aisle) and trash like this.There are going to be people who love this, most of them will be relatively uninformed and already disliking the president and the war- this is merely fuel to their fire.	1.0	WOW- the reviews of this movie have been astounding	2005-11-13	42	11	31

They miss oppressing their neighbors and being in charge of a country so run into the ground that there has no been no hope for generations, so they cook up schemes to get the dumbest among them to drive a truck bomb into your checkpoint. You have to spend over one year in this pleasant environment away from family, friends...all for this great notion of freedom, so this whale can criticize what you are doing, since he hates living in the land of liberty, PS2, the Wal-Mart lower prices yellow bouncing ball, Starbucks Mocha lattes, Volvos, free internet porn, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, and the 24 hour 7 eleven slushee made by the Pakistani immigrant who fantasizes not of Al-Qaeda bombings, but of someday owning his own ethnic restaurant on the rich yuppie side of town. Yeah this great guy is great, capitalizing on our soldier's deaths to make a living.

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A3PXS00XF1TLS9	"Xander Xavier Xymox ""Black metal rivethead an..."	"Let me start by saying that this film doesnt tell the truth! About now you think I am a GOP fan boy. However the film doesnt tell the truth because mr Moor doesnt go far enough. Yeah we all know the Bush's have oil dealings with Saudi Arabia. The problem is thats only the surface of the corruption.Following is a list of things this film skips over.On the morning of Sept 11- Standard air defence mechanisms systematically failed, simultaneously. When a plain deviates from course an attempt is made to contact the plain. If there is no responce Jets are scrambled to intercept the plain and guide it back to the airport. This is actually pretty common. It happens about 60-100 times a year. Without fail there is an innocent explanation for the course deviation nearly all the time. Now the fighter jets that scramble are far faster than any jetliners and if this happened on the morning of 9-11 the fighter jet would have reached the first plain in time to shoot it down. Now assuming the military was just incompitant as the administration would have you think. Than why were they still asleep for the next 3 attacks? The military records of that morning suggest that interceptor jets were scrambled too late, too slowly and from the wrong locations. An interesting side note is usually when there is a failure of this magnitude someone is punished or fired. In the case of 9-11 the military commanders in charge were promoted! Another interesting fact is that fires could not have caused the collapse of the towers. No high rise has ever collapsed due to fires. The idea that the fire melted the steal beams and the towers collapsed is dead wrong. To melt the steal beams the fires would have to be far hotter than 2000 degrees. Experts say the fire from jet fuel is hot but not hot enough. Now assuming the tops melted and collapsed dont you think the floors below would have at least momentarily provided resistance to the collapse? Instead both buildings collapsed in under 15 seconds. For a building that tall that is free-fall speed. Also the first two firefighters that came the closest to the 80th floor where impact was made thought the fires were manageable. They didnt describe a raging inferno. Istead they radiod for two lines to be brought up to put out two isolated fires. Minutes later without warning the towers collapsed on them. Prior to the collapse the seismologist at Columbia university recorded two spikes indicating large burst of energy that shook the ground just before there collapse. They were 2.1 and 2.3 on the richter scale respectivly. You couple that with dozens of survivors who's testimony says they heard other explosians on other floors prior too the collapse. A building colapsing on its own would not have produced all the dust that you see in in the video. Only a high energy explosian can reduce concrete to dust. If you can think back to that day on the news about 5 pm  they announced that building 7 collapsed. It was said that fires once again melted a 47 story steal frame building. Later on the govt changed there story and admitted it was pulled. Pulled is the technical term for demolishing a building. Why did they lie to begin with? Could they have also detonated the towers? We will never know if the steel in the debris tested positive for explosive residue,since before they could be examined the steel was sent on ships to china to be sold as scrap metal! Than there is the stock market.There was massive short selling of stocks just before the attacks. American and United Airlines as well as Morgan Stanly were involved. Somebody new ahead of time that these Airlines were going to down in the stock market. Morgan Stanly had offices in the world trade center. All three were affected by the attacks. Somebody profited millions by shortselling these stocks. Another good question is how could the pentagon been attacked? It is the most highly defended building in the wetern hemisphere yet they say a plain hit it. And this is after the govt already new we were under attack.Anyways I could give you details forever. I suggest that you just read a good book like The New Pearl harbor. If you cant read go to infowars.com and buy the dvd 9-11 The Road to Tyranny by alex Jones. He is concerned with getting the truth out so there is no copyright on his dvd you can make copies and distribute them for free for educational purposes. As far as Moor is concerned I dont understand why he didnt bring out facts. He probably new no theatre would carry a movie that told the truth so he wouldnt make any money on it. He was more concerned with getting Bush out of the whitehouse by having people vote for Kerry. Let me make this clear the democrats are just as responsible. All they think about is there careers so they wont say anything extreme that might make them look ""un umerican"". The truth is extreme though.

And for the people that say, don't believe what you see on this movie, well, Michael Moore doesn't use special effects. The footage of Bush IS actual footage. This may be propaganda but it is also and eye opener for the public, as to say that not everything is hunky-dory behind the scenes. There are things that are happening that you don't know about, and Michael Moore at least tries to make people see that. You don't have to agree with it, but there does need to be more awarness of what is actually happening with everyone on this planet. You may think that it doesn't affect you, but when Billions of dollars(your money) are going towards things that you might not even know about, then there is a problem. This film tries to show that, and I think it also tries to get people to speak up and say, that is not right, we need to do something.	5.0	It's About Time Someone Stepped Up...	2005-02-05	23	14	9
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	AGMIOZ1W4BCOG	Yaghanen Soul	"Wow! What a film! Just saw it in Tokyo where tickets cost around 20 bucks, popcorn extra. All summer long, Michael Moore has been plugged as ""the"" spokesman for American culture. Take that with whatever salt or soy sauce you need. As a good ex-pat (not to be confused with ex-patriot) American, it was my duty to see this film.I was expecting a comedic romp through the book ""Dude, Where's My Country?"" but was thankful for its seriousness and to find it touched on the way you Americans are being terrorized by your own media through orange alerts, censorship and name-calling. I admit I am sheltered here where our TV is a bit more light and fluffy. But it's amazing how we're getting all the wounded Iraqi women, children and U.S. troop footage and you're not, and your press is supposed to be ""free,"" at least, freer than Japan's, anyway.It's not that these violent images are good, they are horrible and regrettable. But it's necessary for people to see both sides of a thing, and such footage of a real tragedy makes people think. After 2 hrs. of such concentrated stress, I was made aware just how much better off I am here away from American television.This movie only gets 4 stars: Michael could've seen that 5th star should he have treated the Washington D.C. footage a bit differently. He may think he's coming across as a righteous crusader for the truth. Instead, him being brushed off by frustrated politicians or rounded up by security seems too staged, too sensational to be taken seriously. Yeah, Michael is a rebel on the fringe. So what! That's not important to the movie. This piece of work already had enough integrity going for it. He didn't need to stage confrontations to make it more controversial or provocative.I hope many more of my fellow Americans watch this movie, if only to get a sense of the way American war-time media is being censored and manipulated."	4.0	9/11 Says what Your Media isn't Saying	2004-10-10	0	0	0
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2J3MR64L567OK	Yossarian	I'm a registered Democrat and 2000 Gore-voter, so you'd think I'd be right in the targeted audience for Moore's work. Unfortunately, it rapidly becomes clear that the sole purpose of 'Farenheit 9/11' is to get Bush, as often and as recklessly as possible. If Bush is involved, Moore spins and twists the facts in any manner possible to cast Bush in a negative light. During the 9/11 attacks, Moore casts Bush as a stunned doofus, unable to apparently comprehend or react to the monstrous nature of those terrorist attacks. Yet of course Moore's own infamous reaction shortly thereafter (&quot;Many Families have been devastated tonight. This is just not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC and the planes' destination of California - these where places that voted AGAINST Bush!&quot;) is hardly a paragon of logical, rational thought (translation: &quot;Dear Osama: Next time, please kill Republicans.&quot;)Yet at the same time, according to Moore, Bush is at the heart of and one of the chief beneficiaries of some nebulous, James Bond S.P.E.C.T.R.E.-like conspiracy with Saudi Arabia and the military-industrial complex. Well, which is it? Is Bush a doofus, or a mastermind? Apparently it's whichever at which particular moment Moore thinks makes Bush look the worst.The real problem with Farenheit 9/11 is that it is so flagrantly, unabashedly biased that it instantly polarizes its viewers and renders any intellectual debate nearly impossible. You either spend the entire time pumping your fist in agreed outrage at the screen, or sit nauseous in your seat hoping Moore will finally just move to France and be done with it. And unfortunately, as a moderate Democrat, Farenheit 9/11 is so extreme that I find myself in the latter half this time.	2.0	Means to an end	2004-08-04	47	15	32
B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A2Y1IWANOBRGYT	Yossarian	The film brings up a lot of things like the alleged connections between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family etc etc that I don't personally believe and are impossible to prove anyways. There's some of that, great, leaders and leader's supporters should be able to take criticism anyways.But, the one thing it does superbly is show viewers how war really, really, REALLY is unpleasant. For the soldiers, families, and for civilians who get in the way. This movie made me cry, and it made a lot of people cry (those who weren't already starting the liberal bashing, that is). It also makes, or should make, you think; think if war is necessary or worth it, worth the cost, the chaos, and, most of all, the human suffering.Also, being moderatley distrustful or cynical of your government is a healthy thing. It forces you, if you wish to have a good argument, to look the facts up yourself, to learn and make your own opinions, which I hope this film drives people to do.So, 4 stars for content and 1 for guts- because now half the country is calling him a fat, stupid, communist...*gasp* LIBERAL!	5.0	here goes nothing...	2004-11-07	35	20	15

B00005JNEI	Fahrenheit 9/11	A1CLACEORRU1WV	"""yourfan"""	One of Moore's chief accusations is Bush allowed planes to pick up 24 members of the Bin Laden family and fly them out of the US in the days following the attacks - when all other aircraft were grounded. To back this up, he shows a document that seems to list them - and uses it as a base from which to explore the relationships between the Bush and Bin Laden dynasties.When Bush was trying to make his way as a Texan oil magnate, this same man was hired by the Bin Ladens to invest their money in Texas, and he in turn invested money in Bush's company, the film says.Moore asserts that prominent Saudis invested in Bush's ailing companies to get access to his father, the former US president. But aside from the original military records, there is little proof to firm up links Moore goes on to make.The result is the oil and arms companies the Saudis invested in, and the Bush family and their inner circle have interests in, profited from the aftermath of 11 September, Moore says. Using a clip of former US head of counter-terrorism Richard Clarke talking about how Bush immediately wanted to find an Iraq link to the attacks, the film moves on to Afghanistan and Iraq.The Afghanistan section - including a screen shot of a BBC News Online story - is a claim that the military action in Afghanistan was really about laying a natural gas pipeline across the country.But the Iraq section is more substantial, and changes the film's direction - using interviews with US soldiers, footage of civilian suffering and highly moving testimony from bereaved parents of US servicemen.The film shows graphic footage of corpses of US soldiers being burnt, dragged behind a truck and strung up, and a scene of US soldiers apparently mistreating Iraqi prisoners.(...)	5.0	Anti-Bush film tops Cannes awards	2004-05-23	125	95	30

I work for the Air Force, and I sent an inquiry to the Base Newspaper asking why it was not shown.

I saw the movie at home, and Moore does not make an endorsement of any candidate or political party.

If all of his books and movies are lies, than it is considered LIBEL (printing lies about someone) and SLANDER (saying lies about someone). Libel and slander are FELONIES, and if the Bush Administration wanted to, THEY COULD SUE MICHAEL MOORE.But are they?No.Do you wonder why that is?BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LIES.If Bush wanted to, he could go on national TV and say something like, ""Michael Moore is wrong, the movie is full of lies, and vote for me in November."" HE CAN'T DO THAT. HE HASN'T DONE THAT. Don't you get it? This movie hurts him so badly, that all he can do is just sit back and hope everyone forgets about it.Michael Moore was sued for a lie he apparently said in Bowling For Columbine. Guess what? Michael Moore won the case.Most of you aren't taking this review seriously. You still think that Michael Moore is nothing but a fat liar. I have yet to see ONE lie that he said in Fahrenheit 9/11.(...). Everything that you people complain about has been proven wrong in that link. Will you take the time to read it? Probably not. This is because all you people want to do is COMPLAIN, rather than getting the problem solved. Yes, Michael Moore is a large man, but what the hell does that have to do with this movie? You're probably the same people that grew up being bullies in school, and whenever you were proven wrong with INTELLIGENCE, you decided to make a snappy comment by using PERSONAL ATTACKS.The facts are all there. All you have to do is sit back and watch.Another thing that you don't understand is the MEDIA. You think that because the media says this movie is horrible and full of lies, it really must be. The truth is, THIS MOVIE MAKES THEM LOOK BAD. This is a big embarrassment to them, and do you know why? I'll tell you.Back when all of this stuff was happening (and it still is), there wasn't one reporter who decided to question ANY of it. It was rediculous, and like Michael Moore said, they played ""cheerleader.""So you see, this movie makes them look bad. That's the ONLY reason why they say it's full of lies. Ironically, it's the other way around.On a lighter note, this is a fantastic movie, and possibly the most important movie EVER MADE.

If you already hate Bush, you'll love it for the cartoon it is.The simple fact is, Moore has stated that he has an agenda with this film and it oozes out of every scene. From creative edits (like the senator who's response to Moore's question was left off, to make it appear that he had no answer) or the joke speech Bush gave that Moore presents as serious, to tons of curiously missing pieces of information (like Clinton's and the Dem's ties to Halliburton and the Carlisle Group, or the fact that it was the CIA and Richard Clark that flew the Bin Ladens out of the US and not Bush), it's all here (or not here, as the case may be) for the enjoyment of the extreme Leftist, partisan democrat.One of the most disturbing segments is Moore's portrayal of a peaceful Iraq.. before we attacked. Moore ignores the fact that, according to Human rights organizations, literally tens of thousands of Iraqi's died every single year on average at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Does Moore actually expect us to believe that we're the bad guys?This film is a good example of everything that is wrong with politics. Moore's extremism causes some conservatives to be extremists, and soon, they're all out of touch with the regular person. This film is a fantasy world for the political partisan conspiracy theorist.

Moore says Saddam made no threats against the US, but meanwhile Usay's newspapers flagrantly pronounced ""Death to America"".  It's OK for Usay to pronounce virulant hatred, but Saddam is not a threat?  This piece of garbage is one of the greatest propaganda films since Leni Reifenstahl.  Moore also illustrates how the Bin Laden family were the first to fly out of America and had ""special connections"".  The Bin Ladens were considered not a threat by the FBI and were not allowed to fly out until 2 days after, when the airlines first returned to flying.  If you were a Bin Laden family member, would you too have not been on the first plane out of the US?  I don't understand how Moore's film is heralded by the left who have become absolutely oblivious to our countries values.Moore further documents that Bush sat around and didn't do anything for 7 minutes.  Well, he is the Commander in Chief and there are safeguards allowed where he doesn't have to overreact in front of second graders and run.  President Bush is the first president to have an MBA and he sat for several minutes calculating, knowing full well that his though processes were being documented for all to judge, and if he jumped up and reacted, that too would have been criticized.  If his staff thought that it was expedient for him to jump up and react; they would have certainly done so, instead he set an example as a leader and handled the situation in a business like manner, which was his job, a business-man in a political position, running the largest $ business in the world.Without any shame, Michael Moore capitalizes on soldier's who nobley gave their lives for the sake of freedom across the world, and Moore shamelessly exploits and desecrates their sacred funeral rites and injuries, in order to line his pockets. Benedict Arnold died a death known to traitors, our democracy allows Moore to perpetuate his cowardly behavior, and he shows his appreciation by exploiting our soldier's (this country's greatest asset) funerals and manipualing people's emotions by telling outrageous lies.
