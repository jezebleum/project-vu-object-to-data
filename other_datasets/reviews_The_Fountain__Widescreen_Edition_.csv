B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"Aronofsky is NOT the Kubrick of his generation. Repeat: Darren Aronofsky is not the Kubrick of his generation. There is one Kubrick and no director working today is as talented as him and nor do any film directors work the way he did. Maybe a problem is that there is too much wanting to copy the master going on with some of these younger guys? (I read an interesting article in EW awhile back that went into that topic.) But anyway, look, this film is bold, highly original and credit is to be given to the director for having guts. But IMHO it just doesn't work. As for the look of the film, it felt....I don't know how to put it--I want to say ""stuffy"" and plastic. It felt like I was in a Christmas store in the mall or something. In anycase the effects didn't take my breath away. What the movie is about is obviously death and fear of death and how life is here, now. OK, message received. And I guess we're supposed to try to come to terms with the three Hugh Jackman/Rachel Weisz stories or at least be interested in how they relate and what it all means. It's so symbolic and stuff."	3.0	a noble failure	2009-02-16	12	2	10
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"New Age fairy tale, `The Fountain,' taps into our most primitive regions by transcending space and time to seek the antidote to man's mighty enemy--Death.  Drawing upon a hodgepodge of religious imagery, the movie intersects four time frames, including ancient times and the biblical Tree of Life; the trappings of Medeival Spain when ascetical practices were sometimes severe, and the Inquisition made ""heresy"" contraband; today, and the future when mankind potentially can reap the benefits of science and meditation.  In the middle times, the conquistador seeks the cure to death with a pilgrimage to Mayan civilization where the pyramid of life can be found and brought back to his queen.  In today's time, that same conquistador is scientist, Tommy (Hugh Jackman), seeking a cure for his terminally ill wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), through an experimental rhesus monkey.  The future looks good if only the past times can be linked together in one healing swoop. A plethora of myths connect the story and time differential. The book 'The Fountain' and an eaten lotus make portals to each place and time.Philosophically, there are no enemies in the movie but death.  In medieval times, Franciscan friar, Fr. Avila, lives in a time where he states, ""Bodies are prisons for our souls.""  In today's time, Tommy says ""Death is a disease, and there's a cure, and I will find it.""  Nice stuff.  Who can argue with the idea that death robs us of loved ones, ruins our plans, and creates muddying mystery beyond our imagination?  The movie tries to construct archetypes that pull for our desire to have everlasting life on earth.  Meaningful, the movie is great escapist fare that is cathartic--even if it has to take itself seriously enough to work.`The Fountain' demonstrates effectiveness in ways that Shymalan`s `Lady in the Water` failed to accomplish.  Each scene is shot with easily pleasing panoramic views, and Darren Aronofsky's direction gives the film an essential urgency.  Handled with good, performances by Jackman and Weisz, and an excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn as Tommy's lab supervisor, 'The Fountain' takes the edge off what could have been a disasterous fairy tale gone too fluffy and soft in the head."	3.0	Restoring Eden	2007-05-16	6	1	5

The movie has some fantastic visuals... and some &#34;B movie moments&#34; (floating meditating yoga man felt like a comedy).

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A36SL9UBVGR8DM	Aaron Nixon	This movie explores a complicated emotion in a very complicated way, and it pretty much hits the nail on the head, those who have experienced what this movie portrays in their personal lives will find this movie bringing that feeling back.Though we don't want to feel it again, this movie will help you remember and may even help you understand these sorts of things even better.Needless to say it is absolutely beautiful, perhaps mildly complicated, but the complex parts of the movie are required for the type of thing the movie is helping us experience, I can say that this movie brings to light Hugh Jackman's great skills as an actor also, he seems to understand this role better than any other role I've seen him play.This movie is a must for anybody ready to understand something that is highly complex, and those of us that have an understanding of it may understand ourselves better with this movie also.It's a beautiful movie, if you're wondering if you should buy this movie, buy it. Like most of Aronofsky's movies, there is no regret in purchasing this work of art.	5.0	One of My Favorite Movies	2008-12-24	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A22AD8M2SSOFHJ	"A. C. Ege/Acedoh ""acedoh"""	This movie is visually stunning but it is not intended for those who need constant action.  After a confusing start this movie bloomed into something incredible.  Really hard to describe in words it had such strong spiritual overtones than anyone who has faith will feel more enlightened.This journey begins in 1500 A.D. as the main character is a Spaniard in Ancient Mexico in search of Eternal Life.  It is said a tree possesses this power.  Although you are not really given that information at first it becomes evident how beautiful the cinematography is.The Fountain focuses around 2000 A.D. and the story of a doctor who is fighting to keep his beautiful wife alive.  It is not necessarily her physical beauty but that of her spiritual presence that makes her an amazing character.  Full of energy and life despite being stricken with cancer.  Her husband cannot accept this journey she is on.  Instead he continues to focus on some way to keep her alive.I watched the Blu-ray edition.  This movie is chock full of special features making much more of an experience for those who want to watch.  The picture is not superb as compared to other Blu-rays I have seen.  The audio for the most part is also average.  I believe all versions include the same special features.  I would say if the DVD version is much cheaper to get that one and watch it on an upscaled DVD player.The movies visual appeal also makes it confusing at times as The Fountain continually switches from past, present, and future.  The stories begin to meld make it more understandable.  What is left is an understanding over what life is really about.  This movie is not intending for everyone.  Those who may enjoy are probably spiritual and open minded enough to accept different theories of life.  It may be a tough movie emotionally for those who lost someone close in their life.  I loved the movie and somehow feel more enlightened after going on this wonderful voyage.	5.0	A Cinematic and Artistic Look at what we call Life	2007-12-07	5	3	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3EU0GKFHEEKQ9	A. Cox	Great movie IMO, but surely not for everyone, it is at times very pretentious, but the movie itself is intriguing if you can actually grasp the plot, which flies over the heads of most it seems. Good flick for watching with your signifigant other, it's real chick flick romance and a big dose of science fiction, you can't find a better middle ground than that if you're arguing what to watch on movie night.P.S. pay attn to the whole movie or you're sure to miss something, lose track of the story and just drop asleep after too long, whether it's good or bad is really a preference and you should probably rent it before buying it, but one thing is for sure, it is very different from any other movie you've seen....	4.0	See it before you buy it	2008-02-01	6	2	4
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2J905H7RL90IM	"Adam Donaghey ""film producer"""	"Given a purely visual sequence, Darren Aronofsky presents a stream of images and music, stunning and imaginative.  His eye for design is remarkable and new, and his ear for composition is breathtaking.  His narrative, however, is something quite different.  Not only trite and boorish, but yet another example of careless ineptitude, with regards to key elements of story-telling.  Much like Aronofsky's ""breakthrough"" film, 'Pi,' 'The Fountain' appears overly-pretentious, clich&eacute;, and utterly annoying.  While in the theater, I remember thinking more about what I was going to do after seeing the film, than the film itself.I've often found that many people are too quick to judge an inescapably mundane film some sort of artistic achievement, purely due to its deviation from the norm.  If you don't understand it, it's probably smart; right?  In the case of 'The Fountain', I found myself wishing I didn't understand the film; that way, at least I could play ignorant.  At least then I could leave the theater with some sense of wonder.  Instead, I left completely unchanged.  Aronofsky had done the same thing again: he'd created something workaday, yet packaged it in something grand.For all its mesmerizing visuality and hypnotic harmony, 'The Fountain' merely toys with the Big Questions, and never really gives any incite.  Aronofsky really cuts off his nose to spite his face with all of his hack-editing and repetitive sequences.  Issues like 'love conquering science,' 'man questioning God,' and the 'acceptance of death' are strewn together and mixed widely without any forethought or strategy.  The great tragedy of this film rests solely in those who have faith in it: as noted throughout, the soundtrack is phenomenal and the cinematography is right-on; the acting is superb; and the passion is without question, dignified.  Unfortunately, these virtues seem wasted given the shallowness of the film as a whole."	2.0	Obfuscation is not a synonym for 'brilliant'	2007-02-03	35	6	29

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2Q4VZJEW90SSR	Admiralissimo Voodoo	The ideas on which this film is based are fascinating. I've seen this movie three times, and I derive different ideas from it with each viewing. I love not having the meaning of a story served up to me on a silver platter.This film deals with the spiritual, emotional, and physical journies of two lovers. Their story takes place in what can be interpreted as the past, present, and future. The story jumps from one time frame to another without losing the story's direction. There are themes of life, death, rebirth, and immortality thoughout the film.I must say that this film is quite a unique experience indeed. There is an organic quality to the sets, including the most abstract scenes in the film, that give so much meaning to the story. Almost everything in the movie can be seen as symbolic, right down to the lighting in each scene with transitions from darkness to light. There was very little (if any) CGI involved in the making of the film. There are scenes from the future in which the special effects were created by filming real chemical reactions in petri dishes. The results of this are amazing, and can really fool you into thinking that these effects were created by a computer.I loved this movie. Many questions go unanswered, and its meant to be that way. That's the way life is. There will always be questions about what happens when we die, just as there will always be questions to which we do not receive answers before it's our time to go.	5.0	A unique experience...	2007-05-22	8	5	3

I love that I can watch The Fountain over and over and each time I get a new meaning, a new interpretation or twist on the theme of the film.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AM6LA7TLLSBWP	"A. Farhadzadeh ""hsasani"""	This is not entertainment. This is cinema at its best. Weaving through exquisitely amazing images, Aronofsky talks about time as a structural dimension of consciousness; and death as a transitional stage in the continuous stream of life. It is a philosophical, existential, spiritual (if you like), and very much a humanistic film. Everything exist at this moment: life, death, past, present, future, pain, pleasure, love, and loss.More frequently than not, the critics disappoint me. Reading their reviews reminds of the intellect of a six-year old child. Watch the movie, let it sink in, and allow it to unfold in your daily life, gradually and repeatedly.	5.0	Immortality means surrendering to death	2006-12-02	14	12	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A10MZRBNPQPLIU	aguru	"""Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds"" ~ Albert Einstein.When I first saw this movie, my mind balked at the experience.  I cant explain what exactly I didn't like, but I left the movie with not altogether positive thoughts. I also do confess to leaving the movie with an unspecific impression that persisted like a tiny splinter.I saw the movie again recently, and my opinion has definitely now changed. This movie has made a significant impact, and has affected my general movie watching experience.I am convinced that this powerful movie is the work of geniuses.  The depth that this movie goes into feels nourishing for both mind and soul.  The story allowed Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz to play characters that have real substance, and they certainly stepped up to the challenge and delivered.  Their performances went places that few other movies would allow them to go, which gave a real air of legitimacy and connectivity.I think different people could get different themes or experiences from this movie.  For me, love, hope, despair and spirituality came across so strongly, all within the context of  eternal existence. I have never seen these themes expressed the way they were, and never so deeply.  It just took me a second viewing for my eyes to open, which were closed and numb from other commercial successes.Thank you thank you thank you all for making this movie.  I truly believe and predict that this movie will gain even more of a following over time, and that other movies will be using this as a springboard as they continue down the path paved by Darren Afronofsky and co.Oh, by the way.  If you likes the score, the soundtrack is brilliant.  There isn't a minute on the soundtrack that I don't like, and is completely worthy of a review in its own right."	5.0	I almost disregarded this one...	2011-08-15	4	3	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"Without a doubt, Darren Aronofsky has subtly crafted the best film of the year.  With this film, he has introduced a brave new paintbrush, a canvas that would be unpopular with the amateur cinefile, but over time will be considered an independent classic.  Like he has done with such powerful films like ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", Aronofsky, with ""The Fountain"" has entered into the ranks of such budding directors as Richard Kelly and Christopher Nolan.  While his work may never be seen as mainstream, his thoughts are continuous, his sentences are bold and detailed, and his worlds are pure imagination.  This, ""The Fountain"", simply defines what a movie-going experience should be like.  He forces the audience to think, use the visual clues throughout to tell us the themes without making our antagonist speak them loudly for audiences to hear.  He designs outside the lines, and his film are considered too ""thinking"" for the average viewer, but to me, this was a movie, simply put, about love.  ""The Fountain"" is one of those broad scoping epic stories that felt eerily Kubrik-ian with its style, but purely Aronofsky with its imagery.  This is not a story for the weak of heart (or mind for that matter), but simply a story about a never aging love pushed through the heartstrings of immortality.To begin, Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story.  In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well ""Van Helsing"" himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic.  Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer.  His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering.  He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way.  Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand.  There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined.  Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together.  From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project.  This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced.  From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be ""cute"", but instead determined and sad at the same time.  We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh.  Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters.  This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's ""2001"" - perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that.  This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress.  From ""Pi"" I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of ""Requiem for a Dream"", he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo.  Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story.  This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe.  His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive.  He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment.  It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different - the same message was being sent.  His attention to detail was magnificent.  I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear.  This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life.  To me, that is what transformed ""The Fountain"" from your average sci-fi experience to something larger.  Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created.  This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty.  Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect.  The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story.  The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments.  Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly.  The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi.  Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden.  They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of ""The Fountain"".  While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.Overall, ""The Fountain"" was a fresh new film experience for me.  With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases.  As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable.  This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time - it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout.  This is not a film for all, but many should experience it.  The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet.  This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher.  It took you all over the map without pity or remorse.  ""The Fountain"" was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project.  Aronofsky continues to impress with his films.  They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year.  ""The Fountain"" should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended.  This is one of my favorites of the year.Grade: ***** out of *****"	5.0	A homage to Kubrick - with a splash of Aronofsky's love of cinema	2008-06-12	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1NO2AWY0SUY3M	AJ	"I just saw this movie last night and it has already changed and helped me. It does what art is supposed to do, in my opinion -- it lifted me out of something I've been struggling with, spun me around, and showed me something entirely new. In a way it's a good sign when something like this gets bad reviews -- that which is truly innovative hardly ever gets widespread acceptance until its cultural impact begins to be felt. I predict that in a few years this movie will be spoken of as a landmark.**********SPOILERS BELOW:*************There are several allegorical threads to follow  -- the moviemakers gave us many ways into the story, and one of the threads I found most compelling was that of the wedding ring. Tommy takes the ring off at one point to scrub for surgery. When he returns to get it, it's no longer by the sink and he cannot find it. To me this symbolized the way he treated his actual commitment to Izzy -- nothing was more precious to him, but he set it aside in order to try to do work that would preserve it, and in doing so, lost the ability to enjoy it during the only time he really has -- the present. Later, after Izzy's death, he takes the pen and ink she was using to write her book, and tatoos a black ring around his finger in an attempt to replace what he feels he's lost with something permanent -- the photography during this sequence is intense. The implication is that no matter how much we suffer, that which is lost cannot be recaptured.. However, there is also the implication that permanence requires sacrifice. The conquistador Tomas is given the same ring by Isabella, with a promise that when he returns, she will be ""his Eve."" Tomas treats the ring as precious and inspirational, but does not wear it -- for him, the commitment it symbolizes lies in the future, even though he is already wholeheartedly committed to Isabella. During the nebula sequences, Tom's arms as well as his finger are tatooed with rings of black in varying thicknessness. This for me was reminiscent of the rings of a tree -- each layer changes a tree, but all of its layers are always preserved, so it represents something that exists always, iin the past, in the present, and in the future, as the tree continues to create its layers -- the completion of the arm ring Tom starts but does not finish will happen, if it happens at all, in the future.There is so much to think about, just using this one symbol, and there are so many other symbols to consider. This movie is as captivating and thought-provoking as great literature."	5.0	Go see it now	2006-12-06	8	6	2

I thought it would be much better than it was because it is a film by Darren Aronofsky who was the writer and directer of &#34;Pi&#34; an excellent film. &#34;The Fountain&#34; appears disjointed in its rambling story of a hero (Hugh Jackman) trying to protect his love interest (Rachel Weisz). Unfortunately the film is not equal to the talent of the two stars. The scenery and special effects are positives for this film.	2.0	An Unpleasant Suprise	2013-01-19	2	0	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ADC4L8ZEVY8C	"Alex Virs ""AV"""	"The description gives the impression that this movie follows a 1000 year quest for eternal life, but the story is actually entirely about a researcher, who is torn apart by the dying/death of his wife, the story she (mostly) wrote, and a Buddhist wet dream.  The acting and scenery are very dramatic, and if there's a silver lining it's the absolutely superb acting.  I'm not going to lie, this movie had me moved to tears by the middle.  The presentation of someone losing perhaps the only person they love in life is emotionally devastating.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't know when to stop and pulls out a very tired cliche (oops, just a moment too late!) not once but twice in two ""major"" parts of the film.  One of them is certainly major, the other is more abstract and only emotionally grating because of what it appears to mean to the main character (the researcher).The point of the movie seems to be to convey to the audience that they should be OK with death, and the story, such as it is, follows the arc of a man becoming OK with death.  Unfortunately, it just suddenly happens.  The character has an epiphany that the audience is supposed to have already experienced.  That epiphany might be that the atoms you're made of will persist until the end of time, or it might be more metaphysical, in that you just need to give yourself over to the ""great cycle"", or find peace with the fact that you're going to die simply so that you can smile and go on living.  Take your pick, as none of these ideas (or any ideas at all) are fleshed out in the movie.Minor gripe about the scripting.  While the acting is superb, and gut-wrenching, the character of the wife is a little one-dimensional, in that she's had an epiphany about death, and that's pretty much it.  Beyond that, her only significance is that she loves the main character and he loves her.  She never seems to realize that even though she's OK with dying, her husband isn't OK with her dying.  She's never presented as being sad for anyone that she's leaving behind, but instead seems set on telling everyone that she's OK with it, and POSSIBLY trying to get her husband to be OK with it, by constantly voicing how she's OK with it.  She seems to not realize that her death is going to be a VERY BAD THING to the people she leaves behind, and the movie just ignores that side of things, presuming perhaps that if everyone is OK with death that it will be less painful to lose our living, breathing friends and family forever, but being OK with your own eventual death and being OK with losing loved ones are two entirely different things.On the more despicable side of things, in the wife's story there exists a Grand Inquisitor that holds that murdering people is freeing them from their ""bodily prisons.""  While I would not say the movie endorses murder or suicide, it definitely runs with the idea that dying is being reborn or freed in some manner.  Also, there is a scene of abject horror in the wife's story that I can only assume exists from an early draft of the film, and despite not really fitting with the tone of the film, it was shoehorned in anyway because the writers couldn't resist ramming it down the audience's throat that you're going to die and plants are going to eat you.Anyone watching this film hoping for a ""sci-fi"" will likely be disappointed.  The future is a bubble in a rotoscope kaleidoscope nebula, flying toward a dying star.  When I say ""bubble"", I mean that literally, it's a bubble with a Eastern bent.  The main character lives in a bubble flying through space with a tree and nothing else, and nothing happens in the future beyond the man reaching the nebula and his epiphany.On the whole, I cannot endorse this film except as a tear-jerker, and unfortunately the emotional steam ran out toward the end and I was just left staring, hoping for a moral to come out of the ending.Good special effects (well, if you like very abstract effects), good production values (cinematography is pretty solid except for the awkward shoehorn scenes), good acting, bad writing, bad story concept.  Unfortunately, it's an emotional roller coaster that I feel I rode for no reason."	2.0	Very emotional, but without much substance.	2012-09-02	7	5	2

The visual sequences and the way the stage is set is simply amazing, with the most brilliant uses of color, art, and scene framing that I have ever seen on film. The movie is the brilliance of words, beauty, truth, death, love, life, all combined into a masterpiece. The love between the two across time is both reality and ideal, a duality like much of the rest of the movie. I have been eagerly awaiting this film's arrival on DVD since I finished watching it in theaters the first time, where I could not stand up for almost 10 minutes after the end of the movie, I was so enthralled in absorbing and mentally rehashing that I had seen.And note --- check out the soundtrack, it is by far the best and most incredible sountrack combination from Clint Mansell and Darren thus far.	5.0	Beyond Belief	2007-03-03	6	5	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AEFGUMD8313IY	Amazon Customer	Don't read this review if you don't want someone else's opinion. ** Spoilers **Here is what I think the movie is. It is set totally in modern day. Any scene that is not modern day,e.g. the Spain stuff and the Space stuff, are simply the movie director's stylistic way of showing us the chapters of Izzy's book.  Izzy wrote all the Spain chapters, but left the final chapter for her husband to complete, because she knew he would need some sort of 'closure' event and revelation to finally deal with the finality of her death from cancer, and so he could move on with his life without her.The plot of the movie is the (ironic) story of a cancer researcher who's own beloved is dying of cancer, and he is so obsessed with finding a cure for her, that he is missing the last days and weeks of her life. She tries to tell him that she has come to terms with her impending death, that she is at peace with it - but he won't listen.  She just wants him to stop working and spend the last days with her. But he won't. She realizes he won't, and also realizes that he will have a terrible time dealing with her death, so she hits upon the idea of writing a book for him to finish. She makes the story about the Spanish Inquisition ( a 'cancer' on Spain ) and a daring Conquistador (who she hopes he will see is him) who is on a futile and desperate 'quest' to find the Tree of Life. An exact metaphor of what he is doing in real life.  She hopes he will see the futile nature of the Conquistador's quest, like she hopes he will eventually deal with the inevitable fact of her cancer death.The reason the Space stuff is so disjointed and why the bald version of him in the spaceship bubble keeps getting distracted by real life images of her, is that he is not a natural writer like she is ( he is a scientist, hence he tries to write a scientific like chapter, using the Mayan star nebula that Izzy showed him in the telescope  ) but as a left-brained scientist, he sucks at the right-brained task of trying to write the final chapter ( Izzy is already dead, btw, when we 'see' his chapter being written ). But he eventually comes to some terms with it all, finishes the chapter, and the final real life visit to her grave site shows us that he has finished his chapter in the book, and is, though very sadly, moving on in his life.And that's it.  In summary, the real story is Izzy's present day death, and his distraction in her final days while he tries desperately and unsuccessfully to save her.  The Spain stuff is Izzy's story that she is writing, a metaphor for her cancer and his quest to cure it. The Space stuff is his crappy attempt to write the final chapter in her book, but he eventually gets there.	4.0	The plot is actually simple, imo	2011-01-27	3	2	1

Gave up bubble gum pop stars, drunken reality tv stars, gladiators and blood sports as the reality of death layered into my life with the losses of loved ones beginning at 16. Life is not as simple as the masses want to force it to be, and there are no guarantees.  Maybe they want to escape into movies to get away from the reality of their own inevitable deaths. I for one, welcome the reminder to cherish and hope and love  - now.Probably one of the truest truths on film, not all things in our world and life can be easily wrapped up in a neat little white box with a bow on top.

The guy has a dying wife (who is infinitely stoic about dying) who writes a book (called ""The Fountain"") that the guy starts reading. She wants him to finish the book for her, as she has written all but the last chapter (this is supposed to be really meaningful, because, she's dying, you know.) In it, a conquistador is sent by the queen of Spain to find a hidden Mayan pyramid that has the tree of immortality in it, using three holes in a broken knife for a map. She wants him to do this to save her from the Spanish Inquisition, which nobody expects. Once there, he fights his way through a few warriors and some kind of religious looking person, eats some of that tree, but instead of it saving him, it kills him and turns him into a bunch of flowers within a minute or so. What else... The guy is some type of medical researcher who violates all the rules about drug studies and, in a flash of insight caused by looking at patterns in falling snow (I think), miraculously comes up with a serum that reverses aging. He wanted to use it on his dying wife, but she had already died. [Heavy sigh.] He did save a dying monkey, though, so that's good. Then, back in space, he breaks out of the bubble, then goes back in. I think that's about it. He never finishes the book - they kind of forgot about it, I guess.To those who compare this to 2001: A Space Odyssey - yes, there is a bubble in space in both movies. Otherwise, they bear no resemblance to each other whatsoever. To compare this to anything Kubrick made is an insult to Kubrick.If you are the kind of person that thinks it is Philosophically Deep to see a bald guy in the lotus position tumbling through space or floating four feet off the ground in front a vaguely Mayan religious person, then you might have a chance of enjoying this movie.

His edits, cinematography, sequences, and sound are some of the best around.  I had read all of the trouble he had with the studio, the budget, and then Brad Pitt and Cate Winslett dropping out and was worried that the film wouldnt be released or extremely limited in release.  Instead I think they just forced him to make it an hour and a half and didn't promote it.  I am hoping that the DVD will be much longer, there were so many allusions and hints towards more.  Bottom line, I paid for 3 movies in the theater in 06 and I went to see this one 3 times.  Even if the story is odd, incomplete, or simple to some, I think its incredibly beautiful.I think Ebert's review was great, ""If Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" is an ambitious folly, that's hardly inappropriate because the movie itself is about one of humankind's most grandiose follies, the quest for eternal life.  Yes, ""The Fountain"" overreaches on every level, and that's exactly what I like about it. Big subject, big canvas, big ambitions. A young director's ungainly and overwrought folly? By all means, in the sense that Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" or Gus Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" or Martin Scorsese's ""New York, New York"" or Bernardo Bertolucci's ""1900"" are follies.

My boyfriend and I watched it together and it is one of our favorites...so much so that I had to get it for him on blu-ray. This film is beautiful--not only visually, but emotionally. Hugh Jackman is brilliant.You will be able to grasp the three storylines independently (I didn't even have to read the back cover of the dvd to do so ;)  )--but the complex element comes in when you, the viewer, tries to decide just HOW these three storylines are related. Some things are somewhat obvious, while others aren't at all. Definitely a movie worth owning and watching again. I'd have to say that this goes in the class of movies that make you happy to be alive and to have the ones that you love.In response to an earlier comment, if you're anything like most of the people that I know (who watched the film), the Fountain won't leave you with a ""blank stare"", but rather a head full of thoughts. The total outcome of the film is open to interpretation, I think.

If you like dark dramas which focus on death and dying, which try to convey a deep message in a very vague and mysterious way, and which jump around quickly between various scenes, you'll probably love it. If you like feel-good films and/or action/sci-fi, you probably won't. I do like some dramas (especially those that are based on true stories) but I prefer action/sci-fi, and the preview gave the impression this was one of those, maybe with a similar feel to ""The Illusionist."" But it's actually a dark, confusing drama that doesn't make much sense and is a jumble of philosophies thrown together like pick-up sticks. I watched it with 3 other people, and when it was done we all looked at each other with disgusted faces and said, in essence, ""WTH??""The movie's scenes continuously alternate between 3 scenarios. The 'present' scenario is of a scientist looking for a cure for brain cancer, and his wife who is dying of brain cancer. The 'past' scenario is a story written by the scientist's dying wife, which involves a Conquistador's bloody quest to find the Tree of Life in South America and deliver Spain and her Queen from the Inquisition. The 'future' scenario is of the scientist, who has kept himself alive for 1,000 years and is now bald, does yoga and tai chi, lives in a glass bubble floating towards a nebula in space, and eats the Tree of Life which is in the bubble with him. He also kisses and caresses the Tree of Life like a lover, which on the big screen is a very strange sight.Tying all these three narratives together seems to be the overarching message that death begins new life and is to be accepted and not feared or fought against.

For as much as it tickles the philosophical centers of the viewer's brain, if you try to intellectualize it too much, you'll lose it. You just have to let it happen and accept the irrational flow. The Fountain is about grief, about life and death, about sacrifice and the act of creation through reduction. Don't try to force the pieces together; the movie will assemble the puzzle for you. The plot has three separate, but intersecting timelines. The main line is in the present, where Dr. Creo is searching for a cure for cancer. He is driven and obsessed, determined to outrun the tumors that threaten to take his beloved wife away from him. For her part, Izzy indulges his dream. She yearns to spend more time with her husband, but she understands his compulsion. As a writer, she is trying to solve her own riddles about death. Her work in progress is a book called The Fountain, a period piece about a Spanish conquistador named Tomas searching for a Mayan temple believed to hold the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden, which is essentially the Fountain of Youth. Tomas was sent on the mission by Queen Isabela, who seeks eternal life for herself and her kingdom. We see the Spanish storyline played out as Tommy reads the manuscript, its narrative intertwining with his scientific mission. Izzy explains to him the various Mayan creation and afterlife myths she's uncovered in her research, and it inspires Tommy to seek different techniques. All the while, the third timeline, the future, runs its own course over the top of both of the other stories. This story is the most open to debate, possibly being another part of the book, but also possibly more connected to Tommy's consciousness.In this future, Jackman plays a caretaker for a tree that grows at the center of a star, its similarity to both the Tree of Life and the star that the Mayan's believe houses their souls after they die being immediately apparent. From how I see it, this symbolic plot line is a manifestation of Tommy's thoughts, of his inspiration and his guilt. The answers he seeks lie in somehow connecting this future story to the rest, steering the star to the Mayan temple and Izzy's hospital bed and not necessarily halting death, but at least finding some kind of understanding or acceptance.I will admit that The Fountain may not suit everyone's taste, but I still think that everyone should see it. Darren Aronofsky has written a script that is philosophical, spiritual, and emotional. With marvelous performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the director has made a movie that is emotionally powerful giving us a feast for our eyes while also stimulating our brains and our hearts.	5.0	The Fountain DVD	2008-02-26	2	0	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ACGBAI00YLEBW	A. Navarro	"I'd rather just forget I ever saw this movie, but I'm assuming that with the new Wolverine movie coming out soon, some people might want to watch this(like I did), I consider it my duty to warn such viewers. This movie fails in a lot of ways. It has no story line, only two themes: love and death, which are represented by 3 semirelated quasi-stories. The movie follows a conquistador, a scientist, and a spaceman who is married to a tree. There are serious problems if you interpret things literally, am I to believe that this tree can: give eternal life, cure every disease, fuel intersteller travel, create artificial gravity, create a force field, absord human consciousness, cause hallucinations, enable time travel, and enable humans to fly? More problems with the future story are: why couldn't he tranfer her consciousness back into a cloned human?, why didn't he take an extra tree of life in a another bubble so he wouldn't have to eat from her tree? Not much is told about any of the characters, all I know about Rachel Weisz's character is that she's a bad writer, she titles her book ""The Fountain"" which most would interpret as ""fountain of youth"" when it's really about the tree of life, wouldn't a more appropriate title be ""The Tree""? Then Jackman's character butchers her book by introducing an illogical deus ex machina. Also insulting is the special feature where the concept artists were congratulating themselves for designing the tree ship, give me a break, it's a snow globe. Here goes my breakthrough ship design: a woman flying around in a jack o lantern and her husband's the candle. There's also problems with the visual symbolism, Weisz's character is shown in white and bright light in order to show that she's at piece with death, however in the conquistador bit she's the one who orders Jackman to search for the tree of life. The tiny flashbacks of her with long hair from her healthy days adds nothing, ""life is fleeting""?, whatever. There are 182 5-star ratings, those are the only 182 people who actually liked this movie."	1.0	terrible	2009-01-18	17	5	12

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	A movie that grew on me while I slept `The Fountain' may actually be one of the best films of this past year.  It's smart, entertaining, thought provoking and elegantly paced with enough frustration, grief and sympathy to grab hold of the audience and their emotions and exploit them to the full.  If you are willing to give yourself over to `The Fountain' then you will find one of the more fulfilling movie going experiences in years, but your enjoyment will hinge fully on your willing participation.  If you easily off put by the strange side of science fiction and don't like movies that refuse to answer themselves then this may not be the movie for you, but if you readily become absorbed in cinema and relish in films that leave themselves ambiguous and up to personal interpretation, demanding the viewer think and rethink the plot hours after the credits have rolled searching for some kind of solace then this is definitely a film for you.At heart `The Fountain' is a story about love and the lengths one will go to maintain and preserve that deep rooted feeling of love.  While `The Fountain' may consist of three interlocking stories the main solitary focus is that of prolonged love.  Tomas, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman, is a neurosurgeon whose wife Izzi, played effortlessly by Rachel Weisz, is dying of a tumorous disease.  Izzi is free spirited and strong in her position and tries her hardest to shield her husband from her worsening condition to spare him any added grief, but Tomas still struggles to find a cure for her condition even if it means pushing all other away from him.  This is the foundation for `The Fountain' and while our two main characters alternate between present time, 16th Century Spain and years into the future it all keeps coming back to the present life changing events that prove a catalyst for everything before and after.The film is deep and moving and its mood and atmosphere are added to by the impressive cast.  Jackman gives the performance of his career here, delving into three sets of emotions and unlocking three characters with enough subtlety that it appears like a natural progression.  Weisz may have won the Oscar for her previous years work but here is where she proved to me she was worth that little golden man.  Her performance is so natural and effortlessly breezy that you can't help but be drawn into those deep pools she calls eyes.  The bathtub scene is especially effective for both these actors' cases and brought tears to both my wife and I.  The supporting cast is strong despite their lack of screen time, the legendary Ellen Burstyn standing out among the crowd, but its director Darren Aronofsky who truly commands and conquers here.I've been a fan of Aronofsky since his brilliant work in `Requiem for a Dream' and was equally impressed by his vision in `The Fountain'.  He's a uniquely driven director who truly puts his heart and soul into his work, giving it a special touch of devotion that helps settle the experience upon the audience.  He's invested in his work and you can tell he believes in it.  Aronofsky directs his cast with such dedication and fervor and it shows and it pays off delivering a one of a kind experience.  So, this may not be a film for everyone, but if this film is for you then it will move you, embrace you and attach itself to you for the long haul.	5.0	A deeply moving epic of love and the desire to remain in loves good graces...	2007-06-25	5	4	1

It is 3 stories that folded together explain a journey of a man and his beloved wife. This movie transcends Space and time to explain life, death and the loss of a loved one. Everything is connected and life is just one of the stages in a universal rebirth. I connected to this movie because It spoke to me on so many levels and the message gave me some comfort. It was painful to watch at times since it stirred up emotions in me that I was struggling with. But it also helped me with relating to and accepting the grief I was holding inside. I cannot recommend this movie enough to those who have lost a loved one. I believe if you can't relate to the story, you won't get it's message. This movie is incredible from the visual aspects, to the story, and the message it communicates. Many thanks to the director who struggled to get this movie produced for many years.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	"The Fountain is a transcendental experience. There is only one word to truly describe it: beautiful. It is an absolutely mind-blowing, stunningly beautiful, extremely ambitious, brilliantly acted piece of visual poetry, with a haunting score by Clint Mansell, and one of the most beautiful endings I have ever witnessed in a movie.But on top of that, you have to feel sorry for directorDarren Aronofsky. He envisioned a film with a $75,000,000 budget starring superstars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. After much compromising and bartering on Aronofsky's side, Warner Bros agreed to gamble and finance a $35 million dollar film starringHugh JackmanandRachel Weisz. The Fountain received mixed reviews from critics, and, while it has in later years become something of a cult classic, it did not connect at the box office as well as it should. The Fountain has steadily stayed at a...comfortable...level of obscurity.But I really feel, and I believe I am not alone in my opinions, that The Fountain is a mightily underrated movie and it should be more well known. It is a stunning work of cinema, epic in scope, and ambitious in plot, mind-blowingly complex and beautifully touching in it's human characters.The Fountain tells three stories: each intertwining and moving over eachother, overlapping and affecting the others with the ripples of their character's actions. And the film is driven by the characters. The Fountain, unlike many other special effects-filled science fiction films, has a heartbreakingly human story at it's centre. The story of Thomas/Tommy/Tom's (played to perfection by Hugh Jackman - the line ""Death is a disease - a disease like any other. And there is a cure...a cure - and I will find it!"" is one of my favourites and has stayed with me) neverending quest to beat death and save his beloved; Isabella/Izzy (played beautifully by Oscar winner Rachel Weisz).Needless to say, this leads to obsession, and obsession leads to guilt and worse, but before the end, viewers will be asking, ""Will Thomas find Cibalba? Will he save his love?"" Aronofsky does not disappoint, and he keeps the film on slow-burn tension for the most part until it climaxes in the one of the most stunning, beautiful, haunting, and poignant scenes ever filmed.Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you, but let me just say it involves electrifying acting on the part of Jackman, amazing cinematography, and Clint Mansell's absolutely brilliant score. Did I mention the score? This is a score that will stay with you for the rest of your life; haunting, ethereal, and every other superlative that spells brilliant!The three timelines are not given equal screen time, and all are not entirely seamless. The Fountain can feel like it is being willfully confusing and difficult, and at times feels deliberately slow-moving. Character's motivations occasionally seem strange, and the ending may put casual viewers off the film. This is a movie that must be pondered, mulled over, and given much, ahem, ""intellectual"" thought. This is NOT a film for everyone. However, for the patient, smarter viewer, The Fountain is pure visual poetry.Woven richly with themes biblical, scientific, and mythological; spanning from the close jungles of Peru, to the present day United States, to an age far in the future, we follow a lone conquistador serving his queen, a man determined to cheat death for his wife, and an explorer, alone with a tree in a ""life-bubble"", searching for the mystical city of gold: Cibalba. This is The Fountain. Heartbreaking in it's human tragedy and drama, stunning beautiful in it's visual style and cinematography, challenging and thought-provoking in it's message, and lingering and haunting in the mind forever after.This is The Fountain.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1P8UWGYKBTOZV	"Arbahar ""Brando"""	"After 6 hotly anticipated years, acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky's sprawling sci-fi opus ""The Fountain"" has finally hit the big screen. What may be disconcerting to many of Aronofsky's devoted fans is the barrage of negative criticism that the film has already received. If cinematic history has proven one thing, it is this: motion pictures that suffer from numerous delays and rescheduled release dates often meet a sad and miserable fate. ""The Fountain"" has passed through the murky waters of production hell (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett extricated themselves from the project due to the confusing script), budget cuts (production funding was reduced from a substantial 85 million to a meager 35 million), and critical lambasting (the film was purportedly booed off the screen at Cannes) to find its place and hopefully its rightful audience. Many film buffs and enthusiasts are now forced to ask a series of fiery questions: Was ""The Fountain"" really worth the wait? Is Aronofsky an overrated joke of a film director, destined to become nothing more than a contrasting footnote in Cinema History textbooks of the near future? Those who haven't yet viewed the film may already be disenchanted, but this reviewer is pleased to report that he has never been happier to be so confused by such adverse critical reaction. The reason for this is simple: ""The Fountain"" is anything and everything but a messy, disjointed cinematic garbage heap.It's easy to understand why most audiences could be (and likely will be) turned off by ""The Fountain"" and its demanding plot. The film's structure is by no means conventional (the segmented tales constantly merge with one another instead of unraveling in a traditional linear fashion) and the metaphysical imagery is bound to be misunderstood by viewers who don't exactly process visual metaphor and symbolism with the greatest of ease. The plain truth is that ""The Fountain"" is not an action-adventure flick, but rather a challenging piece of cinematic art. Hollywood has done such an effective job of cramming gigaplexes with chainsaw-wielding maniacs and computer-generated animals that the average filmgoer may have trouble approaching anything that may be in opposition to the norm. It is very uncommon for art films to be applauded because modern audiences are generally not prepared or conditioned to appreciate them. These comments are not meant to be slanderous judgments, nor does this reviewer adhere to the title of condescending snob who thinks the average filmgoer stupid for walking away from a film like ""The Fountain"" in a state of angry befuddlement. The reviewer is simply trying to sympathize with the perplexed and the uninitiated.As for that demanding and convoluted plot, it goes a little something like this: ""The Fountain"" is separated into three different tales that periodically weave in and out of one another. The first tale is set in the 16th Century and centers on fervent Spanish conquistador Tomas Creo (Hugh Jackman) and his tireless quest to discover the mythical Tree of Life, which supposedly exists in the heart of New Spain (aka Central America). Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) lives in constant fear of usurpation by The Grand Inquisitor (Stephen McHattie) and believes that the life-prolonging sap of the legendary tree will give her the strength to maintain control of the monarchy. The second tale takes place in 2006 and revolves around brilliant neuroscientist Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) and his quest to discover a cure for the brain tumor that is steadily consuming the life of his beloved Izzi (Rachel Weisz). Much to the chagrin of his friend and fellow researcher Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn), Tom chooses to obsessively pursue his scientific endeavors instead of accepting the inevitable result of Izzi's debilitating condition. The third (and most visually stunning) tale unfurls in 2500 A.D. and centers around zen-like cosmonaut Tom (Hugh Jackman) and his journey through space to reach Xibalba, a nebula that was once revered by the ancient Mayans as a gate to the afterlife. His transportation device is a spherical craft that houses The Tree of Life as seen in the conquistador tale. As if this setup wasn't already strange enough, Tom is constantly haunted by visual projections of both Queen Isabella and Izzi as he hurls ever forward to his cosmic destination.As the film progresses, a multitude of mysterious questions arise: Is ""The Fountain"" meant to be perceived as a continuous story of one man's thousand year pilgrimage through time and space? Is each tale meant to be viewed as a detailed visual metaphor for each corresponding story? Is ""The Fountain"" trying to say something about the mysteries of life or evolutionary transmutation? The reviewer would be doing himself, Aronofsky, and any potential viewer a great injustice by revealing the answers to these various questions. What the reviewer will state is that ""The Fountain"" is not so much an exploration of life as it is a fascinating treatise on mankind's fear and avoidance of natural laws, notably that of death and decomposition.And yet, underneath the thick layer of this predominant philosophical leaning, ""The Fountain"" manages to ballast itself as a poignant and deeply moving romance. Even viewers who may feel battered and bruised by Aronofsky's cerebral switch-hitter of a storyline will likely be brought to tears by his depiction of the tragic purity of Tom and Izzi's emotional connection. There is a beautiful scene where Tom makes love to Izzi in their bathtub that seems a bit too perfect to transpire without dire effect. Since Izzi is afflicted with an inoperable brain tumor, it is easy to guess what that dire effect may be. The consequences of this event reverberate in Aronofsky's tale of the future. It is here that Tom's obsessive and seemingly foolhardy actions become a testament to the immutable grandeur of an undying, everlasting love.Some critics would say that a love story is only as good as the actors who carry it.  Well, as good as Rachel Weisz's is (and she is admittedly top notch), the intriguing love story ultimately succeeds as a result of Hugh Jackman's award-worthy turn as the three leads. It is quite easy to see why Jackman is considered to be one of the finest stage actors of his generation. Portraying three different characters in one film is difficult enough for any professional actor, but his command of each is at times so profluent as to appear almost effortless. The span of his emotional range is impeccable: Tomas the conquistador is reckless, courageous, zealous and fiercely loyal, while Tom the neuroscientist is doleful, tormented, restless and impossibly determined. These various qualities braid together in the form of Jackman's futuristic cosmonaut who discovers that real transcendence is the act of facing death itself, emotionally shattered and delusional as a result of his troubled past and present position. Every moment is convincing due to Jackman's obvious affection for the material, his passion deeply felt through every tormented glance, every emotional outburst, and every stream of teardrops.In addition to the weight of Jackman's incredible performance, ""The Fountain"" boasts one of the most unique and mysterious film score compositions heard in quite some time. Aronofsky worked with composer Clint Mansell and his accompanying Kronos Quartet on ""Requiem For a Dream"", an ominous string and synth-based musical outing that somehow seemed more disturbing than the film's imagery. Mansell has taken a big step forward this time around by combining his efforts with those of the Scottish cult band Mogwai. They supply a generous amount of piano, drum beats, and out-of-tune guitar riffs to give ""The Fountain"" a more exotic and cabalistic resonance, the end result being a far more visceral musical experience than it otherwise may have been. Audiences will feel this film score creeping around inside of them more than they will actually hear it. The music could almost be considered experimental were it not so masterfully realized.While the subject of mind-blowing originality is still hot on the plate, a few things should be mentioned about the wondrous look of ""The Fountain"". Maybe the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should create an honorary Oscar for Best Utilization of Visual Effects for films such as this. At no point during ""The Fountain"" does Aronofsky use his special CG and micro-photographic environments to further the installation of whizz-bang action scenes or bombastic explosions. At their worst, these mesmerizing sequences could be considered high-class ocular candy. The splendor of these effects-laden scenes is only further enhanced by cinematographer Matthew Libatique's incessant use of burnt yellows and ethereal hues. These dominant colors primarily seem to represent emotional decay and spiritual grace while simultaneously bolstering the thematic moods of life, death, and transformation. These combined aspects give the film a very distinct and immediate visual profundity that just doesn't seem to exist much in the world of modern cinema anymore. More simply, ""The Fountain"" is one of the most beautiful looking (and most artistically rendered) films ever to grace the silver screen.With so many positive things to say about ""The Fountain"", one may wonder why it received such a negative reaction from mainstream critics. Most of these critics claimed that ""The Fountain"" is simply too difficult to comprehend, that it is more of an arduous task than an enjoyable film experience. Another widespread critical complaint is that Aronofsky's tale of the future only succeeds in making the storyline more confusing than it was to begin with. Possibly, but this reviewer begs a question: ""Where has the spirit and beauty of artistic interpretation gone?"" What's amazing about ""The Fountain"" is that the viewer can interpret the various tales in a number of different ways. This makes every successive viewing not only more interesting, but decidedly more enlightening. Most critics are only allowed to see a motion picture once before writing or giving a review. If they had watched ""The Fountain"" a second time, maybe their perception of the film would be slightly different.Contrary to popular belief, ""The Fountain"" is not ""a noble, shipwrecked folly (Ty Burr, The Boston Globe)"" or a ""plodding, existential muddle (Dehzda Mountz, E! Online)"", nor is it a ""bold attempt by a young filmmaker to cram everything he knows onto the screen at one time (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times)"". If anything, ""The Fountain"" is proof that Darren Aronofsky is one of the finest and most refreshingly intelligent filmmakers of his generation. With a mere three films under his belt, one can only imagine what this wunderkind will accomplish next. ""The Fountain"" is one of the most fascinating and powerful science fiction films since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and is consequently the absolute best film of 2006.FINAL GRADE: A+"	5.0	"In Awe of Death: Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" is a film for the ages."	2006-12-17	24	19	5

Some of the images, breathtaking. As far as the narrative, it is not your drab, formula-driven, 3-act, Hollywood vehicle. It is thought-provoking and original.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A31ZC70NX3WJUI	"Arjun Kumar Ganjoo ""Visor27"""	I randomly found this movie on amazon prime instant stream, Hugh Jackman's name in the casting caught my eye as I admire his work in action and sci-fi movies like X-men, Wolverine, But I gave this a try. To my surprise this movie was a wonderful journey that showed me:-1. Theater and Art are still alive and doing what they were meant to do, i.e. creatively deliver a message, and this movie in every second of it does it so very beautifully.2. It delivers a message about Love and what drives the intent of our lives and the various forms we take there in, to reach our resolve (goal of life or the spirit-the knowledge), which we may have made intentionally or un intentionally, in this life or the previous ones.3. It beautifully dictates as well as illustrates in the story the emotional bonds and the value that it brings in our respective resolve(goal of life or the spirit-the knowledge).4. Finally, showed me that where there is death, there is life and death is the manifestation of a new life.I highly recommend this movie to any one who understands true theater and art with a meaning or a message. If you are some one who thinks theater or art to be mere visually appealing ways of entertainment then this movie is not for you.This movie is SLOW, MEANINGFUL and a Delight to those who have seen and experienced their life in the cradles of joy, melancholy and peace (devoid of joy or melancholy)I highly recommend this movie to all intelligent, spiritual and experienced minds.thank you for reading.	5.0	A Masterpiece that grows every second in your head like a Tree of Life.	2012-12-23	2	2	0

Aronofsky's choice was brilliant in having the same two main actors portraying the central characters for each story, imo it's what made the film a whole. it certainly isn't for the mainstream or the bourgeoisie. if you enjoy films that are more ""untraditional"" by hollywood standards, or visual arthouse, then this is definitely worth checking out."	5.0	a visual masterpiece	2007-03-12	3	2	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AZ5T9WY670KYD	Audra Alexander	"In stark contrast to the realistic hopefulness ofChildren of Men (Widescreen Edition)comes The Fountain, a Darren Aronofsky film about the transcendence of death. I saw Aronofsky's other works, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, so I knew what I was in for in The Fountain; deliberately challenging visuals, elite performances and stylized storytelling. And again, as a fan of science fiction, I thought Aronofsky's unique vision would bring the duality of science and spirituality together successfully. This movie has a lot going for it, but I wouldn't call it a ""success"".The Fountain was billed as a love story that crosses a thousand years, and technically, I suppose that's true. We open on a Spanish Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) in love with his queen (Rachel Weisz) who is threatened by the Spanish Inquisition. Move to present day drug developer, Tommy (Jackman), in love with his wife, Lizzie (Weisz), threatened by an inoperable brain tumor. Move to futuristic ""space traveler"" (Jackman) in love with a tree (Weisz) threatened by the movie's exhausting length and painful stretch of our suspension of disbelief.  Though do not let me suggest that the film moved even half as coherently as the above synopsis.The Fountain has appealing visual elements which are all the more amazing when you understand that it was not in the finance-league of huge CGI productions. From a purely cinematography standpoint, it's quite amazing. The stars, also, have that silver-screen chemistry that is part luck and part talented professionals doing a fine job. Not to be missed is Ellen Burstyn's grounded performance as Jackman's boss in the present-day storyline. Speaking of storyline, what could be more ambitious or romantic than following love through death? It has all the elements of a fantastic sci-fi romance, but none of the subtlety.The visual elements may be a talented technical feat, but the metaphorical use of those visuals to promote the story are somewhat less so, at some points becoming embarrassing parodies of 1960's cinema, only without the considered and sparing use in those films. The disjointed method of bouncing back and forth between timelines was made ineffective by continuously flashing the revelatory scenes from beginning to end, robbing them of their impact. At one point, Hugh Jackman's glowing, bald, lotus-position form becomes so cringe-inducing you half expect David Carradine to jump up and protest. The opening ""historical"" story line is rife with inaccuracies which aren't explained until much later to be a fictional construct of the characters. Hugh Jackman's emoting is filmed with a heavy-handedness that makes him somewhat less sympathetic rather than more.I love the idea of showing three stories, or viewpoints, congruently. It allows the storyteller to clearly illustrate the common thematic element, in this case the ""Tree of Life"", both as a mythical and spiritual symbol. This idea works marvelously for the historical and present-day storylines as an example of the transformative powers of death; i.e. energy is never lost, only transformed, but by the end of the picture, I felt as though I'd been bludgeoned with the idea by one of it's thicker branches. I know there are people out there who will claim that I'm an ignorant clod who just didn't ""get"" it, or appreciate Aronofsky's work. On the contrary, I did get it. The message was potentially as beautiful as it was powerful: the only way to defeat death is to accept it. I just wonder why Aronofsky felt he had to force-feed the idea to us with pseudo-enlightened, hyped-up metaphysical imagery and refined pretentiousness?"	3.0	Beautiful idea obscured by pretentious storytelling	2007-05-27	5	3	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1DZU4AQR7KD9R	Axton Blessendon, Jr.	"""The Fountain""(Warner Brothers, 2006)---------------------------------------Hugh Jackman stars in this trippy, oooh-pretty! modern parable about mankind's struggle between impending death and eternal life.  He plays Dr. Thomas Creo, a high-level scientific researcher racing against time to find a cure for his wife's cancer. He is anchored to the real world by a medical bureaucracy that insists on verifiable results and replicable experiments, while what he wants is a magical breakthrough. Meanwhile, while pursuing love, he loses sight of humanity, and the magic he seeks unfolds in parallel plotlines and luminous, cosmic sequences in which his spiritual form ascends into the stars, learning how acceptance and sacrifice lead to what we mortal beings can consider immortality.  The groovy, hippie-ish mystic/meditation scenes won't resonate with all audiences, but for many viewers this story will recall the cosmic yearnings of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" as well as the disconnected hallucinations of ""Jacob's Ladder.""  The plot here is not as oblique or hard to follow, but the sentiment is similar: what's not clear, however, is how much director Darren Aronofsky is urging the human race to evolve, or how much he is saying that this very quest -- to be more than we really are -- is quixotic and doomed to fail, much like the conquistador's search for a fountain of youth.  Visionary or fatalistic? Perhaps a mixture of both?  Viewers will have to decide for themselves. (Axton)"	4.0	A psychedelic fairy tale	2011-06-04	2	1	1

Focused on life, death and rebirth. Takes place over three separate time periods; Past, in which we are taken to Spain during the inquisition & discoveries in &#34;New Spain&#34; including a search for the tree of life. Present, where protagonist is trying to cure his wife's tumor but instead discovers immortality, which ultimately leads him to the future where he and the tree of life travel into a nebula to be reborn. Themes of being in the now vs. planning for the future, death, life, and the meaning of it all were well intertwined.Quality fo Blueray was hindered by darkness of scenes - lacking the usual punch of blueray films.

However, after a while, all the events seem to come together and flow with the story.  It's one of those movies that takes a lot of time and patience to understand.It's a story about living forever.  Or rather, trying desperately to find a way to live forever, through a series of fairy tale events and strange happenings.  The acting is really good, the story is interesting, and the magical feeling of living forever is a great touch.  I recommend it.	4.0	one amazing journey	2008-08-08	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3KUEXN9M9FOMH	billy	The Fountain definitely looks nice, but the movie has a whole bunch of other problems that makes this movie pretentious and a bit obtuse.First off, the way Aronofsky approached filming this movie was just horribly pretentious.  What's with all the extreme closeups of Hugh Jackman's mouth, the walls of an elevator, and the side of Rachel Weiz's head?  And all the upside down motion shots also got on my nerves.Second, the story seems very hollow.  It's an interesting premise, but the love stories throughout the various time periods,(or inside of Jackman's head, I couldn't really tell) seem very banal and uninteresting.  Maybe it was the actors involved, but I just didn't get in to the alleged emotion of the whole thing.This story is also devoid of any humor whatsoever.  If you make a movie like this, with heavy themes about love and death, perhaps a break in the monotony might have been useful.  The closest thing to comic relief is the monkey Donovan, which is funny if your in to that kind of thing.The best part of the movie is the visuals.  The visuals with the space travel are very creative and well imagined as well as the visuals of 16th century Spain.But being pretty does not make a good movie.  The Fountain has too many problems to be recommended to a casual movie fan.  If your a die hard Aronofsky fan, then go for it.  But if your not, then avoid this.	2.0	Very Flawed But Beautiful Movie	2006-11-26	12	1	11

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3TUNGAU37KSQI	Billy Pilgrim	I have finally gotten around to watching Darren Aronofsky's latest film 'The Fountain' (originally titled 'The Last Man'). I had heard that this film was, according to Aronofsky, something that he had been 'building up' to since his stunningly 'toxic' 'Requiem for a Dream' and while 'The Fountain' is 'light years' away from 'Requiem' (although Aronofsky continues to employ the 'focus' of the eye, both interior and exterior in both films), it certainly expands upon Aronofsky's creative visual scope and his determination as a director to involve his actors in the physicality (and just as crucial in the 'mentality') of their roles.According to the major critiques on this site, the majority of the reviewers didn't 'understand' the film, and I would gather that part of that is the intentional visual effects that Aronofsky has utilized through the multiple 'allusive' aspects 'contained' in The Fountain'. This is shown in Aronofsky's repeated questioning of the issues of time, and the 'limitations' of the human condition (that we are 'bound' in a mortal body with a 'linear' conception of our life). I have read some comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky's films, particularly 'Solaris', and I would agree that Aronofsky is closer to 'approximating' the interior/exterior 'visual reflections' of time, space and spirituality that Tarkovsky envisioned, not only in 'Solaris', but in all of his films. Many people do not 'get' or 'understand' Tarkovsky's cinematic vision either as it was not intended to supply firm answers (or definitive conclusions) towards these themes, as he was more interested in exploring their poetic possibilities in film and questioning the 'reality' of the world of the characters (which is a 'reflection' of how we emplace and view these 'realities' also).While I am not yet ready to place Aronofsky on the same 'cinematic plane' as Tarkovsky, 'The Fountain' certainly deserves to be recognized as a creative, ambitious cinematic 'accounting' of a meld of 'science-fiction' and human spirituality. After watching the film on DVD, I have to say I am disappointed that I did not see 'The Fountain' on the big screen, because visually its effects are astoundingly hypnotic and beautiful. One bonus to viewing the DVD 'version' is that I learned that the visual effects, the nebulous backgrounds, were created by shooting micro-photos of reactive substances in a Petri dish (which were then merged onto the film) rather than using computer-generated imagery, which allowed my admiration for Aronofsky's visual attention to the overall 'scheme' within 'The Fountain' to expand even further. These applications within 'The Fountain' of physical and visual 'chemical reactions' also put me in mind (or is that sight?) of the great independent American filmmaker Stan Brakhage's creative use of elemental compounds within his cinematic 'explorations'.I have been speaking of Aronofsky's cinematic scope or broad explorations of the human conception of time, space (in which our bodies occupy), and spirituality in 'The Fountain' and while the film 'seems' to go to many realms, (16th century Spain, 'present' laboratories, 'outer space'), what is visually `contained' as the 'primary focus' in the film are the two main characters Thomas (Hugh Jackman), and Izzy (Rachel Weisz). Indeed, it is through the 'states' of these characters that the film is 'imagined', as Izzy has composed a story (imagining Thomas as the Conquistador?), and Thomas (through reading and hearing it) is 'imagining' it (and attempting to 'finish' it). My interpretation of this film is Thomas's struggle with accepting Izzy's mortal state, and therefore attempting to 'bring her back' by a 'journey' that is portrayed in the outer/inner reaches of time and space (this is particularly pronounced in the films lighting 'entrances' from light to dark and vice versa). Since he cannot accomplish 'conquering' Izzy's mortal fate through science, he 'reaches' (in an interior 'vision') to the myths of religion (symbolized in the Tree, the lotus posture). In the 'end' we see Thomas physically letting go, and burying the seed at Izzy's grave (a larger reference to the sphere i.e. world) that will (may?) continue the cycle of life.The only reason I have given this film four stars is that while I believed Hugh Jackman gave an outstanding performance (particularly in  'sacrificing' his musculature and his hair), I thought that Rachel Weisz's performance was shaky in parts of the film. I still believe that Aronofsky 'pulled' the best out of her role (which is evident if you watch her in the featurette's 'takes'). All together this is a beautiful, inventive example of American filmmaking by Aronofosky and if he did not make another film after 'The Fountain' (hopefully this will not be the case) it would 'stand' as his cinematic masterpiece.	4.0	'The Last Man' resurected as 'The Fountain' (spoilers embedded!)	2008-08-10	1	1	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1FF5MA9HVYDTQ	Birdie	This is movie is beyond amazing once you understand what's going on. First off, this movie is slow pace and non linear and a large amount of people will not like it for these reasons. It may take several play backs to connect the dots. The movie takes on three different scenarios dealing with the same concept. That's all I'll mention about the film itself. The performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are phenomenal. The visuals are just as crazy awesome as the film. Definitely a movie that needs to be seen in high definition. Not to mention the fantastic score that adds along to everything else. Aronofsky has managed to create an intriguing and well thought out work and Hugh Jackman commits to the role completely. Worthy to own for those people that enjoy movies that aren't straight forward with a cliche ending.	5.0	Stunning if you understand it	2010-06-14	6	3	3

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A20IIR0422G3A5	"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold"""	"My first sense that this film was misconceived when I realized that although the title cited the famed ""Fountain of Youth"", the destination of the quest in all three segments of the film was a tree and not a fountain. That's all well and good, since there is far more mythic baggage attached to trees than to fountains, but still, the title leads down a dark ally, into a cul-de-sac, were we never find that fountain.I think the sense that this film is highly original is misplaced. The three part story, with past, present, and future, all tied up in a quest, is as old as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", which was so entrancing that I went to see it three times on the first weekend it opened in theaters. What we saw was clearly an important film, lovingly crafted, with a level of realism unknown in space operas before or since (although I hear the film ""Gravity"" may have matched it.) The theme was hidden, but it was evident that it was important to figure out what that theme was. The transition between eras, past, present, and future, was seamless and done with stunning clarity, with no ""interleaving"" of events from the three.The theme of ""The Fountain"" comes to us very slowly, and with obscure connections between the clues. An example of another film which botched flashbacks is ""Catch-22"" and the story of the airman dying on the damaged B-25. It never quite works. It seems as if there are so many loose ends. Unlike 2001, where the connection between the present and future main character (pilot, David Bowman)is crystal clear, in ""The Fountain"", the connection is less like a distinct chronology and transition from man to star-child, than simply a parallel story line with some similarities between characters played by Jackman and Weisz in the present and future.Something in me screams that ""I should like this film!"" But, alas, it seems like a valiant effort which lost its way. I will add that for that reason, the supplementary special feature on the DVD, on the making of the film, is essential. I simply would not have gotten the point of some aspects of the film without that documentary. (Among other things, it shows that Hugh Jackman did indeed have his head shaved for some scenes. He was not wearing a skull cap.)"	3.0	Three threads, which never quite came together.	2013-10-06	1	0	1

It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see ""yet another"" science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petrie dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi?The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together. Their dedication to one another is palpable, and when Izzi sits near death's doorstep, you can feel Tomas' overwhelming need to save her, his beloved for all time.So it's time to haul your spouse/girlfriend/significant other kicking and screaming into the theater again. And they'll love you for it later. Perhaps you might even ""get lucky"" after the film..."	5.0	Attention Sci-Fi Geeks: Take Your Women To See This Flick!	2006-12-08	5	4	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2AA00U9FO4UAC	Bradley J. Keusch	"Aronofsky's thoughts on the nature of life and death certainly do not disappoint. I'm shocked, however, that the studio chose to release this film on thanksgiving weekend to little fanfare, where it will almost certainly get slaughtered. At any rate, the film is great and flirts with being tremendous. Matthew Libatique's cinematography never fails to be anything less than breathtaking, and it certainly is here. There are striking, majestic images, and the film truly does look amazing. The film uses silence to great effect, but when Clint Mansell's score does show up, it is fitting and powerful as well. Jackman's performance I thought was strong, and is certainly light years away from his turn as Wolverine in X-men. After seeing the film I can't really imagine Brad Pitt playing this part, as he was originally intended to. That being said, this certainly isn't a movie for everyone, and is probably less accessible than either Pi or Requiem. For those who might not quite ""get it"", the following is my interpretation of the film, with **SPOILERS**.The film's theme, at it's very heart, is that holding desperately onto life can lead only to death, while accepting death as a form of life and creation, can make life come alive. There are three story lines, the only one that may really be ""real"" is the one in the present, but it doesn't matter much as they all end up saying the same thing. In the present, Jackman's wife Izzy has brain cancer and is on her way out, and he is a doctor studying cancer treatments, desperately trying to find one that will save her. All through their interaction in the present, he is obsessed with holding onto her, with finding a way to make her live. He ignores things that she says in conversation, focusing only on the things that he think may allow her to live. He is absolutely terrified about her impending doom. At one point while he is in a hospital room with her, he even exclaims ""I just want to be with you!"" and her reply to this is ""You ARE with me, right now!"" But his obsession with finding some way to prolong her life blinds him to most everything else (one notable scene illustrating this is when he walks down the road to a completely silent audio track, even as ambulances drive by with sirens flashing), even to his remaining time with her. What leads to his eventual liberation is what Izzy found so fascinating, and even wrote her story on, the Mayan mythology. Their creation story contains the ""first man"" who sacrificed himself in order to create the world. It is a common theme throughout all mythology across all cultures, life out of death. There cannot be life without death. We come from the earth, our bodies are built out of it, and when we die we return to it so that new forms can be created. Stars are formed from accumulations of gases and dust, and when they explode with unbelievable grandeur, they spew these components out into the void, where they will form new stars. Izzy was able to find peace in this notion, that her life and death were part of the great mystery of life, and she was able to identify with this great cosmic energy that pervades everything. Jackman's character cannot accept this, and he decries death as a disease, which he will work to cure. But in the end, this is fruitless. Man cannot live forever, and what's more, even if it WERE possible, it would serve only to rob life of its meaning. He realizes this, as in the final chapter of Izzy's book, he has the conquistador taste the sap of the tree, and he then immediately returns to the earth. In this sense he can ""live forever"", but not in the way that he had hoped as his consciousness perishes. In the future (which to me seemed like a generalization of the present storyline, i.e. the tree of life dying wasn't JUST Izzy dying, but represented life in general) the Jackman character laughs when, after the tree has died, he realizes that he too will finally perish. As the star explodes, we see him rise upwards, identifying with the fact that he will die, and thus transcending it, even AS he dies. And the tree of life blooms as he disentegrates into it, life out of death once again.I would like to quote one of my friends who I think summed the concept up brilliantly: ""these things point the way to reveling in and revering the passions we experience in life. In the spirit of these revels, we are engaged, connected, conscious, and wholly (and holy-ly) participating in the moment rather than scheming on how we can prolong, guard, or perpetually keep the moment, all for ourselves (eternal exclusivity being the province of ego), never allowing change to transmute these pinnacles of human-ness we are fortunate enough to find ourselves experiencing. In the words of another wise teacher, ""Love is the middle way between attachment and detachment."" If we are living from, in, and with love, where will we find the need to hold on, to form an attachment, when we are surrounded, enveloped, and fully part of an energy that is exponentially more powerful?"" and thus, why should we be afraid of death. This is why Jackman goes back, and chooses to spend time with his wife, choosing to life his life NOW. This is, in the end, all that we can do, and by recognizing that we WILL die, and identifying with that, EVERY moment that we DO have, necessarily becomes so important, becomes truly alive.Definitely check this film out, and if you enjoy it, spread the word. Pi and Requiem signaled the arrival of a major talent in Aronofsky, but after The Fountain I positively cannot wait to see what he does next."	5.0	A moving treatise on the nature of life and death	2006-11-29	14	11	3

He is a true photographer/cinematographer, and most productions would be lucky to have him in that capacity.The problem, to me, is the story or lack thereof in which that great visual art is in service.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" was an afterschool special.  And ""The Fountain"" is simply a muddled, manipulative mess that will have you reaching for the fast-forward button.  ""The Fountain"" moves so slowly that it makes ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" seem like ""Die Hard.""  The story and plot are nonexistent, which allow you the viewer to project any plot onto it that you like.  If you're into that sort of thing, that's cool.  Hey, I decided to pretend that the whole movie was the post-death ""moving toward the light"" experience of that guy who died near that beginning - it's ""Carnival of Souls,"" if you will, but with 10,000 times bigger of a budget and 1% of the entertainment.Many reviewers below contend that if you don't like this movie, you're stupid.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2R7XZMO43HKE1	Brian Auger	"This is Darren Aronofsky's third feature film. It is both his most complex, and most rewarding. Each of Aronofsky's films deals with the theme of man trying to harness and control powers greater than himself, with unforeseen consequences. In ""PI"", men try to discover the hidden name of God. Some do it for lust of money, some for lust of power, and some for lust of knowledge. When the main character discovers the name of God, the knowledge destroys him. In ""Requiem For A Dream"" the various characters seek fulfillment and realization of their dreams through drugs. Each has a different dream, and a different drug. Each is unable to control their addiction, and is ultimately destroyed by it.In Fountain, Aronofsky returns to a theme similar to PI, namely man's quest for cosmic knowledge. Knowledge is contained within the tree of life, which is the fountain from which both knowledge and life flow from. Unlike PI, the quest for knowledge is driven by altruistic goals. There are three simultaneous stories, woven together. They represent the past, present, and future. Each is played by Hugh Jackman. In the past, the conquistador is seeking the physical presence of the tree of life, in order to save his queen. He reaches his goal through bloodshed. A noble goal but a flawed way of reaching it. His punishment is that he is absorbed by the tree. He is now immortal, but not in the form he was anticipating.In the present, the cancer researcher is struggling to unlock the molecular mysteries of an extract from the tree of life. He is doing this in part to save his wife from the tumor which is growing in her brain. But he is also driven by a lust to unlock the secrets of immortality. His lust for this knowledge is at times greater than his love for his wife. He at times ignores her. His punishment is that he succeeds in saving a monkey from a brain tumor, but his discovery comes too late to save his wife's life. She dies before he can use the treatment on her. The wife instinctively understands aspects of the secret of life which her scientist husband does not. She bequeaths a book to him for which he will have to write the ending. He will have to discover the truth on his own.In the future, man's pollution is causing the tree to die. The main character is both monk and astronaut. He is trying to deliver the tree to a impending supernova, where both the tree, and life will be reborn. He succeeds, but is himself destroyed by the process.This is the most visually compelling movie I have seen. It Aronofsky's best work, but like all of Aronofsky's films, not for everyone."	5.0	Aronovsky Most Complex And Most Rewarding	2007-06-24	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	Where does one begin with a film such as the mind-boggling '06 film `The Fountain?' After viewing this extremely esoteric, non-linear journey through time and space one is left in a vague stupor, experiencing feelings of deep spirituality and unfathomable profundity all wrapped in a timeless universe of eternal beginnings and endings. Either that or one is bored out of their mind.Fortunately for me I fall into the first category.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2VCC9UVM30151	Brian Martin	"Reading the reviews posted here it seems everyone interprets the imagery in this movie differently. Reading some of the reviews that give it 5 shining stars and prattle on how ""deep"" and ""meaningful"" subtle imagery over subtle effects with underlying deep hidden messages is just a another way of saying the story was told poorly. Now I'm not one who doesn't like to be challenged  or made to think when watching a movie, but a movie is meant to tell a story, not make me invent my own reasons for what's happening on screen.Some things just needed clarification no matter how ""deep"" you think the meaning was. For instance, I initially thought the ""bubble"" hugh jackman was cruising around in was his sub-conscious or something, not himself 500 years in a future spaceship. If the director had just put one futuristic scene of tommy boarding this ""spaceship"" it would have clarified an untold amount of murkiness in what was happening. Like were they really in ancient spain or was that just figament of Izzy's book she was writing? You never really know, which is what I guess movies like this want you to think, but if I'm going to waste 2 hours of my life on something which ultimatly boils down to my imagination, i'll read a book or create my own imagery on the computer.One thing that saves this movie is the imagery and ambient music that it uses to tell the tail.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2DT45TD3KK2O0	Brock	"I find that a lot of my favorite movies have a polarizing effect on the audience. People either love them or hate them - but they rarely give lukewarm reviews about them. I think this is the case with THE FOUNTAIN. I'm going to guess that maybe half the people who have seen it couldn't stand it.I'm not going to try to change your mind if you have already seen the film, but I will suggest that if you haven't seen it you should definitely put it on your list. Because if THE FOUNTAIN does strike a chord in you, it will resonate deep, and it will stay with you.---------------SPOILERS below...At the core of this beautiful film is a very simple love story. Izzi (Rachel Weisz) has a brain tumor and she's dying. Her husband, Tommy (Hugh Jackman), is a doctor and he's searching for a cure to save her. From the very beginning of the movie we see that Izzi has already let go, and she just wants to cherish the moments they have left together. She no longer sees death as an end, but as ""the road to awe"" as she mentions several times. Tommy cannot grasp her new ""understanding"" of death, and he's nowhere near ready to let go of her. He desperately spends most of his time in the lab doing research, hoping to find a modern day Fountain of Youth.Outside of that, a great deal of the film takes place within the novel Izzi is writing - and this is probably where the movie loses a lot of people. Tommy is the star of her novel: the Spanish Conquistador searching for the Tree of Life, and later, the pilot of bubble-shaped spaceship on its way to Xibalba, a nebula in the Orion constellation that, in ancient Mayan culture, represented ""the underworld"" (death).Her novel is for Tommy. It's her way of showing him the realizations she has come to about life and death. She charges him with writing the last chapter - how the book will end. And through writing this last chapter, he is able to find peace in not only Izzi's death, but also in the inevitability of his own.---------------END SPOILERS...If you take the heart of the story at face value and ignore the visuals, the movie has more in common with THE NOTEBOOK than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But writer/director Darren Aronofsky had the guts to try to make BOTH of those films wrapped up into one. And I think he succeeded. Put that together with a fantastic score by Mogwai, Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, and THE FOUNTAIN is not just a movie - it's an experience."	5.0	Death is the road to awe	2007-05-17	12	9	3

This film is, from beginning to end, a masterpiece on every scale. The acting, casting, soundtrack, classic story of love, loss and acceptance, all done far more amazing than has ever been done before. Hugh Jackman proves that behind the wolverine there is a real actor who is capable of showing emotion beyond ""you picked the wrong house, bub."" Rachel Weisz does a superb job as well portraying the cancer ridden wife of an oncologist(oh the irony.) And Clint Mansell's score, for lack of a better term, MAKES ME WET!! My friends and I watched this movie one night and among the 15 or so people in the room, only about 5 of us understood it. I was absolutely shocked by the amount of confusion ranging from ""i dont get it"" to ""was the space part supposed to be him in the future?"" I was absolutely pissed! The 5 of us who understood the film can converse intelligently about The Fountain, but if the subject comes up around the other 10... well, the less said, the better. In short, this movie is an amazing piece of cinema that will never be seen as what it is.

If I had to sum this movie up I would call it the most tragic, Buddhist love story I have ever had the privilege to watch. However, there is no way to ""sum up"" this film. It is a true work of art.Aronofsky brings us two lovers bound by the ages one of whom is on a quest for immortality (and not necessarily for himself) teaching us that only through letting go of life may we find life eternal. Brought unto the tree of life we drink greedily. Beating in the breast of our lover find our own hearts. Knowing oneself is the mystery uncovered and in doing so find yourself in another.Does this sound confusing? It is painfully simple.Live. Love. Nurture. Die. Be born again.Through the centuries two lovers entwined. Through astounding imagery we transcend.This film is not to be watched, but experienced.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2W0XLKPO91MPN	C. Bannon	If you like abstract, creative, fantasy and science fiction, but also emotional thought provocation, you will like this movie. If you want a cookie-cutter happily ever after ending, then you won't find it here. It has a much deeper meaning that deals with intense love and the reality of death. I feel it is extremely creative with the overlapping worlds/time periods, which serve to tell about the deeper emotion the characters are feeling about each other and the circumstances they are in. Personally, I love allegorical stories, and very much enjoyed how this one was written and meshed together towards the end. It IS a story about strong love, but some may see it as depressing. If you want an easy, simple, action or romance film, this may not be the one for you. If you want to think and you like to mull over meanings, or perhaps you have artistic interest you may like it. As usual, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz gave amazing performances. I gave it one star short of a perfect 5 because it is spiritually ambiguous and doesn't portray the truth about eternal life; life after death. But in all honesty, I don't think the movie is meant to reveal any spiritual truth except the reality of death in this world. The vehicle of various religions and beliefs I believe is just meant to show that human nature is always seeking for answers, creating religions, and that God has put [the desire of] eternity in the heart of mankind. I hope this helps you decide to watch it or not. The other reviews helped me decide, and I liked it.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A6DOCZ10B7JAJ	"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere"""	"I read the graphic novel extracted from the brilliant mind of Darren Aronofsky, who previously directed Pi, Requiem for a Dream.  He mentioned how The Fountain almost never made it to the big screen because it was a big budget project that lacked mass public appeal.  I know I was flabbergasted when this artistic masterpiece was pulled from my local theater after one week.  Alas, I had to wait for the DVD, but was glad it didn't disappoint.This is a romantic sci-fi journey that explores the existential constraints of the human spirit.  The story orbits around the present day, stretching ostensibly into the past and the future.  It floats around through time and space, spreading throughout the millenium that engulfs us.It involves three seperate stories from three different eras.  Each adventure is connected by the same character, Hugh Jackman, in which his bodily form apparently is reincarnated.In each tale the protagonist is obssessd with the pursuit of immortality.  Each quest is geared toward the ""Tree of Life"" from the Garden of Eden.  Jackman plays a 16th century conquistador, a present day cancer researcher, and a 26th century astronaut.This movie is imbued with all sorts of dazzling, imaginative special effects that give it quite a surreal feel.  It's both intellectual and emotional.  It raises a glaring question about our humanity, which seems to be defined both by our life and especially our death.  If death is taken out of the equation, would we lose our humanity?Parts of this movie can be confusing and hard to follow.  But I have an interpretation that makes sense to me, although it might not be what is intended.  I view the entire movie as if it takes place in the present day, and the leaps backward and foward in time are merely the imaginary story that the ailing wife(Rachel Weisz)is writing as she is dying from cancer.  I really like that idea, but I might be way off.Anyway, this is a beautiful movie, strongly reccommended if you're looking for something different."	5.0	"""Death is a disease.

Eberlein	It took a second viewing for me to finally understand and completely fall under the magic spell The Fountain leaves on its audience.  Like most people, I was confused but this film possesses an aspect most cannot comprehend at first (which is why I recommend watching it once or twice again before throwing judgement)--instead of presenting a straightforward plot (beginning, middle, end), The Fountain uses an intellectual, but confusing story focused on two love-entwined people throughout time.  The acting is superb and extremely moving, and the blazing nebula finale is sure to be written down in the books for being one of the most beautiful film creations to date.  The music, composed by Clint Mansell, adds to the magic of The Fountain, especially at the end in which Tommy From The Future finally reaches the rebirthing nebula somewhere far in the galaxy and is reborn with his love Izzy, represented here in the form of a dying tree (I know, it sounds bogus but watch the movie!); this startlingly lovely scene, combined with the music, will bring anyone with a soul to tears.

It is a jewel that weaves together drama, spirituality, mystery, and sheer wonder like very few others, and I hope will be more widely acclaimed in the future.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2NJRBJFBTF54A	Charles Camp	The Fountain doesn't live up to the absolute mastery of Requiem for a Dream or Black Swan, but it's definitely a thoughtful, intriguing movie with plenty of interesting ideas. The cinematography and score are both absolutely superb, but I unfortunately can't say the same for the characters or the plot. Aronofsky's attempt at a millennium-spanning tale is definitely admirable, but the story buckles a bit under the weight of its own ambition and all three time threads never quite coalesce into the revelatory climax he's striving for. Also, the film veers into melodrama a bit too much for my liking- it's sometimes successful in delivering powerful moments, but other times feel a bit like overstatement.Overall though, those select powerful moments as well as the impressive visuals, resonant score, and thoughtful musings on the intertwinement of life and death are definitely enough to keep the movie on its feet. It's just a shame that it never really ends up walking anywhere.	3.0	Stands tall on its lovely visuals, brooding score, and grand themes, but ultimately fails to take many steps.	2014-03-29	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2LOYJCA4SY6QE	Chris	"The Fountain had a lot of troubles in its pre-production stages.  The film was initially going to have a large budget and star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  It ended up being quite low budget and starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz.  It was also a bit of a commercial failure, however it is a well-loved film by many and I count myself as one of them.  I personally think the version of the film we ended up with is far better than what it would have been if all had gone to plan.The Fountain takes place in three different time periods, but Hugh Jackman is common to all of them.  In the earliest, Jackman plays a Conquistador named Tom&aacute;s, who works for the Queen of Spain, played by Weisz.  Tom&aacute;s is on a mission to find the tree of eternal life from the Mayan legend.In the present day, Jackman plays Tommy who is a medical engineer desperately trying to find a cure for his wife, played by Weisz, who is dying of a brain tumor.  The love story aspect of the film here is simply brilliant and not far short of that in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Finally there is a timeline set in the future.  Wikipedia puts it at about the year 2500, however I must confess that I thought it was supposed to be a much later point than that.  Here Jackman is with the tree of eternal life and in a bubble that is floating up towards a dying star.  There is little action in these scenes, but they are also some of the most breathtaking.The present day story is the most ""normal"" part and the rest of the tale requires you to suspend disbelief for large periods.  If you have seen 2001: A Space Odyssey then you may have an idea what to expect.  Essentially you have to buy into Aronofsky's vision for the film and the imagery he puts forward.  I think it is beautiful, but it won't be for everyone.Jackman is brilliant in this film.  The three different stories give him an opportunity to present three sides of his acting ability and he nails each one.  It's sublime and a joy to watch.The film certainly deserves more plaudits than it got, but it isn't perfect.  The story set in the present day does feel a little predictable in places, and I struggled to understand what links we were supposed to draw between the timelines.  Sometimes Jackman's characters seemed to be aware of their past events and other times not.  The scenes were also shown out of chronological order a lot and I'm not really sure that was necessary.The Fountain is not light entertainment, but if you are up for something a little different that poses more questions than it gives answers, I think you will enjoy it.8/10"	4.0	Sit back and immerse yourself in Aronofsky's vision	2013-02-03	1	1	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3V5UGEARJVT81	Chris J. Veros	"Maybe it's cliche to say a movie ""isn't for everyone"" but I can definitely see how some people would miss the boat on The Fountain.  I love it because there are no answers.  The movie consists of 3 parallel plot lines.  They are all connected through imagery and unexplained commonalities, and if you are waiting for some secret reveal to explain how the same man transcends time, you will be frustrated.But beyond that I'm annoyed at how much negativity is leveled at this movie.  Even if you don't get the plot, or you were hoping for some answers, you can't deny the masterful construction of the film.  It's expertly shot, cut, scored, and acted, every scene is beautiful and 100% committed.  In the very least you should be able to appreciate it as a series of artfully shot vignettes."	5.0	Misunderstood	2012-03-18	4	2	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"Either ""The Fountain"" is one of the most nonsensical films ever made, or I'm simply too dense a person to have understood it. I honestly don't know how to feel about it anymore; I saw this film with my mother, and when we left the theater, I saw she had tears in her eyes. ""This is a beautiful film,"" she said quietly, wiping at her cheeks with a shriveled tissue. I was completely at a loss for words. How is this film beautiful, other than because of some moments of impressive digital effects? To say this story is cryptic would be a colossal understatement, and I just can't understand why it had to be so alternative that it alienated any sense of reason. This has to be the most aimless movie I've ever seen, going passive-aggressively from scene to scene with virtually nothing holding its individual moments together, save for a couple of weak narrative links.Now, you may be asking yourself, ""What is this film about?"" Well, that's the catch: I have absolutely no idea what this film is about, and I can't even begin to describe a cohesive plotline. The best I can offer are vague snippets of information, ones that make sense in and of themselves but have no structure when put together in the same movie. The most prominently featured motif is the idea of birth, death, and rebirth, physically represented at times by a mythical tree of life, at others by Rachel Weisz as both Queen Isabella of Spain and a modern-day cancer patient. What any one image has to do with the other is anyone's guess; there are three individual narratives in the film, each separated by several hundred years, each randomly weaving in and out of each other. They had little if any connection, other than the notion that one could live forever if he or she looks in the right place.One narrative takes place in the 1500s during the Spanish Inquisition. Hugh Jackman enters the film during this segment as a devoted conquistador willing to sacrifice himself for the salvation of Spain; apparently, a power-hungry inquisitor (Stephen McHattie) is slowly taking the country over, and he's about ready to attack the queen in a final display of torture. But according to the unrealistically calm queen, there is hope for their beloved country. As stated in Mayan legend, a miraculous tree resides deep within the jungles of New Spain (modern day Central America). Anyone who drinks of its sap will live forever. With such reliable information, the conquistador is sent to this land with a monk in order to find the tree. Exactly how going about this task would in any way, shape, or form help an oppressed country is beyond me. It would have been nice if some kind of an explanation were given, even if it was an unrealistic one.Another segment takes place in the present day. Jackman now plays Tommy, a doctor obsessed with finding a cure for cancer. His current patient is an ape named Donovan, who unfortunately has a brain tumor. When Tommy sees that Donovan is slipping further and further away from life, he decides to take drastic measures. With a quick rummage through an assortment of files, he finds what he's looking for: an organic material taken from a special tree found in Central America. Maybe an injection of this stuff will help the poor little simian recover. And sure enough, it does; his vital signs improve beyond anyone's expectations, and his head scar heals much more quickly than normal. Unfortunately, the tumor itself remains unscathed. This is incredibly distressing for Tommy; the whole point of doing this medical research is to help his wife, Izzi (Weisz), who's brain cancer is progressing to the point of diminishing her tactile sensitivity.This segment description may make it seem as if it's the most structured one of the film, but the reality is that it's just as out of place as the previous one. Consider the loss of Tommy's wedding ring; we see this object continually reappear throughout the film, originating as a charm on Queen Isabella's necklace. It must have been some kind of symbol, possibly the classic symbol of unity and commitment. But then why did it have to be lost in the first place? It only added another layer of drama to a story that was already overflowing. And then there's Izzi's book, which documents the life and death beliefs of the ancient Mayans. All but the last chapter is finished, and it's her wish that Tommy finish the book. He continually says that he can't, that he doesn't know the end, and that he doesn't know how to reach the end. Finally, one of the characters expresses what I've been feeling throughout the entire movie.The third segment is probably the most baffling one. It presumably takes place in the distant future, a time when people float through space in giant bubbles. This is the way we find a now bald and barefoot Hugh Jackman, trapped inside his own snow globe with a hair-covered tree. The unabashed strangeness of this segment can only be indicative of a spiritual mind excursion, so much so that any form of explanation would be pointless. Apparently, this bubble is heading for a nebula, one that surrounds a dying star. This dying star, according to Mayan legend, is the place where the life/death exchange takes place. Interestingly enough, Izzi had already identified this nebula during the present day segment by viewing it through her telescope. It also served as the basis for her book.As this futuristic Tommy floats through space, he hears voices, has fleeting hallucinations of both Izzi and Queen Isabella, and periodically cuts off a piece of the tree's hairy bark to chew on. He even tattoos himself with a fountain pen (which started in the present day segment after Tommy lost the ring). Like many other aspects of this movie, I can't explain the significance of any of it. That's probably why I disliked this movie; it's a visually stunning work, but the story is so convoluted and so mysterious that it prevents the viewer from understanding anything about it. I don't mind when a film relies heavily on visual material, but it should at least be part of a story that's actually about something.But even as I say this, I think back to my mother, who found the story so touching and meaningful that she was reduced to tears. I don't deny the possibility that I completely missed the point of this film, that I'm too mainstream a viewer to be entertained by this kind of narrative. Nonetheless, I can't recommend ""The Fountain""; I see it as nothing but a gigantic mess, so loaded with abstract ideas that don't add up to anything comprehensible. If any of you reading this still intend to see it, I, of course, have no way of stopping you. Maybe it's just as well; you just might manage to get more out of it than I did."	2.0	To Have Loved and Lost Takes an Eternity	2006-11-29	14	4	10

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV	"Christina ""Lisa"""	Beware of any linear explanation of The Fountain.  It is difficult to definitely tell the plot. It is a little chamber piece that happens to be a nice movie.  This nonlinear fable reminds me mostly of a Robin Williams movie, Being Human and somewhat another by the same actor titled What Dreams May Come. 2001: A Space Odyssey also comes to mind, too.  It is a love story that goes cosmic, breaking through the fabric of the physical world and astral science exploring a spiritual plain.  I was expecting something more conventional in love stories and science fiction.  The opening of the movie pretty much dashed that to the rocks but in a good way demanding my mind to loosen up and go for a ride. Mayan astronomy and a fiction being written are the vehicles for bending reality. The language is not just speech but shapes, pictures, light.Hugh Jackman has to perform more emotion in this movie than the other characters and other parts he has played. He succeeds at showing a lot of range and selling this notion to us.  Rachel Weisz plays an idea wonderfully, female characters that aren't women like the rest of us. (She mostly just has to look good and fit into the story, which can be tricky because she projects a lot of presence.)  The acting is intelligent and interesting.As for production, it is admirable. In the documentary footage of how the movie was born, Darren Aronofsky and his colleagues were on a journey that burst into something different than they had originally conceived. It is hard to decribe this film accurately.  I hope these notes are helpful. It does and will provoke more and more thought for thoughtful people.	3.0	Xibalba is the best way to explain this movie	2007-09-17	6	5	1

I expected the blu-ray edition to be crystal clear, which it is for the most part.  However, there were a few scenes in the hospital and in the jungle that seemed a little lackluster.  Overall, it is a powerful film with great acting and effects.  Hugh Jackman definitely shows off his acting chops in this role.  Rachel Weis is a beauty in her own right and a gifted actress.  My wife loves this film, which makes her cry every time she sees it.  If you enjoy weird love stories or science fiction that really makes you think, then this is the film for you.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3H4UBJFQEI72Q	"Cirilio Villaverde ""chango48"""	"I think the movie demonstrates, by its lack of audiences and mass appeal, what is wrong with our US movie-going public: we're being dumbed-down.  If a movie doesn't establish the plot line in the first three minutes, if it doesn't follow a linear story line, and if you the viewer actually have to think about what is going on (god forbid!) vice sitting numbly in your seat while your senses are overwhelmed with noise and a consequent cacophony of images, then forget it, too much work, why bother going to see it.Well I'll tell you: Darren Aronofsky may not be ""brilliant,"" but he sure does think differently and thus makes us thinkg.  This is his third movie, and the biggest budget-film of the three.  I only saw one other of his movies, ""Pi,"" and I was very impressed.  It was a low-budget independent film.  But this latest, The Fountain, is actually three stories in one, each with the same issue at their core: the search for a continuation of life.  I won't say ""eternal"" life necessarily, although that is certainly the goal in one of the story lines.  The idea of immortality, of fighting against death, of living longer, is certainly not a new topic... far from it.  But through three separate yet ingeniously interweaving story lines Aronofsky deals with the issue beautifully, poetically, and originally: a Spanish conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth (aka Tree of Life); a modern-day researcher examining the effects of a newly discovered plant on cancerous tumors (with the goal of racing against time as his wife falls ill with her own cancerous growth); and a futuristic traveler seeking to restore his loved one--a tree--to full life.  I was left wondering if this 26th-century tree is the same 20th-century pod which he planted... The movie is rich with symbolism, imagery, and references.  Truly wonderful, truly a work of art.I liked it so much I had to see it again, and was utterly disappointed when the theaters weren't carrying it anymore--again, no mass appeal, no quick commercial sales, so out of the theaters it goes.  I'm only glad it came out again, in the lower-budget theaters.  I plan on seeing it at least one more time; the effects employed and the music are beyond amazing and I feel a need to experience the magic of Aronofsky's skill on the big screen once more."	4.0	Beyond Beautiful	2007-01-16	13	11	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ART4U0TWHJGFO	C. Jung	"I must admit, I had high expectations for The Fountain after I read the synopsis. It sounded like my genre: a film that takes place across three time periods with the meaning of life, death, and love played out. Furthermore, I am a huge fan of Aronofsky's other work, and finally (finally!) got to watch it over the weekend. My verdict? Everything else was pitch-perfect: the music, the cinematography, the production, the acting. The passion evidently put into this film is nothing short of amazing. Unfortunately, that passion is also the film's undoing with the screenplay. Instead of letting the characters develop and bloom of their own accord, Tom and Izzy feel as if they were forcibly molded and cut the way Aranofsky deemed fit. I felt their personalities were flat and one-dimensional as individuals and as a couple. On the other hand, Tomas the conquistador, the Queen, and the bald Tom were more well-rounded. I connected with them more then I did for the Tom and Izzy in the ""present"" time. This is all the more unfortunate given that the present time took up the bulk of the movie, and so, I would grit my teeth when I saw them on screen and think, ""Why would Tom/Izzy say that? Would that really happen?"" All in all, The Fountain is a visual and musical feast, but is severely lacking in character development, resulting in three instead of the five stars. My one possible explanation for this flaw is how the project was shelved and redone so many times, I feel like there was a certain level of film burnout by the team at the end. While this is certainly not my favorite movie, Aronofsky or otherwise, I have seen much, much worse."	3.0	Caught in the Middle (**SPOILERS**)	2010-05-30	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Earlier this year, I had the opportunity (or misfortune) to watch Shortbus, a sexually frank film that was meant to be a huge study and deconstruction of people's perceptions of sex but really, it was just a message film with a bad story attached to it. The Fountain was most likely made to be an art film; a film that was meant to be studied and dissected and debated about a la 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Matrix. While these films are meant to be admired for the amount of attention and passion put into it, that doesn't automatically make it a film that deserves heaps of praise or at least from everyone.In the first of 3 of interconnected storylines, Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical doctor and researcher looking to cure brain tumors. This is an extremely personal case since his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) suffers from a brain tumor. Izzy is writing a book entitled the Fountain, a period piece about the Conquistador Tomas who is sent on a mission by the Queen of Spain to find the Tree of Life in the Mayan civilization so she can use it to restore glory to Spain since an evil Inquisitor has been causing trouble. In the third storyline taking place about 400 years in the future, a bald Jackman is travelling through space in a bubble which houses a tree as he travels to a dying star, said to be the gateway to the Mayan underworld. Shifting back and forth, we see the passion and determination of how far one goes for love.Now I have to give props where it's due: this is one lush and gorgeous film. Probably the bulk of that praise goes to the future segment done largely by macrophotography. Even though the idea of a bubble spaceship will elicit laughter, it just looks fantastic and was probably quite a sight on the big screen (our stupid theatre never showed it here). The rest of the film is as good from Spain and Old Spain with the present day segment looking the most ""normal"". The problem is, like how I felt about 2001, is that the film seems too...cold, kind of clinical as if the character's emotional journey is an important one but the way it's presented as a detached quality. Some will definately disagree and say it is but that's the basis of the film: everyone will walk away with different ideas of what they just saw which becomes a slight problem.The problem is that this film wants to be important and studied that it almost has a calculated approach, like they know they're making an important film and this is something for people who truly get it. This is meant to create discussion. ""Is there a Tree of Life? Does love last forever? Is the Spanish segment Tommy and Izzy's past life? Did Tommy find the Tree of Life and is travelling through space? All in his head? Can 2 and 2 really equal five? Dude."" I thought Requiem of a Dream was a technically better film than it was emotionally. The Fountain isn't as bad as that but some might walk away feeling like they saw a technically outstanding film but a little bit too pretentious for its own good.Even if you might have conflicting views about its story, you got to admit the acting is pretty spot-on. While best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men films, Jackman is practically on fire here playing his character with such emotion and drive that it reaffirms this guy is one to watch. And while probably the more subtle, Weisz is excellent as Izzy and Isobel (the Spanish Queen) and you really believe someone would hunt to the ends of Earth and Space to be with her again. The rest of the cast, namely Ellen Burstyn, are good but you don't really know much about them and probably will forget their names. But ultimately this is Jackman and Weisz's movie and they deliver in spades.Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with a negative or positive review, this is a film everyone should at least see once."	3.0	One of the most polarizing films in recent years	2007-05-15	3	2	1

I'm not saying this movie is exactly high art, to be honest, i think some movies are weird just for the sake of being weird, but its visually impressive (the movie, not so much the blu-ray transfer, this movie is visually very dark and the deep blacks look very muddy and pixelated)	5.0	the Fountain	2014-02-26	0	0	0

That is something I don't think I've ever said about any other movie. I haven't idealized this movie, it is just rich which meaning that for me required multiple viewings to wrap my head around. The more I've watched it the more heartbreaking it has become. I can understand why people might not like it and it was entertaining to read the negative reviews posted. They remind of the way I feel about Charlie Kaufman's movies (they infuriate me), which always feel heartless and way overly intellectual/cerebral in uninteresting ways (e.g., Synecdoche, New York). But some people love his movies. The Fountain is also a heady movie with lots of think about, but is also emotionally engaging, visually stunning, deeply engages with the question of how to love.	5.0	Excellent movie (for some)	2013-12-10	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi and Requiem for a Dream) has created a niche for himself in the film industry. Much like filmmakers David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Vincent Ward, Darren Aronofsky explores the realm of dark drama, where dreams and fantasies flow into everyday reality. His film The Fountain is an ambitious science fiction/fantasy film with a strong metaphysical undercurrent. As always, Aronofsky utilizes his keen visual sense of storytelling while focusing on characterization and maintaining an emotional momentum. What really brings the film together is the unique narrative structure that combines three different timeframes. This storytelling device can partly be accredited to Aronofsky, though most of the praise should go to the film's under appreciated editor, Jay Rabinowitz.Another crucial element of the film is the haunting music by Clint Mantell, which will stay with the viewer long after the film is over.The film stars Hugh Jackman as Tomas Seville / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabel / Izzi Creo. The talented supporting cast features Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, and Cliff Curtis. Still, there's no doubt that it's the performances of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that propel the story forward.In the year 1,500 A.D. Queen Isabel of Spain suffers under the reign of terror that was the Grand Inquisition. She turns to her most valiant warrior, Tomas Seville, to save Spain from bondage and in return she will give him her hand in marriage. The queen believes that the Tree of Life grows in New Spain (or South America), and that whoever drinks the sap from this tree shall be given immortality. This, she believes, is her only hope of saving herself and her country from the wrath of the sanctimonious grand inquisitor, Silecio. So Tomas gathers together the bravest of the conquistadors and travels to New Spain in search of the fabled Tree of Life... but the dangers that await him may prove too great even for this noble warrior who faithfully serves his queen.In the year 2,000 A.D. a doctor named Tom Creo searches for a way to save his dying wife Izzi, who has an inoperable brain tumor. But as Izzi's health declines she finds a spiritual awakening in the legends of the ancient Mayan culture. These legends revive memories of a past life and inspire Izzi to write a novel that will help Tom cope with her inevitable death. All the while, Tom is consumed with grief and obsessively continues his research with an enzyme found in a rare South American tree.In the year 2,500 A.D. Tom travels through space with the tree he planted over Izzi's grave. Haunted by images from their past, he meditates on loss and what it means to live and die. As Tom drifts ever closer to Xibalba, a dying star that is enshrouded in a nebula, he learns the truth about immortality. Most importantly Tom learns to let go and understand the importance of physical death.In the end (if there really can be one), The Fountain is about a love shared between two soul mates, a love that transcends life and death, time and space.Also recommended:Somewhere in TimeBrazil12 MonkeysWhat Dreams May ComeDonnie DarkoMulholland DriveRiverworldThe PrestigePan's Labyrinth	4.0	The Road to Awe	2008-11-26	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1ROL5ZFJIS594	"^Coventry ""^Coventry"""	This movie is one of those experiences you need to be ready for. I won't dwell on the plot because others have done so. Instead I'll simply say that for anyone who has endured an emotional loss that made you question everything about your life, this movie has  the power to dredge those feelings right into the present. If you've come out the other end of such an experience to find happiness, this movie can really let you know how far you've come. An appreciation for such a thing is hard, because we are wired to bury emotional pain as part of our own self-preservation response. Time, and a very real physiological reprogramming of powerfull neural patterns, does the rest. In a very real sense, you can't  go back to that painfull place until you've been there. That's why It really comes as no surprise that this film garners a lot of divergent opinionsHowever, if you are ready for this experience, it may give you some new appreciaton for the happiness you have so painstakingly rebuilt. And while that might not be something you feel you need, there is a lot to be said for the clarity it can bring to your present circumstanses. That's my opinion, for what it's worth.Oh, just one more thing. The voice track on this video can be difficult to follow. Many very important pieces of the story can be totally missed. This is another reason this film was so hard for even intellegent minds to follow.	5.0	An Emotional Journey Worth Taking	2010-06-17	4	3	1

The character of Hugh Jackman seemed a wonderful, free style interpretation based on the Ayn Rand protoganist.  Rachel Weisz is luminous and soulful as ever, and years later, this movie lingers in my mind like no other.  Deep, enduring love, conquering fear, the cycle of life.  This is whatThe Tree Of Lifecould have been if it had been a cool flick.  But it was not, and The Fountain is.

Powell ""It's Always Sunny"""	Having watched all of Darren Aronofsky's films now which include: Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler, and his most recentBlack Swan [Blu-ray], I have to say this is my least favorite of his. Having said that, by no means is this not a beautifully told story, with yet another amazing score from Clint Mansell, it is simply just not my favorite. The movie can be confusing sometimes as it is somewhat complex with a very in-depth meaning to the film that cannot be determined from merely one viewing. If your not a fan of being able to watch a film for a second time, this might not be the one for you. The acting is spot on with both Weisz and Jackman. Jackman, I have to say was terrific especially due to the choice of different roles. It was nice to see him actually act and not just yell and fight as wolverine. Weisz is always a pleasure watching her on screen. I only recommend this for hardcore fans of Aronofsky and fans of thinking films.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2NTJUI2DLZF4R	Craig Chalquist, PhD, author of TERRAPSYCHOLO...	"After hearing so much about this film I found myself quite disappointed in it, especially the ending. Nice effects and good acting, but in the first place it's not a multi-lifetime story. The conquistador episode is from Izzy's novel, and the 26th century an obvious extrapolation of what happens when your life-extension research is successful (if too late).After doing Tai Chi and shaving his head, the doctor finally realizes, ""I'm going to die!"" No kidding. That's what happens when you fly directly toward a dying star. All this travel to let go of someone amounts to a Buddhist wet dream of finally getting the non-attachment bit, but without any real wisdom. So we wind up with a pretty picture--and yet another uncritical pitch for the supposed superiority of Eastern contemplative methods over Western. (I live in California, where everyone and their aunt is a Yoga Master but hardly anyone knows anything about the richness of their own abandond traditions.) Even so the Christian cultural background finally has the last say as the meditator literally flies heavenward, though still in a bubble.

Then I bought the Blu-ray (primarily for the above mentioned cinematic elements), and the world of The Fountain opened up to me the second time I watched it. The story is absolutely beautiful and spiritual, yet very human. To understand the story, you should watch it several times, and it would not hurt to have some knowledge of yoga, chakras, kundalini, etc.(though this is only one element of the story; it has much to offer beyond Eastern philosophical concepts and imagery).I highly recommend you add the film to your library.

Typically, I'm the one rolling my eyes at any sort of sappiness in most movie's romantic/love scenes but he did such a great job of conveying true love that I actually cried.In addition to the acting and writing, the way in which the scenes of the film were put together was a little confusing at first, finding which was past, which was fiction and which was the present, but once you do you can see how well they come together. The soundtrack only added to the grandness of the film, and I suggest listening to that exclusively too.Overall, the movie has such a complex plot that I haven't gotten tired of it, been watching it over and again for about eight years.	5.0	Perfect and Beautiful	2014-03-16	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A27LJ7PPIDJCCP	Dangle's girl	"What does it say about Darren Aronofsky that every frame of ""The Fountain"" is filled with patterns, textures and the interplay of light and shadow? You could say he's an obsessive genius, or you could say he's a nut job. That pretty much sums up ""The Fountain,"" a bizzare hybrid of ""Apocalypto,"" ""The Mission,"" ""Love Story"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that somehow works. Aronofsky shows impressive control in weaving together his plotlines and has chosen outstanding actors to tell his story: Rachel Weisz coveys more with her eyes than most actresses can in pages of dialogue and Hugh Jackman is visceral in his torment of grief and guilt. The visuals are also amazing--even on a smaller screen. The DVD extras add to the experience with explanations of the behind-the-scenes challenges Aronofsky faced and the visual inspirations for the images. This is not an easy movie to access on a first viewing, but if you let go of your expectations and unleash your imagination, you'll be entertained, moved and blown away.I just hope that a future civilization unearths ""The Fountain"" and recognizes it for what I truly believe it to be: one of the first film masterpieces of the 21st century."	5.0	Open your mind and enjoy	2007-11-26	2	1	1

Moralez ""Daniel"""	"Mr. Aronofsky, if fate ever allows you to see this review, let it be known that there are those few out there who do in fact comprehend the ideas of this movie.  I am SHOCKED that this movie is not held to such standards as ""Transformers"" or ""Avatar,"" it really says something about modern American society.  This story is a philosophical masterpiece.  It touches on things such as history and myth, science and philosophy, life and death, love and fear, past and future, and weaves them together in a way so meaningful as to inspire and touch.  Not only that, it also ponders upon such things as 'meaningful existence' in those today whom, among Democracy, seem to be lost in the crowd.  You ask the question; if there is such meaning inside of individual humans of the past (with the conquistador), where do we fall today with our cyclical lives of work, home, weekend, rinse and repeat.  The upside down shot of a parallel between New York and the Inquisitor's castle answers this:  the conquistadors of today are not explorers of uncharted places on Earth, they are the researchers, scientists, writers, philosophers, striving to find answers to such complicated matters that we ourselves deal with today.One day this work will be appreciated for what it is.  Far into the future, humans will look back and view this movie in the same fashion as a Homeric epic; a snapshot of the psyche of today, the ideas of meaning and belief held to those men who are intelligent enough to comprehend, analyze, and form ideas about the history of humanity."	5.0	Modern masterpiece.	2010-04-28	7	6	1

I really felt Izzi's case (she has brain cancer); I really believed in her character - someone who has accepted their fate and tries to live the best they can with the time they have left. Doctor Creo (Hugh Jackman) is desperatley trying to find a cure (he also just happens to be married to her). Although he played his part with a sadness and insanity that really surprised me, I just didn't believe in his character being a doctor. I don't know, something about him just doesn't strike me as a doctor-type. But that's okay, because the film more than makes up for any shortcomings with its stirring visual appeal.

Some people just didnt get it because they need movies spoon fed to them. If you like movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or What Dreams May Come then go see this movie. Its both visually and written beautifully. GO SEE IT!!!!	5.0	An adventure through life and a look into the soul.	2006-11-16	11	8	3
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	What I liked most about The Fountain is its intense spirituality, fantastic cinematography, moving soundtrack and the Tree of Life mythology, which is historically accurate!The film is essentially divided into two stories, one happening in the real world, and the other coming to life though the imagination of the author. I enjoyed the story within a story approach! I also like brave movies, which are surrealistic and leave much to the imagination like2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray].The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think Salvador Dali would have greatly enjoyed this film!Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination!I was also deeply moved by the Tree of Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased an obscure video documentary,The Tree of Lifedirected by Bruce Lane!While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths. This is one of the few movies I have seen this year that actually was exciting, and I want to encourage filmmakers to continue being brave and taking chances! That's what art is all about!	5.0	The Soundtrack Alone Was Worth A Trip To The Theater!	2006-12-10	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AM6EXX5Z2RUQC	Dante M. Alegre	I generally like watching movies that have a different take.  Quite refreshing from generic movies with predictable endings such as &#34;boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back&#34; or &#34;reluctant action hero finally steps up to the plate, kills the bad guy, saves the world, and wins the girl.&#34; Sometimes you can find real gems trying different movies, so I have an open mind when it comes to something with a different concept.  However, I had a hard time following the plot of this movie.  It is clearly about men from different time periods, all played by Hugh Jackman, who seeks a way to extend life, aka Ponce de Leon's fountain of life.  Still, this concept of time and character flipping is hard to follow.  It worked for Highlander, but at least there was a sequence.  I wouldn't recommend the movie for entertainment purposes.  Too much work to enjoy.	2.0	Confusing	2013-06-24	2	1	1

About a third of the way in, I was wondering if I could stay awake long enough to watch the rest.  There's just too much unexplained jumping around in time and too many dark scenes.  Then, there's the nonsensical bubble floating through the Orion nebula, as if Heaven were a place rather than a state of being.  Just too confusing.  Yes, there is a kind of biblical air to it all, but the fountain isn't really a fountain, and living forever isn't what you think either.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2XMBWQL0LGNJD	Dave Cordes	"I was utterly moved to tears by this film. The Fountain is a breathtaking sentimental masterpiece in the vein of2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray] as it boldly seeks to answer the great mysteries of life, love, death and re-birth transgressing the metaphysical boundaries of the universe. It's epic non-linear narrative spans the centuries with Hugh Jackman delivering an absolutely unforgettable performance as Tomas, a Spanish Conquistador in the 16th century who pledges his loyalty to Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) to find the mythical Tree of Life so that Spain will hold the key to the Fourth Paradise, Immortality, denounced as heresy by the Grand Inquisitor. Tomas' quest is interleaved between three converging narratives across time and space. As a modern-day neurosurgeon, Tomas struggles to find a cure for a tumorous disease that threatens the mortality of his beloved wife Izzi who is writing a fable called ""The Fountain"" chronicling the odyssey of their 16th century quest which can be interpreted as either a fictitious or biographical account of Tomas and Izzi's lives who have endured the centuries together or simply as mythical characterizations of Izzi's unfinished allegorical manuscript symbolizing her husband's obsessive quest to find a cure for her terminal ailment that she has left for him to finish (the past representing Izzi's tale and the future representing Tomas' as he struggles to ""finish it"") both of which could be argued with equal measure. One of the beauties of The Fountain is its open-ended narrative construct left to speculation and interpretation and can be viewed from entirely different perspectives with each consecutive viewing. Tomas' quest ultimately takes him to the distant 26th century where he has projected himself and the dying Tree of Life across the great void of space in a transcendental bubble to reach Xibalba, the name of the Mayan underworld given to a dying nebula that brings the creation of new life from the wake of its destruction like the yin and yang of the cosmos beyond the confines of this mortal coil. ""Our bodies are prisons for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul... ""Darren Aronofsky's poetic film blossoms with rich cultural, biblical, mythical and spiritual imagery that speak the common language spoken by all religions and cultures that have asked the boldest philosophical questions about our place in the universe since time immemorial. For anyone who has ever looked to the heavens and stared in the face of mortality and beyond, The Fountain holds all of the answers to life like a profound epiphany radiating from the heavens. Drink from The Fountain and achieve the knowledge of truth and spiritual enlightenment on the road to Awe. One of the truly great cinematic masterpieces of this century and last, The Fountain will transcend the test of time and eternity."	5.0	Millenial masterpiece.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	"The first thing my wife said about The Fountain on the way out of the theater was that the film looked a lot like 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There is a definite feel of  Stanley Kubrick in The Fountain from the visual effects, particularly the scene set as Hugh Jackman travels in space.  The story is set over 1000 years covering a16th century Conquistador Tomas who is searching for a way to save the Queen of Spain, a doctor, named Tommy, trying to cure his wife Isabel (Izzy) of cancer and Tom, a 26th century space traveler heading toward a nebula that will explode to give birth to a planetary system and new life.The three stories cut into each other, a task that must have been difficult in a film with such an abstract story, and there is interaction between the stories.  Izzy writes a chronicle of her 16th century life and Tomas' quest for the Tree of Life but does not finish her manuscript; that is left for Tommy to do.  Tommy, ironically, in searching for a cure for Izzy's cancer tries an experimental drug on a monkey named Donavan, whose fatal brain tumor not only shrinks but grants immortality.  However, this was not the cure that Tommy wants, at first; Izzy is dead before Tommy realizes that he could have saved her.  In the 26th century, Tom is traveling with a slowly dying Tree of Life to Xilbalba, the Mayan underworld where in destruction life is reborn.  Viewers who demand that a story to be told chronologically will probably be disappointed at the way the film cuts back and forth between stories.  The Fountain is a spiritual journey into immortality; our search for a cure for all our physical maladies until we conquer death itself.  I found myself drawn into the ideas of the film as it progressed; it is a film that provokes thinking and discussionThis film truly belongs to writer-director Darren Aronofsky  who spent seven years making the movie, a road with a lot of bumps along the way.  Hugh Jackman turns in a magnificent performance displaying a full range of emotion from joy, sorrow and ecstasy.  I found myself accepting him completely as the people he was playing.  This has been a good year for him with his excellent performances in The Prestige and The Fountain.  If one enjoys being challenged by imaginative filmmakers, then ignore the inane comments made about ""Donavan's Brain"" and see The Fountain."	5.0	A Fantastic Film Journey	2006-11-28	7	5	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1POPCJ19XSHF9	"DeadBunnyDip ""Bunny in a Blender"""	Around mid-2005, I spotted the cover of a graphic novel through the shop windows in a local bookstore. As an artist, I can't help but judge a book by its cover. The illustration was of a man with his back towards the reader, he had a tattoo of a dying tree on his back, and he was holding a woman in a sensual and loving embrace. And on her face was a look of calm. I felt myself drawn to this book so I walked in and picked it up to get a closer look. To my glee, I found out that it was a creative project from the minds of one of my favorite directors Darren Aronofsky, whose films lay alongside my selection of original DVDs (and I stress the word ORIGINAL) which I watch time and again. At the back of the cover, I read that apart from this novel the movie was also in the works. So, I paid a huge chunk of what I had in my wallet for the book, and went home dying to tear the book free of its plastic wrap.After three hours, perhaps more, of reading and taking in the beautiful artwork by Kent Williams. I was already ecstatic about the film, but had a sinking feeling in my heart that told me it probably wouldn't be shown here in the Philippines because of the depth and scope of its concept (which I am sure only a small percentage of the Filipino population would appreciate). Late last year, I chanced upon another book about THE FOUNTAIN in the same shop I purchased the first book. This time, it featured still shots and artwork from the movie itself. So, for nearly two years, I waited for a trailer to pop up on the internet just so I could catch a glimpse of the movie until I could order the limited edition DVD (which I hope comes out soon). When that day came, I felt a mixture of excitement and frustration - excited because I was dying to see what visuals Aronofsky was going to pull out of his hat, and frustrated because I was SO sure that the movie wouldn't be coming to theatres near me. I was so revved up about it that I decided to do some promotional vendetta myself, to the extent of giving the graphic novels away for Christmas presents, and e-mailing my friends and loved ones abroad to go see the movie when it comes out.And then one fateful day, I see the plug on HBO. Suddenly, I felt that there was hope of seeing the movie in the local cinema. If this movie  was able to gain this much coverage prior to its release there was a huge chance that the local industry would be interested in picking it up for distribution. I WAS RIGHT! And what a perfect time to release it on Valentine's Day! I almost crapped my pants when a friend of mine told me that it was coming out in local theatres. Even though no one else I knew was as enthusiastic as I was to go see it, I went ahead and continued my promotional vendetta. Finally, after the books, the articles, the trailers and the waiting, I would finally be able to sit back and watch this spectacle on the big screen.I must say, THE FOUNTAIN is a perfect example of surviving the test of time. Six years in the making, acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky brought this beautiful sci-fi epic love story to page and, finally, to the silver screen.  Having captured the admiration of critics and cinephiles around the world with his award-winning debut feature PI and top-listing movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Aronofsky unveils another stunningly visual film featuring the talents of actor Hugh Jackman and actress Rachel Weisz. I think the casting was appropriate as the movie was the perfect chance for them to showcase a deeper and darker side of them that audiences all over hadn't seen.It is a timeless tale of a man's journey to conquer death and save the life of the woman he loves. THE FOUNTAIN intercuts among three different time periods and follows the struggles of one multiplicitous character. There is Thomas, a 16th century conquistador battling a fierce Mayan army in the heart of Central America seeking the mythic Tree of Life for his love, Queen Isabel. There is Tommy, a modern-day neuroscientists frantically in search of a cure for his dying wife, Izzy. And then there is Tom, a far future space traveler haunted by his past, hoping to uncover the secrets of a dying star that gives birth to new life. All three storylines converge into one painful reality - that he must come to accept the inevitability of death. Deep, timeless, and creatively executed, THE FOUNTAIN is a gripping story about love that transcends death, time and space.Aronofsky once again adds his magical touch to the artistic aspect of this film. The use of monochromatic themes throughout the movie adds more gravity to the few scenes in the movie that do have color, such as the one where Weisz dawns a red strapless dress and the one where the a plethora of green engulfs the tree of life. By method of experimentation and masterful execution, Aronofsky lavishes this spectacle with wonderful transitions, well-composed shots and notable juxtaposition that would send chills down a film buff's spine.And being the self-proclaimed cinephile that I am, I was the first person to get in the movie theatre and the last person to get out. Although only half of theatre was filled, it was interesting to see and hear the reactions of the people around me. Some, unfortunately, had found it hard to catch up. Some left the theatre a little confused. But most importantly, some left speechless and in awe. I loved it. I myself, was teary-eyed and at a loss for words. I most certainly recommend the movie to all you artists and cinephiles out there who appreciate a beautiful and  well-thought concept. Definitely another addition to my selection of favorite films that I am bound to watch over and over and over...	5.0	For artists and cinephiles out there who appreciate a beautiful and  well-thought concept.	2007-03-07	31	24	7
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3USW46J1R317P	Deborah	This is the only film I've ever seen of this type done right. I watched it because of the actors, but as soon as I saw what type of movie it was, I just did an eye roll, as I normally hate these types of films. The director normally loses the focus of the movie, and it ends up being a psychedelic mess. I hung in there because of the actors, and I'm glad I did. I will add this to my collection. It may look like it throws Christianity out the window in favor of Buddhism, but if you understand your Bible correctly (following Jesus's teachings, not Paul's), then you'll see it come back full circle to Genesis. This is first and foremost a love story. At the end, keep in mind this is the true meaning of life, so don't expect a fairy tale Disney moment. Because most of us are brainwashed that way from birth, the ending leaves you feeling a little sad, even though logic tells you to be happy. The two lovers keep being reborn, always find each other, and then lose each other. Now, is enlightenment just being at peace with that knowledge that you will always be together again, or as religions tell it that your soul/essence/being will always be connected in the collective? Does nature show us it's the same thing? Whatever the answers are, our characters finally find peace, and are happy with what that is. That is the happy ending. This movie will pull on every emotion you have. It surrounds you, and penetrates every fiber of your being. Even after it's over, the feeling remains. Just enjoy the film, and leave your preconceived notions at the door. If you don't, you are only cheating yourself.	5.0	Incredible and Capitvating	2013-10-14	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AD7J8Y6CN2UJ4	default	"I don't mind artsey-fartsey as long as it has a point. This movie was essentially about some guy's wife dying of cancer and should have been billed as such. The fountain is just a metaphor for the main character's ""crusade"" to save his wife. Its a movie about things we all have gone or will go through at some point, over dramatized and not very interesting. I think this movie could have saved itself if the main character would have withdrawn to his fantasy world for example, in order to save himself the pain of his wife's death - or something else out of the ordinary. But this is a movie about mundane things, covered up with an artsey-fartsey perfume to make it look deeper. If you're looking for a sci-fi or fantasy flick, this isn't one. If you're looking for movies that deal with the subject of death, there are several better than this one; the notebook for example."	2.0	Purposelessly Artsy-Fartsey	2013-01-25	1	0	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A9QPIEGBZUKFH	Desert Rat	The movie seemed to be a very disjointed attempt at dramatizing the circle of life philosophy. In spite of the fact that I am a fan of many of the actors and comfortable with the concept of life being birthed from death, I found the movie unpleasantly organized and unnecessarily confusing.It begins with a Conquistador looking for a treasure, in conflict with hostile natives, ala the opening of Raider of the Lost Ark, except with a fraction of the cinemagraphic clarity. It then jumps, willy-nilly, to a modern scientist snapping at his wife/girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) before he does brain surgery on a chimp. Eventually, we find out he is searching for a treatment/cure for deadly brain tumor of the woman he loves... the one he is so snappish with (and for whom his highest memory of their time together, seems to be of playing sexy chase with her in a red nightie.) The hero is snappish with everyone, his love, his co-workers, his boss. All of whom seem to be going out of their way to put up with his nastiness, and walk on eggshells because he (not her, the one that's dying) is such a tragic figure.It is deep into the movie before any explanation of the opening scene is revealed, when we find out that Weisz has written a story about the Queen of Spain (played by Weisz) and a Conquistador (played by Jackman) she sends out to find the Fountain of Youth/Tree of Life with a promise to be his love forever, should he succeed in bringing this elixir back. This access to eternal youth is supposed to miraculously save her and Spain from the corrupt and sadistic vendetta of a High Inquisitor, who means to bleed the Queen and country into catholic compliance. How eternal youth would prevent this devastation, is left to the imagination, one of many pesky details the movie did not chose to deal with.The third story line in this mess, seems to be of a bald Jackman in grey Buddhist robes, meditating on a dead looking tree (which he occasionally nibbles from), in a bubble with him while he periodically gets snappish with various images/ghosts of Weisz.. The Bubble appears to rising through a star nebula. Apparently this relates to a native explanation of the after life, a detail, which we also do not get, until long after we first meet the Bubble. We eventually find out that the tree is supposed to be the barely living spirit of Weisz, which makes the nibbling on the bark a bit disgusting.The movie eventually merges the Bubble with the Conquistador and the Tree of Life, to the inevitable co-joining of all, although we never get a chapter explaining how Jackman and the tree ended up in the bubble.Overall, I felt that the characters were shallow and unlikable, the cinematography dismal and dark, the acting, meh and the story  little more than meaningless posturing, riddled with cliches'.	1.0	Chaotic and unpleasant.	2013-02-18	6	2	4

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ARD0370K9J7LF	DistantRhythm	"One of the most brilliantly poetic movies I've ever seen, ""The Fountain"" encompasses quantum physics, love and devotion, highly emotive performances and incredible effects.While the writer and director, Aronofsky, has already proven his progressive and visionary credentials with his past efforts (""Pi: Faith in Chaos"", and ""Requiem for a Dream""), this effort seems more hopeful in its message.Not so much about time travel, ""The Fountain"" explores true love, adventure, absolution, religious archetypes and eternal life in a plot that spans at least a millennia--from pre-history to the end of time.If you're a sci-fi buff, I guarantee you've never seen a spaceship, or a vision of deep space, quite like what you'll see here.If you were turned off the first time you saw it, try giving it another watch, and try to actually pay attention this time. The Fountain may not be for everybody, but I know I got a lot more out of a second viewing.The first time around it was a little confusing. Remember the first time you had sex?

While I don't think this film is genius, it is beautiful to look at and experience if you have the patience for poetic, non-linear storytelling.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1PL080YIFOSSC	"DL Nels ""no one is listening"""	So I finally saw The Fountain. I'll admit that I was very intriguedfrom the get-go. It's Aronofsky. He's not a veteran, it's not like whenScorsese has a new film coming out, but I was excited. Pi is a greatfilm and Requiem is problematic, but a good film. Also the knowledgethat it had taken him nearly six years to finish this film intriguedme.The film is totally misrepresented by the trailer. It's not really as'sci-fi' as they want you to think it's going to be. (Which, though noteveryone will agree, I think is a good thing). It's well shot, HughJackman gives a solid performance. But Weisz's character is the stock,moderately eccentric woman that seems to be popping up more and more inAmerican 'independent' cinema. She was Kate Winslet in EternalSunshine, was Julianne Moore in Children of Men, was Nora Zehtner inBrick.The story consists of three separate places, 1500 CE Spain (actuallytaking place in a book Hugh Jackman's character is reading), presentday America, and an undefined futuristic sequence (which may or may notbe nothing more than Hugh Jackman's character trying to deal with hislife). It's high concept and interesting, well shot, and never reallycrosses any dangerous thresholds into the realms of laborious film,but, to say the least, it's problematic.So what do I think? See it. The whip shot motif is beautiful, goodcinematography and an interesting screenplay, but I'm not going to goso far as to say that anyone will actually like it.	3.0	Not what you think it will be, not that great either	2007-05-31	7	4	3

A serious and sad subject like the one tackled here are not my favorite, but other reviews gave it good marks so I tried it.  the biggest disconect for me was the confusing dream scenes, they seemed to distract rather than add to the plot of the movie.

As a Christian myself, and having watched the trailers, I wasn't really surprised by this.The story, for me, lacked resolution.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AOZGOFPVAUMTB	Doug Park	"Just kidding. It is, however, a little melodramatic and preachy in places, and the slow, mournful string concertos playing over and over again in the background tend to overdo the intended mood of THE FOUNTAIN. Another thing: Most of the setting is in the darkness of a medical lab, outdoors at night, or in the depths of outer space. There are reasons for this, of course, but all the darkness requires the audience to adjust their senses and heightens the somber mood even more. Just a little more daylight in key places would have been a plus.Nevertheless, THE FOUNTAIN intelligently takes on some big heady concepts, most importantly, our desire for immortality. As medical researcher Tommy explains, ""Death is a disease, just like any other. There is a cure, and I will find it!"" Does he succeed? It's all debatable, and THE FOUNTAIN does a nice job of showing and telling us just enough while also leaving just enough for the individual viewer to interpret. There are a number of interesting hints regarding the possibility of reincarnation and, barring that, how we live on regardless of whether we continue to live physically and literally.THE FOUNTAIN seems like another obscurantist trying-so-hard-to-be-brilliant film at first, but if you stick with it past the initial 10-15 minutes, the three interrelated past-present-future stories come together very well. A number of other reviewers have described this film as ""a poem,"" and I agree. That being the case, it should appeal to people who like poetry, but those who want a standard movie-film may be a little disappointed by THE FOUNTAIN."	4.0	This Film Is Blasphemy!!!	2013-06-26	1	1	0

They put so much effort with the statement they were attempting to put across in the movie that the story itself started to fall behind the statement making the movie a little difficult to follow and not as good as it potentially could have been.If you are interested in movies that focus on symbolism and figuring out the message they are attempting to pass to you then I highly recommend it.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M	Dr. E	"This film is a artistic masterpiece. Its graceful beauty is does not permit debate. It will be an exquisite experience for any lover of art. The sheer visual originality will transfix the viewer. It is without pretense . . . its message is universal.Here is the caveat: you need not be ""educated"" in film to understand this work . . . you need not be a Ph.D. holder to enjoy its majesty . . . you need not have any background in Early Colonialism to follow Aronofsky's thoughts . . . but you do need to be patient. You need to prepare yourself for a visual experience that rivals Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. You need to surrender yourself to Aronofsky's vision. His non-linear approach may initially confuse the viewer . . . his metaphors may initially frustrate . . . . his repetition may initially annoy . . . but try to understand these aspects as essential to the film's glory. Trust Aronofsky to guide you through the film . . . the more you resist his approach, the less you will be inclined to enjoy it.Some label this film a ""tear-jerker"" . . . this is a terrible misnomer. Aronofsky's work did not steal one tear from my companion or me. This is not as much a work about two people, but is allegorical. So, if you are concerned that this film is a ""romance,"" you can dismiss those fears entirely.This film is similar to neither Requiem nor Pi . . . that is Aronofsky's genius. He is gifted with uncommon range. Moreover, this is not the Hugh Jackman with which many are acquainted . . . his acting is sensitive to detail and strikingly stark.

(You know who you are.)Tarkovsky especially with ANDREI RUBLEV and STALKER, Bergman with too many to count, Tarr with WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES, Jodorowsky with EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, Kubrick with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Dreyer with ORDET and PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (among others I'm sure)----these are among the filmmakers who made (no matter what ""beliefs"" people ascribed to them, right- or wrongly) spiritual films which crossed cultures, ages and belief/non-belief systems to touch something essential in people.Aronofsky is now in their company.  THE FOUNTAIN is a film not of its time.  It will be passed along like a secret from parent to child, friend to friend, person to person years and decades from now.It is a film with not one single accidental element.Every color, every shot and visual effect, every line of dialogue, every prop and costume is a kind of ""book"": at once both emotionally and sensually moving, and also stored with both immediately accessible and esoteric meaning for receptive viewers.I also need to mention that the sound design and music are impeccable, in a time when large-budget films from Hollywood tend to sound ugly, gaudy, busy and obvious.So, it is only natural that a film like THE FOUNTAIN would polarize people, given the intensity of its impact.What bravery allowed a major film studio to bankroll something--twice--that is the product of such a singular vision (although Ari Handel's involvement should not be overlooked)?  And then likely lose money in the process (at least, for now)?I don't know.  But I am grateful.If you are debating whether to watch this film and buy it blind--you might want to rent or borrow first.If you are one of the lucky few who saw it in theaters and are back debating whether it is worth your money--I say, it definitely is.There will even be a select few who will hate the film and then change their minds...but the amazing thing is that THE FOUNTAIN will be the same, and >they&lt; will be different.To use a few of the protagonist's words...this is a film which one day may have ""pulled (you) through time."""	5.0	Possibly the greatest spiritual film of our place and age	2007-05-17	12	9	3

Just watch ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For a Dream,"" and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.""The Fountain"" is basically a sprawling tale that is half ""real,"" half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.""The Fountain"" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy (""There's no hope for us here. There is only death""), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch ""Fountain"" a few times to really ""get it,"" but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising."	5.0	To love forever	2007-03-17	14	12	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AXW1OVBP9WL7J	EB. Seattle	The premise behind the story is painfully simple: a man's struggle to save the woman he loves from dying.First I didn`t know what to think and feel, watching it. First it doesn`t make sense. BUT when we put all 3 parallel stories together, it became something wonderful and breathtaking. First we just watched for the incredible visual effects, and the gorgeous music (Clint Mansell). Now, after watching it 3 times, I LOVE this movie, you just sit down and let it in. I guess people don`t like it who want to`figure it out or solve it`like in other movies, but this one is like a journey, just watch it and enjoy the photographs and the music, and see where it goes, hopefully it will make sense to everyone -if not the 1st but 2nd or 3rd time! Brilliant acting (difficult job), fantastic visual effects and awesome music. Just enjoy it. The film had its world premiere at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2006.[60] Several critics booed The Fountain at the festival's press screening, while the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at the public screening the following evening. It is visually stunning, intellectually and emotionally challenging.The premise behind the story is painfully simple: a man's struggle to save the woman he loves from dying. Tomas, a 16th century conquistador, is seeking the fabled Fountain of Youth to save the life of Spain's Queen Isabel who risks death at the hands of a merciless Inquisition. Tommy, a 21st century medical researcher, is desperate to find a cure for the brain tumor which threatens the life of his wife, Izzy. Tom, a 26th century explorer, is making a long and desperate journey, seeking to save what he believes to be the very essence of life itself. In the end all three are the same man, wrestling furiously to answer the same questions about life and love.	5.0	Overwhelming, Sad and Beautiful	2009-12-27	9	7	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3VPD5EH5B7LH9	Ecce Nihil	"I spent most of this movie disliking it, but the final scenes, or at least my understanding of them, saved the movie in my mind. Most of the time though I was thinking it was the very definition of the word self-indulgent, in that it indulged in the concept of the self and the exaggerated and overdone refusal of the acceptance of death. That this character would bleat and hand-wring so much for so long is a little excessive.But given the final scene when he removes himself from the ""mother ship"" (and so relinquishes life) and sits in the lotus position I figure that this portrayal was intentional, because this position is associated with Buddhism and its philosophy of impermanence and not clinging to one's self and so contrasts with the main character's earlier pathetic display. That gives the movie some credit I think. His wife's role is also open to interpretation with respect to this with her insistence that he ""finish it"", i.e. his striving for timelessness, and also the walk in the snow lesson, i.e. valuing the here and now as opposed to the forever after. I also see some linear evolution in the character from the conquistador and his desperate drinking from the tree's sap for his own desperate desire for immortality, to the central character's same desperate desire but for the benefit of his wife, and then finally to the gaining of wisdom and acceptance of death.But I'm not completely convinced, and there does seem to be some other corrupting new age type maudlin spirituality in this movie, so I'm only giving it 4 stars."	4.0	maybe the end justifies the rest	2007-12-30	4	3	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2NSK7CHLCF5EW	E. Godfrey	"The Fountain is one of the most brilliant films I have ever encountered.  If you read the one-star reviews on Amazon, you will find a number of people who didn't understand the film.  I suggest multiple viewings.  It is not to be watched casually over popcorn.For starters, this film gets me to cry EVERY TIME and I've seen it about 8 times now.  This occurs at the end where Hugh Jackman's character ""gets it"" and I'm not one to get leaky when watching movies.  This is my exception.It is easy to get lost in the three layers of the film, so I strongly recommend watching this several times.  Some subtle yet crucial points of the film slip by undetected on the first watching.  To improve your odds of getting this film the first time around, you should keep in mind the following.1.)  Izzy is dying and her husband Tommy is in denial.2.)  The book is a koan or riddle that Tommy must solve in order to move on.3.)  The bubble is actually a spaceship 500 years in the future (so says Aronofsky).If you can keep these three straight, you should have a better chance at seeing through the confusion into the brilliance below.The special effects here are amazing.  On a similar note, so is the commentary on the DVD.  There's tons on neat info, one section of which is on the special effects.  This is a must see.  The visual effects are simply breath taking and I look forward to watching this film in HD.  This is really quite a visual work of art.The theme of the film focuses on death and how people cope with it, seemingly taking a page from K&uuml;bler-Ross's playbook.  Her stages of dying are clearly spelled out in this film and may aid the moviegoer in getting deeper into this film.Overall, I cannot fathom how anyone could not like this film, unless they didn't understand it.  For all one-star nay-sayers, I strongly suggest re-watching it, or perhaps doing some research concerning the themes of this movie.  Here are my brief thoughts on the matter...Spoiler Alert!!!2000's:  Izzy is dying and her husband Tommy is a cancer researcher trying to save her life through research.  Izzy is characterized by calm acceptance and a vague sense of spiritual contentment.  On the other hand, Tommy is in utter denial of Izzy's condition as he is sure that he can beat death through better science.  Through out the film he is in denial, in furious rage and sometimes seemingly bartering with death itself.  While he is off at work, Izzy just wants him to be with her; right here and right now.  This is the primary tension of the film (and K&uuml;bler-Ross's earlier mission), between acceptance and denial.  One could look at the entire film as Tommy's path to acceptance.1500's:  Izzy then begins to realize that Tommy may never accept her mortality, so she begins to write a book about 16th century Spain where she and her husband are the figurative lead characters; Queen Isabella and the Conquistador, Thomas.  This almost functions as a koan written specifically for Tommy's disposition.  In the story, Spain is being crushed by the inquisition and Queen Isabella asks her brave Conquistador to go to Central America to find the tree of life.  If he returns successful, she will be his wife, forever.  This is clearly an analogy of Tommy trying to prolong their lives forever.  But, Izzy has left the last chapter blank.  This last chapter begs the question of how are we to view eternal life.  Is this possible or even reasonable?  Ultimately, what good is it to live forever if we cannot live in the present moment?  This is the perversion that Izzy is trying to get Tommy to see past.  After many centuries (see 2500's below) Tommy realizes that the story must end with the Conquistador dying.  He finds the tree, drinks from its sap and perishes.  The eternal life he sought was the re-birth of flowers springing up from his body.  The moral, that Izzy tried to teach him in life, was that every death is a sacrifice so that life may continue.2500's:  We are to assume that Tommy beat death through scientific research.  His wife is now reborn in a tree which Tommy has scooped up in a spherical, transparent spaceship bubble and is heading to a dying star of Mayan mythology in the hopes of rebirth.  He is still, after all this time, completely oblivious to his feelings about his wife's death.  The resolution of the film comes when he finishes the final chapter of his wife's incomplete book.  Here, he finally confronts the idea that he is in fact going to die.  The look on Jackman's face in this scene as his face beams in a smile with tears flowing down his face is absolutely amazing.  ""I'm going to die"" he says.  I'm getting shivers just writing about it."	5.0	A Powerful and Stunning Film with Breathtaking Special Effects.	2009-10-30	15	12	3
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1EAN2SFKYBJ05	E. Hunter Hale	I became interested in seeing THE FOUNTAIN when someone compared it to Terrence Malick's current film THE TREE OF LIFE. And I wasn't disappointed. Like THE TREE OF LIFE it is a film that invites a second or third viewing. It's nice to see something a little different that makes you think. The EXTRAS are worth studying also. The interview with Hugh Jackman is interesting and the section showing how several of the spectacular special effects were put together is fascinating.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AGZK3IZXF72TY	Elizabeth	The Fountain is one of those films that people love or hate.  I LOVE it!!!  The bad reviews come from those who simply did not grasp the themes and messages being portrayed. There are some spectacular five star reviews that explain the details quite proficiently so I will not get into that here.  If you are someone who has ever pondered life and death, re-birth and immortality, and the meaning of it all...this is a film for you.  If your mind is trapped only in the shallow, vain glories of daily physical existence, you will be one of the ones who hated it.  So many times I read reviews and wonder at people's utter lack of comprehension.  The key is to determine what the film is trying to accomplish, and whether or not it does that.  Just because someone did not understand or have an interest in that message does not mean the film is bad. The Fountain is a brilliant and breathtaking film with deep, thought provoking themes.  Hugh Jackman is amazing as he brings to life multiple dimensions of his character through several lifetimes!  Truly provocative!	5.0	Intellectual and Transcendent	2012-12-17	2	1	1

The connection that is shared with all.It represents the circle that life and time is.  With out death, your cannot have life, and vice versa.

Rachel Weisz plays his beautiful wife to such a fine degree that we fall in love with her character(s), as this takes place both in the present and in the past, guided by her in-progress novel of the Spanish Inquisition and the Queen's (Weisz') search for the Tree of Life through the efforts of her Captain of Conquistadors (Jackman).

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A29IFODT9Z1WQN	Erick Pleitez	As a Aranofsky fan, I was pretty bummed when this movie was cancelled the first time (Brad Pitt left the project).  So I was glad when it was resurrected, but for some reason or another I didn't see it at the theaters.  I finally have this on HD DVD, and it is intriguing, imaginative, and it has some of the most dazzling images I've ever seen.  I won't go over the plot, but I will say that it is basically a love story mixed in with the search for immortality.  You might want to watch it two to three times to soak it in.  The story lets you draw your own conclusions, but if you think about it, you will learn the meaning behind the ending.  Overall, its a great movie,though it's not for anyone who doesn't like to be challenged by their entertainment.As for the HD DVD, I give the PQ a solid 4.5 out of 5.  There are many amazingly sharp images throughout, some of the best on the format, particularly the Mayan and spaceship scenes.  The soundtrack fits in perfectly and is quite amazing as well.  A worthy purchase.	4.0	Great movie, worthy watch if you like open-ended films	2007-06-09	7	3	4
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1FMJJKSVQDDQ	Eric S. Kim	"Make no mistake, this one of Aronofsky's greatest works of art. The way he unfolds all three stories (past, present, and future) into one coherent whole is something that we don't regularly see in films these days. The overall vision of The Fountain reminds me of Stanley Kubrick: I'm not saying that Aronofsky is nowhere near as good as Kubrick (who is one of my favorite directors), but Aronofsky does seem like the new Kubrick of our generation. I'm hoping he continues to make these sorts of films so that they could dazzle us straight through.The only problems I had with the film were the extreme closeups of Jackman and Weisz. They were so close to the camera that I sometimes had to look away. But nonetheless, Jackman and Weisz gives astonishing performances. Jackman especially knows how to look and act like an obsessive man who will stop at nothing in finding eternal life. He should've been nominated for an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe.So mix in Aronofsky's visual creativeness, Jackman and Weisz's great acting, Clint Mansell's minimal and often meditative music score, and you've got a visual masterpiece. I think it's time for me to watch ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", too.Grade: A-"	5.0	""". . . You pull me through time."""	2009-04-15	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2F1P10GGZ7K2T	Erik1988	"First time I saw it I was wowed by the visuals and emotions and acting but I didn't get it. Second time I saw it I figured out what was going on. Third time I saw it was on my plasma with 5.1 surround sound and it was awesome!In a nutshell: He's in the future remembering the ""present"" and his wife is writing about the past and all three stories converge.But the story is so much more than that. Its a mixture of Christianity and pagan mysticism. A theme of life blossoming from death.First off, each time I become more impressed with Hugh Jackman's acting in this flick. He deserves an oscar nomination. This is ligh-years beyond (pun intended) his ""acting"" as Wolverine or anything else I remember seeing him in.Racheal Weiz always does a fantastic job, and thankfully a much more upbeat character than in the Constant Gardner in my opinion.The second greatest part of this movie after the acting is the writing. The story is full, I mean full of symbolism and metaphores.As the three stories unfold and the parallels between them become clearer; the viewer becomes transported into an emotional nuclear explosion as you you get hit with the message of the theme and glory of discovery from not one but three stories at the same time. A masterfully imaginative and well written script. Another oscar should be awarded for the screenplay.The music and visuals I'll throw into my final point. The music pulls at the emotions as it is choregraphed expertly with storyline. As the visual and musical climax with the story's climax, it hits you hard and leaves you stuttering the word, ""w-w-Wow!!"".OVERALL:This is in my top 10 all time favorite movies now.Its a thinking person's movie and takes more than one sitting for most to ""get it"". Each viewing you'll pick up on more details and can grow to appreciate this movie on a new level. In a time of remakes and crap B-quality movies and abysmall screenplays (anyone say Ghost Rider!) coming out of hollywood, I wish this movie gets a growing fanbase because it deserves it. Bravo!

It was significantly more powerful, and even more impressive.

I have to say after watching it my wife and I were very moved by it and could see why our friend recommended it.  Embedded in the main storyline of the centuries long journey of two ""soul mates"" are deep metaphysical/esoteric concepts of reincarnation, the karmic wheel of life, death and rebirth; and, perhaps --- I may be getting more out of it than others will --- the long journey each soul takes through repeated incarnations in order to reach the next level of existence ---- I gathered this from the repeated scenes of Hugh Jackman's character at the ""Tree of Life"" floating in space like a miniature Garden of Eden.  But, ultimately it was the ending that convinced me of the concept of Spiritual ""Ascension"" into a higher level of existence.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC	Ethan D Van Vorst	"Did you know that most libraries have movies and tv series on VHS or DVD? This came as something of a surprise to me until my wife, who is a librarian, started bringing home some DVD's for viewing. She says that they're largely ""contributions"" from various patrons, which explains why most of them are usually not that good. Thus it can be surmised that one local patron considered ""The Fountain"" as weird and at times incomprehensible as I did, and quickly ""donated"" it to the local library.I've seen some really weird films in my day, but this one ranks right up there with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", whose ending I still to this day have not been able to figure out. When the wife brought it home from the library and said ""It's got the romance angle for me and some action for you, according to the back of the box"", I should have known better, but I played along. The film stars Hugh Jackman (Wolverine from ""X-Men"") and Rachel Weisz (the lovable librarian heroine from ""The Mummy"" movies) as his dying wife. Jackman's characer, Tom Creo, is a research doctor who is trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, who inadvertantly stumbles across a concoction that imbues upon test subjects seeming eternal youth. Tom wants no part of that nonsense as he's after the cure for cancer, not agelessness, despite numerous objections from his medical staff and his boss, who throws unintentional roadblocks in front of him from time to time. The finding of the cure for his wife's illness has clearly become an obsession for Tom and he forgoes all other things (including his wife's affections for the most part) in his race to come up with a cure overnight.Now, that plot sounds reasonably cogent, right? The director, Darren Aronofsky, then injects two side-stories into the mix, which tends to muddy up the waters a bit and can make following this otherwise beautifully styled movie into something a bit confusing. First there's the side story of Tomas, a Spanish conquistador (Jackman) who is given the quest of finding the lost Tree of Life by Queen Isabella (Weisz) which is located somewhere in the New World in the realms of the Mayan people.Then there's a third bizarre side story of a bald and tattooed Jackman flying through space in a giant bubble with a tree in it heading towards the Orion Nebula. This portion of the movie was definitely the most off-putting and perplexing to both me and my wife as it contains the most meta-physical aspect of what the director was trying to say in the movie.And what exactly was he trying to say? Well, you see, the movie is about how we deal with death, and eternal life, as well as reincarnation (sort of) and an abundance of spiritual themes. The manner in which he tries to show us how these themes interweave is what most people will probably find confusing as he uses three separate stories to tell the same tale. Consider the ""Tomas the Conquistador"" story to be straight allegory of Dr. Tom Creo's quest for the cure. The spacy ""Tom in the Bubble"" story is a more spiritual symbolic translation of this quest. Each is designed to look at the same story through different styles, and all tend to interweave with the others.But it is very confusing and off-putting, as I mentioned earlier, and a lot of people who view it aren't going to A. Get it, or B. Like the way the story/s are told. For his part Jackman was a very sympathetic and grounded individual whose character you can't help but like in any of their 3 respective incarnations, but poor Rachel Weisz...her characters (Queen Isabella, Izzy the dying wife, or ""Space Tree"") all come off as portraying her as a kind of otherworldly weirdo. More than once my wife and I exchanged puzzled and none too perplexed looks at each other after hearing some of her rather hokum-enriched and spooky comments. In fact it was our impression that she wasn't entirely banging on all cylinders, which is sad since we're supposed to feel sympathetic for her character. This is impossible to fulfill totally when the person you're supposed to feel sympathy for has a nasty side-tendency to creep you out a little bit at the same time. Kind of like Carrot Top.To those who leave comments that suggest that I'm ""too dumb"" to see the beauty and true meaning of the movie, I feel I've explained this adequately enough in such a fashion that proves that I am not too dumb to understand. On the contrary, I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish and applaud his attempt, it's just that the ultimate screen version is a bit too new-agey for a traditional ""I like plots that make sense"" kind of guy like me. If that kind of movie is your cup of tea then you'll love this movie. If it's not, as with me and my wife, then you'll probably want to keep browsing for something else."	3.0	Quirky movie	2007-12-10	5	2	3

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2LYW9EAY8M1X0	Evermind	"One of the few masterpieces of film in recent years. It is many years ahead of its time, and certainly not for everyone. If you have already experienced the sentiments expressed by this film, you'll find them echoed in it beautifully, but if you've never wondered about the kinds of issues the film handles, you'll find yourself bored to tears or groaning at its earnestness. It is too strange, too abstract for the everyman, but that's fine, because it reaches right to the core of its intended audience.Without any doubt Aronofsky's most mature and well-crafted effort - he has grown leaps and bounds since ""Requiem for a Dream"" and this is definitely his most intensely personal film to date. He has managed to reach inside himself, draw out and present - for the first time, I feel - some very ineffable and sublime emotional aspects that are a part of every human being. Compared to his two previous films - which felt more like ""hey, that's a cool/interesting idea, let me explore it..."" - he has truly managed to do the job of an artist, which is to move people in ways they won't easily forget and ultimately have a lasting impact on them.Art film as art film was meant to be. And did, in the time of the old masters (Bergman, Tarkovsky, Kurosawa, etc): not pretentious, not laden with ""emotional pornography"" or excessive sex/intellectualism but the most brutally honest expression of people who have studied human psychology/spirituality for years and synthesised it into a narrative."	5.0	A masterpiece	2007-04-30	35	28	7

The movie is like a beautiful and intriguing puzzle, but the trouble is that in the end the pieces never actually fall together to form a bigger picture. Which ultimately leaves the viewer confused, unsatisfied and sort of empty. The performances by Jackman and Weisz are absolutely wonderful, and the visuals are stunning. But apart from that... It just didn't do it for me. I need a STORY. The Fountain gives us tidbits, but no involved storyline or in-depth character development. Besides, I feel somewhat cheated... The way the previews misrepresent this film is almost criminal. They make it seem as thought this is The Highlander plus depth and minus the action, the story of a man who is living forever and trying to save his dying wife over and over and over. This is NOT what it's about. Not even close.	2.0	They lost me	2008-07-26	3	1	2

I learned that you should not eat too much from the tree, or you will become one.  I also learned that the earth needs more help (like not shaving too much - less razors to cut the ground)!!  Wolverine is a man who sometimes floats in space (I think to be punished for using the tree for shaving) and other timings is staring at a woman who is fuzzy.  It reminds me of the show with Mr. Bruce Willes and the woman from the 80's who solved mysteries - much like Wolverine tries solving for the fizzy woman in the movie!!  She looks at the camera a lot and sometimes he is remembering her looking at the camera.  I think he was also sad, especially when he floated in the bald and was talking to the tree.  Overalls I would bestow more stars if the movie had more mystery villians and less fuzzy staring; it is nice too watch, but is almost like making a puzzle instead of breaking it apart.

I hear that 2001: a space odyssey had lots of detractors when it was first released. so i was hoping for a misunderstood masterpiece. well, once again in life, my hopes were dashed. whereas 2001 (stanley kubrick's masterpiece) is understated, with brilliant low-key performances by the actors, this is overly-melodramatic B-movie mediocrity. I turned it off at the 80 minute mark. i didn't care about these people at all, because they obviously were not real people. they were actors through and through. bad actors to boot. stiff, bad actors in a silly movie that could have been made for TV back in the 70'S. nothing about this film was convincing. it was not hard to follow, it just stunk. if you like this sort of thing, more power to you. i wish you well.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A32QHJBNX62YBT	Frow	I finally had the chance to watch The Fountain the other night with my wife.  Agree with many that this is an absolutely gorgeous film, with little stylistic details for those paying attention(the repeat of him whispering into her neck/the tree, the flip shot of him driving into what looks to be Philly and the flip shot of the horse carriage going to the Spanish city).  The non-CGI effects were phenomenal to behold, though I wonder if the Blu Ray/HD DVD transfers were better.  There seems to be macroblocking and poor detail in some places.Now for the story, which is the devisive element in reviews.  My background is that I have 2 brain cells to rub together with a history of watching everything from Hollywood bubble gum epics to occasional French films that interest me but confuse me to no end.  I can say after the first watching of the Fountain I was not sure what happened and was left with that spacey feeling that I had just watched something amazing but couldnt quite get my head around it.  But the great thing is that it sparked a discussion of what we felt Aronofsky was trying to say and an examination of our own beliefs about life, death and the afterlife.  This is certainly not something we do everyday so I commend the director and his vision.  I also readily admit that I did some research on other sites to help me with my interpretation of this film, which I know is cheating but I couldnt resist.I loved that there was so much open to interpretation with his liberal mixing of various religions and cultures.  I can see how some fault him for style over substance in his movies, but I failed to see this movie as the pretentious exercise that many reviewers noted.  I thought the 2 lead performances really anchored the picture and I am not sure Brad Pitt could have really pulled this role off.It actually made me think for once so I applaud this movie and would highly suggest it to anyone.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1US8UAPHMFBKW	"Gayle ""brighttyger"""	How could anyone with eyes in their heads be bored by this film?  It is dazzling.  Each shot is beautifully conceived, and each cut relates to the other impeccably.  The use of color and light are exquisite.  Maybe a minute of the whole film did not work for me, where the images got too over the top or repetitive, otherwise it was perfection.  I felt the same way about Hugh Jackman's performance.  Fabulous, with a few moments of over the top.  Not hard to forgive when he gives his full heart to the character.  Rachel Weisz was wonderful, and they were great together.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that this is not Sci-Fi.  It is metaphysical.  The heroine has written a book about a quest of two lovers for eternal life.  We see the story of the book entertwined with the present day events.  The book is unfinished, and she has asked her lover to finish it.  The futuristic version is his attempt to do so.  He is emotionally traumatized, and these story lines are woven together as memory haunts him, and he struggles to reach acceptance.  Initially they seem haphazard, but they build to the climax of the film.  The director knew what he was doing every step of the way.  This is an enthralling, amazingly beautiful movie that should be seen with an open mind, open heart, and wide open eyes.	5.0	Gorgeous Gorgeous Gorgeous	2006-12-07	8	6	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ANAFBNU1MPA9B	Glenn Davy	I saw this at the movies and whilst not blown away, walked away feeling intrigued.  I then got it on DVD and slowly I have pieced it together.  I just found myself returning to it and watching it again and again until I realised that this is easily one of my favourite movies of all time (my other one is The Sheltering Sky, so what do I know about popularity).  It was almost like the movie had some answer to life in it that I had to sort out for myself.Now, I am not going to insist that no one can have an opinion on this movie until they have seen it ten times, but really, the more often I saw it it all started to make sense until I found it complete enough that it was no longer a mystery.  I now get what this movie is about and love it.But know this, in my opinion, the first part where Jackman plays a conquistador (spelling?) is merely the reinactment of the story of Izzies Book, nothing more.  Know that and the rest makes much more sense (maybe I was the only idiot out there who thought all three characters were the one biological organism).

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1G7Z80CW7MXJO	"Good_N_Affordable ""Good_N_Affordable"""	This is actually a great movie, despite a couple of questionable decisions in its flow and chronology. Grea movies... aren't always fun. This is not a 'light' movie and I didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. It's actually a lot of work on the part of the viewer. But it is fascinating, and as much as there is going on in it, and there is a LOT going on, I found myself adding it to my list of all-time great movies even as I was struggling to comprehend what was happening in it. The acting in it is impressive and I found myself giving the actors all kinds of props, just realizing how hard this movie must have been to grasp and conceive of prior to editing and final drafts. How Hugh Jackman could muster such genuine emotion in such a broken up, interrupted maelstrom of scenes is beyond me, but others would have failed miserably, I think. Rachel Weisz was okay, but unremarkable, since she was essentially reacting the same character from The Mummy in a different movie. In all fairness, her part didn't present as much obvious challenge, so it probably doesn't reflect her talent or skill.Overall, if you are interested in movies as someone who does or would like to make them yourself, this is a goldmine. If you're looking for entertainment or to kill some time, it's probably too overwrought and rich.P.S. It's best to watch it and interpret according to your own intuition of the resounding themes and emotions expressed in this film. To read a breakdown of the three separate narratives in a lot of online reviews spoils it, since the physical specifics of the different narratives are secondary to the implication of something eternal taking place.	4.0	Heady Goldmine for Movie Makers and Screenwriters	2014-02-11	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A304QY7DUT9J4C	Graybot	The Fountain is a great film that is unfortunate enough to be judged not on its merits but rather on its troubled production. The budget was slashed, scenes eliminated, and running time cut short. For all that, it manages to feel epic in 96 minutes, using an economy of narrative that many bloated films could learn from. The more fantastical scenes are just that- fantastical- and if you're willing to let dreams be dreams and fairy tales be fairy tales, there is so much to love about it. Hugh Jackman is persuasive as an obsessive, and Rachel Weisz is something like the opposite of a manic pixie dream girl. The science in the film is nonsense, but outside of a biopic about a famous scientist, I can't see how that could possibly matter. All that, and it is beautifully shot, all golds and greens, the limited budget never apparent. What is it about? Love and the fear of losing it.	5.0	Unheralded greatness.	2013-11-29	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1IEKLX61FF05B	"G. Rickard ""Movie Enthusiast"""	I did not see this movie in the theater, and part of me wishes that I had because the visuals of this movie are incredible. I happened upon this movie in the rental store, and I am glad I did. The first time I watched it I did not fully 'get' the movie, but there were enough themes revealed that I knew there was more than what was on the surface. Many critics thought the plot was muddled and to 'new-age', but you have to pay attention to the movie to really understand the themes that are interwoven between the three story lines. Racheal Weiss and Hugh Jackman are the main characters, and I think they perform admirably.To fully understand the movie you have to study it and determine what is real and what is symbolic. Some call it a sci-fi movie, and I don't get that at all. I think it is first and foremost a love story between a man and his dying wife. A lot of the movie focuses on some deep topics regarding death, and how some people learn to not fear it while others are terrified of it.Watch the movie with an open mind and try and pick up on what the director is trying to say. There are some parts of the movie I am still confused about, but the second time I viewed it I found a lot of what I was looking for, and I suppose future viewings will reveal more clues. If you were to watch this movie just for the visuals and not look for the themes in the movie, you will likely despise the movie and feel that watching it was a waste of time. I think in due time people will realize this was a sleeper movie and opinions on it will change.If you watch the extras you learn that WB pulled the plug on the film and it was originally shot in Australia. Later the director shot it as an independent film in Montreal, Canada.I'd compare this film to 'Bridge of Terabithia', because the trailers for it lead you to beleive it is a fantasy movie. In reality, it is not. If you saw that movie you know what I am talking about. The trailers lead you to beleive 'The Fountain' is something it is not, when actually what it is is more than meets the eye, which is a great thing for a movie to achieve. So many Hollywood movies are shallow and have no themes.Much of the movie is in the imaginations of the main characters, so as you watch ask yourself is it real or part of their imagination...This is certainly a movie that some will love and others will hate. Some will simply dismiss it as garbage. If you have not seen it do yourself a favor and spend a couple of bucks at the video store, or put in on your Netflix list. If you like movies that make you think, I think you will enjoy this one.I watch next to nothing on TV, but I own 100s of DVDs and watch about 4 new movies a week.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A13TO5TU4A68LD	Gryphonisle	"""The Fountain"" is a movie that unfolds in three sections, all of which are related (the Tree of LIfe) although they don't necessarily work together to forward the plot.  The main story is a fairly tragic love story between an oncologist and his beautiful young wife, who is dying of cancer.  He's not just a doctor though, he's also a scientist, and his race through animal tests to find a cure eventually succeed, but...  These  characters are pretty to look at, live and work in dark but pretty surroundings, but mostly just smile and moon over each other so the audience doesn't quite form the attraction to them that would have made the movie work with this story alone, so, another layer is added, from a book the wife is writing called ""The Fountain"" (which, like the movie, is about the Tree Of Life, not a fountain).  The book is set in the Spanish Inquisition and features something of a love story between Queen Isabella and a Conquistador (also played by Jackman and Weisz) where he goes off to find the actual tree, in Mayan lands.  This story---the book---is performed, instead of being read by one the characters, so it could be mistaken for part of the real-life timeline of the story and probably is, by some.  It's not all that confusing, or shouldn't be to anyone paying attention in the least.The third ""story"" is more of a moving image with minimal dialog.  A bubble of unknown construction is floating in space, into a nebula, a dying star the movie identifies as the source of the Mayan Creation Story.  Jackman and Weisz show up here too, and the tree seems to take on the role of Weisz after (spoiler avoidance).  It seems that by taking the tree to the dying star it will be reborn as the star explodes.  Jackman by now has lost his hair---all of it, even the five o clock shadow, and is alternately shown in the bubble in black space-age meditation clothes, and, floating about, meditating out of the bubble.  How they got there, when this part of the movie takes place, and why the tree of life itself has to die to live, let alone how it's going to live in outer space amidst an exploding nebula is the sort of ""Hollywood twaddle"" that drives a lot of people crazy..But as others have noted, it does indeed look pretty.  Not Kubrik stunning, it goes on way too long for that level of drama to be sustained, but it is pretty.Over-all, this is modern entertainment which aspires to being so much more than it is.  Like ""Lost"" it uses cherry picked spiritualism from different religions to add an air of spiritualistic mystery in order to give depth to a story that lacks it.  ""The Fountain"" at its heart, is a tragic love story that isn't developed enough to stand on its own;  by adding two other stories that are essentially also free-standing, but unable to stand on their own either doesn't help.  In short, it's a very wobbly three legged table, don't set too much on it.  On the other hand, it is pretty, and if you don't invest too much energy into it, it's quite watchable."	3.0	Standard-Issue Tragic Romance In Sci-Fi/Spiritualistic Wrap	2013-10-14	3	2	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	APRVKZZLIZUSJ	Handsome-Jeff Friedberg, an Author and Media-...	"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!But it's just my interpretwtion---everyone will have their own....Unquestionably Darren Aronofsky is a genius--but he's an artistic genius, which is different, much edgier.There is nothing in this work that is not brilliantly symbolic of something else. Soft orange electric lamps are like the lambent torchlight of other sequences in past eras. A great mystic tree is the Tree Of Life, the World Tree of many diverse mythologies. Snow is death and a harbinger of it. A story is written in an old fashioned notebook that must be unbound to be opened and read, just as life is a mystery to be unlocked and read. Even a monkey named Donovan has his use (Donovan's Brain, 1953.) You get the idea.Look for the magnificently layered feast of imagery, symbolism, and mythology Aronofsky serves up. It is as thrilling and emotionally overwhelming as its exquisitely unresolved musical score, endlessly dark, poignant, forward-moving, unending.The Fountain is a work in three acts, with three separate--yet blended--components in each act that are revealed simultaneously. A brilliant young scientist and researcher, Tom, seeks to conquer death in time to save his dying wife, Izzi; for him, ""death is a disease"" that needs to be cured. This is his life when it was ordinary for him, before passing over a threshold from which he can never returnIn a harmonic insertion, his dying wife, Izzi, is writing a book with old time fountain pen and ink, a mystic Romance of love, conquest, and death that takes place in Spain during the Inquisition. All but the last chapter is finished, which she wants Tom to write after she's gone, ""Finish it..."" is her recurrent refrain. Izzi's book serves as an explanatory supplemental structure, lattice, or parable for their mutual battle or acceptance of or against her own imminent death: she is resigned to death; he never can be.Tom views this tragic love story from his present, his point of view, which appears to us as the future. Like pages turned back from the future, Tom, made immortal by the medicinal bark of the mystic tree, looks back on all this--his past ordinary life as a scientist researcher--his life and love with the now deceased Izzi. Also, from out of the future, Tom dreams his ""role"" as a character in Izzi's book, a devoted Conquistador who battles death itself--and discovers immortality in a mystic Mayan Tree Of Life.But Tom--reluctant here in the future--must eventually pass through a---to him---terrifying doorway of no return to achieve his Goal. He wrestles with his own imminent personal conquest of death here in the future, which is to receive death, by choice, like a gladiator sworn to his oath might receive death, not willingly, but with acceptance and duty.This is a complex presentation. How does all this come about, movie-wise?As the film plays through, Tom's point of view shifts through time and space--and therefore reality--from his (futristic) present to his own past, but also through imagination and visualization as he reads Izzi's book, which is another realm, of form and idea, where he is symbolized by the unnamed Conquistador.In The Fountain, the Present is actually taking place only in the ""futuristic"" scenes, where Tom--immortal--is in a trans-stellar container, a ""bubble"" or egg that falls endlessly through space toward a dying star which will go nova. When Izzi died--four hundred years ago, Tom planted a seed-pod over her grave, which grew into a great mystic tree that numinously now holds her life force and soul. This is nuanced and foreshadowed frequently by The Tree Of Life theme that weaves through the movie--death and regeneration, a mythology of planting and harvest, not of the hunter-killer. Tom has that great tree with him in a star-craft which journeys now through space toward its dark destination.Tom and his vehicle are meant to be reminiscent of the Star Child that awaited rebirth in the movie 2001. Tom's conveyance contains him and also the great tree that grew long ago and, Druid-like, drove its roots into the Under World of Izzi's grave. It now holds the life-force or soul of Izzi. Its medicinal bark, or her essence, is what keeps Tom alive, or progressing, through time as he journeys toward his destiny.Izzi's ghostly leitmotif, admonishment and refrain to Tom, ""Finish it,"" means: finish the story--finish your life with death, for Immortality is not Human.Tom flashes back to a scene rerun where Izzi asks him to walk with her in the snow--death--which he refused to do the first time she asked him--in the beginning of the movie. Now, in the future, he chooses to finally take that walk with her into the white expanse of forever.Now, here, in the 25th Century, Tom finally meets that destiny as he sails to the star, Xibalba--the Mayan underworld, which is another recurrent theme.

That said, if you watched it and understood it like I did, than not one person would hate this movie. It's a film about love, death, sacrifice, and will.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A390XDIQM6313Y	HHalls	This is one of my all-time favorite movies to date.  This is a great, abstracted love story that, if you allow it, will pull on your emotions through time and space.  I'm sure you can read into this movie with all sorts of philosophical titles and theories and bla bla bla, but that is not the way to watch this.  I won't say that you should simply watch this film without thinking, quite the contrary, but to muddle the experience by deconstructing the film via a lens of preconceived notions on love, space, time etc is simply wrong.  I think of this movie more as a visionary poem that should simply be allowed to unfold.As the story develops, I can't help but identify with Jackman's character's devotion to his wife, the sorrow at not being able to change their circumstances, and the thought of the void that would fill the space in one's life once filled by that loved special loved one.  This story could simply have been told in a single string of a scientist and his dying wife in modern times, but imaginative use of time and space to illustrate the undying spirit of pure love in this narrative is so inspiring and thought provoking.  To analyze it is to kill the message, the message being to connect with the characters on an emotional level.There is no mystery to this movie if you have the capacity to do so, but the way the message is presented here (which it is shown in so many movies already without the inspiration of this one) is simply visionary, captivating, and truly heartfelt.  This film will remain one of my absolute favorites for a long time to come.  Enjoy with an open mind!	5.0	Excellent visionary emotional tale.	2013-04-05	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1KLG8F5APLM2N	h	"I had no preconceived notions when I sat down to view this film.  I was tempted to read reviews and glad , instead  that my eyes watched the film untainted and in utter enchantment.  This film fits no genre and cannot be cataloged with ease.  As an artist, I was enraptured by the surrealism.  Some scenes are the most awe-inspiring organic moments ever captured on film.  Others bring to mind the tormented yet serene imagery of Dali.  If the film had no sound whatsoever, I would have loved it enough based solely on it's appearance.The love story of The Fountain is majestic and mysterious.  This is a love that transcends time and space.  If you focus on the multi-linear aspect of the plot, you will lose the fragility of the love between the characters.  Prepare to be overwhelmed with emotion and imagery - this is eye candy for the philosophical sci-fi lover.  The Fountain encompasses many ideas, emotions, and imagery-perhaps too much for a two-hour film, but I loved it nonetheless.  In my theater seat I was whisked away to Spain, catapulted to the distant stars of the Universe, and grounded by the nature of human existence and love.  In two hours my brain felt as if it had absorbed a library of new emotion-feelings yet to have been branded with a name as simple as ""Love"", ""Hate"", or ""Jealousy"".  I enjoyed The Fountain very much.  I anticipated an immortal love story but saw and experienced much more.  Not since seeing  ""The Passion of Christ"" the day of its release have I been witness to so much silence and introspective chatter at the end of a film. This was a miraculous vision boldly brought to film.Other films you might like if you like ""The Fountain"" : ""Mirrormask"", ""Pi"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""LadyHawke"", or ""Aeon Flux"""	5.0	A Leap of Faith	2006-11-24	6	5	1

This movie is so deep, on so many levels I can't even begin to describe the emotions and confusion. I rated the movie a 5/5 for several reasons. First, I didn't particularly like Hugh Jackman' acting until this movie. He expanded my mind about his talent within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Second, the spiritual suggestions about the movie are not blunt or overbearing. I am an avid reader of Buddhism and similar Eastern religions, and enjoyed the symbolism in the movie. Third and lastly, the emotional journey you get to live through the characters is absolutely amazing.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1BDJK501QH72G	HugeStakkaBoFan	I'm not going to review the film itself since there are already 82 different versions of that up here. I will however say that, true to form, Warner Brothers has cut every possible corner in bringing this title to home video. The sound is decent, but the video transfer is atrocious, laden with posterization and other compression artifacts. For a film whose footage is primarily low-key, maintaining shadow detail is of the utmost importance, and WB really dropped the ball in that department. Aronofsky has already said he will probably have to redo the entire thing as a special edition at some point in the future when time and funding permits, and it's easy to see why after about 30 seconds worth of viewing. I'd like to think the Blu-Ray version is a little better, but as I have no intention of spending $1,000 to find out, I'll have to assume the worst and hold my breath waiting for the re-release. Whether you love it or hate it (hint: if you're from Texas, Mississippi or Arkansas, you'll probably hate it), this is a unique film that deserves better treatment.	2.0	Way to cheap out, Warner Bros.	2007-05-15	14	9	5
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AP0WYCRLMMRSE	Hugh Vincent	Hugh Jackman is unable to deliver on a weak plot that jerks the viewer back and forth through time between scenes that lack coherence and any semblance of a plausible thread.  The storyline never focuses on one idea, and ends up in a mishmash of ideas drawing very loosely on Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth (presumably where the film gets its title), the Biblical Tree of Life, futuristic science experiments in dimly-lit (?) labs, and a goofy sequence of a shaved-head quasi-Buddhist Jackman floating around in a space bubble in Orion's nebulae.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ARXPEHZJLCMIE	Iaian7	Along with The Fall, Amelie, and Hero, The Fountain is perhaps one of my favourite art films. Utter visual poetry, every scene is built with squares and circles &#8212; lit with pools of light &#8212; rhythmically repeating themes and iconography throughout the circular storyline. And the storyline really is circular; playing out in nonlinear fragments and jumping between the three primary timelines, it doubles back on itself by the end. The ultimate resolution or conclusion can be a little difficult to ascertain the first time through, but repeated viewings bring a little more to the forefront every time. Absolutely worth owning, and the extras give some nice insight into the production process.Darren Aronofsky has talked about the troubled start this film had, with a production start in Australia that ultimately failed, a re-write of the script that was required to fit a drastically reduced budget, re-casting of the characters, and a re-start of the production later on. Well worth it, as The Fountain is an astoundingly beautiful piece of art, though yes, with perhaps a slightly vague storyline at points. While I certainly do not personally agree with some of the theological or religious aspects (and for those concerned, a small amount of nudity), as a starting point for deeper thought and discussion on the matters of death, life, creation, I think it merits viewing. As a piece of art, it is absolutely stunning. Also of note, the Chronos Quartet soundtrack is incredible. Highly recommended!	5.0	Deeply beautiful	2013-03-19	0	0	0

Even if you are not paying attention, this film is visually beautiful, offers a richly textured, moving sound-scape, and will take you by the hand to contemplate the symbolic import of its name. The scenes of raining, golden substance portray a reality so deeply measured that as they call upon the Muse to bring forth a word, she cannot speak, cannot breathe... only teach us silence.	5.0	Mystical Beauty	2014-03-10	1	1	0

Many times during the movie I flashed forward to the day when I will give my wife her last kiss goodbye.  Like Tom, I would do anything to make that day never come.The Fountain is like an emotional planetarium.  Turn the lights out, take a seat, and allow it to take you places that will touch you deeply.The ending is sudden and unexpected in several ways.  Much like love, life and death.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A21XG7UVD2ABKS	Jack R. Tallent	"""The Fountain"" is the story of a man coming to grips with the death of his wife. Ultimately, I believe, it is a tale that illustrates how fear of death prevents one from living.The film presents three intertwined stories, each involving a version of Tom, played by Hugh Jackman. In the modern day, ""real"", story line, Dr. Tom Creo is racing against time to find a cure for the cancer that will ultimately claim his wife, Izzi. In another thread, Tom is a Conquistador searching for the Mayan Tree of Life in order to grant immortality to himself and Queen Isabel (who is another version of Izzi.) In the third story line, Tom is a monk-like star voyager in a golden bubble, in which he travels with a giant tree throughout space.The title of the film, ""The Fountain"", is also the title of a novel written by Tom's wife. In it is the tale of the Conquistador and Queen Isabel. Ultimately, it will be up to Tom to finish this work, and doing so will require coming to terms with the nature of life and death.Perhaps the best thing about this film are the visual effects, which, apparently, made minimal use of CGI, and employed more conventional photographic techniques such as macrophotography.The film's presentation leaves the viewer wondering what it is all about, but the experience can be enjoyed by all as a beautiful narrative about death and life."	4.0	A Visually Beautiful Film	2007-05-29	5	4	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1JDEU2BPUMCVV	James F. McGrath	"Having read a review or two I was geared up to find the movie incoherent; instead I found it fabulous, insightful, provocative and deeply moving. I highly recommend it.The story focuses on two characters, Tommy and Izzi, who are husband and wife. Tommy is a scientific researcher trying to find a cure for cancer, and he has a personal investment in his research, since Izzi has terminal cancer. Izzi is writing a book called The Fountain, and the queen of spain and the conquistador in the story are also Tom and Izzi (and played once again by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz). We also meet Tom in a bald futuristic setting in which Jackman looks remarkably like Peter Gabriel, in which he encounters Izzi in memories and flashbacks, but I will say more about that later. SPOILER WARNING: You may want to buy or rent it and watch it before reading further, although what follows may actually help prepare you for the movie (some viewers whose reviews I read did not seem to follow what was going on).Izzi has come to terms with her death, inspired in part by studying Mayan beliefs about death and the afterlife for her book. She comes to understand that death is as natural as life, that life comes from death. She mentions at one point that her father (if I remember correctly) had a seed planted on his grave, so that now he is no longer there, but has become one with the tree, and whenever a sparrow eats from the fruit of the tree, her father soars with it through the air. Death, she says, is the ""road to awe"".Tommy, on the other hand, views death as simply another disease like any other, for which one day they will find the cure. In fact, his research includes the discovery of a plant, brought back from a South American rainforest, that he hoped would cure cancer, but in fact reverses aging. As it turns out, it also can reverse cancer, but this is not discovered until Izzi has died.Some viewers have interpreted the movie as a true story about individuals who have found the secret of immortality, and so we encounter them across vast stretches of time. This, however, cannot be correct since it cannot make sense of the plotlines. It is a story about Tommy's attempt to find closure, symbolized by his attempts to write a final chapter for Izzi's book, which she left unfinished and asked him to complete.In the far-future space setting, which I understand to be Tommy's inner world, he has in fact discovered the youth-restoring properties of the tree they discovered in South America. He has planted that very sort of tree over Izzi's grave, and she has become one with the tree. In the far distant future, he has taken the tree in a spaceship that is essentially an eco-bubble to the distant star that they Mayans called Shebulba, and which they viewed as their underworld. Izzi had been fascinated with the Mayans' choice of this dying star (as opposed to a healthy one) as their underworld, and Tommy envisages himself taking her (as the tree) there, so that when the star finally dies, she can be reborn. But he is haunted on his journey by Izzi's request that he finish the book, which he still has not done. The tree dies just before they get to Shebulba, just as in reality Izzi died just before they discovered the benefits of the tree extract that could have saved her.Finally, he must come to grips with Izzi's death and say goodbye. He finishes the book. In the last chapter, the conquistador finds the tree of life and drinks its sap, but instead of living forever, plants sprout from him and he is quickly overgrown. In this very symbolic ending, eternal life is shown to consist not in preserving someone or something statically, but in being part of the ongoing cycles of life, the healthy process that is the life of our world and our universe. As the film closes, Tommy plants a seed on Izzi's grave, and says goodbye.The films is full of symbolism, both from Genesis and from elsewhere. Although the movie is called ""The Fountain"" (i.e. of Youth), the key imagery is of the tree of life. This overlaps with Mayan mythology of the First Father who gives his life to create the world, symbolized or thought of as a tree. There are also several moments in the film that begin with an inverted perspective, perhaps hinting that there is a sense in which we see reality inverted, particularly when it comes to death and living forever. And there is the powerful sense that love is the tree of life, since it is in connection with the one we love that we most often use the language of immortality, and most desperately desire to overcome death.The most powerful moment(s) in the film is perhaps the moment that Tommy keeps revisiting in his mind. It was a moment when he was at his lab, and Izzi comes in to tell him that the first snow had begun to fall, and they always would go out to walk together in the first snow. He tells her he cannot, his colleagues are waiting for him, so she goes alone. He revisits this moment more than once over the course of the movie, and the last time he makes a different choice. He goes after her, unwilling to be hindered even by colleagues, and walks with her in the snow. It is at this point that he realizes the meaning of life: not to spend our time trying to make the one we love immortal, but to spend and cherish each moment we have with them.[This review originally appeared on the Exploring Our Matrix blog]"	5.0	The Fountain: Romance, Sci-Fi and Mythology All Rolled Into One	2008-09-18	6	5	1

With it absolutely stunning visuals and emotionally authentic characters and plot, it engages the viewer as much with feeling as it does with content.  As epic as any large-scale movie, and as artistically legitimate, The Fountain is a masterpiece.A caution, though:  The Fountain is not a movie to be taken as a depiction of real life.  It requires suspension of disbelief to truly enjoy it.  Like an expressionist painting, it isn't supposed to be an accurate reflection of what you see, but of what you feel.  If you spend your time while watching the movie trying to resolve the paradox of one person in three roles in the film, you will not enjoy it.  If you accept, though, that a movie does not have to ""make sense"" in the traditional fashion, you will find that this is one of the most gratifying movies you will see."	5.0	Wonderful, With a Caution	2007-03-28	5	4	1

At no point were the characters believable and always incredibly selfish, i.e. screw saving humanity I want to save the one woman I love. People call this movie a poem, perhaps but not a very good one. I'm more of a fan of Keats than Milton though. If you want an incredibly long ""Paradise Lost"", then this may be for you.

If I was casting THAT movie, Jackman and Weisz would be top picks. Alas, I ordered this film site unseen, and it stinks.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AVIRJZ59HYXAV	Janel Evans	The first time I saw this film, I was really young and it was in theaters. I didn't really understand it at the time. This time I really enjoyed it. The film's storyline is non-linear, so it doesn't begin at the beginning and end at the end. If you're a person that prefers  storylines that are simple to follow, I wouldn't recommend this film. That being said, this film is pretty easy to follow as far as non-linear storylines go.I found the central idea intriguing, and I love how it stands apart from just about everything that Hollywood churns out these days. Hugh Jackman is, as always, an amazing actor, and Rachel Weiz does an amazing job as well. The characters feel real and dimensional, and their conflict is really poignant. What's great about it is that you can SEE that dynamic of love and conflict at the same time; there's nothing in the dialogue that points it out -- the acting speaks for itself. The cinematography and use of color (especially gold) provide a subtle continuity to the stories, which allows you to focus on the characters and their story rather than the setting.It's a great film with a great message, and although not everything is revealed (why and how certain things are happening), you don't need to know the history or the science to understand the theme and appreciate the imagery. I really love this film, and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who's looking for something more from their film experience.	5.0	Artistic and Intriguing	2013-07-09	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AFSND7ZMCBTAM	"Jason Czaplicki ""Czaple"""	"While many of the other reviews for The Fountain do a wonderful job of relaying the emotional context of this movie, and the elegant and dazzling cinematography that encompasses it, I'd like to take the opportunity to comment on the Blu-ray edition of this movie.First off, for all you doubters and disbelievers (like myself before purchasing this movie), there is a HUGH difference between watching this movie in 1080p* (high definition) and 480p (standard definition).  The image is much crisper, the lines that separate and define the objects in the movie are well... more defined, and it is just all around a more visually appealing experience.  The movie is also in 1:85:1 ratio, so for those of you who have widescreen televisions you'll be able to enjoy a full screen non-letterboxed experience.  The sound also seems much deeper and comes through my speakers crystal clear.  The one downfall to the Blu-ray edition is that some of the scenes have a lot of image noise in them that I didn't notice in the standard DVD release.  Although, I've seen Aronofsky deliberately create image noise in his other films (PI comes to mind) so this may be intentional.Also of great interest to me was the modified menu for this movie.  It doesn't have a traditional DVD menu.  The DVD menu is completely interactive while the movie is playing.  In other words, you don't have to stop and exit the movie to view the different chapters of the movie, or even view / preview the bonus material for that matter.  The movie has a built in menu that allows you to switch subtitles, language, visually view chapters of the movie and jump between them, and preview the features available on the disc without ever having to stop the movie - this in an interesting diversion from the traditional DVD that has a frontend in which you preview / review the bonus material and then choose to start the movie.  On this disc, the movie starts right away, and then while the movie is playing you can choose to browse the menu.  To me, this is a much better viewing experience, as it avoided all the intro / commercials at the beginning of the disc, and gets you right into the movie without having to go through a half dozen menus.As far as features go, there are many more features on the Blu-ray release than on the standard DVD release.  One of these supplements is the astounding ""Peter Parks montage"" that takes some of the macro-photography used in the movie and sets it to a musical score; beautiful to watch, although I wish it would have been longer.  There are also interviews, VFX documentaries, and storyboards that are not on the standard DVD release.  Anybody who is a fan of this movie and has the hardware should put aside their doubt and get the Blu-ray edition.  It's certainly worth the extra $9 I paid for it.*The movie is 1080p, but the special features are either 480p or 480i."	5.0	Comments on Blu-ray edition	2007-06-25	27	22	5

If you've seen any of Darren's films, you'll understand the format in which he presents his storys. Hugh Jackman's acting has moved me so deeply. He truely is an amazing actor, and Rachel Weisz is just as spellbinding to behold.The story deals with Death and the effect it has on the loved ones left behind. It brought me to tears. The Fountain is something we all can relate to. This has to be one of the most important films I've seen in my life. The range of emotions that the story moves you thru (sadness, grief, hope, release and understanding) has left me with a deeper understanding of the greatest mystery of all time.It has been said ""the only thing the dead know is that it is better to be alive"".

That's the way the [...] review of this flick begins, and they are absolutely right!  Unfortunately, the story does not survive the collision.  According to the ""special features,"" which were even more boring than the movie, the screenplay was written by a graduate student who was ""into the Maya stuff"".  Never buy a screenplay by a graduate student!  Summing up the main character, it seems that he is the world's first, and hopefully only, Roman Catholic-Buddhist Mayan conquistador-doctor-baldheaded guy.  The lighting guy went on and on about ""creating a mood"", but it was almost impossible to see half of the movie because it was so dark.  My mood became one of impatience and exasperation.  The actors has virtually nothing to work with, and will probably bear the scars of this collision for years.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1CIQTLWE6RAZF	"J. Burgos ""I &#60;3 Books & Comics"""	I watched this about a year ago and this film still resonates with vivid images. It is fundamentally a story about loss, death and the nature of mortality/immortality. Intermixed among the film are 3 stories. One set in the present, one in 16th century Spain and one in the far future. The film is lush with imagery, some of which is difficult to grasp due to the fact that the narrative jumps between these 3 timelines.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2CB0DNKYCIQE8	J. C. Amos	"There are few movies I've seen that leave me staring at the screen blankly at the end, but this is one of them.  By the time the credits started rolling, my mind was moving a mile a minute trying to decipher what was going on.  At first I was determined to figure it out and make sense of it all, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that perhaps wondering ""what the hell happened"" isn't really the point.The movie is really three movies in one -kind of- with Hugh Jackman doing a very good job at playing all three leads.  We have him in the past as a Spanish Conquistador searching for the fountain of youth, in the present as a scientist trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, and in the future... well I'm not entirely sure what he's supposed to be, but we'll say an astronaut monk traversing the stars in a bubble containing a dying tree (Let it not be said that Mr Androfsky lacks imagination.) Each thread involves his wife played by Rachel Weisz and his obsession with being with her for eternity.These three parts don't flow in a linear fashion, but toggle back and forth, each coming to a head by the end of the movie.  It's actually not as confusing as it sounds, and I thought I had it mostly figured out... at least until the end when these plot threads start coming to a close.  By the end you're left with many different possible conclusions and the movie can be taken several different ways.  You have to decide what is fantasy and what is reality, but whichever way you take it, the movie tells its message about life and those we love.The acting and scripting in this movie are great.  The imagery is astounding, and from what I hear, done entirely with special effects and no CG whatsoever.  I was captivated by how bizzare and beautiful it is, yet frustrated by the time it was over.  You get the sense that there is something missing, something left unsaid.  I think that's what Androfsky was going for.  Afterall, it is better to leave you wanting more...I recommend this movie to those with an open mind.  If you don't have patience for cryptic and strange stories, this probably isn't for you.  If you've enjoyed movies like 2001 and even Donnie Darko, watch this movie and appreciate it for what it is: a weird but well made piece of cinema art."	4.0	Frustrating, captivating and beautiful	2007-06-24	5	4	1

Plus five delightful years living with my young family in early post-Franco Spain. Plus being a sci-fi nut. The Inquisition led by Torquemada (any resemblance to the man called Moqtada in present-day Iraq is more than coincidental) absolutely destroyed the fabric of Spanish culture for over 500 years: from the Christian defeat of the Moors at Cordoba (do read Michener's Iberia) to the adoption of a modern constitution in 1978. The inquisitors required all Muslims and people of the Jewish faith to convert to Christianity. Those who refused were executed; those who converted were later exiled (e.g. the Sephardic Jews and the Spanish Diaspora.)The production staff of this film is to be congratulated on a totally accurate historical representation (and artistic depiction of Mudejar architecture in Granada.)	5.0	A mix of 2001, Solaris, Apocalypto, and 400 years of Spanish history	2007-03-11	6	4	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2493S5X4C7G2X	Jeff	Rachel and Hugh turn in excellent performances as they always do, but even their considerable talents did not save this movie. Yes, it is touching at times and is filled with some beautiful shots, but all in all it was a struggle to sit through this movie. If your film interests lean towards bizarre and extremely vague plots, you might enjoy this movie. If you prefer a well thought out, gripping, and unpredictable plot to keep things interesting, then you will be completely bored to tears with this film. In my humble opinion, it is one of the least entertaining films I have ever watched.	1.0	Pretty, but boring	2010-10-29	20	5	15

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1EJS4X0KJ9MZH	"Jeffrey A. Friedberg ""Expert On All Things"""	"I saw this Darren  Aronofsky movie three times. Unquestionably Darren Aronofsky is a genius--but he's also a creative artistic genius, which is different.There is Nothing in this work that is not brilliantly symbolic of something else. Soft orange electric lamps are like the lambent torchlight of other sequences. A great tree is the Tree Of Life, the World Tree of many diverse mythologies. Snow is death and a harbinger of it. A story is written in an old fashioned notebook that must be unbound to be opened and read, just as life is a mystery to be unlocked and read, etc., in an almost glimmer of The NeverEnding Story (1984.)Even a monkey named Donovan has his use (Donovan's Brain, 1953.) You get the idea. Look for the magnificently layered feast of imagery, symbolism, and mythology Aronofsky serves, it is thrilling and emotionally overwhelming, as is the endlessly dark, poignant, forward-moving, yet exquisitely unresolved musical score.The Fountain is a work in three acts, with three separate--yet blended--components in each act that are revealed simultaneously.A brilliant young scientist and researcher, Tom, seeks to conquer death in time to save his dying wife, Izzi; for him, ""death is a disease"" that needs to be cured. This is his life when it was ordinary for him.A leitmotif scene is Izzi inviting Tom to walk with her in the blanketing snow outside the lab, which he vehemently refuses to do several times, symbolizing his turbulent denial of death.Meanwhile, his dying wife, Izzi, is writing a book with fountain pen and ink, a mystic Romance of love, conquest, and death that takes place in Spain during the Inquisition; all but the last chapter is finished, which she wants Tom to write after she's gone, ""Finish it..."" The book serves as an explanatory supplement, structure, lattice, or parable for their mutual battle against her own imminent death.From up ahead in the future, made immortal by the medicinal bark of a special tree, Tom looks back on all this--his past ordinary life as a scientist researcher--his life and love with the now deceased Izzi. Also, from the future, Tom dreams his ""role"" as a character in Izzi's book, a devoted Conquistador who battles death itself--and discovers immortality in a mystic Mayan Tree Of Life.But Tom--reluctant here in the future--must eventually pass through a doorway of no return to achieve his Goal. He wrestles with his imminent personal conquest of death here in the future, which is to receive death, but well, and by choice.How does all this come about, movie-wise.As the movie plays through, Tom's point of view shifts through time and space--and therefore reality--but also through imagination and visualization as he reads Izzi's book, which is another realm, of form and idea.When Izzi died--four hundred years ago, Tom planted a seed-pod over her grave, which grew into a great mystic tree that holds her life force and soul. This is nuanced and foreshadowed frequently by The Tree Of Life theme that weaves through the movie.In The Fountain, the Present is actually taking place only in these ""futuristic"" scenes. Tom--immortal--is in a trans-stellar container, a ""bubble"" or egg that falls endlessly through space toward a dying star which will go nova.Tom's vehicle is reminiscent of the Star Child that awaited rebirth in the movie 2001. Tom's conveyance contains him and also the great tree that grew long ago into Izzi's grave and holds the life-force or soul of Izzi.  Its medicinal bark, or her essence, is what keeps Tom alive, or progressing, through time as he journeys toward his destiny.Izzi's ghostly admonishment and refrain to Tom, ""Finish it,"" means finish the story--finish your life with death, for Immortality is not Human.Tom flashes back to a scene rerun where Izzi asks him to walk with her in the snow--death--which he refused to do the first time she asked him--in the beginning of the movie. Now, he chooses to take that walk with her into the white expanse of forever.Now, in the 25th Century, Tom finally meets that destiny as he sails to the star, Xibalba--the Mayan underworld, which is another recurrent theme. Once Tom and the tree of life reach Xibalba, the star explodes, and Tom and Izzi are utterly uncreated--yet merge in cosmic completion, where they will not ""live forever,"" but, rather, will exist together for Eternity.Eternity contains Forever within it, and is absent from both time and space. Therefore, they don't live for eternity, but they are together in Eternity, with the Great Source Of All Things.The End.Do see Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain."	5.0	Darren Aronofsky, The Fountain	2007-06-21	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"There is something going on here. If I were to say that I knew what everything in ""The Fountain"" is supposed to mean, I'd probably be a liar. That said, I feel that I got the general idea. Many people have compared this film's esoteric, pseudo-intellectual appeal to something like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this is a wrong claim to make. There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress but half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.The plot is in three parts: the first of which chronicling Hugh Jackman's 16th century conquistador Tomas' journey into the heart of the Mayan empire to locate the mythical Tree Of Life and reward himself and Queen Isabella with eternal life so as to escape from a dying Spain, the second is set in the 21st century and sees Tommy as a scientist trying to cure his wife of her cancer and, with help from a strange South American tree, stumbling across a potential cure to ageing. Ageing, but not death. The third plot sees a futuristic Tom escorting a dying Tree Of Life (who would have thought that the Tree could die?) into the heart of a dying nebula where both the tree plans to be reborn. The relationship between the plots is blurred and certainly open to interpretation. There is however certain constants throughout each act as it were. Not counting the obvious themes of life, death and love, there are repeated elements of tragedy and noticeable splashes of shared dialogue, imagery and color (especially gold) throughout each different time period. The romance between Tommy and Izzy, particularly in the 21st century time period, is an heart-breaking portrayal of love and loss.If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost; he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character that is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.The film is very much a heavy film if you were for its message and visual experience. It isn't a clear cut adventure film, but one which forces viewers to think. I found out that Brad and Cate was suppose to star in this film but apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior ""Babel.""  Based around the Biblical Tree of Life described in Genesis, I think it is one of the most original pieces of artistry I have seen in quite sometime, but in the other hand is not as clever or deep as it thinks it is."	4.0	[3.5]--Life, death, love, I'm okay with those things	2007-06-20	3	3	0

The Fountain is one of my favorite movies, not only for its visual and auditory beauty, but for the sorrowful, emotional beauty of the story itself. The acting is also phenomenal in my opinion.

Any film that can make Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz look UNattractive is a loser from the start.Miss Weisz is seen mostly with an ugly knitted cap and when she has it off, her hair must have been done in a blender. I would have thought it impossible to have Mr. Jackman look ugly, but he is unrecognizable as the bald ""monk"" in the seqments set in the future. Ellen Burstyn is completely wasted in what is a bit part.SPOILERS:The story is a mess concerned with three searches that are unsuccessful. Why have a monkey's life be saved only to have the doctor's wife die because the cure is found too late. She also askes her doctor/husband to finish a book she is writing but he doesn't. What is the rational behind him turning into the tree of life at the end? By that time who cared.AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2VAH4G2DY2C9D	J. Mahan	"This movie is a puzzle, a gift to its viewers, and although it is different from the traditional ""spoon-fed"" movie its not ""so far out there"" to understand it.It is absolutely imperative to pay attention to every scene, each moment, every spoken word, detail, or thought. Nothing in this movie is superfluous. Each moment is a clue, puzzle pieces that in the end fit together to reveal one of the most profound understandings of what we face as humans: life and death.The riddle to the movie is not as abstract as the movie might depict.First, you should look for the broader theme of the movie: life and death. Yes, this is a love story, but it is not the core of the movie.Second, Darren Aronofsky is very skillful and unique in his directing sequences, which is where I think one might get lost throughout his movie. There are three stories going on at the same time:(1) Tommy and Izzy(2) Tomas the conquistador and Queen Isabella(3) Tom Creo (Future Tom)It is important to know the context of all the stories, and how they relate to one another.First, the story of Tommy and Izzy takes place in the PRESENT.Second, the story line of Tomas, the conquistador, and Queen Isabella is FICTIONAL. It never happened in the past, and it is NOT real. The story and characters are symbolic of their real lives. Tomas (i.e. Tommy) will go to the ends of the earth to save Izzy, just like his character does in the book to find the tree of life in order to save Spain and his beloved Queen. Queen Isabella (i.e. Izzy) has already come to terms with the prospect of death, just like her character faces her kingdom being brought down to her knees. Lastly, the Spanish Inquisition (i.e. Izzy's brain tumor / cancer) is eating away at her and will stop at nothing until she is dead, just like the Spanish Inquisition will stop at nothing until Spain is under its rule.Now, Tom Creo, the man in the spaceship is Tommy hundreds and hundreds of years in the FUTURE. This is REAL. (I'll get back to this idea.)So, Tommy (in the PRESENT) has a scientific breakthrough that reverses disease and aging. Unfortunately, he cannot apply his medical findings on Izzy, and she dies. You can see Tommy's fear of death by how he believes that death is a disease, something that can be cured, a defect in living organisms.In order to understand the movie, you need to understand that the ending transcends the physical/real world into the meditative/philosophical.Reality (as in the material world) and spiritual / meditative (as in beliefs and cognitive thinking) must be viewed as an attachment of each other, as if they are the same thing if you will, but distinctively separate at the same time.What do I mean? Well, for example, water can be both ice and steam, yet each one is made of the same properties. Also, look at the trinity: God, man (flesh), spirit, are all the same, but distinctively different. It is important to understand this relationship between the physical world and the spiritual world, how one can transcend into the other, but are both distinctive realms. If you can understand that, then you will be better prepared to understand and appreciate the magnitude and beauty of the movie's ending.It is important to look at the portrayal and evolution of Tommy's character, which is reflected in the differences in his name (Tomas, Tommy, Tom Creo). Although Tomas is a fictional character in Izzy's story, Tomas represents the ""real"" Tommy in the material world. Likewise, Tom Creo is Tommy hundreds of years into the future. You can see the difference of time, his nostalgic memories of Izzy, and his fear of death have transformed him from Tommy into Tom Creo. This is important in understanding the final moments in the movie, which I will attempt to explain.It is assumed that the tree that Tom Creo (Future Tom) is traveling through space with is in fact Izzy. You are meant to infer this when Tommy is seen planting the seed over her grave, which you are also meant to assume that the seed he planted was the one he derived his medical/scientific breakthroughs from in order to reverse aging and illness.Tom Creo journeys across space toward Xibalba, while he is haunted by his guilt of not finishing the last chapter in the story Izzy wrote. He hasn't been able to ""finish it"" because he still doesn't understand what Izzy was always hinting at-death is only the beginning, and with death always brings new life; it is a cycle. Izzy, before she died, had come to terms with her own death, which is why she never finished the last chapter. For this reason, Izzy tells Tommy to finish the story-their story. So she leaves the last chapter for Tommy to ""finish it."" knowing that one day he will finish book when he has come to terms with his own fear of death.You know that Tom Creo (Future Tom) has been alive for hundreds of years by the black tattooed rings on his body (much like the ring of a tree) since the first one he tattooed on his finger. That's why he eats the tree, both taking in Izzy, and taking in the properties that practically make him immortal. Tom Creo has been living, going through life's motions, and avoiding and running from death, the disease at the same time; but his memories of Izzy, which are visual manifestations to us, finally make him suck it up and attempt to finish the last chapter of ""their story.""Tom could have easily finished the last chapter with the antiqued fountain pen, and the book that was thrown about somewhere in his organic spaceship, but his journey to ""finish it"" becomes more than just inscription, but a real and spiritual journey. After all the years running, he finally understands that life must be completed through death. So he is able to complete the story for himself (and each one of his identities as Tomas, Tommy, and Tom Creo).The power of the mind is unmatchable. You can rewrite history with your thoughts, which is what Tom Creo does as the end of the film. Tom Creo is finishing the story, through meditation, while he physically travels toward Xibalba, literally translated as Place of Fear, to finally face death and embrace it. While he mentally finishes the story, he writes the ending for the conquistador, finding the tree of life, drinking its sap, and although he will live forever, he dies in the process.This is where the physical/real world into the meditative/philosophical realms transcends into one another. Because Future Tom has reached an epiphany (in reality), he becomes the ""father"" the all knowing meditating in front of the Mayan (fictional/spiritual). He has become enlightened.This is how Future Tom is able to take the wedding band from the conquistador, but when the camera goes back on him he now looks like Tommy. Future Tom evolved and enlightened back into Tommy, who was spiritually lost over the years, emotionally stunted by his fear and loss of Izzy; but as enlightened, he becomes the original man that Izzy loved, the man she originally told and knew would ""finish"" the story.I hope I helped anyone who might be confused.  I know skipped over many things, but I think by knowing this, you can catch all the other little details, clues, and hints. Anyway, this movie is wonderful, brilliant, an inspiring. It truly captures the fears we face as mortal creatures in life and death."	5.0	Don't Worry, You're Almost There: (An analysis of the movie for anyone who might be lost)	2007-07-31	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1KRNQWUNCTJS3	joebobhenrybob	"First - the film is opulent, beautiful, masterful on a visual basis.  Worth watching if you appreciate beauty and good cinematography.  5+ stars on that basis.However 2 overall.  When Hugh says ""I'm going to die"" jubilantly, it resonates emotionally on the level of Jarjar Binks going ""weez-a-goin home!""I love the part about the Spanish conquistador, determined to win through to the fountain of youth, determined to NEVER die.  The implications of immortality - or even long life - are extremely intriguing.  We get old just as we're getting the hang of things.  Just as we are starting to gain wisdom, our minds start going senile and our bodies lose the power of action... how amazing would it be to have the body of a 20-30 year old for 1,000 years, or even thousands of years?  All the different things you could do, places you could go, people you might know or love.  It's quite an interesting proposition....but they cop out.  As far as the purpose of this film goes, as far as what it is ABOUT, it fails.  One film I highly recommend would be Rozencranz and Guildenstern are DeadRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  At one point, Rozencranz talks about being dead in a coffin... you'd be trapped in a box wouldn't you?  Of course, you'd be dead but that's the point.  If I said straight to you, I'm going to put you in a box, would you rather be alive or dead, naturally you'd choose to be alive, because maybe someone will come along and let you out.  So Hugh is trapped in a bubble with the Tree of Life, trying to make it to some new, viable place where life can continue, realizes he can't make it, and is suddenly and inexplicably jubilant that he is going to die... but this is the point of the movie, right?They fail to get us there.  You can wax poetic of how death is good, necessary, whatever, but uh... okay, you first.  I'm not saying you can't get there, I'm just saying they jump to an embrace of death without showing us how they get there.  Naturally if I were trapped in a bubble with a tree for a long, long time, I might feel a LITTLE like dying.  But there's always the chance  of something else, isn't there.  Going new places, meeting new people and so on.  If you said I'm going to stuff you in a bubble with a tree, would you rather be alive or dead, I say definitely alive.  What was this guy doing for the thousands of years he got to live, what did he get out of it, why did he decide it was good to die?  We never see why in the film.  Obviously it's tiresome to be stuck in a bubble, but with immortality, time spent there is an insignificant fraction of your total lifespan - it would be like giving up on life because of that one time you spilled a glass of milk as a child.  An intolerable span of time to experience at the time, but it's ok now.  Are the writer and director still alive?  They didn't jubilantly end it all yet?  Then WTF is this movie about then, what did they actually believe and were trying to convey?One more recommendationMelancholia...which more honestly and bravely tries to approach the idea of mortality.  Also beautifully done.On the other hand, if you want a movie about immortality, you could do worse than the original HighlanderHighlander...the immortal main character is world-weary, funny, deadpan, and still basically good after all his losses over the centuries.  And still has the will to live.  I find myself liking this film and its main character infinitely more than The Fountain despite any flaws....And yes, The Fountain is structured a little bit like Slaughterhouse 5, but I think you'd have to be kind of dumb not to be able to follow what's going on with the different timeline, what the film is really about, etc.  As far as what was going on in the film and why, I never had any unpleasant moments, but as far as the overall purpose the film is supposed to be working towards... not great as far as I'm concerned."	2.0	Opulent, beautiful cop-out	2012-06-15	4	2	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3V39GRK6ULMWW	Joel Anderson	I see by other reviews that people either love or hate this movie, and there's not much in-between.  One reviewer claimed repeatedly that all the events depicted in the film really happened (in the film, not in real life, I think he meant).  I don't think it needs to be interpreted that way at all.  In fact, if one assumes that the &#34;present&#34; depicted is what's really happening, and that the &#34;past&#34; is merely a re-telling of the tale in the wife's book, and that the &#34;future&#34; is the lead character's dream, it becomes obvious that this is not a sci-fi movie but a romance.

Despite having different characters and settings, all of the stories are connected. The Fountain is a meaningful film with mesmerizing visuals and an awe-inspiring score.The story in The Fountain is meaningful. Although you don't have to, I believe the film promotes contemplation and open-mindedness; I love these type of films, although some would disagree, because different people will have different interpretations; what you take out of films like this is a reflection of yourself. The film tackles themes such as love, life, and death. The film blends fantasy, romance, and SciFi along with stunning visuals and a beautiful score to create a surreal and captivating experience. The storytelling can be a bit rough and a little confusing at times, but it always corrects itself. (i.e. you'll eventually get back on track) Amazing performances from Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Beautiful cinematography and unique visual effects.Overall, The Fountain is a beautiful film- aesthetically, sonically, and story-wise. It may not be a film for everyone; but, it may be a life-changing film for some, or simply a captivating and entertaining experience for others.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2AT49LYZ05L93	jookyone	"With every reason in the world to relate to this film, sadly I could not.  For those wondering why the reviews are 5 stars or 1 star and hardly any middle ground here is why.Like with Pi, Darren is obsessed with patterns and similarities and that shows again throughout this film (constant fading of overlayed objects of similar size and shape, and replayed scenes but not funny like Groundhogs Day).  While with Pi, it was novel to have patterns as a focal point, in this movie its forced onto you in slowly passing imagery.  Like telling a joke in the slowest voice possible and being beaten to death with the concept that things are similar yet different... DONT YOU SEE DONT YOU SEE?!?!  For those that weren't aware of things being similar or the same, it might be eye opening (aka 5 stars), for those familiar and already know the punchline (yes there are patterns everywhere, and it means nothing) it's like hearing the same joke for the 47,000th time (aka 1 star).Trying to give more credibility to the similarities of life by wrapping it in the emotional aspects of life (love and death) doesn't make it any more intriguing nor does it validate that the patterns are important in any way.  The punchline is still the same.  Things live, things die... repeat.There is absolutely no point to this film.  I feel like I just got hoodwinked into listening to a guy say ""I have the answer to life!"" only he rambles on about every day stuff like a video on YouTube or the new internet meme.  Some people say ""Yea the every day stuff IS the answer to life"" (aka 5 stars) but the others think ""every day stuff... been there done that""  (aka 1 star).Watch it if you have time to kill and you have somehow become immobile with a remote and this movie all ready to go. For clarity, there is nothing wrong with the acting, but couldn't relate to any of the characters despite similarities to my own life (wait... things can be the same?! Who knew others floated in a tree bubble thru space like me!). And it did make me relate to something, only not to anyone in this movie, but to the main character in Pi *** SPOILER ALERT *** I wanted to drill my head out after watching this."	1.0	Try harder Darren... try harder.	2012-10-13	7	2	5
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A36HBE2C5SQ2E6	"Jordan Appel ""thedudeman"""	Three stories. One love. Hugh Jackman as a Spanish conquistador, a modern scientist, and a future astronaut. Rachel Weiz as a queen, a woman dying of cancer. He must rush to save her from cancer as it tears away the fabrics of their relationship and he devolves himself into finding the cure. shows that love can last in every generation.When I walked out of the movie, I had feelings of weirdness simmering all over my body after I watched a remarkable film. The film was simple yet made complex with the imagery and the hidden meanings. The meanings don't damper the film, it makes the film all that better, it makes the audience think, about what they just saw. Movies these days don't make you think. They apply the same motions to you and they expect you to clap and cheer for that movie, but no, this movie in itself is not like that. It leaves the audience, with a sense of confusion when they leave because the film bombards you with breathtaking things and multiple meaning imagery. The director wants you to figure out what was going on, and how you would interpret it because this film doesn't have just one meaning applied to the same situation over and over again. It has multiple meanings that are constantly changed based on your viewing experience. The meanings vary from person to person.The acting in the film was not all the best. Hugh Jackman delivers the most avant garde performance of the film, going all out and showing more range than he has as Wolverine or any other film roles. He takes his role seriously and he earns my respect as a dramatic actor because he certianly has proved that he can be a damn good one. Ellen Burystn, of Requiem For A Dream fame, is really underused in the picture. She really doesn't provide anything new to the movie and didn't really spark my interest in the performance. Rachel Weiez, the wife of Aronofsky, was good for what her role provided her. She took the role and tried to make it her own, and she looked beautiful in the process.The directing aspect of the film was top notch. Using the bacteria patterns for the 2026 scenes or whatever future year was perfect and spell binding to me. Also, I noticed that he used natural light opposed to artifical, I liked it, it gave the movie a more gritter feel to me in the past and future sequences. Also, There were some excellent shots, for example, Hugh Jackman walking towards The Tree of Life, and the whole futuristic sequences were outstanding. Although Aronofsky has been known for making really long films, the films length, over a hour and 30 minutes, was perfect for it as the imagery didn't get tiring and stale. He hit you with enough of it to stick in your head.When you make a film that can possibly have a audience love or hate it, and it sticks in your head and you discuss it and have conversations about the hidden meanings in the film, then it is a fine film for what goes through your thought process and the film maker's job is done when it leaves you with that feeling. I have a weird feeling that I am going to thinking about this movie for days to come.	4.0	"""Death is a diease. If there is a cure, I will find it."""	2006-11-26	1	1	0

This is a recipe that some people will simply not like.I loved the fact that it's open to my interpretation, the movie doesn't let you know for sure what's real and what's imagined.My take is this:  The entire movie takes place in present time, and there is no ""Tree of Life"".  The past and future versions of the characters are from Izzi's book.  Tom is spending all his time working and trying to find a cure for his wife's terminal disease, not realizing what's important, which is spending time with his dying wife.  She can accept the fact that she'll die, he thinks that death is a disease that can be cured, it isn't until the end of the movie that he understands that he needs to accept death, his wife's and eventually his own.I really enjoyed this movie.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1U74I9FWDMGEW	Joshua	As evident from the reviews that run the gamut from completely trashing it to loudly singing its praises, The Fountain is not a movie that everyone will like.  The story is heavily emotional, non-linear, and told from three separate viewpoints, each in it's own time-frame (spanning one thousand years) woven together in one cohesive whole.  Some will feel lost by the style of the movie due to these factors.  Others have remarked that the film comes off as pretentious, but I completely disagree.  Jackman and Weis both performed at the top of their game, and really owned their respective roles.  Yes, the film takes itself seriously, but not so much that it is off-putting.Visually, The Fountain is everything that a movie should be.  Most of the key special effects were created using macro photography, creating a timeless essence to special effects that continues to stun me every time I re-watch.  The fluid motions captured create an entire new world in space that should succeed in standing the test of time.The special features provide an interesting look into the movie's background and the process of making the script come to life.  My favorites here are a featurette giving a behind-the-scenes look into how use of miniatures, green screens, macro-photography, and other layered effects were used to generate some of the most stunning scenes in the movie, and a montage of of original macro-photography.  The lack of commentary on the disk is fairly disappointing (Aronofsky did record an mp3 commentary track that is available online), and I think that the film as a whole could benefit from additional special features.  I hope that Mr. Aronofsky succeeds in getting a special edition put out with even more juicy additional features.In  summary I find The Fountain to be memorable in a number of dimensions and highly re-watchable.  Each time I re-watch I savor the subtleties of the directing and scripting as well as the intricacy of the three interwoven plot-lines.  This is an extremely underrated movie that I think more people should see.  Aronofsky has demonstrated that he has really come into his own.  I was a fan of both Pi and Requiem, however I see both of those films as being a bit rough around the edges.  This film makes me optimistic that we will continue to see great things out of Aronofsky, and confident in my belief that he will be remembered as one of the greats.  I give this blu-ray five stars because as a film it is in a class all its own.  The Fountain is art in every sense of the word.	5.0	A non-linear masterpiece	2009-02-18	4	3	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A34D06JL7LC6MU	"Joshua Miller ""Josh"""	"Darren Aronofsky is a very talented writer & director. His previous two films ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" rank as top favorites for many cinephiles and are even more impressive when you realize how low-budget they are. Yet those films contain many haunting images and some innovative camera work. Give Aronofsky a budget and some big-name actors, you get ""The Fountain."" This film has haunting images, a haunting score, good performances, and is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. Too bad, it lacks that brilliance in plot. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as two lovers over the course of 2000+ years. First Jackman is a conquistador of Spain who is sent by the Queen (Weisz) to find the tree of life. Then, in the year 2000, Jackman is an animal surgeon whose wife Izzi (Weisz) is dying of cancer. He has samples of the tree of life and he's used them on monkeys to great success, but it may be to late to test it on his wife. Then there's the final segment, the one that transcends explanation. The only thing I can tell you about it is that Jackman is bald and Weisz is a tree. Plot-wise, this is Aronofsky's weakest film...Visually, it's his strongest. Even with a modest budget he was able to produce fantastic visuals (the visuals are one of the reasons few people forget ""Requiem for a Dream"" when they see it), but here he outdoes himself. I'm about to start ranting, so prepare yourselves. Aronofsky had an actual budget now, which gave him a certain level of artistic freedom. This film is absolutely, unequivally visually arresting. It's a film that is incredibly beautiful to look at, even if you're not entirely sure what it is that you're looking at. The final scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen, whether you've enjoyed the rest of the movie or not. The performances are good, Jackman gives an under-praised performance here. He puts a chameleon act on the film and manages to brilliant disappear behind each version of the character he's playing. Weisz looks stunning, but her character(s) are one-dimensional and thefroe hard to really feel for. ""The Fountain"" has had a mixed reception from critics, but on a purely visual level it deserves 5 stars. Since I actually paid attention the weak plot and one-dimensional Weisz character, it gets less. However, if you open your mind and just let the images take over than you'll find a very haunting experience awaits you. The film co-stars Ellen Burstyn ('Requiem for a Dream') and Ethan Suplee ('My Name is Earl').GRADE: B"	4.0	Visually Stunning.	2007-05-16	1	1	0

So, my review will be short because I don't believe in divulging the plot.This was not the type of movie I expected to see Hugh Jackman in; and, he acted his heart out. In fact, if I had an award to give for acting, this would be his movie for how believable his character is.If you like the films that are running multiple themes, have depth, inspire you to feel a multitude of emotions, like special effects and a good soundtrack, but don't always need the movie to be the ""in your face"" style of most Hollywood movies, you'll probably like this movie. It's subtlety is clever. I thought the plot was brilliantly constructed in such a way that I had to consider the actual intent of the film-maker after I watched the movie. We had a great conversation about all of the aspects we saw in this movie. And, it's not a pretentious, or obnoxious ""high-brow"" movie.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A24CASOMWGS87I	"Juan Camaney ""Book Hunter"""	"That, in this day and age, a filmmaker in the US decides to take head on, from a metaphysical perspective, issues such as love, death, reincarnation, eternal life, is nothing short of admirable. It's actually daring, especially in such a monumental, epic scale. It's also reason to tremble, as such ventures can easily lead to masterpieces, or their opposite, legendary bombs.Despite being booed at Cannes, and its somewhat mixed, chilly reception by critics, ""The Fountain"" is a very interesting film, not because of its ideas, or because it contains very profound revelations. Though seemingly complicated, the film has a (daring?) simplicity to it, and anyone familiar with modern spiritual movements will get it right away.It is true that more earthly or intellectual types might actually find it unbearable. But such a film has a right to exist, especially since the  issues it addresses and the questions it poses are so rarely taken on in such a nakedly vulnerable fashion. Yet, be warned, that this is more Paulo Coello or Miguel Ruiz than Krzysztof Kieslowski or the other Ruiz, Raoul.  And, so what?This heartfelt conviction in its universal subjects such as love and reincarnation powers ""The Fountain"", which is as brutally beautiful a film as you will ever see.The love story, which spans the ages, is full of astonishing, memorable images. However, it's this same love story which probably prevents the film from being a great one, simply because it's not really fleshed out, and it gives the story something of a cerebral (others will probably say mindless), conceptual, feeling.Just something, as the film is greatly helped by intense performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as the literally star-crossed lovers at the center of the story.Love it or hate it... This is a film that demands (in as big a screen as possible) to be seen, and experimented, even if only as an extraordinary sensory experience, or maybe, if you are able to enter its wavelength, as something far more profound."	4.0	Magnificent Ambition...

You need to be in the right mood, because otherwise it can be slow and confusing.  But if you are looking for something comtemplative and a love story that lasts through time (and also time is not easy to follow) then this is a good pick.  I like the actors, the scenery and &#34;feel&#34; of the movie. The film left a few things open to interpretation so my only complaint is it left me feeling like I wanted more information.

I gave it another shot later and, while stunned by the visual effects, still didn't get it.My brother bought the film a few weeks after I had written it off and fell in love with it the first time watching; his girlfriend hated it. He encouraged me to watch it again and it took me two more viewings before I started to understand and appreciate it. His girlfriend still hates it. Basically, YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS KIND OF FILM or you will hate it. It's a bit slow-moving, very philosophical and metaphorical, and doesn't explain itself at the end like most films of its style do.If you choose to purchase this film, make sure that you're prepared for confusion and to somewhat create your own meaning.

I chose this movie as a way to really get outside of myself and my thoughts, having no idea how significant and eye opening of an experience it would be. To say it's a &#34;movie&#34; cheapens the thought, feeling, and sincerity of the work. (For lack of a better word at the moment) It shows you in so many parallel and overlappingly intertwined instances what love is and what it has the potential to be!!!

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3SMYPQ8KXWNXU	kerrjac	"I enjoy watching movies that stretch my imagination, and bring me in and pose large questions. However, I often find that art movies go out of their way to make things too complicated. The focus is too often on the plot - it might have a bazillion jumbled pieces, which actually fit together (say, Momento), or which don't even come together (say, anything by David Lynch), or which are made to represent something I don't understand (say, The Last Temptation). But if I were looking for mere symbolism or complexity of thought I'd read an essay about mechanics or something. The truth of the matter is that artistic cinema has a more to offer than mere complexity or intellectual wackery.The premise for The Fountain is deceptively simple: A cancer researcher's wife is dying of cancer; in the meanwhile, she is writing a historical / mythical book about Spain's conquest of the Mayans. The movie progresses by interweaving her book and his experiences - threads of reality, history, and myth - none of which, again, are very complicated.Written above, it all looks somewhat bare perhaps a bit cheesy. But movies aren't meant to be read, they're meant to be watched. And this one unfolds very graciously. It quite literally ebbs and flows, thanks to the accomplished cinematography, editing, and score. The style has a way of digging its way inside your head: A shot of a smiling woman spontaneously running around a house feels like a personal revelation and a past regret about life slipping away; a shot of a warrior being boldly carried off by the enemies seems like a body attacking a bacteria. The movie can even be seen as a story of movement, with some story arches literally going up, others going down. A passing shot into an intriguing piece of wallpaper feels like an inevitable approach.Most movies use such stylistic techniques for the sake of character development, or to move along the plot. However, in The Fountain, these elements are in fact the movie. Like the directors other great movies, this one capitalizes on these elements in order to portray a progression of events and feelings in a manner that only cinema can. While such attention to style can often be devastating for a story, The Fountain uses it in good taste: And why not use the tools of cinema, in congruence with the way in which humans watch and register things? Ignoring such tools would be like writing an essay without any periods.Consequently, some people might ask, ""What's the message this guy's trying to get across?"" and ""Who are these characters?"" But these questions miss point, (and any movie that could answer such questions, I'd argue, is a bad movie, because it might as well be a book); The Fountain feels more like a symphony - you wouldn't ask those questions to Beethoven about his Fifth, would you? Of course, much of the movie's impact will depend on its aesthetic effect on you: It's difficult to explain why you like a piece of music, it just feels right. But if you surrender yourself to this one's feelings - its progression, texture, and flow - you might get totally sucked in. And at the center there isn't an idea, a message, or an unforgettable character; there's a feeling: Awe. The feeling is wrapped in timeless questions about the pursuit of science, man's mortality, the differences between man and woman, and the reality of myth; it's wrapped in the steps that one needs to take to experience it. But at the same time it's not too removed or abstract; it registers as brutal and thought-provoking, and so very *human*."	5.0	graceful	2007-07-01	7	6	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1WW9SMBQM6SJO	Kevin Persell	I enjoyed this movie.  My wife hated it.  However, she cried several times.This is a movie I would suggest owning... you may want to watch it once and then put it aside for awhile to let it simmer in the back of your head before another viewing.Music and acting and direction are all great.  This is a movie that sticks with you.  I watched some of the extras, and apparently, the entire movie is all about him moving toward the light.  Each set is set up that way.  If you are confused at all, you may want to watch the extras.I have been thinking about it for the past day or so... Here is a spoiler coming so, stop reading if you haven't seen this.  I thought it might be helpful to write down my idea of what it all meant.  Who knows maybe you have a different impression, and if so I would love to read it!I think that the conquistador and the past was all part of Izzie's book.  The people in the book are shown in his form and the form of other people in his present life because he was the model she wrote about.  The ending of the book is what he wrote much later, probably near the end of the movie.  Ok, with that out the way, the movie is fairly linear.. the medicine he creates allows you to live forever as long as you eat from its bark.  500 years in the future, when it is possible to travel in the manner shown in the movie, he flies to the dying star that he looked at with his wife.  Anyway, that is my idea of what happens.His medicine allows people to live forever as long as they can eat from the tree.	4.0	Excellent, Visual Film.  Awesome Music	2007-05-21	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AKS9SJTHTU0OM	K. Gordon	Leave it to me to love this often trashed film even more than Aronofsky's strong'Requiem for a Dream' . (although a solid minority of critics went for it too).Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex,humanistic, metaphysical message, here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics(and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end inthemselves.A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as aconquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', thepresent where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure forcancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, wherethe same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still lookingfor eternal life.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and I the score is creative andeffective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life anddeath. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightlyflawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way - ala '2001'over the same old, same old every time.(possible spoilers ahead)The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy talebook started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemedvery obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of criticsscratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. I can see why,if you miss that, the film could seem confusing and arbitrary, butit's laid out pretty clearly along the way,	5.0	A moving, creative, visually stunning, metaphysical look at love and life	2011-04-25	1	1	0

He consequently suffers a mental/nervous breakdown. Finally through a ?""Dream sequence "" the doctor is enlightened and discovers that death is just the transformation of the journey,  just another vehicle like the body, only without form. He becomes the Buddha or the enlightened one in the end, sitting underneath his Bodhi tree, understanding that you can not cling to life or anything, because it is only a journey, not a destination, he becomes one with universe.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	4.444 starsI'm not certain The Fountain is a great film, but beyond question it is a true work of art.Watching this shimmering movie was mesmerizing, pleasantly confusing, thought-provoking on many levels, and perhaps too void of narrative push for some (see the many one-star reviews here, some of which make strong cases; for those who need plot movement, this is a slog). I for one loved the experience; it took my mind to places very very few movies have or can, and that in itself makes it a must for those who love to watch their own mind at work, as well as that of an increasingly masterful filmmaker.Clearly Aronofsky is in both categories, and what a mind his is to watch. His grasp of symmetry, both visually and conceptually, peaks in this film. Pi is farther out but The Fountain is deeper, the work of a much more emotionally mature man than Pi or Requiem, and miles afield from his recent breakthrough The Wrestler. I'm betting this guy has a film or two in him that will stun the world into submission, at which point his oeuvre will be reexamined and gasps of awe will issue forth over this little gem.Orrr, maybe not. It is indeed amazing that this was followed by The Wrestler, as two more disparate films are hard to imagine. I for one think this is a much finer film; maybe if Mickey Rourke had made his comeback in The Fountain it would be the one with all the acclaim.In any case, this is a truly unique and gorgeous movie, with many shots of breathtaking beauty and classical symmetry. DA sure can frame a scene, and I didn't notice the camera itself once during the flick, a rare event, expecially for a movie as concerned with cinematic perfection as this. The plot lines, such as they are, are also driving towards the cores of human existence: dealing with death, wishing for ever more time with those we love, and luxuriating in the moment before it and we are whisked away into the void.Speaking of which, there is a perfectly luscious visual moment with the tree of life and the stars and Jackman (who gives a very strong performance, as usual) during which the missus and I were sitting on the sofa, engrossed in the spectacle (this movie makes blu-ray and a nice big flat screen make perfect sense), when our dog suddenly started having a dream on the floor behind us. You know how they quiver and yip and move their paws like they're chasing God's own squirrel through the celestial meadows in Dog Heaven? I love the sound she makes when she's dreaming, and as I sat beside my human sweetie, holding her hand, eyes on the sumptuous montage of realities onscreen depicting and ears on our pooch off in her own little dream world--a place I often wonder about but will never see in this lifetime--I realized very clearly that I was in the midst of my own perfect little synchronistic moment in space and time and soaked in it with a smile, feeling the love and ease as deeply as I could and knowing that one day this moment will be like manna that I can enjoy at will.Any movie that can help raise one's consciousness of self-awareness like that while simultaneously creating a field of knowledge which demands your surrender (plot junkies take note) must perforce be something special. Thanks and praises to Darren Aronofsky for even trying to make movies devoid of profit motive, let alone getting them made with this much love and precision. If Leonardo Da Vinci and Terence McKenna ever meet upstairs, The Fountain will be playing at the local art house rep theatre, on a huge screen lush with golds and greens, surrounded in all directions by inky blackness. I hope I can be their usher.PS As an added bonus, this movie points out that living forever might not be the cup of tea one likes to imagine.Embrace the entropy; it's beautiful too...perhaps even perfect.And besides, maybe this is all just a dream our dog is having.	4.0	For fans of art and film, a revelation.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1NLZVP501JM5Z	K. Vaske	Wow.  Well then.  I still am not sure if I really liked this movie, but thats the way I'm leaning right now so it gets 5 stars.  I'll start off with the easiest thing to review.  The effects.  I was blown away by the shots of Thomas in the bubble with all the golden fragments falling down from the sky, that was great CG.  Actually it was done by photographing different stuf under a microscope(Don't expect me to be Mr. In depth:)The direction was either great OR not so great, like I said earlier I'm leaning towards great.  Hugh Jackman is very good in his 3 roles as is Rachel Weisz, I did like Hugh better in The Prestige, but thats just me.  This is a kind of movie you have to see more than once to fully appreciate it.  I know that this movie divides audiences.  The person I went with loathed it.Overall if you like to have everything explained to you and to not have any loose ends by the time the credits roll I suggest you go out, rent a Tom Cruise movie, and enjoy.  Of course theres nothing wrong with enjoying a Tom Cruise movie(I own a few of his myself) I'm just saying that by the end of this movie you will have to think about it and come up with your own  interpretation of it.  Some like that, some don't, but if you go into The Fountain with an open mind you'll at least have a chance to love it.	5.0	"De@th is the Road to Awe."""	2006-11-27	4	3	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3BI5KDXAYH182	Kyle Crick	Personally, because this is just my opinion, I loved this movie. Ive noticed some reviews telling people not to watch this movie. That is just sad. I think it would be horrible to rob someone of a thrilling experience just because someone else didn't like the film.  Not everyone is going to like it...thats for sure. Here are a few things to think about when going in to watch it.1)It is nothing like the movie trailer.2)It is slow moving at times but pays off in the end.3)It can be hard to follow and may require some thought.4)It is more a visual love poem than a conventional film (meaning conventional character development and story are not the main focus.)I think there is a lot to be had in this film and I hope people will give it a chance. One thing is sure, you only get out of a film what you are willing to put into it. Maybe it is a little ahead of its time. I don't know.As far as it being pretentious, well I say the difference between a pretentious work and a masterpiece is negligible. Look back through film history for numerous examples.This movie is something that needs to be taken on a personal basis and no critic will be able to predict your exact feelings, they only convey their own.So, try it out, whats the worst that can happen.	5.0	Don't listen to negitive reviews, give it a try for yourself.	2007-05-31	8	4	4

It is rather a cinematic art, that is found in its 3 plots/stories, movie-editing, visual arts, and of course, the metaphor.Sporadically, pieces of puzzles/scenes are all pointed to Hugh Jackman or us, human, who needs to manage the task while limited time is giving. Here, morality is also involved as a basic movie element in confronting such task. (when Jackman bravely proceeds the experiment of the monkey, not hard to predict how/where the story is about to lead.)For art, i give 4 points; for the movie in general, i give 3 points for the fragments that disturb my mind.	3.0	an artistic one	2007-08-14	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2PLFR1FV6MY8I	Lark Ballinger	I had the immense pleasure of viewing this film for its second screening ever, when it was showcased at Chicago's International Film Festival. Fans of Aronofsky who enjoyed the intensity of 'PI' and 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM' will find that Darren's primary thematic focus has shifted yet again from the mind and gut ('PI' and 'REQUIEM', respectively) to the heart. However, don't take this to mean that 'THE FOUNTAIN' isn't intellectually engaging or visceral in its impact.In a word, this film is warm. Aronofsky's palette for his third feature is a swirling miasma of golden yellows, and it sets the tone for the work. 'THE FOUNTAIN' is a life-affirming treatise on the eternity of love. Cynical hacks might decry this as a mawkish, facile rumination of saccharine proportions, but despite the sentimental themes, the film is never cloying, opting instead for a (sur)realistic portrayal of the nuances of one of life's most powerful emotions.The casting was superb: Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are outstanding in their roles, with both offering utterly believable performances. Weisz reveals the same depths she did in 'THE CONSTANT GARDENER', portraying myriad subtleties in a role that could've easily been misplayed, starring as Jackman's love throughout time. For those who've only seen Jackman in action-oriented mutant movies, his command of his character's strengths AND frailties is a welcome surprise. The supporting cast was excellent as well, with Ellen Burstyn standing out in particular.Special effects were phenomenal, even without taking the film's halved budget into consideration. I won't spoil the surprise, but when you find out how Aronofsky and Co. achieved some of the extraordinary images, you're sure to be impressed (and reminded of a film classic from over 25 years ago). This is not a film to rely on FX, though. In fact, the segment (not scene; the story is split across three time periods) using the bulk of the effects is probably the shortest.Aronofsky ambitiously tackles heavy themes and concepts and he does it in a little over 90 minutes. I didn't realize how short the film was until it was over. However, 'THE FOUNTAIN's brevity could also be perceived as an extension of one of its themes: learning to appreciate the world and its beauty in whatever time we are allotted.	5.0	The Path to Life	2006-10-18	18	15	3

Nope.Like others have said, this movie takes itself to be &#34;artsy&#34; and &#34;deep.&#34; Really, it's just presumptuous, New-Agey, and annoying. The movie left me befuddled and cinematographically frustrated. Yes,it will &#34;leave you thinking,&#34; as some fans have said.... BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE!!!

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1224IBFV0K5V9	LG	The Fountain is a hard movie to understand and appreciate. Some people don't like the lack of plot development and other such typical things within a movie. I believe that all of that is intentional. Its not about plot development... its not about death, life, and the existential meaning behind it all. I love this movie because visually, it totally delivers.... and if you're the kind of person thats willing to truly take something in, the film can become a moment of self reflection.Though many movies deal with such themes, no one does it by totally rethinking the way we view movies. We expect certain things... but then he gives us something else.The fountain is to film, as Heidegger is to being.	5.0	Great Film... He does it again.	2010-02-28	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ACO5HYBB7E5QE	Liam St. John	I love this movie.  It is one of the first movies that I've ever seen that shows stories of people reincarnating through past and future lives. It seems to me, to reduce a lot of cultural hatred of Catholicism by showing the theme of reincarnation within Catholicism.  Also, the end when you realize the past life was the story she wrote in her book, the fountain, and the future life is the story he wrote as the last chapter of the book, shows that perhaps ultimately we choose our own destiny.  Do we write our past in the present as well as our future?  The theme of seeking immortality was powerful, also it seemed to show unity between paganism and Christianity which is a perspective we need to have for the post 2012 era.	5.0	Perspective changing movie.

He is trying to face the fact that he is going to die, and possibly he is currently in a vegetated state between here and the underworld.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2MG8DHACXH5MS	"Lola Jovita ""Literary Fan"""	Quite a telling image with Hugh Jackman resembling a cross between Timothy Leary and Buddha in the scenes of him as a 26th century explorer. The Fountain is Sci Fi meets epic romance and I'm really glad Hugh Jackman was in this role rather than the original actor cast for the part - Brad Pitt. Jackman is Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in 1500, 2000, and 2500 in a relentless search for a cure to save his love Isabella, Isabelle, Issy. The trio of characters all play into one another but are still distinct. Jackman is an international film star in his own right but his more private relationship with the papparazzi allows his thespian gifts to shine in a more opaque light. Jackman melts into the different personalities that are weaved together in The Fountain. We see his role not his celebrity life clouding a stellar performance. Being a trained actor skilled in singing and dancing makes Jackman a belivable cast of Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in a psychedelic twist of karma and fate across the centuries. He melts into the role with his muse Isabelle/Issy/Isabella whom he spends centuries trying to save. The timing of this film released at the height of Brangelina is poignat because had Brad Pitt stayed in the lead it may have been unbelievable to audiences of the character's mad devotion to stay with his wife. This is what makes the film work.Jackman emotes well and plays a Spanish conquistador, American medical doctor, and space age explorer all in one without seeming like the same character each time. Cris crossing between three different lifetimes over a millenium to save the woman he loves The Fountain plays on karma, reincarnation, and endless love and its quest to conquer death. The ending is odd because you don't know whether he succeeds or not and it heartbreaking since it isn't clear if the lovers unite. A well done film that blends distinct story lines into a captivating tale that concludes in a unique way. I'm impressed albeit confused. All that said, mark my words, one day movie trailers will promote Academy Award Winner Hugh Jackman in films he stars in. It's evident in The Fountain that, pretty soon, fellow Australian Russell Crowe won't just be sharing the land down under with Jackman, but also an Oscar trophy.	5.0	Love Death Rebirth Life Love Death Rebirth Life Love	2007-09-07	2	1	1

No, this movie wasn't the cause; in fact she saw the ad and thought it would be good.  But during our viewing, she repeatedly said it wasn't what she anticipated and repeatedly apologized for taking me to it.This is the story of a man and a woman in three different timelines: a conquistador and his queen, a present-day husband whose wife is dying, and a future where the man spends long periods of time in a lotus position in a bubble in an amber-colored environment, evidently travelling through space to reach a tree which grants immortality (I guess).It moves molasses-slowly, the dramatic scenes are overacted, and overall it feels akin to staring at a lava lamp for hours.  Maybe some people see a deep meaning in it.  I felt that whatever the movie intended to say, I didn't get it.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AJXIY2LIGA0NA	Lorin Kee	"40 years after Kubrick made 2001, an author named Jay Weidner came along and offered what I think is the most complete explanation of what the film is actually about.  Look it up.  The difference between 2001 and The Fountain is that while the critics who originally reviewed 2001 may not have fully understood what the film was trying to say, they universally praised it nevertheless.  The Fountain on the other hand, received mixed reviews by critics who expressed widespread confusion about its meaning.  However, I am certain that this movie will stand the test of time, and it and the filmmaker will eventually receive the credit they deserve.  From its rich, evocative score to its lush, mini-photography vistas, the story it tells is one of the most spiritual narratives ever recorded on film.  Both 2001 and The Fountain resonate at a soul level.  While the precise meanings may be hard to articulate, the importance of the message is nonetheless intuitively feltSo what is the Fountain about?  If you want to experience the journey unencumbered by other's explanations, stop reading here.  However if you acknowledge that my interpretation is just as likely to be incompletely and wholly lacking as anyone else's, read on.  I believe the Fountain points to a metaphysical reality.  It's best summed up via a metaphor used by the western Buddhist teach, Alan Watts:""Let's suppose you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream, and that you could for example have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time, or any length of time you wanted to have. And you would naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say, 'Well, that was pretty great, but now lets have a surprise. Lets have a dream which isn't under control. Where something is going to happen to me that I don't know what it's going to be.' And you would dig that and come out of that and say 'Wow that was a close shave, wasn't it?' And then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further and further gambles as to what you would dream, and finally you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today."" - Alan Watts""Death is the road to awe."""	5.0	Celluloid Alchemy	2010-12-03	5	4	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3I9A9LJ3N73SL	Lukas. C	THE FOUNTAIN1. Introduction'The Fountain' is a love story, starring Hugh Jackman (Tom/Tommy/Thomas) and Rachel Weisz (Izzy/Queen Isabel) which takes place in three different periods of time.One takes place during the time of colonial Spain in the 16th century, one in the present and one, around the year 2500, in a science fictional future. Jackman'scharacter is searching for eternal life, whether as the conquistador looking for it, the scientist researching a substance that contains it or the astronaut pondering its meaning. Weisz's character is separated from Jackman's at each juncture: first by class and distance, as the conquistador's queen who sends him across the Atlantic, then by disease, as the scientist's dying, cancer-stricken wife, and then by spirit, as the astronaut's memory, for which he's traveling to the far reaches of space for a hoped for reunion.As the three narratives interweave, the story becomes both clearer and more undefined.The story blends elements of religion, fantasy, history and science fiction. There is also a lot of spirituality and philosophy interwoven in the film.Firstly let us find out what happens during the three periods of time.At the end i will let you know, how i understood the movie 'The Fountain'.2. The first IncarnationThe first tale is set in the 16th Century and centers on fervent spanish Conquistador Tomas and his tireless quest to discover the mythical Tree of Life, which supposedly exists in the heart of New Spain (Central America).Queen Isabel lives in constant fear of usurpation by the Grand Inquisitor and believes that the life-prolonging sap of the legendary tree will give her the strength to maintain control of the monarchy. This, she believes, is her only hope of saving herself and her country from the wrath of the Grand Inquisitor. She turns to her most valiant warrior, Tomas, to save Spain from bondage and in return she will give him her hand in marriage. On his quest, Tomas must journey to an ancient Mayan ruin which supposedly guards the Tree of Life, whose sap is the fountain of youth sought by adventurers throughout the ages. He finds the Tree of Life, but dies because he is unworthy.3. The Present TimeThe second tale takes place in 2006. Izzy has a brain tumor and she'sdying. Her husband, Tommy, is a doctor and he's searching for a cure to save her. From the very beginning of the movie we see that Izzy has already let go, and she just wants to cherish the moments they have left together. She no longer sees death as an end, but as 'the road to awe' as she mentions several times. Tommy cannot grasp her new 'understanding' of death, and he's nowhere near ready to let go of her. He desperately spends most of his time in the lab doing research, hoping to find a modern day Fountain of Youth.Tommy is so blindet by love that he can't see to let go.Meanwhile, Izzy keeps herself busy by writing a manuscript, a story which tells the tale of a Spanish Conquistador who is asked by his Queen to travel to South America in search of the fabled 'Tree of Life'. It is a mystic romance of love, conquest, and death. All but the last chapter is finished, which she wants Tom to write after she's gone : 'Finish it...'.At last Izzy dies. Tommy drops a seed on Izzy's grave, and she becomes a Tree.4. Future-Astronaut-TommyIn the future space setting, which i understand to be Tom's inner world, he has in fact discovered the youth restoring properties of the tree they discovered in South America. He has planted that very sort of tree over Izzy's grave, and she has become one with the tree. In the distant future, he has taken the tree in a spaceship that is essentially an eco-bubble to the distant star that they Mayans called Xibalba, and which they viewed as their underworld. Izzy had been fascinated with the Mayans choice of this dying star (as opposed to a healthy one) as their underworld, and Tommy envisages himself taking her (as the tree) there, so that when the star finally dies, she can be reborn. But he is haunted on his journey by Izzy's request that he finish the book, which he still has not done. He hasn't been able to 'finish it' because he still doesn't understand what Izzy was always hinting at death is only the beginning, and with death always brings new life. It is a cycle. Izzy, before she died, had come to terms with her own death, which is why she never finished the last chapter. For this reason, Izzy tells Tommy to finish the story (their story). So she leaves the last chapter for Tommy to 'finish it', knowing that one day he will finish the book when he has come to terms with his own fear of death.The tree dies just before they get to Xibalba, just as in reality Izzy died just before they discovered the benefits of the tree extract that could have saved her.5. How i understood the story / my interpretationPast: Queen Isabel strats Thomas on his quest for eternal life. He finds the Tree of Life but dies because he is unworthy. They both are reincarnated until the present.Present: Izzy is dying but comes to terms with it. Tommy refuses to accept it. Izzy write 'The Fountain', an unfinished manuscript about their past, and asks him to finish it ( Izzy didn't wrote the last chapter). She dies. Tommy throws himself into researching the Tree and unlocking the science of immortality. He drops a seed on Izzy's grave, and she becomes a Tree.Future: Tom and the Tree are approaching the dying star 'Xibalba'. The tree begins to die. Tom despairs but finally finishes 'The Fountain' when he lets go and embrances death. The star explodes, Tom dies and the Tree bursts into new life. Tom finally accepted the death.My interpretation is that the past is the story written by Tom's wife, and then finished by himself in the final moments of his life. The present is of course real, and the future is too. Tom uncovers the secret to immortality to late to save his wife, and uses it to stay alive for centuries while looking for a way to resurrect her. 'Present Tom' and 'Future Tom' are the same person. 'Past Tom' is Izzy's interpretation of the real Tom's attemps to cheath death. When Tom finishes the book he writes the Conquistador's demise as a way to become a part of nature and the universe. Tom the Conquistador turns into a hedge. When future Tom is disintegrated in the stuff of stars, he has chosen to abandon his quest to save his life, and instead travels back in time to do over her few remaining days on Earth. All three storylines converge into one painful reality - that he must come to accept the inevitability of death.The films is full of symbolism, both from Genesis and from elsewhere. Although the movie is called 'The Fountain', the key imagery is of the 'Tree of Life'. This overlaps with Mayan mythology of the First Father who gives his life to create the world, symbolized or thought of as a tree. There are also several moments in the film that begin with an inverted perspective, perhaps hinting that there is a sense in which we see reality inverted, particularly when it comes to death and living forever. And there is the powerful sense that love is the tree of life, since it is in connection with the one we love that we most often use the language of immortality, and most desperately desire to overcome death.To fully understand the movie you have to study it and determine what is real and what is symbolic. Some call it a Sci-fi movie, but i don't get that at all. I think it is first and foremost a love story between a man and his dying wife. A lot of the movie focuses on some deep topics regarding death, and how some people learn to not fear it while others are terrified of it.	5.0	The Fountain	2012-01-20	9	7	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A18NTI5V03ZD6Y	m4tch	I absolutely love this movie. It&#8217;s like a poor diet, thinking you&#8217;re full but still so empty. The Fountain has it all: love, despair, war, peace, culture (both spiritual and religious), re-birth, death, present reality, time capsule science fiction&#8230;  To truly appreciate this movie you must understand that there are three states of &#8220;being&#8221;: Jackman as a brain surgeon/ scientist looking to cure cancer since his wife Weisz is dying; Jackman as a Conquistador pledging to find the Tree of Life and save the Queen (Weisz) and Spain from the inquisition; and Jackman projected in the future in a space cap traveling through the galaxy with the Tree of Life (Weisz IMO).I will leave the finer details of how all three tie together for when you view the movie yourself. But, you can interpret all three states as a reflection of the past, present and future, or as a reflection of Jackman and Weisz&#8217;s undying love and bond, or even as the distant places we take our own minds when unsatisfied by our present circumstances.The filmography is absolutely beautiful, even though it is filmed quite darker than your average movie. The cast is exquisite and truly bring out the best in each character. The plot although confusing the first time you watch it without having a heads up of the three states, later becomes like Jackman&#8217;s obsession. If you enjoyed the movie, you find yourself going over everything and thinking of new ways to look at the three phases, examining what they mean to the characters and to you and perhaps a different part of you. My only complaint for this movie is the lighting is sometimes tricky to allow the eye to view details and being deaf in one ear made it harder for me to hear the quieter conversations in the movie. Overall, this is a wonderful step outside the box and highly recommend watching this.	5.0	Wonderful stap outside the box	2014-01-06	1	1	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A24KZBAAUTC83R	Mace & Lacey Gannon	Director Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain was overall just too slow and ambitious to make it a huge Box Office hit.We found it a beautifully crafted film, with a touching storyline with themes like timeless love in past, present and future all shown in such a magnificent way, albeit so slowllllly, made The Fountain at times hard to keep the viewer interested.But we applaud the director's eye for film-making, both in visual style and all the drama he captured from his two major stars - Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz - who do an outstanding job with the roles given to them.Bradd Pitt walked off the set of The Fountain, purportedly to play Hugh Jackman's character, placing Aronofsky's movie in dire trouble of ever being made. But Hugh Jackman stepped in and saved the day.With the mass appeal of this film, with the unfortunate slow script that made it more of a sleeper than a thriller, The Fountain reverberates with visually stunning scenes of life, death, and time-jumping sequences that at times were spellbinding.This would have been a much bigger major hit if the movie would have had more of the adventure feel that the beginning of the film began with, tantilizing filmgoers into hoping for a more balanced film with both drama, love, AND major adventure. Unfortunately the slow pacing of the film taxes the moviegoer.	3.0	The Fountain Spills Over...	2007-06-19	0	0	0

The theme of the movie was a good idea it just didn't come together for me. Part of the problem was the streaming was terrible. For every 5 minutes I watched it took 5 to 7 minutes to stream. It's interesting I have no problems with Netflx's or any other services, just you guys. It makes for a long night and a lot of patience.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2B87TIGJQUSQN	Marc Frontario	Wow, this is an extremely underrated overall rating. I read this was boooed at film festivals.  Critic's are idiots. The scores on movie query from the critics are average. I found the acting, the score, the visuals, the emotions and yes the story top notch. Confusing maybe, but I guess one can conceive one story(the conquistadors) is Izzie's, one story is real life and the future story is Hugh Jackman finishing the final chapter in her book.  I think this my be what Aronofsky was trying to say.  This movie will have a much greater appreciation overtime.  Aronofsky is an amazing director. Those who may not know, Aronofsky was originally slated to do the Batman project. Imagine what that would have been like???  Not sure what happened, but Nolan is doing a fine job with it.Regardless, I need to watch this again to see if I find other clues you should to.	5.0	3 1/2 stars??????????????????????	2010-08-20	5	3	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AH86MZPURQLCR	Marc Harris	If trailblazers like 2001: a Space Odyssey , Solaris and maybe a couple of others hadn't been made, this movie might have had a more dramatic impact for me. Not to say it isn't uniquely well done and artfully filmed, it just felt that it was done so in an overtly dramatic, heavy handed way which I've seen before. Maybe it's the human characteristic to treat things man has pondered for eons (immortality, creationism, etc) with a sense of awe, and maybe that's why sci-fi movies like this one go over the top with melodrama. But, once you've seen a movie do it once, there's a certain 'been there, done that' vibe. I still enjoyed the artful cinematography and non-linear storyline. The actors were almost an afterthought to the puzzlelike scenes, but they were pretty convincing. The film does tend to plod along at a rather slow pace, but as others have mentioned, that sort of added to the fascinating artistic aura of the scenes. Whether that added to the ultimate effectiveness of the movie is hard to say, without having that 'never been seen before' vibe to it.	3.0	Provocative, but the gravitas felt a bit cliched	2007-05-25	4	2	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1YUT6W5MNKKVD	Marc	While I loved 2001 which many people seem to be comparing this movie to, I was continually frustrated and annoyed. I like the tie in between the book, current times, and past times. The problem is I don't really feel there was much of a story  being told in any of the time periods and that their connection was flimsy at best. A repeat of certain scenes with small changes just further convoluted the story. Maybe I am missing some hidden meaning or message, maybe this is just not my type of film, or maybe it was just a poorly written story executed without real purpose or clarity. I am going with the latter.	1.0	Skip this movie	2012-09-10	12	5	7

They need to be on the same page more than ever and they won't be. People do that every {blanking} day and it's horrible. Infuse that with a backdrop of ancient understanding of death, some transcendent Buddha and/or DMT trip visuals and you have a very artful attempt at bridging the gap between us now, who are removed from death as a phase of life or an opportunity or a ""road to awe,"" and people before who lived with death in the next room. They got to know him. He was still kind of a dick, but they understood how it all fit together.

The visuals are just so over the top.  It isn't that I don't like thought provoking films.  It isn't that I don't understand existential expression and works of art that are ripped from the soul of an artist.As far as the ""meaning"" of this film goes - coming to peace with the statement ""I am going to die"": In my experience Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" is a far more cohesive work resulting in a far more meaningful experience. And Bergman beautifully brought us to this truth through the use of light rather than a battery of super-cooled graphics work stations.I just found The Fountain very boring and pretentious whereas The Seventh Seal kept me captivated from start to finish.  The visuals in The Fountain would have been great had they not been used to such excess.This film was a jumbled mess...  Jim Jarmusch is far more skilled than aronofsky at blending disparate timelines and stories into a unifying theme.The soundtrack drove both my wife and me crazy.  Lot's of viewers heap praise.  It was so repetitious it was like a dripping tap.  And folks, I like minimalist composers like Steve Reich, Terry Riley and Philip Glass.  Ugh.

Even after finishing the whole movie I'm still befuddled by why the director chose to start it that way.Calling this a movie that ""dabbles in the metaphysical"" is a bit of a farce. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just say that what seemed to be a metaphysical aspect angle turned out to be severely disappointing.Finally, the movie was waaaaaay too slow-moving. Perhaps the frustration I felt in the first 20 mins kept me from getting into the right mood later on, but I think only a small portion of viewers, namely those with a LOT of patience, will actually enjoy sitting through the whole thing. It's only 96 mins, but felt like 4 hrs b/c of the slow pace.Aronofsky should have just stuck to the romantic drama and avoided the poor attempt at tackling greater question around life's meaning."	2.0	"Slow, all over the place, not really ""metaphysical"""	2013-10-08	1	0	1

Unfortunately the Trailer shows most of the action scenes, but they are presented in the beginning to get things going. Hugh Jackman's character is strangely relatable at times and extremely mysterious at others. The plot was rather straightforward which wasn't essentially an Issue, but the story was solid. I enjoyed watching with another person, and at times pausing and making sure we kinda knew what was going on. It turns out it is all based upon an ancient Spanish culture that looked to the stars for solutions and as a final resting place. What exactly happens with all of this is a suspense builder that builds and builds to the very end. I would recommend this to others.	4.0	Intense, deep, and super trippy.	2013-02-27	0	0	0

The film's production problems played a part in the anticipation, but the most excitement came from the desire to see Aronfsky's follow up to the tragic, extremely depressing ""Requiem For a Dream.""  I was there when the film opened on Thanksgiving Day and was not disappointed.  I can't say I understood the film entirely, but a repeat viewing on DVD has given me a somewhat better idea.  Many critics panned this because it may come across as flaky and hard to grasp.  I can see their point, but the film's emotional beauty more than makes up for any confusion on the audience's part.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	After watching The Fountain, I have to say that it's the ultimate love story. True, it's very complicated to understand, and you need to have to your smart brain switched on. Since I don't have one of those, I just watched it and really enjoyed the love story unfolding before my eyes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were absolutely amazing characters, and I have to say Rachel did a brilliant job, but more about that later.The reason why this film can come across as complicated, as it spans centuries! Get your head around this: in 16th century Europe, Hugh plays a Spanish explorer searching for Incan magic; in the present day he plays a doctor desperately searchng for a cure for his dying wife, and in the far off future, he plays a hairless (!) space traveller, seeking a way into the afterlife.Rachel's character appears in nearly all of the scenes with Hugh, in different periods of time. The present day character she plays, is dying, possibly from a brain tumour (?), and Rachel really manages to throw herself into it. An extremely brutal haircut/wig really helps her pull it off.Hugh is a bit of a strange character in this, particularly in the present day segments again, his wife his dying, yet he keeps throwing himself into his work, suffering deep inside. But then he reads her unfinished novel, called The Fountain. Only she tells him to complete it after she dies. In the future, he appears almost completely hairless, which really freaked me out to begin with. He really didn't suit being bald, whether it was a skull cap thing, or he did actually shave it all off.It's a very strange, but moving movie ultimately, and there's not much to say about it, except see it! You might not possibly understand it, I definitely needed the ending explained to me! But it does all work, just might need a second viewing. Oh, and don't watch it alone - I figured if I'd watched it alone, I probably would have cried from beginning to end! I was nearly crying at the chimps/apes. But it's an excellent movie, and needs to be part of your collection. Now.	4.0	Love will stand the test of time	2008-01-04	2	1	1

Let's get the positives out the way: Hugh Jackman is excellent in this movie. The visuals are great. The concept was novel and it's different than most movies. Rachel Weisz was ""mostly"" good. The negatives: I think the movie could've been great if the overall sequence of events had meshed together better. The music was okay - not enough variation. It has most of the right pieces, but I just don't think the movie overall was constructed well enough. I don't think there will be a repeat viewing from me.

Kienan Briscoe"""	"I was first introduced to Darren's works when I heard he made a film based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel, Requiem For A Dream. Hubert, being one of my favourite authors, I simply had to see the film...it instantly became the best movie I had ever seen, and continues to be (even up until this day). Seeing as I rented the movie, I almost instantly ran down to an FYE and picked up a copy, yet the only version they had came in a two pack with his first film, Pi. I bought it anyway, and after seeing Pi, I was convinced that Aronofsky was the best film maker of this century. I had been counting the days until The Fountain was released in theatres and finally whence it was, my friends beat me to it, on an account I was out-of-town at the time. When I returned, I asked how it was, and some said ""Uhhh...."" some said ""I don't get it"" and others said ""You'll Love it...I did"".I watched this movie with the notion in my head that it would be ""weird"", and that I would really need to ""follow"" it. With that in mind, by the time the credits hit the screen I was left in astonishment, wonder, emptiness and wholeness simultaneously...Like seeing a masterpiece displayed in a gallery, or reading a poem that describes life beautifully and perfectly. I honestly did not think that he (Darren) could out do his previous works...but he did. Watch this movie at least, buy it is my recommendation, but if you're more into ""simple"" movies, don't care about aesthetics, or an intense/intelligent/creative/artistic approach to your films...than simply rent it, or see it at a friend's house...just so long as it makes an impression in your head sometime in your life."	5.0	Aronofsky is Brilliant...simply that.	2007-05-27	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A37NANKMB3SSI5	Michael D Reese	"This is a movie that you will either love or hate - not much middle ground.  The movie presents three interwoven story lines that may or may not be a single story that stretches over several centuries. The dialog is sparse and things said or seen in one story line gain significance only when considered in light of the other stories. The photography and music are integral components to the movie.  It is a beautifully filmed movie and the soundtrack sets the mood wonderfully.  This is a romantic movie as the term is used to describe literary works - the Shakespeare play ""The Tempest"" is an example. The ending is not ""happy"" but it is appropriate.  The conclusion is right and appropriate and achieves a final reconciliation that evokes feelings of satisfaction, but something of a mixture of peace and sadness rather than ""happy, happy, joy, joy.""  If this does not sound like something you'd like to experiece, then you won't be one of the ""love it"" group.  Because the movie does not depend on a suprise ending, it can be watched and enjoyed repeatedly by anyone who wants to experience the visual, auditory, and emotional sensations that this movie evokes."	5.0	beautifully crafted movie	2011-01-01	1	0	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1M2VKI7TAJDCJ	Michael James	"The promoters of this film billed it as an ""epic-sized love story that stretches across centuries and galaxies,"" putting Hugh Jackman's Thomas in three distinct sequences in time: the 16th century in the past, the present day, and the 26th century in the future as a ""space traveler."" From reading the comments left by viewers, it seems everyone took this advertising campaign promotion literally.This movie was filled with symbols and metaphors, and it surprises me that no one considered that the Tree of Life in the space sequence was not actually a tree that Thomas somehow transplanted into space but was actually a symbol for Izzie - she dies, the tree dies; the medicinal cocktail made from a tree in Guatemala, where the Tree of Life in Izzie's story is found by the Spanish conquistador. Why did everyone assume that Izzie's story was actually a real event, just because Thomas envisioned the conquistador and the Queen as himself and Izzie?Almost all the reviewers described the sequence with Thomas in the bubble with the tree flying through space as Thomas' 26th century search through space, with plenty of comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Where did that 26th century number come from? Just from the back of the DVD case, because there was no mention of it in the actual film. Yet people just assumed this was the ""sci-fi"" part of the movie. Why didn't people consider the possibility that this was Thomas' spiritual journey, the anguish in his mind, the tattoos symbolic of his desperate attempt not to lose her (the tattooed ring, the rings up and down his arms like the rings of a tree), the bark he extracts so carefully from the Tree of Life to eat like the sample of the Guatemalan tree he used in his lab to cure the brain tumor in the present day. He suffers the worst grief and anguish in the real world as he goes through the dark cloud in ""space,"" before reaching the enlightenment of the Xibalba nebula, when he finally understands that to be immortal is to go through life's cycle and to accept death as part of that cycle - it's no accident that Aronovsky sequences this part to time with the scene in which the conquistador eats the sap and becomes apart of the tree, followed by his planting of a seed on Izzie's grave, like her Guatemalan guide did for his father.You've let yourselves be strung along by producers who felt it would be too hard for the American movie consumer to grasp the idea that it wasn't actually an ""epic-sized love story that stretches across centuries and galaxies,"" but rather one man's epic struggle to deal with his love's death."	5.0	Stop being spoon-fed by the ad campaign	2007-10-16	9	7	2

The film is woven together in a sensible way which, although might slip by you in the first viewing, provides a satisfying interplay of the storylines.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AC6LV5D2RKTIR	"Michigoon ""tech geek"""	This is a film which proves there is in fact a place in this world to utter phrases along the lines of, &#34;people who don't understand this movie are probably not very informed about movies.&#34; I'm sorry to seem arrogant, but the film is an absolute masterpiece in all respects. The Fountain deserves to be placed among the greatest movies of all time, and it gets an unfair amount of hatred. Aranofsky's project could have been seen as what it was, a beautiful piece of art which accomplished everything that people who value artistic integrity which would happen instead of the business-as-usual of Hollywood. Instead, the movie was hated because many couldn't understand its ambition. Please, open your mind, and see this film.If you're a film buff, aspiring or accomplished, &#34;The Fountain&#34; must be put directly at the top of your &#34;must-see&#34; list. Absolutely every aspect of this movie is incredible. I'll give this a quick breakdown, but seriously- watch this film.Sound- Clint Mansell's score forms one of the greatest albums in modern history, and I'll pause to say I'm being completely serious about my level of enthusiasm. The music is so rich with emotion, that it could be used for guided meditation- and I have used it as such myself. You may want to go ahead and purchase the score separately- it will move you to tears.Imagery- The film's journey is largely accomplished by imagery that rides on Mansell's wonderful score. Often intentionally dreamlike, a wealth of computer-generated or computer-enhanced scenes transport you from the familiar and in to Aranofsky's world. The visuals, especially toward the climax, are something that could only be accomplished by modern filmmaking. Truly an epic journey.Acting- Hugh Jackman is among the best actors of this era, and he's in fine form here. Much of the movie develops from silent emoting and small actions which must carry great effect, a role which requires a master, and Jackman excels. Rachel Weisz plays a supporting role in every sense, the strength and beauty of her character being necessary for our hero's journey.Script- The movie is so gorgeous and accomplished- in audio, video, and kinetics- that it could otherwise be a silent film and still be every bit as amazing. The words which are spoken serve to make the central theme explicit, although there is no true narrative in the traditional sense. As Aranofsky has said, the action of the film is essentially a &#34;very simple love story,&#34; the larger journey of the film is what transports this basic story onto a higher plane.If you care about films, see The Fountain now. Aranofsky is a master, and this work deserves so much more praise than it has garnered.	5.0	Intelligent Masterpiece	2013-02-27	1	1	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AJMM44A9Q1ZMQ	Mick Guitar	"I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan -- and I don't mean that I'll only like a Jackman movie if it's in the vein of X-Men, Swordfish, etc -- I understand the man's range as an actor, and I was frankly ready to enjoy him in a ""deeper, broader"" film, as I expected this one to be.  No such luck, unfortunately.  I have no problem with the film's non-linearity of plot (I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"").  No, my problem lies with a film that pretends to be - but is not - a ""work of art"", and is instead a dull, lifeless series of vignettes that seem loosely related to each other, but which overall has such a lack of cosehiveness that it literally leaves you feeling cheated out of your time and effort.  I viewed it with my wife and teen-age kids, and at the end, our collecive reaction was - literally - ""That's IT...?"" (or, feel free to replace ""What the hell was THAT...?"").  Visually, the film has its moments, especially the ""bubble in space"" scenes.  But the whole ""tree of life"" thing is SO over-done, Jackman's pathetic crying scenes are so plentiful and overly long, and the bizarre ""Kung Fu/Kwai Chang Caine-like"" similarities (Jackman in a floating, zero-gravity lotus position looks embarrasingly like David Carradine -- I half expected Master Po to appear on the scene) are so ludicrous that one finds oneself wishing for a merciful end.  Eventually, that end does arrive, but it is so anticlimatic, and so ""lame"", for want of a better word, that it's literally as though the actors, director, and all concerned collectively had had enough, and decided to just STOP.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1T46HFY68E6E3	Midwest Bibliophile	"I began watching this film with the expectation that it would be somehwat odd and transcend ""usual"" filmaking. It exceeded my expectations, however, to the point where I was just frustrated by the obvious path of the story line(s) and the relentlessly repeating nebula effect and insipid orchestration.  After the initial disorientation - trying to figure out what was going on in the plot(s) - the rest was...waiting for the movie to end. I found myself crtitiquing the lighting of the laboratory (too dark) and operating room (too dark) and surgical technique (not very sterile even for animal surgery) and the recurring visual theme of the multi-tentacled cancer - nebula imagery that the production designer and/or director obviously wantted to penetrate our thick skulls.  Whenever I find my mind wandering like this during a film, I know that the film itself is intriguing, but not a film I can reccommend. The reason for my title ""Good but not great...unless you're in a ceratin frame of mind"" dervies from the fact that I think this movie ould be quite touching for couples going through breast cancer or other serious issues together. It is a very introspective film and I imagine it would evoke serious introspection and emotions in someone in the mind-set for such an exercise.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AN8M401S8Y6DA	Mike Liddell	"That is the message that came through to me in Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain which goes about as deep as your imagination wants to go.  Aronofsky is one of the most ambitious and creative of modern filmmakers and writers, and The Fountain is one ambitious and touching project.  Other creative and ambitious directors/writers that come to mind in the same class are Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind) and the new Mexican wave of directors Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Children of Men), Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu (Babel), and the great Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth).As I said this film could be analyzed and go as deep and as personal as you like, you can literally make this film your own.  For me it was about searching for time and what your missing while you search.  What better actor then to cast in such a role then Hugh Jackman who in 2006 appeared in 6 films including The Fountain, Happy Feet, Flushed Away, The Prestige, Scoop, and X-Men the Last Stand.  Jackman in that year brought himself to a new level, how busy must he have been, what was he missing out on while working so hard, maybe that is why he delivers such a real and touching performance.  Another perfectly cast role is Aronofsky's wife Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz in a story where she is someones wife and dying, she was powerful in this and I'm sure it hit home with such topics and only having to look over her shoulder to see the love of her life and imagine him in Jackman's role.  Jackman is unable to accept her dying, he is in a position to make a change being a scientist, he is so close and time is running out.  He misses the walk of the first snow with her due to working for a cure, he is not at her bedside when she needs him, so while he is busy trying to have more time with her he is losing the time he could be having.  Weisz's character is writing a book ""The Fountain"" where a conquistador goes on a mission to find the fountain of youth while in the process all of Spain's men are slain.  She leaves the last chapter for her husband to finish.This could apply to anyone who puts in too much overtime to provide for their family or is so into there career and getting more and more that there missing out on their kids childhood and that you can't get back.Another point as brought up as he died so we could live, in the process of trying to save his wife he makes an amazing discovery which could help many people, so because of her illness she inspires him to find a cure and if she dies her death could have saved countless others.  And you could keep going and analyzing this bold tale of life and death and choices.I gave this 4.5 stars as 10minutes before the end I found the film to lose itself for a time being, however I might have just been lost, I still found it to be a powerful and touching  film.  The theory of a person being buried and growing into a tree and death is life, and the sole lives on, like those messages this movie for me evolves and transcends beyond a film and into a message and a feeling.  Even if I forgot the film's specifics and the characters names over time, to think of the Film I would still remember the feeling it gave me and the message I took from it."	5.0	4.5 Stars.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A34Q7J7VJA3EAQ	mike reider	take an idea, namely a story about the depth of time, the extent of love between one soul and another, and the uncomfortable thoughts of one's own mortality, and you have a story thats timeless in its portrayal of life, death and the journey that carries us from one side to the next.this is what Aronofsky was trying to achieve with the Fountain. Having finally watched this, my first reaction is one of profound awe, not only for the beautiful portrayal of space and haunting nebulas, the amazing soundtrack filled with sad violins (Clint Mansell) but also of the extent of the story itself.the concept of the Tree of Life or everlasting life is very intriguing, and Aronofsky does an excellent job showing the Spanish search for this treasure, but he also expertly ties the storyline to a single character and his own search for life, life for his wife Izabella who is dying of cancer.Although this film is laden with symbolism, and 'heavy' concepts such as life, death and eternity, it doesnt feel overwhelming, nor outlandish. Its simply beautiful both visually and contextually. Its very hard to rate and even review this film because of its original and unique nature. All I can say is watch it and interpret it for yourself. The acting is phenomenal, and the story itself encompasses more than words can say.	4.0	A phenomenal film - in the great Kubrickian tradition, it makes you think	2007-07-18	1	1	0

Following an ingenious non-linear narrative of death, life, loss, and the quest to understand it all, Thomas and Izzie (played marvelously by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz), whose relationship in the present is transcendent, in the past is blooming, and in the future is unrequited, take us on several journeys (which is the same journey?) to discover what life, death, and love is all about.

I absolutely love 2001 (big surprise, right)- my brother hated it.  People love watching poker on TV...I didn't get that gene unfortunately because my friends really have fun watching it.That's what makes life grand.  I saw this in the movie theater after WANTING to see it.  I liked it but was just a little confused about one aspect at first (I like movies that confuse me at first though).  I just was unsure where it should have started or ended.  Then when I bought it on dvd and watched it again, my take was that it was a cyclical story.  It could start or end at any point in the movie.  This is what I loved about it along with the strong visuals and atmospheric score.  For me the more important thing in the movie was when he realizes he's going to die more than the ""love story"".  I'm not going into a long explanation of what I ""got"" in this movie. What is neat about the film is the difference on opinions if you look at the reviews.  It's not a middle of the road film I think which almost makes it one of those films you see to argue with your friends about how you loved it or hated it.All I can say, is that you MAY like it if you're kind of aware of what it's about and have an interest in seeing it.  If you just saw it as a another friday night rental or you have no idea what it's about or don't have motivation to really watch it, then you MAY not like it.  I would hope you would like it but if you don't...I understand. Just like how my brother hates 2001 but I love it."	5.0	Like Bjork, you're gonna either LOVE it or HATE it...	2007-06-05	2	0	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A7YYT3GKA8W29	"M. Johnson ""Boone"""	"Film: The FountainAudience: me (46) and son (12)One more off my to-watch list. Note to past self: don't bother.Warning: &lt;spoilers>. But go ahead and read this anyway. I'm not really spoiling anything worthy of protection. Telling you that the secret entree of a mystery meal is in fact an inedible boiled chicken foot isn't really a spoiler.I love weird. I love beautiful. I love sci-fi. I love fascinating stories and compelling characters. Darren Aronofski's The Fountain had too little of each. It's two-and-a-half interwoven stories. In one, Spanish conquistadors search for the biblical Tree of Life a la Garden of Eden. In another, a biologist is on the cusp of a breakthrough that could change humanity and save the life of his dying girlfriend. In the -and-a-half, the biologist is taking his girlfriend-tree up to a dying star in a magic space bubble. I was encouraged to watch it primarily for the visuals, and to a lesser extent the sci-fi and the drama.The visual aspect:As stunning as the visuals are at first, they don't stay fresh for long. You've seen the poster of a guy and a tree in a bubble floating into a nebula. That made for quite an image for a few minutes, but they just keep cutting back to it without giving us a clue what's going on. And that whole segment is so awash in some of the worst cliche, new-age pamphlet images that started getting on my nerves almost immediately. Lots of images of a bald guy in kung-fu pajamas meditating in the lotus position among the stars and bathed in a cosmic/spiritual light...gag. This third of the movie looks like every hokey new-age pamphlet you've ever dropped in a garbage can ten steps after some stinky hippy shoved it in your hand.The sci-fi aspect:What if you could live forever? Who knows? They pretty much asked the question, then moved on without looking back. A biologist finds a tree who's sap heals all ailments and could give eternal life, and possibly save his girlfriend who's dying of a brain tumor, which brings us to the final point...The drama aspect:...the biologist's lab boss comes in and tells him the cure works, seconds after his girlfriend dies in his arms.There's porn, where it's just people ""doin' it"" on screen for the sole purpose of giving you sexual arousal  without any aesthetic value. Recently the very useful term was coined, ""torture porn"" which provides some with sadistic arousal. After watching Fountain, I'm moved to further extend the construction to ""tragedy porn"" in which you're given to watch people being sad in the same fashion. Sad, sad, sad...the end. She's sick, and he's all emotional, but she's strong and ""not afraid"" (she keeps hitting us over the head with this fact). Then she's dead, and we get to watch everyone be sad for what seems an eternity--what if you could be sad forever? In lieu of  a story, they real-quick run through the textbook K&uuml;bler-Ross stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression & acceptance). Watching this with my son, we had one of those great comic moments of spontaneous synchronicity where I started the sentence and he finished it with me, ""It would be really sad...if only we cared."" That's it. There's no reason to care about them. We spend the first thirty minutes trying to sort out what the heck is going on as the film is intentionally weird and confusing, and the characters are more ciphers than souls which makes it hard to emotionally relate to or invest in them.But I was a good viewer. I never fast-forwarded or skipped ahead. I had faith that there'd be some kind of payoff if I endured till the end. The payoff? A guy turns in to a bush. That's it. It was kinda cool, I guess. hardly worth two hours, though. Like the whole movie, pseudo-profound.It imitates depth, and for a teenager, it might actually pass as deep. But it's really just that guy who's a pretentious freshman philosophy major trying to impress all the bimbos at the party with how deep he is.Dark, dull, dour, slow and sophomoric. When it was finished I suggested my son put in a DVD of something less boring. He quipped, ""that could be just about anything.""My advice, don't hesitate to fast-forward.

One thing about this is the music is just of that like on Requiem. Done by Mansell, his music makes the movie so much better and gives the movie more emotion.

Mayne	There is so much in this movie that it is difficult to begin to review it; and many others here have summarized the plot and described particular scenes.The Fountain _effects_ you.  Rich in symbolism, it manages to baffle you and wrench your heart out at the same time, while moving you through a 3-tiered story that is a metaphor for each of our lives.  It isn't something you watch, its something you experience, and when it is over, you are not the same.  Every aspect of this movie is brilliant, : the cinematography, the use of color, the use of symbolism, the acting, the ambient sounds -- woven together so perfectly and seamlessly that you find yourself coming full circle.  This is something you can watch, then start it over and watch it again and have not quite the same experience.  And it is completely unforgettable.In all honesty, I have to think that anyone who does not love this film simply failed to understand what it was trying to do.  This is not a blockbuster, its a philosophical journey about love, life, & death, and as should be viewed as such.	5.0	This film will change you.	2007-11-30	2	0	2

The underlying moral dilemma and the conflict and conversely link between science and faith were explored but unfortunately drowned a bit in the action as is often the case when a movie has to fit the conventional 1.5-2.5 hour time set aside.What brings me to write this review is that I have just completed reading the ""The Source"" a highly entertaining yet mind provocative book by Michael Cordy. It like the movie is about a current day scientist made to follow in the tracks of a route the Spanish colonialist did when the discovered Latin America to seek to save his mortally ill wife. And in this quest seek the source of all life, The Tree Of Life.Interestingly the book seems to have been published AFTER the movie so I am very interested in knowing the link between the two - for there must be one - the similarites are too many.I enjoyed both but the book obviously was able to dig deeper in the moral and scientific dilemmas and I thus give that 4 Stars and the movie 3.

The director of this movie is up there with Stanley Kubrick in my book, and lived up to the expectations set by Requiem For a Dream. After reading all of the one star comments, I have just this to say to those haters: ""Don't watch an abstract movie if you're too stupid and ignorant to try and get something other than Madea Goes To Jail.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2UD8A6JDZ8L4M	"Mr. Mike ""Sci Fi Guy"""	"This film appeared to have a lot of things going for it when I saw the previews and heard the initial reviews. Its been a loooong time since there was a truly epic, meta-physical, thought-provoking film, the last one being 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Many positive reviews seem to try and compare this to 2001 and Im not quite sure what they are thinking.  This movie has almost NOTHING in common with 2001 and to compare this meandering, pointless drivel to that movie is an insult to Mr. Kubrick.This movie was basically just a love story littered with scene after scene of Hugh Jackman in a space bubble.  The special effects are OK but the same shots seem to be used over and over robbing them of impact.  Rachel Weisz plays a good character and you are impressed by her resolve and her attitide as she faces imminent death but is not afarid of it.  Jackman is OK in this role but he has one too many crying scenes that just dont seem to be naturally occurring or forced if you will. Overall, the love story itself was not bad and there were moments when you did feel for the characters and their tough situation.  However, this was badly ruined by the completely incoherent, muddled plot that jumped around like my kids on sugar.  Scene after pointless scene of old Spain, space bubble, kissing the wifes neck, etc, were inserted into the wrong place or wrong context and it really killed the flow of the movie for me.  The film felt like it was 3 hours long but was only a little over an hour and a half.  By the time it ended I really felt cheated and rather disappointed.Before all of the ""You didnt get it"" nimrods start spewing their hate, please realize that I got it all right but there really isnt anything to get. There is a VERY fine line between artsy movies being plodding and pointless or being incredible works of art. Well, this film is much closer to pointless than it is incredible art. The director was trying to make it clever without really thinking muich about why or how and ended up with what seeemd like an abstract film-student mess. This was NOT profound at all.  It was not mesmerizing. It was simply a fairly common ""been there, done that"" love story with some semi-cheesey sci-fi scenes thrown in to make you think you were watching some ""grand"" epic.Go ahead, watch it. You may like it as apparently many other people did. I guess I missed the boat on this one though..... it was mostly dull, poorly plotted, and not even remotely close to a movie like 2001.Proceed at your own risk....."	2.0	A somewhat touching love story.... but plodding, incoherent, and quite disappointing.....	2007-05-27	9	7	2

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A34IBFZRTFGT66	Mulcite	"It's a real shame that this movie has been so negatively received by many people.  Honestly, I think you have to give it a chance and open up your mind to see the masterpiece that it is.  While watching it the first time, I thought it was absolutely horrendous, but after it finally ended, it was like all the pieces came together and there was something brilliant within.  I've watched it a few more times after that and each time I notice these various ideas (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) that really evoke deep poignancy and thoughtful reflection.It's a profound spiritual journey that addresses the basic human condition and the biggest question(s) of life that we all face.  And no, I don't think its mission is to discredit Christianity nor to uphold it.  The answer it gives is ambiguous (like a good answer to any unanswerable question), and it is presented in a beautiful, mystical way that really deepens ones sense of life and spirituality (at least in my experience).If you come to this movie with the same attitude as any other movie (like Star Wars, or some typical romantic drama, or any other ""typical"" movie) you will certainly be disappointed.  I think that is why many people don't like it; they have the wrong expectations.  If you come to this movie expecting a deep spiritual experience and you wish to have your mind and spirit opened to a greater sense of profundity, intrigue, and mystique - I think you will be pleased.If you don't get anything out of it, and reading the analyses of others doesn't help, then I suppose this movie was not intended for someone of your mindset.Give it a chance and I hope you will see ""The Fountain"" is a spiritual masterpiece."	5.0	Give it a chance	2008-11-16	2	2	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	The story behind Pi and Requiem For a Dream director Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is almost as interesting as the film itself.  Originally conceived a few years back, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the feature roles, along with a much larger budget than the end result, The Fountain was put on indefinite hiatus thanks to nearly every party involved backing out.  Shortly there after, Aronofsky adapted his story into a graphic novel for DC Comics' mature readers imprint Vertigo, and soon enough, the film would be resurrected to be what we have now.  And be glad it was.  The Fountain is, for lack of a better word, a triumph of modern film making.  Hugh Jackman stars as Tom in this metaphysical love story spanning a thousand years.  Beginning as a Spanish conquistador, continuing as a present day desperate doctor, and finally as an interstellar traveler, Tom tries again and again to cheat death and ensure an eternity with his dearly beloved Izzi (Rachel Weisz), only to lose her time and again as well.  Aronofsky's theme and look at the inevitability of death is powerful to say the least.  It's no secret that Aronofsky doesn't present the film in the most accessable manner, nor is that his intention.  This is not a film that one can just walk into and know what to expect: The Fountain is a slow moving and heart wrenching journey that isn't easy to take, but for those that do, they will find something that is truly special indeed.  Jackman gives the absolute best performance of his career, and that, as well as the amazing special effects (mostly done without CGI!) are worth the price of admission alone.  Simply put, The Fountain is a masterpiece of modern film making; but be forewarned, this is not a film for all tastes and audiences.  If you do check it out and are not sure what to make of it, give it a second viewing, and above all, give it a chance.	5.0	A triumph	2007-05-15	2	1	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3SU3TXON36T0X	"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos"""	"And he commanded him, saying:  Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.  For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.-  _Genesis_ 2:16 - 7._The Fountain_ (2006) is a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which combines themes from various religions and science fiction concerning the fact of mortality.  Unfortunately, the movie combines these themes into nothing more than a syncretic neo-Gnostic porridge and thus fails to achieve any sort of redeeming message.  The film has three strands of development which make it difficult to follow, tracing the activities of a scientist as he attempts to discover a cure for his cancer-striken wife.  While the movie features themes from Roman Catholicism, the religion of the ancient Mayas, and Buddhism, it should be noted that the underlying message is ultimately Gnostic in origin - featuring the age old conflict at root in the Garden of Eden and behind mankind's Faustian quest for knowledge.  The film shows a Catholic inquisitor opposing the quest for immortality and makes the case that such figures are reactionary.  (We can see such conflict between moralists and those who support the diaboleries of the scientifically managed state today.)However, the film fails to note the contrast between earthly life and the promised life in the world to come.  The film also fails to appreciate the true meaning of the Fall from Grace in the Christian faith.  As such, the movie enters into the realms of the heretical Gnostics who sought to create God's Kingdom here on earth.  Christian philosophers have long warned against such attempts to ""immanentize the eschaton"" as Eric Voegelin put it and have repeatedly noted how such attempts have led to the various totalitarian political religions of our age.  (Such attempts are also at root behind the utopian urges that have given rise to the scientifically managed state.)  In his quest to achieve immortality for his wife, the scientist/conquistadore turns his back on the traditional Christian understanding of the human soul.  As such, this movie can only be seen for what it is, as a profoundly anti-Catholic film.  It should also be added that the blending of religious traditions makes for a disconcerting effect, with no clear-cut boundaries between each such tradition.  In this respect, the film reduces all such traditions to ultimate meaninglessness and thus fails to achieve anything ultimately lasting or worthwhile.  This of course is to be expected however given the fact that Aronofsky is an admitted atheist."	1.0	A Profoundly Anti-Catholic Film.	2007-08-07	16	5	11
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	One recurring theme for manifests itself annually in Hollywood is the movie about lovers transcending death and time to be with each other.  Past examples include Somewhere in Time, The Lake House, Timeline, Bicentennial Man, and maybe even the Sixth Sense.  This is probably the weirdest of them all, but also the most intriguing.  The movie is actually three stories wrapped into one, all of which feature three characters, Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, and a tree that gives life.  The three are intertwined and revolve around a man, played by Hugh Jackman, trying to save his lover, played by Rachel Weisz, using the power of a tree.  All are OK stories in and of themselves, but meshed together the whole is more than the sum of the parts.  The same music theme is used for all three stories, which is unfortunate and repetitive.  Both Jackman and Weisz act well, and the story is interesting enough.  It just jumps a little too much, and the story that takes part in the future is not fleshed out that well.  The title of the movie refers to a book being written by Weisz's character, and my guess is that it refers to the Fountain of Youth.	3.0	Weird journeys	2007-07-11	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2UI0PZ1RQMHBU	"N. Gail Jude ""therapist"""	"I found this movie incredibly moving. What seems to be lacking in the perspectives of some of the reviewers is that it is not a literal or linear film.  The Fountain is a work of art that has layers and layers of meaning and needs to be interpreted accordingly.  Quite bluntly, if one mythically translates the symbolism of each character and the implied sense of sequential timing of events, one realizes the events are not necessarily occurring in some fictional history but are actually meant to imply symbolic, simultaneous, and multidimensional occurances in time.This is, in my opinion, the timeless and universal story of a symbolic representation of the soul, the queen or anima, sending the body-mind consciousness, the conquistador/physician, on a quest to discover universal immortality. In order to do so, the physician, the conquistador, the body-mind-trapped human being, is imprisoned in a bubble of its own belief systems and fears, much as many of us are. This is its afterlife or on-going life experience.  In this state, the character ascends toward heaven, but can never quite enter until it accepts its mortality and the necessity of death. Once it is able to accept the need to ""finish it"" and enter into death and transition, it discovers it becomes the essence of life itself, the all-father, the consciousness from which life springs. Through this the queen or soul is reunited with the body-mind consciousness, now self-aware, in eternity, and able to transcend time and mortality.To me, the movie is a beautiful representation of the essense of the spiritual quest of humanity.  I highly recommend it and look forward to its release in DVD."	5.0	Archetypal	2006-12-29	33	27	6

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A362483SNG259K	"Nick C. ""Nick"""	This movie falls into two categories...those who love it and those who don't understand it. Why didn't I say hate it? Well, everyone who says they 'hated' it was so completely lost that I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt. These are the people who will go and see 'Transformers' and think it rocked. The Fountain is not for everyone to be sure. Those with short attention spans should stay home and watch the Simpsons instead. You'll have a much better time and not pay $20 bucks for food.Positives:1. Visually one of the most impressive movies to date. The use of special effects was done so well the movie is a piece of art.2. The soundtrack was incredible! Clint Mansell knows what he's doing! Every aspect of his work shines like the sun throughout the movie, captivating and carrying the audience to heights almost as high as the visual effects.3. Costumes for various periods were done exceptionally well. The space shots were a favorite of mine. I love the way the futuristic ship was shown to be a simple bubble instead of a Star Wars death whatever. Great attention was spent on the detail and the effort pays off.4. Buy this on HD DVD if you can! Very few films aside from 'Planet Earth' will show off the features of your $500 - $1000 dollar players. This is not the movie to cut corners on! Drop it in your HD DVD tray and take a ride! An HD television will eat this movie up like a fine meal at a five star restaurant.Negatives:1. Acting was not Oscar worthy to be sure. Not too much chemistry behind Hugh and Rachel that I could see. Better casting may have (or may not) have helped this film along.2. The plot made this film unreachable for all but the most open minded person. Those who wanted just a visual fix were pleased, but unable to explain the movie to anyone else who asked about it. It dipped so heavily into metaphysical and spiritual themes that the plot seemed to come and go almost at will. If you can get past this, your home free. I really don't know who or what the target audience for this film was, but it was really small. I can't say I understood everything this movie was trying to say, it was more of general journey that held different things for different people and it's not worth arguing over with anyone. Take it for what you can and leave with your own message. If you try to overanalyze each point you're only going to leave with a headache.3. Satisfaction? Well, that depends on who you are. If you have to figure out all the details to be happy, like the end of 'Planet of the Apes' with Mark Walberg, and how those chimps took over the earth...then you need to avoid this movie like the plague. This movie is not for you...end of story. If however, you can see past yourself and enjoy the movie on its own merits, you'll have a great time as I did. I went to the IPOD website and downloaded the soundtrack the day I saw the movie. When I was asked what it was about I was truthful and told only select few to go see it.

You begin unaware of what's going on, but through magnificent repeated imagery and symbolism the pieces begin to fall into place ever so slowly. The story builds with tension and conflict and emotion. Building at such a perfect pace that anyone truly interested in a well told story, both visually and plotted, will enjoy this masterpiece.This is a movie you must follow along with, it will not spoon feed you like typical movies. You must want to know, you must trust the director to show you a story. You need to work with the story and become a part of it or you will fail to see the beauty. If you do, you will have one question towards the end, ""How does it end?"" And when it does end, when it's all over, you will have taken part in the greatest love story ever. A journey through time and space.If your looking for an action sci-fi, this isn't it.If your looking for an easy movie to just slip into, this isn't it.If your looking for a movie that gives you all the questions and answers this isn't it.This movie gives you the question ""How does it end?""Perhaps the question is ""How does life end?""

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1EG0UHLOAGKEA	Omid Moghimi	Abstract, and arguably a little disjointed, The Fountain is also quite genuine, well-thought, and beautiful to the eyes, ears, and heart. It deals with some of the most written about philosophic issues of mankind: love, life, death, possibility of an afterlife, and what it means to be at peace with the reality of the world (ironically, explored through science fiction and fantasy). Although it has a rotten rating on rotten tomatoes (only 51 positive), and I can see why many might find it to be simplistic or overdone, I found that I was quickly absorbed into the world(s) created by Aronofsky, and was touched by the simple yet exceedingly important (and so easily overlooked in the real world) issues and themes it explored. Plus, all the philosophic and metaphysical stuff aside, the sound-track and scenery are both awe-inspiring.	4.0	A great journey	2012-12-09	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3B5ICCQHELN7K	Pandora Spox	"It's a tree of life, not a fountain of youth. That's kind of a microcosm of what's wrong with this film -- it's too random and unexplained. It comes off as unfulfilled potential masquerading as High Art.There's an intimation that the past, present and future Jackmans are the same person, because the future Jackman hallucinates the past and present Rachel Weisz. But there's not even a hint as to how this might have transpired, be it through immortality, reincarnation, etc.While the fate of Conquistador Jackman underlines the philosophy of the film, it leaves viewers who bothered to care disquieted because his intended mission, which was pretty darned important, seemed to be for naught.Present-day Jackman plants a seed as he was instructed, but I don't think the desired end result could be achieved given the impediment of a coffin.And future Jackman? Bottled up in an intergalactic terrarium, eating bark and tattooing himself? What a nightmare of an existence.I was tempted to give up on the film, but my husband pointed out, ""If we don't watch it through to the end, we'll never know which was more boring: the past, the present, or the future.""As the end credits rolled, he gently recommended, ""Just leave the Netflixin' to me.""There are definitely some interesting ideas and beautiful visuals, but it never comes together in a truly meaningful way."	2.0	First of all, there isn't even a fountain.	2007-09-03	16	10	6

This movie also does an excellent job of exemplifying how all lives are lived at once.  The main character in the role is Thomas and his three (3) lives consist of the following:1)Thomas the Conquistador  - Sent to South America to deliver Spain from bondage.2)Thomas the Doctor - Research doctor to save his wife (Izzy )(Queen Isabel) from brain cancer.3)Thomas the Over soul- Separated journey to a nebula (Source of all life)In Thomas the Conquistador, he searches for the Biblical Tree of life in South America for his Queen (his wife Izzy in his Thomas the Doctor life).  In his Thomas the Doctor life, his wife is dying and she is the Tree of Life.  In the Thomas the Over soul life, he is ""bound"" in a separated sphere of belief with a dying tree of life as he drifts towards the nebula or his death/transformation.The ring is a symbol of union between Thomas and Izzy (Adam & Eve).  The ring is also a symbol of union between Thomas the Oversoul and his separate lives (Doctor & Conquistador).  The queen gives the ring to Thomas the Conquistador.  Thomas looses the ring as a doctor.  As Thomas the Over soul, he inks the ring up his entire arm to commemorate the memory of Izzy pulling him thru time.  As Thomas the Over soul enters the Nebula or Source, he puts the ring on just before transformation.Probably the strangest part of the movie is the role of the Inquisitor in the Thomas the Conquistador life.  The Inquisitor plays the role of an ascetic Gnostic not a Christian.  Christian dogma views the body as the temple of Christ/God.  The Inquisitor views the body as a prison of the soul and it is his job to destroy the body of repenting heretics to free them to enter Heaven or Hell.  This is Gnosticism not Christian.  The name Thomas is Gnostic in itself (Gospel of Thomas from the Nag Hammadi Library discovered in Egypt in 1945).  In the Thomas the Doctor life, Izzy feels ""full"", complete, whole (holy) as she falls or nears death or transformation.  The Gnostic term for ""full"" or fullness is the Pleroma or the fullness of being.This is not a Sci-Fi movie.  It is a spiritual movie of who we forgot we are...eternal.  There is no other like it.  It is beautifully done from the static sound of the hair on the tree or Izzy's neck to the beautiful nebula in its entire splendor.  The background of the stars as Thomas the Over soul conducts martial arts movements with his silhouette of his body creating a ""void"" in space.  Again it is as if Thomas the Over soul will not transform or join with the rest of the universe.......thus he is a void in space/creation.As Thomas the Over soul with the help of Izzy, he accepts his death/transformation, he assumes the full lotus position of mediation and breaks free of the ego (belief in a separated self) in the form of a sphere containing the now dead tree of life.  He accelerates faster towards the SOURCE and he now proclaims.....IT IS FINISHED!"	5.0	Finish It!	2009-07-27	5	4	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A31GBVWDCXZ491	Paul DuPont	I can see the arguments against this film. the plot is not intricate but presents itself in a confusing way that has unexplained holes and loose ends. The movie isn't flashy and it doesn't give the actors a lot of room to move around and show their talent. The film is very different - and different can be good, bad, scary, and/or enlightening.The great part is: THIS FILM IS DIFFERENT! Aronofsky poured himself into this film, and it shows. Yes, it deals with vague issues and has a melodrama feel to it, but if we as viewers need to have a movie spoon feed us with trite dialogue and flashy action sequences to understand the thematic elements of the movie then we aren't holding up our end of the bargain as engaged film viewers.What I love is that Aronofsky understands the film medium and the ability to progress the form in a way that no other American director seems to be doing these days. Go back and watch some Louis Bunuel, or some Jean Luc Godard and you'll see what I mean.It's sad to see that our culture is so wrapped up in an MTV style presentation that many people have difficulty recognizing beauty when they see it. I urge you to watch this film (or re-watch it) and just allow yourself to become involved with the characters, let Clint Mansell's amazing score fill your ears and try to enjoy this film for what it is: an experiment in the metophysical.A Beautiful movie.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AFHNNJFCQB4RM	Paul S. Fratianni	"If you are at all philosophically and or spiritually minded it is a good chance you will love this movie. This is not the type of movie for those who relish ""Mission Impossible Three"". The fountain is slow paced, thought provoking, as well as intensely and somberly acted. The theme of the movie is over all about acceptance and the spiritual comfort of intimately being aware of the cycle of atrophy and creation. In my honest opinion this movie was incredible, but be warned, not all will see it this way. Yes, there are spiritually clich&eacute;d moments like Zen sitting poses and pans into the third eye. But this can easily be over looked because of the impeccable acting and the much needed message which was enlightening and healthy. I would heartily recommend this movie for any person seeking more to life than just seeking to fulfill the pleasure principle. Go see it. Even if you don't like it, which I sincerely hope you will. The experience of watching The Fountain will likely plant a seed which will metaphorically, like in the movie, spring into something new and wonderful."	5.0	Life-Death-Rebirth-Acceptance-Enlightenment	2007-01-14	0	0	0

Notice reviews with reference to time travel, that is not at all what is happening in this film. It is so rare that a film of this nature, with high production values, is made. Just imagine someone with the guts to produce a serious film, with a real budget, with a theme such as this: the concept of the Tree of Life, synonymous with the fabled Fountain of Youth which gives eternal life, is an ever present reality. And this is the primary revelation waiting on every human being. Pretty ambitious and bold,....... no?

Has a lot of very dark scenes (and when I say dark, I mean so dimly lit that persons with any degree of loss of eyesight would have trouble watching).

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1F92EK0MUNOVR	Pecos Bill	"This movie is an example of ""art over entertainment"".  It's beautiful.  Great acting.  Great effects.  Lousy script, though.When you start watching the movie, you may find yourself confused, wondering what's going on.  This is normal.  Many people may walk out at this point, and that's also normal.About mid-way through, you'll have enough clues to realize what's going on.  It all comes together and makes sense.The rest of the movie will be boring, because the ""future"" scene already reveals the final outcome, so there is no more suspense about anyone's fate.  You know what will happen because you've seen the results.There is one mild twist that mostly makes no sense, and adds confusion back to the movie.All in all, I came away from this movie feeling like I'd wasted a lot of time.  It's one of the least emotion-provoking movies I've seen.  There's no real chance to identify or sympathize with any of the characters and it's hard to feel emotionally invested in the outcome when the movie starts off by showing you the outcome.It's a beautiful movie.

As is the case with all poetry, if you try to read it as you would a short story or novel, you will be disappointed.  If you can embrace it as a cinematic poem, there's a good chance you will enjoy it.  If not, not.I gave it three stars based on how enjoyable the experience of watching it was for me personally, not based on the quality of the film.  It is masterfully made and often visually stunning.  But you gotta love cinematic poetry to love this film, and I, alas, do not.

Give the film an honest try and I think you will join the fan base the film has already created. Its got a lot going on emotionally while it also challenges you to follow the different spans of time and their connection.  There are NUMEROUS ways to take the ending.  I wont go into spoilers but suffice to say if you watch it with a group of people you will more than likely have a fun conversation as to how each person ""saw"" the ending.  The film also deviates from the graphic novel in certain details, some large, which made if fun for me personally because it really gave the film a separate experience from the book.  I feel the film will really find its audience on DVD (as many great films that fail at the b.o do--i am speaking to you GRINDHOUSE)  Its a fantastic experience and it shows off Jackman and Weisz at their best."	5.0	Beautiful Film, Wonderfully Acted, One of my favs of last year	2007-04-13	7	6	1

It is one story but the emotions are so complex and intense and so many, That it needed three different canvases to convey and create the most profound impact.It is a story of Tom taking the journey with his wife towards her death and his struggle to stop her from that fate.Izzy once tells tom about the myth in Mayan history: When people die their souls travel to that distant nebula in the sky.That's why there is one Tom reaching out to the Nebula struggling to get the secret out of the tree and trying to stop her from reaching it.Ultimately when Izzy succumbs to death, the bubble reaches the nebula too.In the real life tom is looking for a medical cure and the story shown in past highlights his struggle in the real life.Its all struggle and the Man's ability to do and expect unthinkable. Many questions arise.Where does Izzy go after all? She says to Tom once, ""I'm not afraid anymore"". she is cheerful, she wants to enjoy the first snow.Is it possible to achieve what Izzy did? Is it possible to let go the ones you hold so near to you? How does it feel? How does it feel to be Tom?Unbelievable, The movie may not have all the answers you are looking for, but it will fuel those thoughts, It will show you the path.It is up to you, what you make out of it. What choice does a human have at end but to accept what is the part of his existence!The movie is a spiritual journey, It makes you aware, it teaches you to accept and it reminds you of His existence. It teaches you to cherish while we have a chance.Many would question, whether it is ok to give up? I don't have the answer neither did I get it from the movie.For technical part of the movie , there is no review required, the movie speaks for itself.

Everyone in this cast delivers their best work and the design of the production and beauty of the cinemtography are gorgeous, As with most great films, at least in my subjective view, screenplay and actors are the rulers, with the director playing a crucial role as well.In my other reviews of films here on Amazon I always say that upgrading DVD video to BluRay delivers questionable (at least subjective) results. The soundtrack is where the benefits lie for me. Still, with this film I do feel that the BluRay DOES better render clarity and contrast and color. You decide.

The film maker makes an ambitious attempt to weave together a love story and quest across time and cultures. He reached for the stars, literally and succeeds on an emotional level but utterly fails in any coherent sense.  The end result is intriguing but it's just a tease that does not fulfill or lead to any insight.  Comparisons to 2001 are superficial at best based on psychedelic visuals, but 2001 had an actual vision and message.  The film is not a waste of time because the contemporary and Spanish story lines are interesting and well acted but the metaphysics fails to elucidate and appeals primarily to unquestioning new age addled minds.	3.0	Reached for the stars but hit London	2014-01-06	0	0	0

The plot meanders all over the place and is best described as a series of fragmentary thoughts strung together by lots of fancy camera work.  It's fairly incoherent and makes little sense overall, presumably ""leaving it up to the viewer to find meaning"", but in reality it doesn't provide a sufficient or compelling enough framework to do so and instead just comes across as lazy.Despite this, it still manages to be wholly predictable at some of the more critical points of the film, which ultimately only adds to the confusion when you're trying to make sense of it all.  Why pretend at some deep level of sophistication and meaning only to fall back on some of the oldest ""twists"" in the book when it all comes together?  In short, it feels like the film massively overreached itself in both concept and execution and simply ended up being a pretentious art film gone horribly wrong.There are no surprises here other than, ""How did they get Hugh Jackman to do this?"".

To ensure he reaches her goal for him, she gives him the manuscript and a task, a task he is reminded about constantly throughout the film.  Her perspective was the past.  His perspective is the future and a completely different cultural, religious frame of reference.  Does he complete the task?  Watch the movie and the answer is obvious.The magic in the movie is the way the story of her book and his attempt to complete the task is interwoven into the reality of their life.  It's not so mysterious; it is beautifully expressed and it will touch all those who know the power of two loves evolving over time into an inseparable oneness.	5.0	It's not so complicated	2007-09-03	5	4	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AFJFXN42RZ3G2	"R. DelParto ""Rose2"""	Darren Aronofsky has been known to challenge the senses when producing a film.  One may say, The Fountain may fall in that category because it contains the traits in most Aronofsky films, Pi, Requiem For a Dream, and Black Swan.  But one thing that is evident in his films, how he associates man and nature and tests the limits of each through various methods that surpasses filmmaking and delves into the deeper realms of critical and analytical thinking, history, metaphysics, philosophy and religion, and science and technology; this list may be much longer depending on the viewers' interests and perceptions may differ.  However, what makes the film of great interest are not only the main actors Hugh Jackman who plays a doctor-scientist-researcher Tommy Creo and Rachel Weisz his wife Izzi Creo a writer who is dying of cancer, but how Aronofsky interweaves all of the elements mentioned above and produces a film of diverse cinematography.The film contains extremely creative content that appears immediately during the beginning of the film that shows a series of fragments and abstracts that the average viewer will see and want to understand.  But once one observes the parallels and the correlations of what is occurring within the framework of the film and the storyline, greater meaning may come about.  Indeed, the characters are the center of attention of the film, Tommy a scientist and doctor that wants only the best for his wife Izzi as she is experiencing the challenges of her illness and the imminent - Tommy is working day and night to come up with a cure through lab experiments on a Rhesus monkey.  But the story subtly suggests that Tommy is having difficulties accepting Izzi's condition and continues to work effortlessly while Izzi appears relaxed without a care in the world.  In between these scenes include a slew of symbolic imagery, Tommy opens a manuscript of a book that Izzi is writing that is called The Fountain, which involves a Spanish Conquistador and the mysterious and cryptic elements of the nebula star and a Mayan inscription, and another scene appears futuristic and involves the tree of life.  Although these scenes may not fit together, one way to look at each one, the bigger picture - nature sets its course and is in full control.The Fountain is a much recommendable for viewers looking for a thought provoking and definitely tests one's perceptions type of film.  And most importantly, after viewing the film, it leaves one with an after thought of the never-ending curiosity and questions that revolve around man versus nature.	4.0	Cliche or not a thought provoking film	2014-01-01	0	0	0
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3ALCP02N5EF41	Reader	Seeing this movie resonates with many of us on a personal level ( judging from many of  the readers reviews here).  Not only did it deal with familiar themes but Darren Aronofsky also gave us a cinematic experience that merits viewing several times. It is a beautiful movie - and when it ended, it felt almost like a benediction to me, with its transcendent quality. It is thought-provoking and open to different interpretations... and completely captures one's imagination. Yet, on a more basic level, it is a highly-emotional love story which compels us to re-examine how we deal with its gut-wrenching theme of loss. Perhaps it is the teasing ambiguity of the story and how we interpret it that is really Darren's gift to us all?It is a pity that Hugh Jackman's work in this movie has not been recognized on the awards level, but it is heartening to see that, finally, Hugh Jackman is being appreciated by movie fans as an excellent dramatic actor!	5.0	Stirs the imagination and touches the heart!	2007-01-28	8	7	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2L7WYA5OENV03	Reticuli	"The FountainI'm reminded of what I believe was a Charlie Rose, or maybe it was a magazine article, where either a doctor or a futurist made a reference to western culture's fixation on curing death, as if it were a curable disease like any other and not an inevitability.  That this potentially poisons ourselves and through extreme fear & grief impedes our ability to be in-the-now is something eastern cultures seem to have come to grips with long ago.  I found the subject matter heartfelt and do not have a problem saying ""This film moved me.""  Because it did.Thank goodness The Orleans Casino had a gal who knew what she was doing with the projector.  There was some problem with the shutter not opening all the way at the beginning of the film, but eventually we got it worked out and the bottom half of the print became fully lit in all its glory.  Those efforts were well rewarded.  I found The Fountain visually stunning and did not at any time find it to be silly, though it has quite a few moments of abstract and open-endedness to it.  For instance, why is the nebula bringing life back to this tree?  Maybe I missed a part during the efforts to fix the shutter, but it seemed as if we are simply left to assume the power of the tree and the nebula are connected.  The tree's life-giving abilities have been nearly used-up by this doctor who obviously has taken advantage of them and stayed alive far, far into the future.  So far, in fact, that his space ship appears to us as simply an elastic, transparent bubble that is capable of making new bubbles (space ships) around him at will.  We have no idea how it works, but it clearly does...at least to those viewers who allow the film to be what it is and make an initial and respectful suspension of disbelief to allow its own rules to be established and worked within.  I think a caveman would say the same for my computer screen.  So we are cavemen to this futureman.  The technology is so advanced as to be, not to be redundant, literally and figuratively totally simple, elastic, and transparent to its end-user.  Neat concept.  Can any of you think of a better way to illustrate the ultimate technology of the far future?  I can't.Interestingly, because this new tree was planted on her grave, she is somehow now a part of it.  This is a call-back from an earlier set-up accomplished by a story she previously told.  Through eastern meditation and consuming of the bark, he appears to be reliving the elements of his past, reminiscent of Wim Wender's meandering and overly-long Until The End of The World.  As in that film, this virtual living in the past is a kind of egotistical black hole of stagnation.  Here I think it works better, since we as the audience are brought along on the narrative by his re-experiencing of the events from the very beginning, rather than it being a secondary structure at the end.  Quite a number of people seem to think the conquistador thread was an actual historical past for the film characters, but forget that it is Izzi's book as ""visualized"" by Tommy as he reads (or read), and who injects he and his wife into the central characters.  This historical allegory of unfinished novel, the past when he was a doctor, and the present-future are all three intertwined.  The futuristic returning to the Garden of Eden to partake of the Tree of Life creates a new Adam and Eve, I think, both immortal in different ways.  By doing so he has lost his perspective, though.I found the duality curious that eastern meditation was both the key to exploiting this endless reliving in the first place with the Izzi-tree and the means to bring himself to end it, by finally visualizing a suitable ending to his wife's book.  In order to re-attain wisdom and appreciate once more the true reality and, indeed the past-nature of, that beautiful relationship once more outside of this clouded, emotionally-distorted & fixational abyss of immortality, there is only one thing the doctor can do: partake of the Tree of Wisdom, which is death.  In this way, just as the novel took on characteristics of their lives, life also takes on characteristics of a story, which is one way to find solace in mortality if that is something you are willing to accept, where life has a beginning, middle, and an end, yet is perfect in its own completeness.Viewing The Fountain is not a passive experience, intellectually or emotionally, and you no doubt will bring a great deal of baggage on its subjects of love, death, immortality, consciousness, and eastern thought.  I suspect the strongest feelings will oddly enough be on that last item, even though it is only a tool and framework to explore the rest.  I can see quite a few people being turned-off seeing a bald Hugh Jackman floating in the lotus position to his literal and figurative finale.  Is it silly?  I don't think so.  Gene Siskel once leaned over to Roger Ebert during their first screening of Fargo and whispered, ""This is the reason I go to the movies.""

I found the film lacking.  I found myself depressed about the death and dying and struggle.  I kept waiting for the message of hope.  And it did not come in a way that made me feel good about all the bad in the film.  The acting is ok but the characters were lacking.  I never found myself rooting for anyone.  The book must have been one of those deep, contemplative novels.  But it didn't translate well on screen.For my Christian family: Don't waste your money.

Certainly, it's gorgeous to look at, and the past and present episodes were quite good, but the future segment totally escaped me. Clint Mansell's score won awards, but I thought the new-age sound was quite unexceptional and repetitive. The cast was fine, especially Rachel Weisz, and the brief but effective appearance of Ellen Burstyn. Hugh Jackman handled his very complicated roles admirably. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. The DVD extras provide some insight that the production was plagued by shut-downs and delays. With budget cuts and other hang-ups, I'm sure the result isn't the film that Mr. Aronofsky set out to make.	3.0	What'd I miss...?	2007-08-28	1	0	1

Hawk ""Jubal_Early"""	I saw this on DVD for the first time last night.There are so many reviews here that I won't bother repeating the same old viewpoints for or against it.One thing I wanted to mention that really bothered me about the DVD extras:They go into great length about the production process, but there is not one second of in depth commentary by the people who created this film on the meaning of the film from their point of view, their view of life and death, of the future, the past, how this all comes together in the film. Writers are deep thinkers. The core actors here put their heart and soul into this. So they have no opinions? Nothing to say?This is an endemic problem with American cinema. These teams can make a profound movie, and yet totally lack the depth or awareness to actually talk about the issues it brings up.Who cares how they created the light at the end of the corrider in the hospital? Really? Do we need to hear this explained? How different colors of light were used etc etc ad nauseum?Who gives a flying !@$#% about that? Who cares about the sets they built in Australia, then dismantled and sold off...? All of this technical garbage on the DVD extras is a waste of time and has nothing to do with how people are affected by this film. Yet you sit through all of this (sum total as long as the film itself) waiting for something interesting from the crew and cast and writers about how the story itself had meaning for them...and nothing...I liked the film. I &#34;got it&#34; and I thought it all tied together well. And so, you'd expect at least a few minutes of commentary on the DVD extras by the actors, the writers, the director, about what this all meant for them personally. Yes we hear them talk about how production was shut down after two years and then restarted independently. Still, this is pointless to the effect the film has on its viewers.Classic example of shallowness on the part of the Hollywood industry. They can feed us all sorts of profound visionary cinema, but they totally lack the depth to contemplate its meaning themselves or the character to discuss what they just produced...The idea of the world tree/the tree of life, is as old as civilization itself. To utilize such a concept in a film, then have nothing to say about it is a cop out.

Hugh Jackman does an outstanding job of carrying this movie which is a stew or flashbacks, story within story and a man's journeyfrom sadness to something else. Joy or acceptance.  I have watched this movie 3 times and each time I hate it and love it.  Each time I come to the conclusion that I have seen outstanding acting in what truly is a fantasy or a trip into a form of insanity.  You be the judge.  You have to really pay attention in this movie.  At time it seems to drag along, then it become interesting and moves at a good pace.  A large section of this movie is parallel in style to 2001 A Space Odyssey.  The pace is slow and very much internal.Bottom Line:  I liked this movie a lot.

Huffman	"As a graduate from a prominent art school, I always appreciate artistic films, but there is a lot of ""reaching"" and desiring to be artistic here.Visually the film has moments that are groundbreaking.However, focusing too much upon visuals, the film loses sight of the greater purpose and reason for making a motion picture in the first place.As is the case with so many artist who reach for something deep (and because they really aren't artistic at all but would like to be) they try and force work like this upon a public who really isn't interested in art or the ultimately psychotically bizarre imagery and concepts that are in the writer/director's head.There is a real attempt to bring together various ideas, myths and cultures into one ""meaning-of-life"" journey that gets lost 10-15 minutes into the film. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS FILM FOR GOOD REASON.Aronofsky could of cut out the future/bubble scenes, which would of improved this film, because it did nothing to validate or advance the story (or ideals of it).Having little or no story line eliminates the audiences desire to stay connected to the film. After all, motion pictures are supposed to entertain through stories with laughter, sadness or ""all-of-the-above"" within that STORY.I attempted to understand the film by watching the ""special features"" and ""making-of"", but was further frustrated by a undulating series of mundane and uninteresting scenes.Lastly; This film severely lacks a story, concept or connection to the audience and I cannot understand why the studios have supported it (because it didn't make any money either)."	1.0	The Fountain, into a whole new genre of it's own.	2008-01-28	21	10	11

You agree, and he takes you on a magical ride with some of the most stunning visuals you've ever seen (not to mention an eerily-orchestrated but nonetheless appealing soundtrack).  But about half way to your destination, Mr. Hanks turns to you and asks if you believe in Santa Claus.What's your response?This movie is so ambitiously unconventional that it forces the watcher to make such a choice.  At about the half way point of the movie, I had to make the decision for myself: either accept the lofty and outlandish plot elements of The Fountain and proceed in jaw-dropping awe of the technical marvels, OR take frequent trips to the bathroom/concessions and demand a refund at the end.  I chose the first option.Although the special effects and soundtrack are dazzling, this is not the type of movie where you can sit back and ""be entertained"".  For one, the multiple storylines are spliced together in a manner that requires viewers to be actively engaged just to follow the basic plot (think Memento).  And although Aronofsky effectively ties these three stories together by the end, he allows much room for interpretation as to some of the larger thematic elements.  So if you enjoyed the ending of The Blair Witch Project, for example (where you know that something bad has happened to the campers, but it's really for you to decide exactly how it happened), then you'll probably enjoy this one as well.  But the themes The Fountain tackles are so large- the meaning of life and death and even love- and the story gets so downright weird at points, that you must make a conscious decision to ""go with it"" if you are to derive any value at all.When I saw this in the theater, I hadn't read any reviews or heard any of the buzz.  I didn't even know who directed it (I later discovered Aronofsky also directed Requiem for a Dream and Pi, both of which I had seen).  But this movie taught me that keeping an open mind can pay off large dividends, as my fascination/obsession with this movie has grown over time to where it is now among my favorites.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you approach it the same way, because you really will love this movie if you can just let yourself embrace its uniqueness and oddity. Think of this movie as a hypnotist; if you can shed your inhibitions and do not resist what it offers, you will be hypnotized.  On the other hand, if you are too critical and never allow yourself to get comfortable, you will probably equally loathe this movie.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1FQD19BXJ6CD9	"Robert C. Riggs ""Rob Riggs"""	What interests me most about this film is the idea that, through death and rebirth, two souls may still be bound to each other. In each life, Hugh Jackman is trying to save his lover, Rachel Weisz. In the first life, Jackman discovers the tree of life and becomes a part of it. In the present life, he uses the tree's medicinal values to discover an anti-aging complex. And in the future, he is an ascetic, a man devoted to meditation, and his wife a tree. This evolution has both Biblical and Eastern religious themes, and all becomes one at the end. What is interesting to note is that the dying star they are moving toward has a nebulous wrapped around it... a shining metaphor for Jackman wrapped around his dying wife, doing all he can to save her.The cinematography in this film is beautiful, the movie itself is a poem. Coupled with Clint Mansell's music, there are part of this film that move me to moments of pure inspiration, specifically as they move toward the star at the end and Jackman has a moment of enlightenment before the star explodes and new life forms. We witness the constant transference of energy from one form to the next, and Jackman in the end becomes acutely aware of it.Maybe I am reading too much into the film, maybe not enough. In our current state of Hollywood franchises, where every movie is made with its sequel, and commercial products in mind, The Fountain is a rare work. One that is not meant to merely entertain, but to think about the larger scale of where we are, where we have been, and where we are ultimately going.There are some obvious contradictions between the movie's quotations from the Bible and ultimately its Buddhist concept of death and rebirth. But it only references origins in the Bible, not destinations. Maybe at some point, in our human translations, our translators have taken different roads. But I like the idea of all things are one, beginning from and returning to the same place.I give it 4 stars because there are a few lines from Jackman that seem both unconvincing and absurd. One is here he says something about finding life, when he is going toward the tree of life as a conquistador. Other times, when he talks about his need to save his wife, he just doesn't seem to believe it wholeheartedly.	4.0	A look at two souls bound to one another, lifetime after lifetime.....	2007-05-29	4	3	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3VO05LD5WSO9F	Robert Hayes	THE FOUNTAIN, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, is an epic tale told in three separate timelines and is about love, life, death and rebirth. To talk too much about the specifics would be kind of hard, but also spoil the viewing experience. The &#34;story&#34; is really just a way for Aronofsky to explore some rather heady philosophical themes. And while the narrative might be lacking, he has created a feast for the eyes and some things to think about. Overall, this is an incredible film that demands multiple viewings.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is one of those complex films that, if you want to, is very fun to see over and over and contemplate its meaning.  In this respect, it is very much akin to 2001, though focuses on the love that a couple shares across time and space.  The first time frame is colonial Spain, right smack in the worst excesses of the Reformation.  A brave aristocrat (Jackman) is sent on a mission by the beleaguered queen (Weisz), on a mission to find the tree of life that has been hidden by Mayan priests; this tree is said to offer eternal life in the mythologies of both peoples, but in different ways.  The second time is the present, when a research doctor is searching for a cure for the cancer that is killing his wife, a writer whose story covers that of the Spanish and the next one, the quest of a man flying to a dying star, in accordance with Mayan prophesy; he is transporting the tree, which is failing, and lives with the memory of his wife who is long since dead.From the film, it is impossible to tell what is real, what is imagined, and what it means.  The tree appears in all 3 sequences, as do the characters, who may or may not be the same individuals.  The themes - of love, loss, and hope - are present in all times, where the link of new life to death is apparent and mysterious.  During the entire film, I was able to forget my real life and wonder at the questions and ideas that the film offered, which is an extremely rare experience for me and marks the film as a great success.  The grief and struggle are very moving, the images of merging into light, of killing, of rebirth, are spectacular.According to the extras, this was toned down from the original, which was supposed to have Brad Pitt (one of the most over-rated actors, IMHO) rather than Jackman; Weisz replaced Cate Blanchett.  This version is completely successful, with a consistent mood, quality images, and excellent acting.Recommended for those who enjoy thinking about scifi, who delight at letting characters and concepts gain a place in their imagination.	4.0	solid scifi that mixes grief and spirituality	2011-03-23	3	1	2

And no it's not because this wasn't a two hour packed action film- that has nothing to do with it.It for the most part at least for me had to do with Jackman and Weisz's relationship together in the film- their relationship was so bland because I definitely didn't feel any chemistry between them at all which can badly hurt any movie. Not to mention Weisz's character, although supposed to be so inspitational, I instead found very annoying. The rest of the cast refused to make any memorable impression on me as well.The story itself though fell flat long before it ended. Instead of building up to some amazing conclusion it instead left me amused and definitely not impressed.I give it one other star because of its very beautiful scenes and again it's good intentions. That's about all I can say positive of this film. And while a bunch of people will highly recommend it- I will not.2/5	2.0	A Well- Intentioned Film That Falls Flat	2007-05-21	17	6	11
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3R3Q8CMRINCVT	Rodrig T.W.	I thought the movie was visually and thematically interesting, but I really didn't enjoy the method of story telling Aronofsky used, or the heavy handedness he employed in trying to get us to understand his point.I left feeling as though the separate time lines had been shuffled so as to deliberately obfuscate the themes.  Opening with the Conquistador thread, for example, killed my suspension of disbelief with all of its glaring historical flaws until it was later framed as fictional.  Something was always being hidden from the viewers, but these secrets never carried much 'pow' upon revelation.  It's as though Aronofsky believes that by presenting a good theme in a confusing manner it somehow becomes better.I'm a fan of obfuscation when it makes a better movie, such as Memento, but this one just didn't do it for me.  If you liked the presentation that's fine, but people who didn't aren't necessarily idiots.	2.0	Deliberately Heavy Handed and Obtuse	2007-01-12	31	11	20

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2UR0J92JAR2TW	"Roman Martel ""R. Martel"""	"I love what director Darren Aronofsky attempted here.  Its not every movie that attempts to explore death, obsession, spirituality, rebirth, sickness, and devotion.  I get the feeling that this movie will work wonderfully for some people and less so for others.  But I think it's impossible to tell you which one you might be.  See the movie for yourself and make your own decision.I think the visuals are the most interesting and impressive element of the film.  Aronofsky is working with three separate worlds (or realities or time periods).  Each has a unique look and yet each one has elements tying it to the other.  There is an over riding color scheme of yellow and black that gives the film a unique look (I just watched another movie that used a similar visual palate; the 2001 Japanese/Polish film ""Avalon"".  Also worth seeing).  In addition to the visuals, the sound and music work very well with the movie, blending it together and providing an overall mood to the film.Acting is solid throughout.  Hugh Jackman does a great job in all three roles (or is it two, or is it one?).  His passion, love and obsession are very clear and potent, making his character the most realized of the group.  Rachel Weisz does the best she can with an underwritten role.  She's brave, full of life and hope.  We see elements of why Tommy loves her, but something is missing in her character (something that I feel was missing in the script, not the performance).  The supporting cast is excellent and up to task.I've only seen one other film by Aronofsky, ""Pi"".  I really enjoyed that movie and it's daring.  I can see elements of that film here.  In the end I feel that some of the weaker characterization of the two leads ends up weakening the overall impact of the film.  Instead of feeling an emotional thrill at the climax, I felt satisfied, but not awed.  I think that Aronofsky was hoping for more than just satisfaction with this film.I know some viewers found the film to be confusing or obtuse.  I didn't.  The movie makes perfect sense, but you do have to pay attention.  The three worlds presented are linked (not just visually and thematically but in the plot as well).  Some of the film seems a bit heavy handed to me.  And I feel that Aronofsky didn't need to present such clear answers in the film.  When covering ideas like death, rebirth, spirituality and science there might not be any clear answers.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different and visually interesting.  Some viewers are going to really connect with it and others are going to just blink and say ""That was pretty and all, but what was it all about?""  I enjoyed it, but I wished I could have loved it as much as Aronofsky seems to.  You can feel that this was a labor of love."	4.0	Obsession, eternal life, and a trip to end... or the beginning.	2007-06-05	3	2	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AJ9H5HCGD25SI	Romeo Charlie	My English teacher once told me that the best writings show rather than tell the reader what's happening.  That's the aim of this movie, not to tell you how to view love and death but to present a story and have you interpret it.  If you want a movie that gives you a meaning, look elsewhere.  If you want to find your own meaning, this is a great movie.  This film is a work of art, not necessarily meant to be completely coherent on its own.  Instead, it's a dialogue between viewer and movie, and so we fill in the gaps with our own interpretations and ideas.  It's the literature of movies, and should be treated as such.  That same English teacher also said that if the books we read were boring, we weren't getting them yet.  The joy I get from this movie comes from changing the collection of images into a greater meaning, which I recognized existed almost immediately, like a bell rung somewhere within.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ABEJUJRMV0DAP	R. Paschal	I found The Fountain to be a terrific movie that incorporates significant elements of Maya Cosmology and blends them into three worlds: what appears to be a fictional story set during the Conquest, our present time and a spiritual world that appears to exist concurrently with the other two worlds. This is not New Age content nor is it a 2001 science fiction proposed future world. Maya cosmology from its Classic Era (pre-Conquest)is seamlessly woven into all three worlds. I was amazed to see a movie that was visually appealing, engrossing and was written with content rich, well researched subtle points far exceeding the usual dribble that is passed off when venturing into the themes of this movie. You don't need a degree in comparative religions or cultural anthropology to appreciate this movie. It has a broad appeal on a number of levels.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	"[Noticing the substantive, thoughtful, even passionate responses that this film has elicited from many reviewers, I retract any elements of my own review that may sound dismissive, patronizing, presumptuous.  Obviously, numerous viewers find the film provocative, innovative, mysterious, profound and deeply moving in terms substance and form, meaning and creative use of the medium.  Any film these days that's able at once to challenge, enthrall, and motivate viewers to become alert and ""active"" spectators deserves no small amount of commendation--and most likely another look (at the very least) from this reviewer.  I would take issue with the notion that the film is sentimental or pretentious--or that either of those words is necessarily pejorative (Griffith was certainly pretentious but no less of a giant; ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is as sentimental as it is dark, but not even the anti-sentimental '60s and '70s could suppress Capra's neglected but vibrantly alive American ""basic text"" for long.  Still, as informative and healthy as informed discussion can be, we will never (thank god) escape the fact that many of the medium's greatest accomplishments will not get their just due, and that one viewer's ""Citizen Kane"" will be another's ""Star Wars: The Latest Sequel.""]D.W. Griffith needed six hours (""Intolerance,"" original release) to tell four simultaneous, closely interlocked stories separated in time by 2500 years.  The result was one of film's noblest failures.  Chris Marker, on the other hand, required less than 30 minutes (""La Jetee"")  to tell an unforgettable story about humankind's fear of death, desire for love, and the ensuing but inescapable struggle with the past, the present, and the future to conquer death and aloneness.At about 90 minutes, ""The Fountain"" succeeds in fascinating us with its surrealist, psychedelic imagery, and if it fails to convince some that it has something significant to say or its meaning as clear as some would like, it's not for lack of trying.  In fact, everything about this film all but shrieks at the viewer ""important allegory,"" ""vital parable,"" ""deep, profound, thought-provoking cinema.""  Doesn't matter if it's a flower bud, a finger, a ring (the latter are certainly overworked symbols, especially after Dante and Wagner rung from rings just about all the meaning they're capable of yielding, though admittedly that didn't discourage Joseph Campbell, whose monomythic circle representing the hero's journey has become the frequent formula of no small number of the screenplays we see these days)--it's all deeply, profoundly, evocatively significant.  And lest we have the least doubt, the score bleats at us non-stop with throbbing strings italicized by spiritual soprano choirs--somber minor key modalities and thick textures relieved occasionally by new-age piano light rays. In fact, it's the kind of score that, unlike the reactionary constructions of a John Williams', takes us further away from the exemplary work of a Bernard Herrmann or Hugo Friedhofer.Of the three stories, only the one in the present--of the doctor desperately seeking a cure for his beloved's illness (cancer, but in the terms of the story, death is the ""illness"")--has any humanity, any semblance of ""life"" (though even here, the acting seems at times a bit stiff and ""operatic,"" a hostage to the symbolism of the story, orchestrated by the camera and effects.)  The other two stories are narrative ""frames,"" occasionally shedding some illumination on what is one of the darkest films (literally) I've ever seen (including hundreds of film noir examples along with most of Bergman).  Despite the inevitable pretense of the genre, there are the best of intentions, one suspects, behind the film, and young viewers who are taken in by it sufficiently to watch it again and work out its symbolism are undeniably apt to be rewarded, especially compared to the viewers of a ""Titanic,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" or any number of more childish (not merely sophomoric) ""fantasy genre"" movies (again, not a negative so much as a mere observation--certainly the inclusion of Clarence is sufficient to qualify Capra's seasonal classic as ""fantasy"" genre).Moreover, visual-architectural enthusiasts will have much to admire in the match cutting (from faces to symmetrical and luminescent correlatives, both man-made and natural, and the camera angles (those overhead aerial shots!), which often play more like music than the music does.  But were I a fan of a more hard-core, cleverly-engineered and artfully designed fantasy (I won't belabor a definition here--though Dante's Comedia and Wagner's Ring, despite sharing similarities with the genre, are as much its antithesis as is, say, ""Tokyo Story.""), I'd be more inclined to study the script and mis en scene (which even a movie like ""Donnie Darko"" can repay with insights not sighted after a mere two screenings).  Time is precious, and I'm grateful the filmmakers of ""The Fountain"" elected not to overextend their welcome.  Nonetheless, two hours of ""There Will Be Blood"" strikes me as a movie more worthy of close study than ""The Fountain"" if only because, as Dr. Johnson required of dramatic art and found so readily present in Shakespeare's, it ""holds the mirror up to nature"" (film's verisimilitudinous strong suit) so that we can see it, as if for the first time.A quick interpretation, maybe more Mishima than Buddhist: You can't ""have"" the Tree of Life because you ARE the tree.  To have it, to obtain it, to acquire or possess it, is to ""objectify"" it--in other words, to rob it of life.  Only the subject is alive: the object necessarily dead.  Once we recognize our relationship to the tree of life, we are eternally alive, immune from mundane materialistic understandings of death. There is no taking away from us what we never actually  ""had"" because the tree is what we ""are.""  Coming into ""possession"" of this understanding, or state of blessed ""nothingness,"" requires undergoing the quest of the conquistador, doctor, scientist, lover in the movie."	3.0	Cryogenic symmetry	2009-08-09	7	2	5

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1HK7CKE21UB87	Sarah Stegall	Some physicists tell us that there is no such thing as time, that it is an illusion produced by our brains. Rather, they say, everything happens at once, and we only perceive it sequentially. Time is merely an artifact of existence and experience. Perhaps this is part of the concept that powered writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, Pi) latest effort, The Fountain. Like origami, this film folds in on itself, with three stories spanning a thousand years overlapping like a Moebius strip, interleaving plane to plane until the film unfurls into one loosely unified fable of love, loss, tragedy and spirituality. The Fountain is no movie for skeptics or cynics; they will probably be impatient with its experimental narrative structure and repeating imagery. The multilayered plot is built on a simple notion: a pair of lovers follow one another through various incarnations ranging from medieval Spain to some far future, soulmates determined to surpass death, cycling in and out of bodies but always together. The idea is that when God cast mankind out of the Garden of Eden for tasting the Tree of Knowledge, He hid its twin, the Tree of Life, in the New World. When discovered by Franciscans working for Queen Isabella of Spain (Rachel Weisz of The Constant Gardener), she sends her trusted Conquistador Tomas (Hugh Jackman, The Prestige) to secure it, promising to be his Eve if he is successful. It takes him over a thousand years to find the true meaning of the Tree, during which he and Isabella/Izzi cycle in and out of conjoined incarnations, linked by love, a ring, and a dream of immortality.Several ideas not in current intellectual fashion feed the dark energy of this movie: eternal love, spiritual transformation, the idea of soulmates. Romantic conceits such as this in the Age of Irony are usually confined to art house movies; indeed, The Fountain resembles nothing so much as an art house film that has fallen into money. And oh, what they've done with that money --- layer on layer of gorgeous images. Honey colored star fields, bleak snow-filled valleys echoing despair, a tree that truly looks like a Tree of Life, the filth of the Spanish Inquisition and the claustrophobic humidity of Mayan jungles. Symbols permeate this film: a ring is given in 15th century Spain, lost in a 21st century surgical prep room. Hugh Jackman drives a car through a sporadically lit tunnel towards a city of light and hope, then rides a horse down a torch-lit road towards a city of flame and tyranny. Life literally bursts forth in Tomas, ink becomes blood and dead lovers become trees. Not since Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come have I seen such imagery infuse a movie.The ubiquitous Hugh Jackman uncorks a sobbing, glowing, tragic, erotically charged performance perhaps matched only by his charismatic turn in The Prestige. Alas, this performance threatens to overwhelm his scenes with Rachel Weisz, whose attempts at subtlety sometimes merely flatten her portrayal of the doomed Izzi. To be fair, however, her role is basically to act as numinous avatar, not as a real human being. Her role ranges from regal Queen to plucky gamine, but she is never given the incandescent scenes Jackman sears through. Their chemistry is just barely enough to convince. Still, Jackman's performance was powerful enough to persuade me that his shaven-headed Zen monk was in love with a tree, without making me break into giggles. Supporting actress Ellen Burstyn (Wicker Man) turns in a subdued portrayal of a harassed but sympathetic lab director. Clint Mansell's ethereal and evocative score provides an emotional carrier wave for the film so powerful it deserves Supporting Actor billing.Six years in the making, this film still needs more editing to lift it out of several shallow plot holes; brain tumors, calligraphy, monkey research, biopharmaceutical research, nebulae and eternal life intertwine in a sometimes chaotic mix. Despair and hope suffuse this movie like brandy soaks a rich cake, and like that cake, a little ambiguity may go a long way with those viewers looking for a more conventional narrative. One is left with some questions: for example, why is a movie about the quest for the Tree of Life called The Fountain? Why, in a movie about a love that transcends time, does Queen Isabella keep reappearing to insist that it's all about saving Spain from the Inquisition? Another rewrite was probably in order here, but I have to admire Aronofsky's courage in giving us so many angles on the same story. When so many movies are composed by connecting the dots, it is refreshing to see even a flawed attempt to rearrange the dots into something novel and visionary. If you read books as much for the joy of beautifully cascading prose as for the story, if you enjoy the intertwining streams of improvisational jazz, if you like your science fiction more Stanley Kubrick than George Lucas, you may appreciate The Fountain, a poem brought to the screen which, if sometimes more beautiful than profound, never fails to enchant. The Fountain is destined to be a cult movie, admired as much for its ambitious flaws as its resonant triumphs.	5.0	One of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched	2007-01-30	0	0	0

The movie is a collage of scenes of an artsy film. There are a lot of repeated scenes apparently in an attempt to keep the audience on track of the story and in which direction the flick is moving. Needless to say, that the trailer seemed to promise something different and therefore my expectations weren't met at all.The acting was very good and that's why I give this film 3 stars, because otherwise it would be less than that. I don't think Aronofsky as a director did a very good job of telling the story - it's a lot of going back and forth with some boring scenes, ... confusing with New Age junk mixed into it. In a sense it's like an unfinished cinematic painting, and the soundtrack is kind of annoying after a while. And whenever a scene reaches a climax and there's an expectation for a surprise, nothing happens and it's a letdown. To me it was like an experimental film or a project as the final exam of a student to graduate from film school. There are lots of closeups - too many if you ask me.If you do want to see this film in the theatre, you must hurry, because I don't think this film will survive more than a week on the big screen - the theatre I went to was almost empty while the other flicks there were filled to capacity.	3.0	An unfinished Cinematic Painting	2006-11-23	6	0	6

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A13UAIE3K517CQ	sft	Although The Fountain is impressive visually, and inventive in scope, the film fails to produce a cohesive whole that really gels. Because of this the movie is something of a cold exercise in form, and as such fails to engage the viewer in the way intended by the makers. It also seems a little pretentious at times, particularly towards the end when Jackman experiences a Buddha-esque transcendence. This is an interesting and highly creative tour-de-force but not the moving love story it sets out to be. In fact, the most moving aspect of he film is the score, without which the movie would come close to an emotional vacuum.	3.0	A cool cascade	2009-10-26	1	0	1

I had read that Brad Pitt had been slated to star it this film, but that he had to bow out because of the long pre production, though im sure Pitt would have done and interesting turn in this role, I really can't imagine anybody but Jackman making this metaphysical script work:  thanks Brad for following Angella all over Africa and letting the role fall by default to the singular Jackman.

It's beautiful to watch, but these are the only attributes I'd allow for a movie so fiercely defended by some.  I love a movie that makes me think, makes me wonder, makes me feel sick or sad or happy or fearless...anything, this movie just didn't accomplish anything like that for me, though I could tell that's where Aronofsky was going.  This movie was so 'all over the place' and loose-ended that it's unwillingness to finish any thought completely detracted from what the story tried to tell.*Spoiler*I think the characters were formed pretty well, I wanted for him to save her life and was sad when he didn't.  I was sad when he ended up paying the price for drinking of the tree...so I did feel connected somewhat to the characters, but the story disconnection I felt present with each 'tale' was too prominent...it's sad, because this movie could have been so wonderful.  After watching the movie start to finish my first reaction was muted disappointment.  Much like opening a wrapped box expecting a gift, only to find it empty.  I wouldn't discourage anyone else from watching the movie, it is worth watching, but don't expect something amazing...it's much like 'the secret'...we already know the secret!Though I didn't expect another 'Requiem', I did expect to be socked in the stomach with emotion from Aronofsky and that didn't happen.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A32GVA2VANF89W	siempresuamor	"The best movie I have ever seen; however, clearly it will not be able to touch many hearts in this world. There are only a select few that when confronted with the option to live forever would choose to do so, and even fewer who will ever expierence a love so strong that even in death they choose to remain together eternally (even if only in their minds).I am one of the select few thousand on this earth that actually wants to live forever, for whatever reason, perhaps to keep the memory alive of a perfect love I once had, or maybe it is the hope that one day I can find that love again, either way this movie exactly reflects my feelings on the subject and had me in tears from the beginning to the end.The only flaw I could see in the story line was with wife, since my wife spared me the agony of her departure, after a long talk explained to me that she was bad for me, that I should not sacrifice my entire life however long or short it is only to stay with her until to that last breath, that the more time together we had, the harder it would be for me to let go, so she left and I do not want to know if she is still alive or dead, and that is what I feel should have happened to these 2 characters in real life, if the wife loved him at the very least she would create unsolvable problems between herself and her husband that could never be ignored, or even quite directly ask for a divorce and claim she no longer loves him so that he could move on with his life. The mere fact that this never happened in the story makes me wonder how strong the love really was between the couple, I assumed their love was as strong as mine, but without much conflict around the discussion of what he should do once she was gone, it leaves little depth development to the female character and left me wondering, ""Why does he love her so much? What did she do to earn his love? If you love something you set it free right?"" She put him through eternal torture by planting the seed in his head that even if she dies, they will still be together forever in life, that is pure evil the way I see it, so he could never move on, so it drove him to perform an insane task that could benefit practically no one but themselves.Anyway this movie explains why love makes you so happy sometimes that you can only cry...If you do not understand it then you have not loved and lost your 1 true enternal love yet...Is it better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all?

Now, I am a patient viewer, and for a long time I have had a commitment to finish watching a film once I start it, but even I can't stomach this tedious and sophomoric tale.  When it fell back onto the trite artifice of a flashback to &#34;the Grand Inquisitor&#34; of the Spanish Inquisition, I just couldn't stomach any more.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1VBYS3G8NQUY1	SKOLVK	"I first heard about ""The Fountain"" a few years back at San Diego Comic Con. Aronofsky seemed really hyped about it and showed us a few clips. After seeing them I was amazed but confused, and thats how I felt when I viewed the entire film years later, but after thinking about the film and discussing it with some friends I figured it out and I was blown away by its beautiful complexity. ""The Fountain"" follows three story lines. The first is about a scientist whose wife is dieing of brain steam cancer. He spends all of his time devoted to finding a cure but to no avail. The second follows his wife when she takes up a hobbie and writes a book about a conquistador who is sent on a quest to find the fountian of youth for his queen. Her book is played out in live action as she's writing it and provides a really cool tie in to the film. The third story is the strangest. It basiclly watches the scientist as he floats up through space in a big bubble(Stay with me here)while he meditates by a big tree. These three parts intertwine to make one of the most inovative and visually stunning films I've ever seen. It's hard to explain how beautiful the film is and it's honestly one of those ""You have to see it to believe it"" cases. Alot of people who say they didn't like ""The Fountian"" say it's because they didn't understand it. Just because YOU didn't understand dosen't make it bad.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2JF2YF3Y2FRCZ	spock2	I saw The Fountain last night by Darren Aronofsky. It is a very interesting film, dealing with the great themes (and dichotomies) of life & death, science & religion, temporality & eternity, and especially of love and how it intersects through all of these. On a more basic level, it is simply the story of a man coming to terms with his wife's illness and her eventual death. It is also a movie which pushes the narrative technique to its farthest boundaries. At first, the movie seems strange and bizarre, incomprehensible (at times), yet it is always visually hypnotic and stimulating. However, once you figure out that the three stories of past, present, and future actually all take place in the present -- that is, that they are all just different perspectives of one man (Jackman, as scientist), and that the story in indeed very linear -- the movie starts to come together and make sense. There are a lot of big ideas in this movie, but I believe two come through most clearly. They are: (i) the only thing that can last forever is memory which can be sustained by love; and (ii) the process of life is one in which death is required for new life to begin. I would agree with most critics that some of the dialogue is poorly written, especially between the two leads, and there are still some scenes which are vague at best in meaning; but the movie as a whole is undeniably rich, extremely ambitious, and most importantly, original.Highly Recommended!!!	5.0	Fantastic Movie	2006-11-29	5	4	1

It's a film authored from a transrational level and in a cultural climate of relativistic pluralism and shallow spirituality (actually spirituality is a disclosure of depth, and so, most religions [and spiritualities] fail to qualify as spiritual under this definition) any interpretation beyond the conventional (the extremely shallow)is deemed silly or worse just plain stupid or irrational. The narrative structure of The Fountain is transrational in the sense that it transcends the merely rational (that is, it has entered and included logic, but then transcended it to a nondual awareness) and so, of course the critics (and most moviegoers) didn't ""get it"". No harm no foul though, everyone operates at the level their at, but it's a shame that those who are in positions to criticize such films as The Fountain (or the last Matrix films for that matter)are not at a level to even comprehend, let alone dispense with an interpretation of it. Truly unfortunate for such artists as Darren Aronofsky. But only history can  prove such artists as ""ahead of their time"", which is actually wrong, their just ahead of their culture, who fight evolution at every turn and would rather watch American Idol than watch a film which truly has seeds of transformation in it.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A30RQN7B7QVVI0	Stan Rohrer	"There's a lot of pretentious overly positive reviews on this movie here. What it really boils down to is that it's just not a very good movie. It tries too hard to be the next ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and falls far short. More like something a self-indulgent director dreamed up to try to show how really artsy he is. And people that think that way are going to be the only people to really enjoy this thing.  I just couldn't find much empathy for the main character.Here's a quick summary of the three main parts the crash and melt into each other randomly and distractingly through the movie... flashbacks, flash-forwards, flash sideways... :Past Scenes:Murdering conquistador on a quest to find the tree of life, eats some sap and dies.  Not sure why his crew tried killing him in mutiny instead of just walking away. Seems like that would have made more sense than attacking him since they had him out-numbered 6 to 1.Present Scenes:Mad scientist hacking into monkey brains in a frantic attempt to come up with some last-minute miracle cure for his dying wife.  Should have been spending her last hours on this Earth with her rather than dicking around in the lab mutilating primates. No cure he could have come up with would have been approved in time to save her.  He should have know that.  Seemed more like a Dr. Frankenstein.Future Scenes:Then there's the futuristic `bubble-boy' hari Krishna scenes. I guess it was supposed to be some space ship with Tom trying to get to this particular star for some lunatic reason. He eats tree bark and hallucinates about his dead wife.This movie might have been better on the big screen but didn't impress me much visually on a 50"" plasma in HD.  If you are impressed by smoke rings coming out of your pot-head friend's bong maybe the space scenes will impress you.  Just a bunch of swirling nothing. Just pick up an kaleidoscope and you'll have a better show.This movie grossed around 15 million globally last I heard and was booed by critics at its first screening.Just wait for it to show up on the Sci-Fi channel at least then there will be commercials so you can maybe walk away to do something productive for a moment and just forget to come back to watch the rest.Shouldn't get more than 2 stars from anyone that's not trying to be a pretentious film student."	1.0	True masterwork of mediocrity.	2008-01-24	25	11	14

Dwyer ""Kush"""	"the basic reviews about ""the fountain"" put me off at first, but after some hesitation i came to watch it recently anyway.it is a little clunky in moments, but i think that comes from our culture not having enough conscious background conversation, agreement, common dialog, on these subjects, to let a movie like this move quickly, smoothly, through the philosophical, spiritual, ambitions ""the fountain"" has roped off.it is like a poem in the way it set off my own inner dialogs, broughtme into my own introspections, annunciated the unspoken, the (as you see in my review, ;->) unspeakable.the subjects i found subtlety presented are death, freedom through deathfrom death, liberation from what is small about us, the silliness ofour common blindness, pointing out our cultures lack of realization and acknowledgment about our actual cosmic situation...the way we cling to life and our conscious definitions of what is, while ignoring how actually ignorant our concepts are, how limited our investigations have been... rooted in ignoring our temporary status in ""physical"" bodies, lost in ""religious"" fantasy about what we don't know. this movie is a poem, bringing the open minded to their ownmeditations.one great subtle scene/feeling is how the ferocious intensity of a supernova is not to be feared even in close intimate contact, when we arebeyond our physical limitations.at times it reminded me of ""holy mountain"", and ""2001..."", at others like a sequel to ""apocalypto"".do not look for an action movie, or a clear cut path for your reasoningmind, and it is enjoyable, nice, recommended."	5.0	poetic movie	2007-08-15	0	0	0

But today (06/17/10) I saw it again on blu-ray and had a connection and understanding to this film that I did not have previously.I know now that this story has to be understood as two bookends supporting the center. On the left we have the story which takes place in the past. The story of ""The Fountain."" A Spanish conquistador in quest of the tree of life for the queen of Spain.On the right we have a distant future explorer who is trying to transport a tree to the heart of the Orion nebula so that when a dying star in its heart explodes the energy released by the blast will revive the tree and give him and it eternal life.In the center we have the ""real"" story, a man who's wife is dying of a brain tumor.In order to deal with her own death and leave a legacy for her husband that may help him to understand her fight and ultimate acceptance of her own death, she writes a book called ""The Fountain."" This is the story I mentioned above of the Spanish conquistador in quest of the tree of life for the queen of Spain. She writes 11 chapters of this story and we see this story enacted through the movie with her as the queen besieged by the inquisition and her husband as the hero conquistador in quest of the tree of life to save her. The wife leaves the final 12th chapter (a complete cycle) for her husband to write after she dies.He does eventually write the final chapter and this chapter is the end of ""The Fountain"" story in the past and the creation of a new future story where he transports the tree I mentioned above into the heart of the exploding star so it can be reborn. This tree is actually his wife living on in this tree that was a born from a seed planted in her grave.The whole movie is a metaphor for love and death and acceptance and hope for eternal life. The chemistry between Hug Jackman and Rachel Weisz is amazing and actually this movie really is Hugh's best work as a serious actor. The pain he feels as he tries to deal with the inevitable death of his wife is heart breaking. The suffering and confusion is very honest.It is a beautiful film both visually and emotionally and deserves to be watched at different points in your life. I was not mature enough to appreciate it 3 years ago but today I am at a place where the genius of what was attempted by this film can find a home in my heart.One technical point - The blu-ray transfer is actually not very good. The sound is very low and the picture quality lacks contrast and color richness. The presentation is bland overall and this film deserves far, far better. But despite these technical short comings the film itself still powers through and touches.I highly recommend it and give it 5 stars even though Amazon will not let me update my star rating from 3 to 5."	5.0	"""Death Is the Road to Awe"""	2007-06-05	10	7	3

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A2F6IIBONO2V48	strangeitude	I rent this movie because I love sci-fi and the theme sounded very interesting. I'm a hardcore sci-fi fan, I LOVE 2001, Blade Runner, Brazil, Solaris, to name a few; I like THX 1138, City of Lost Children, you have the picture.I don't know if it was the non-linear story line or the blurred real life, fantasy boundaries within the film, but I think the concept was too much and too much fast and furious in the delivery, since minute 1 the film tries to engage you with so many things that you don't know what's going on, it does not take the time to grow on you, or at least on me. I first thought that the spanish 'conquistador' was real life, then we find out that it's from a book, or maybe is both, so what we have then, reincarnation?I think the music is simple, sometimes cheesy, unworthy of the high concept of the movie. The acting is fine, I love Rachel Weisz, no matter what she is in. It ain't that the movie is bad, at a few moments I got interested, but I think it does'nt fulfill it's premise and it does not engage you emotionally as it should, just on the OK level.Furthermore, I'm an amateur astronomer, and they show Orion's nebula as a planetary nebula, that is a nebula of remains of a dead star, from which other stars will be formed in other regions of space in the next millions of years - life from death; but the real thing is that the Orion nebula is really a gigantic star nest, a stellar nursery of new stars, no remains of dead stars anywhere close -  a real life astronomical object appears as something it is not. That turned me off, it takes this film out from science fiction realm to the fantasy one, so the life-death theme becomes shallow, I just was not impressed.Try it at your own risk, I recommend to rent to be sure before you buy.By the way, this is not Kubrick, it does'nt even comes close.	2.0	2.5 stars	2007-07-22	9	3	6

It has elements of Kubrick (a tired 2001: Space Odyssey anaology, I know, but its true) but unlike Kubrick, it drew me in and made me feel the characters instead of contemplating them. The plot is non-linear, so its not the easiest to follow, and perhaps tries too hard at that, but there are worse film offenses, believe me. Another review called the love story one-sided, reducing Weisz's character to an object, which I disagree with- while it is somewhat one-sided, I don't think she is made an object, so much as maybe a symbol of the unattainable. Certainly on a human level I can understand the emotional aspects of wanting to hold onto the one you love, no matter what.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ATJ8PW8268BR5	Sully	This movie left much to interpretation, which I am sure was intended, but never the less the plot was very simple.  You have the story of Tom, who was a doctor desperately looking for a cure for his wife's brain tumor.  She has dealt with her impending death, but he has not.  She writes a story of how he was a great conquistador searching for the Tree of Life in order to save her, the queen, and Spain.  A great metaphor, or allegory as it were, of their life and love for each other.  The only catch is that she asks him to write the last chapter of the story, therefore dealing with her death, for she knew it was just the beginning of the afterlife.  You can interpret the ending as you wish, is the bubble a spaceship of the future, or is it simply his spirit traveling to the afterlife?  There is eternal life, but it begins at death.The imagery is beautiful.  The special effects are awesome, especially considering the techniques used and the budget they worked with.  You can say the film is new age, some scenes definitely portray that.  You could just as easily say that it is a Christian allegory.  In the end the movie is about love, death, and eternal life.	4.0	Love, Death, and Eternal Life	2007-05-21	3	2	1

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A26O4ZLM3H7B3H	T Boz	Anyone who gives this film a bad review has obviously only seen it once, as the multiple layers of symbolism only become apparent after several viewings.  Probably the greatest aspect of this film is the intentional ambiguity of its interpretation, purposely put into the film by Aronofsky to make the viewer question their own mortality, as well as their views on love, death, and what it means to truly live.  I like seeing the story as one continuous narrative, with Thomas & Isabella as two star-crossed lovers meant to be together, but tested by time and mortality to the very limits of human existence.  I could go on all day about how many ways this film can be viewed, but suffice it to say, the more times you watch it, the more you notice.  Things like the recurring themes of the circle, the triangle, the human heart, as well as the endlessness of time really bring something original to this work of art that stays with you afterwards, and brings up more questions (as any truly great film should).  I'm so glad Brad Pitt dropped out of this movie, as he was completely wrong for the role, and I can't imagine anyone but Rachel Weisz in the role of Izzi.  Some critics have dismissed this film as a ripoff of 2001, but they are totally missing the point.  As that film dealt with the concept of extra-terrestrial communication and the nature of the cosmos, this one deals with humanity and its quest to overcome the limits the universe has placed on it.  Suffice it to say, you could teach a film class on all of the themes present in this masterpiece.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3K91X9X2ARDOK	"Terrence A. ""cinemaparker@twitter"""	I don't think that whether I liked the film or not is particularly important. I definitely don't think it's for everyone, that's for sure. I did enjoy it to a degree but I have to admit that I liked Pi and Requiem For a Dream much better. I know that this little bit that I've written will probably get me incinerated by the Aronofsky purists but hey, I just don't consider it to be a masterpiece. Sorry if this offends anyone.That being said, I was surprised that this HD-DVD didn't blow me away. The big visual moments in this film don't look so great in all honesty. Not in HD anyway. I was let down by the video transfer of this disc and that's not to say it looks bad but it just didn't wow me like it should've. I thought the Spain sequences looked terrific and other moments as well but I was surprised to find that the movie didn't look absolutely stunning completely throughout. If a movie like Hot Fuzz can have a gorgeous transfer, then there's no excuse here.The extras are kind of lackluster and a bit tedious in all honesty. I think those looking for something revealing regarding the making of this film will be disappointed.I'm recommending this one for a rental. This is not a film for everyone and not exactly the kind of HD-DVD that makes you want to invite your friends over and show off your system. And if you love this film through and through, I'd still suggest a rental because the presentation is simply disappointing.	3.0	Surprising but not for the reasons you might think	2007-09-06	2	1	1

I feel it is a good thing to open up this area. The current high level of technology now allows producers to capture inner states of consciousness that have often been lost to audiences. We are multi-dimensional beings. It's hard to explain that, but seeing and feeling it through characters in a film opens us up to an awareness of ourselves that we may never have accessed before. We are not at all limited by time and space. Eventually we all will accept that. This film allows us to experience it without needing to agree with it!	3.0	A WORTHWHILE CHALLENGE	2013-12-05	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A6TFP0TL9XH5	Thaddeus Burns	"Here's what I think most people's problem is with The Fountain:They're insecure. People today have over-inflated egos that make any deep emotion beyond their own lives uncomfortable, so the common defense mechanism is to make fun of it. It's a more sensitive story than people are generally used to. This movie is cryptic, open to interperetation, and deeply emotional. Since it takes itself seriously, but doesn't explain itself, those with an ego tend to ridicule it rather than understand it, or if they do understand it, they become uncomfortable with the simple raw emotion, and ""laugh it off""The comparisons between The Fountain and Kubrick are valid, but the difference here is that Kubrick never really explored tragic raw emotion like this. He never did a love story. (As far as I know) If he had doone something like this, I'm sure he would have gotten a similar reaction from his fans.But for those who can get over themselves and enjoy the movie for what it is, The Fountain is one of the most creative, deep, and beautiful films ever made. It explores issues of love, mortality, and existence in a way I've not seen in any other story. As for as I'm concerned, Darren Aronofsky has created his magnum opus in this film, and although not everyone can appreciate it, it will stand the test of time as a sleeper hit."	5.0	A gem of a film, if you can swallow your own ego.	2008-05-07	2	1	1

I am all about subtle truths and well-written twists in a movie. This movie is meant to be on the edge of your understanding, as its topic of love, loss, and death are well-told and from a more fresh perspective. Understand, though, it is told through two stories that tie together and some of the end sequence does require some thinking to fully understand, but this movie does not leave anything unexplained. Just make sure the volume is up and the subtitles are on if you have troubles sometimes hearing quieter dialog. If you pay attention to every detail, this movie will not disappoint.RECOMMENDED: Looking for a cognitive drama? Yes.	4.0	If you like subtle, well-written movies...	2012-02-04	3	2	1

He meets the Aztec high priest and gets killed and goes to heaven where he practices yoga and tai chi and goes bald like a Sao Lin Monk.  Wolverine wakes up in the future and is a doctor trying to save his wife.  Then not.  Then there is a smart sick monkey.  Then back to him as a bald monk with the tree of life in a giant bubble.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AEQZIQMOC0XPV	this_moment	First I must confess that I had to watch this a second time to really appreciate it. The first time I was a little drowsy after a heavy dinner and a long day hiking, so could only appreciate that it was visually captivating. I really couldn't gather much meaning out of the entire affair, other than that the male lead clearly loved the female lead in both story lines within the film.On the second viewing I was blown away by the depth of this, and the artistry of it. Sure you could sum up the entire point of the thing in just a few paragraphs, but that wouldn't affect the viewer nearly as much as the artistry with which this director and writer reveal the wisdom of this film.If you like characters who grow over the course of a film in profound ways, then this is a film that will serve up a major dose of that for you. If you tend more toward action films, where a hero pursues a goal or defeats an enemy, even if you can figure out what this film is about, you will think it irrelevant.*** Spoilers ***If you have already watched this film and feel a fragmentary understanding dawning in you, hopefully this review will help clarify. Notice that he does in fact finish her novel for her.  And in the process of doing so, of writing the end of the story for both his wife's character and his own, he becomes a new person. His values utterly shift. Instead of clinging to this body for his wife within the eternity he wished to share with her, he accepts that only by letting go of this body, for both her and eventually himself, can they truly be together in eternity. He discovers that what he has been fighting against with such force, intellect, and passion for so long was in fact the very thing he was looking for. And with that he let's go of the fight against what is and surrenders himself into the awe of pure existence.Now you have to give a director a break in trying to visually translate all that as an experiential story instead of just telling the way I do in the above paragraph. That's the art.Recall the change in even his interpretation of his own life story (or maybe that's the time travel bit and he actually does go back and decide differently), as he decides to go out and play in the first snow with her in the last reflection on that moment, instead of continuing the research that led to his fountain of youth tree bark discovery. He chooses differently, opting to embrace life as it is lived while it is lived and accept death as it comes as well.*** end spoilers ***If we can all take the internal journey of the main character vicariously through him, and come to the same guiding wisdom for our lives before we waste precious decades resisting what we in fact most seek, we will be lucky indeed.

I could not wrap my head around where this was all going or what was happening. Honestly, Jackman and Weisz were my assurance it had to be a good film and that's why I rented it.Several years later, I gave it another shot, knowing it was something completely different. I now own the movie. I see something new and wonderful each time I've viewed it. This is a precious favorite of mine. The imagery, acting, musical score, director's genuine affection for his themes, the non-linear but ultimately integrated concepts are a marvelous testimony to perception.Honestly, to provide a narrative to describe the stories within this artwork would fall short.Few movies ask me to give myself completely to the vision of the director. Fewer still are successful at keeping me in that place once I give into it.confusing, tragic, beautiful, inspiring, conflicting -- that word combination doesn't seem to make to a fond description, yet in feeling all of these, the result was a moving piece of art.I highly recommend this movie. Do some homework though before viewing, so you have some familiarity with the themes. There isn't a topical, easy, spoon-fed storyline to follow with the option of seeking deeper layers. There are only layers. Even if you watch and appreciate it from a single viewing, a little time and another watch will just bring so much more of it together.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A19HPNW2LDYCST	trismosin	"This movie is what a clever teenager would make (if given the resources) on the theme of love. It's stunning to me how an adult (like the main character played by Hugh Jackman) has not already come to terms with death as a fact of life. Instead he runs around his lab like a petulant 7 year-old, railing against death, etc. Ridiculous, yet I see some people here claim to find some kind of 'wisdom' in this story. To make matters worse, the writer(s)/director mix up religious symbols in ways that only show their complete ignorance on those matters. Case in point, the ""Buddha"" bubble has a very precise meaning to the true practitioners, so to mix that up into a story involving a blood-sacrifice religion (that of the Mayans) is utterly repugnant. Now, of course, some fanboy will counter that the bubble is some kind of spaceship, etc, but the fact still remains that the symbol is ""borrowed"" from actual iconography. I checked out the special features on this DVD, just to see how this abomination came into being, and I see even the director admits that he only picked out those elements because they were ""cool""(!!) That's right, straight from the horse's mouth, forget all about the actual meaning of what you're showing, as long as they LOOK cool, the suckers are gonna swallow it whole. And, going by the rave reviews here, many already have. As for the story, it's all sentimental schlock, there's nothing profound about that, there's no moral lesson, no spiritual insight, NOTHING. I wonder what the ages are of these fanboys, I'm willing to wager most of them are under 30. I mean, don't get me wrong, if the movie tickles you in a certain way, there's nothing wrong with it, but when I hear someone invest some deeper meaning into this pile of garbage I think a counter-argument is in order. If you're looking for truly spiritual movies (and not some phony aberration) I recommend you check out the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Yasujiro Ozu, or Krzysztof Kieslowski (The Decalogue, in particular)."	1.0	pure schmaltz masquerading as art	2011-04-17	9	1	8

People with low attention spans and psuedo-intellectuals as well will balk at its message.  I have never cried at a movie but I was bawling at the last few minutes.  It builds slowly into an emotional crescendo and then it is all released at once.  I felt impacted when I left the theatre as I pondered death and that bond of love we share between family and friends.  I think that is why some people hate it, because it brings up some of the most potentially heart wrenching notions, that someday everyone you know and love is going to die.  And what after that?

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	ANN4JW1E08AS6	tuberacer	"Kubrick for a new generation? I don't think so. Puhleeaase! Kubrick never  made one of these Hollywood-churn cult of romantic love stories. Sentimental is a good term. Such stories were probably boring as sin for Stanley, unless they provided fodder for parody or irony. What's the closest Kubrick came to a love story? Cruise and Kidman in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" or Humbert Humbert and Lolita? ""Spartacus"" doesn't count because it was not actually his conception, and the censors cut out the Kubrick-signature scene that alluded to homosexuality.  ""Barry Lyndon"" pointed at the ridiculousness of love and ""Full Metal Jacket"" had a couple of real touching love scenes with a couple of Vietnamese women, didn't it, similar to the love scenes in ""Clockwork Orange""? How about ""The Shining?"" Now there was a passionate romance, axe and all!Kubrick was a genius. Aronofsky is a college graduate playing to the box office. Kubrick was not, as in ""Fountain,"" pretentiously clumsy with clutter and sap (speaking of which, I'll never look at Elmer's Glue the same again--and we all thought Super Glue was the elixir of the gods!--Elmer should have put a halo around that smiling cow).Hugh Jackman is painful to watch. What an over-actor! That energy works as Wolverine but not in a goofball love story. You can always tell when an actor is overdoing it when they start spitting all over the place as they are expressing anguish. Poor Rachel. She was so often in the line of fire. I hope she had a rag and some liquid sanitizer handy on the set.Rachel was miscast. You never really fall hopelessly in love with Rachel Weisz, nor should you. She's always got a sense of something devious, or at least superiorily intelligent going on somewhere in back of her mind. They should have chosen some uncomplicated innocent beauty type to get the being hopelessly in love stuff across fast and comprehensible. Rachel is too smart an actress for this shallow part.I'd never even heard of this film until I saw it listed among the ""people who bought this DVD also bought"" section of the Amazon page for the 2002 version of ""Solaris""--a movie I loved (now there's a movie that's an homage to Stanley Kubrick full of unabashed, blatant theft of ""2001""). But ""The Fountain"" is not Science Fiction. It's Fantasy run amok via CGI. It's another in a recent trend of American films trying to do Magical Realism. Unfortunately, Magical Realism is grounded in Spanish/Latin culture and doesn't quite make it as an American artform. I guess the scenes in Spain and Latin America were supposed to help give the attempt credence.  It's interesting to see a trailer for ""Pan's Labyrinth"" on this DVD. That movie is Magical Realism at work and naturally effective reflecting its roots in its Spanish culture. As for Americans going Mayan, ""Fountain"" is like tourist metaphysics with a great slathering of the Old Testament and whatever else Aronofsky thought he could slip in. Not a great respect for Mayan culture, if you ask me. Personally, I got more entertainment when Predator and Alien were having at each other on the top of that same pyramid. Predator as the guardian of the Tree--there you go! Or maybe you could have him hanging out in the tree with his cloaking device on--""The Fountain II--Predator vs. the Buddha.""Like I say, Aronofsky's a college graduate putting the parts together like a learned engineer. Even in the behind the scenes features you don't get a sense that he actually feels this film. Floating around in the lotus position in space. Boy, that really tops ""2001""--bald-headed, no less. Real genius at work. I wonder if Kubrick ever arrived on one of his sets with his frat boys, took one look at it, and said, ""F*#% an A!"" (watch out, the special features have moments of deep expressiveness).Enough with all the CGI, Hollywood. Get back to actual drama. So what if computers can do all this? It's mostly just filler. My dog can spin around in a tutu. So what?If you like this movie, you might like ""Constantine."" Rachel's in that one too. I enjoyed that one. It's a much more fulfilling twist on the Biblical stories, and even has a sense of humor. ""Fountain"" has such a constant unending sense of droll throughout. The musical background is like a never-ending sea of oppression.You know, I was hoping the Tree of Life was not going to be an actual tree. Would have been a nice leap into new thought if it hadn't been. Kubrick probably wouldn't have made it a tree, either, but then, Kubrick wouldn't even have touched this purely cornball story.There's a difference between making a movie about a genius, and being a genius.

Really reflect on the real stuff: the meaning of life, love, loss and death.A couple of quick observations about the reviews posted here. First, this film really splits the crowd between those who love it and those who hate it. Is that a bad thing? I say no.

You will notice how in real life we meet people midstream, and as we progress with them, then do we get windows into their past. This movie functions in that real-life fashion.However, when I got to the end, the main idea turned out to be pretty simple. It gets stated early. You want an elaboration, but it does not come.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A8FPCYK931K9N	Warners	This movie represents an incredible mix of beautiful imagery, powerful music, and wonderfully interwoven storylines.The Fountain, to me, is a thankfully nontheistic, but nevertheless spiritual vocalization of the unique importance of *living* life and *embracing* death. In that sense, I found it devastatingly powerful. When Tomas (Jackman) has his epiphany and is able to vocalize the hard truth that he had been not just avoiding, but attempting to eradicate, it evoked in me the awe and wonder that I felt when I finally was able to admit to myself that I no longer believed in god and realized that, for all I could tell, this life was the only existence I would ever have - and was thus made all the more precious, vital, wonderful, and beautiful.Thus, this is one of the few movies which I have been able to fully connect with and become absorbed in emotionally. And it became a wonderful tool to share my awe and wonder for life -- yes, even as an atheist (this may be shocking to some) -- with my theistic/believing wife. I am truly thankful to Aronofsky and Handel for writing it.	5.0	Transcendent and overwhelming.	2013-10-24	0	0	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"An epic film (at a non-epic length of 96 minutes), Darren Aronofsky's ambitious science fiction parable ""The Fountain"" demonstrates that the director wants to continue to make dense, emotionally complex films that require audience involvement. Although it isn't flawless, ""The Fountain"" is an enjoyable film that moves along at its own leisurely pace. Although ""The Fountain"" was critically attacked when it was released (it was booed at Cannes), it's an ambitious worthwhile film for those who have the patience and aren't expecting a explosion filled Summer blockbuster kind of movie. Aronosfky serves a different slice of ""pi"" here in trying to tackle the subject of mortality, reincarnation and the afterlife. It's a fascinating film even when it fails to reach beyond the rudimentary topic at hand.The different strands of this interlaced triptych have different success rates with the story involving the Conquistador's search for the Tree of Life that a Franciscan Monk (Mark Margolis) friendly to the Spanish throne may be able to find. If the Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) can find it, Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz)may survive the expanding inquisition. The present day story with Jackman as Dr. Tom Creo struggling to find the cure to his wife's cancer (she's writing a book called The Fountain which details the first part of the story about the Conquistador and his search. When Tom ""reads"" the story he's reading a metaphor about what is happening to his wife, his efforts to save her, etc.) all the while running into unintentional roadblocks from his boss (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar nominated performance) is along with the first, most successfully. The last segment set in the 26th Century while visually dazzling is the most cryptic much as Kubrick's ending for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was cryptic in tackling the concept of mortality and ""rebirth"". Again, it could be seen as Tom's efforts to save his wife from his perspective and his ultimate surrender to fate and the acceptance that he may not be able to save her in this life but can join her in the next.While Arononfsky's ambitious story may leap out of his grasp, there's much to admire in this visually stunning film. It won't be for everyone but like Kubrick's ""2001"" it will speak to a specific audience and the skill with which it is made will insure that its reputation (both for good and bad) will grow with time. In fact Aronofsky's film probably has more in common with the two versions of ""Solaris"" more than Kubrick's film with their consideration of life, death and how they impact those we love.Linking all six characters that Jackman and Weisz play is an interesting idea that might confuse those expecting the film to be literal. On the other hand, one could rationalize why they are in all three stories since it touches the attempt by Jackman's character in all three stories to try and defeat death allowing him to stay with the women he loves. Perhaps in some way they are the same ""characters"" constantly struggling to defeat death to stay together. You decide. Aronofsky takes an almost literary approach to the material eschewing the action-adventure approach of most film science fiction.For those interested in the DVD extras we get a six part featurette that can be viewed all at once that covers everything from the genesis of the project (when it was entitled ""The Last Man"") and the discussions that Aronofsky had with a Ari Handel (who co-wrote the story). They had many discussions about life, death and fate all of which were fed into this compelling film. It's amazing what Aronofsky gets away with given the low budget of the film. At one point the film went into turnaround when Brad Pitt and Cate Blachett pulled out of the film. Originally budgeted at $75 million, the production saw its budget sliced in half after Pitt left the production (reportedly due to creative differences with Aronofsky). Aronofsky lost his sets (they were auctioned off when Village Roadshows pulled out of the production as well)The fascinating, beautiful visual effects were achieved using micro-photography of chemical reactions on Petri dishes vs. with CGI and looks just as good (if not better) than some of the visual effects for similar films that have used CGI to portray a star about to go nova. We also get the original theatrical trailer. While that's nice, a good commentary track would have been a bit more revealing particularly during some of the more symbolic and over-the-top sequences of the film.Is ""The Fountain"" for everyone? No. Some will consider the film to be a pretentious hodge-podge of romantic/spiritual sci-fi and homage to Trakovsky's ""Solaris"".  ""The Fountain"" has more in common with Tarkvosky's ""Solaris"" than ""2001"" (although Tarkovsky's film is about a man trying to deaden himself against the living memory of the woman he loved). In that regard, ""The Fountain"" is a fine companion piece to both films (if a bit more esoteric and cryptic). I personally like ""The Fountain"" but it will take some patience to stay with the overlapping often intersecting storylines and absorb the ending of the film. ""The Fountain"" is thoughtful, emotional science fiction something of a rarity in today's bigger, louder, faster science fiction films.Solaris,Solaris - Criterion Collection,2001 - A Space Odyssey"	3.0	"Not everyone will be pleased to drink from this ""Fountain"" but it will be a tasty drink  for some"	2007-05-08	93	73	20

Personally I felt that the whole astronaut in the future storyline was just a metaphor. The graphic novel doesn't bear that out. Shrug. My take is this: there's the real story, which you see, then there's her story (the fountain) that deals with her death and then there's his story (the astronaut) that deals with her death. I saw this in the theaters and it certainly compares to 2001, but with much less boring. This is a more human 2001 and deals with issues that we will all have to deal with eventually.This may be the first 5 star review I've ever given a movie.	5.0	great, aronofsky is one of the greatest living filmmakers	2009-01-23	5	4	1

I'll also wonder who was the target audience, after all several people gave it high ratings. I watched the whole thing and kept thinking there would be something that would tie everything together, but it didn't. SPOILER ALERT!!!  I hated the wife died but was glad the monkies got betteR.

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3ZNWRUW4EKV6	Wendy	I've read and heard that this movie confused some people, that they couldn't figure out which story was which.  It's not (imho) about time travel, not literally.  Watch it closely, watch the beginning, what do you see?  You see the book that Izzi was writing, the one she asks Tom to finish.  This is a visually stunning movie, emotionally touching and frustrating in turns.  The characters are so believable.  This is a story of creation, everlasting love, loss, regret, grief and acceptance.  Hugh Jackman gives an outstanding performance, as does  Rachel Weisz and actually all the cast!  Note that this movie is an adaptation of the graphic novel by the same name.	5.0	Stunning and Thoughtful	2014-03-13	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A333VQB4ICSCW5	Widescreen guy	There aren't many sci-fi movies I simply toss in the trash, but this was one.  (Okay, it's going in the yard sale box, but that's essentially the same thing.)  A guy floating in a bubble.  Don't know how he got there or exactly what's happening to him or why I should care.  This movie was slow and tedious.  No plot, no story, no action, no suspense, no conflict, little or no character development.  These things have been the elements of good story telling from Dickens to Twain to Stephen King.  And they are all missing from this movie.  Watching it was about as exciting as watching grandma knit.  You get a guy in a bubble.  That's it.  Other reviewers have said that they saw all sorts of new age or philosophical or religious meanings.  For them, this movie makes sense, I suppose.  For me, it was two hours of pointless boredom.  I'm a lifelong sci-fi fan, and I rate this as one of the worst movies of all time.  I don't know what category it belongs in, but it's really not science fiction.	1.0	Waiting for a bus would be more fun than watching this movie	2011-02-15	17	4	13
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3S4UMDR6921PZ	"William A. Robertson ""cygnadu"""	"I was anticipating this movie so much that I didn't even bother trying to find someone to go watch it at the theatre with me...not that I need someone to go with me but... Anyway, enough of my sad story, this movie is fantastic.  The DVD has a lot to offer in the ""behind the scenes featurettes"" department - lots of details on how it all came to be.  But, I suspect that there will be an even sweller edition released at a later date - probably just in time for the Christmas spending season.  If you have a chance to read the graphic novel adaptaion of this movie I recommend that as well - it's a slightly different take on the film and just as surrealistic.  The movie itself is quite magical - not quite in the fairy-tale sense yet still mind-stretching and very touching.  Hugh Jackman owns his role just like always and you get to see him as ""action guy"", ""romantic lead"", and ""brooding/pensive"" all in this wonderful film.  Rachael Weisz is just as outstanding in her double roles making us guys fall head over heels for her.  The only reason I only allow four stars is that I can forsee this becoming a double-dip when a Special Edition DVD is released in the near future."	4.0	Allows your mind to float but clutches your heart-strings.	2007-06-27	1	1	0

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A3T46X7M3AUDAB	William Timothy Lukeman	Clearly this is a love it or hate it film, with very little middle ground. For those who want a linear, plot-driven story with everything explained, it can only be a vast, pretentious disappointment ... but for those who take it on its own mythic terms, a glorious & heartfelt journey awaits. It's meant to be experienced in an almost primal way, for it reaches down into the roots of the collective unconscious to tell its essentially simple but deep tale.Simple but deep? I think so. The plot, as much of it as there is, isn't complex: how we face or refuse to face death, especially when the loss of a life-enhancing love is concerned. It's the way it's told that gives it such depth, and why I call it symphonic -- this is a tone poem, one which repeats its motifs & images over & over again, layer upon layer of feeling which builds intensely, gathering momentum & emotional weight.Is Tom experiencing different lifetimes? That's certainly one possible interpretation. Or are the stories set in the past & future actually representations of an emotional, psychological reality? You can intellectually analyze this film & tease out many interpretations ... but in the end, it's meant to be FELT. Meaning & clarity hover on the edge of vision, just beyond complete understanding but somehow almost visible, not unlike remembering a vivid & deeply moving dream.The acting is superb, and the visuals match & enhance the emotions being played out before us. I'm so glad that budgetary constraints forced the use of non-CGI effects; the film is so much better for it. And the evocative & haunting score adds yet another layer of emotional depth.Again, not a film for everyone. But for those open to such risk-taking work, it will be rewarding indeed. Most highly recommended!	5.0	Symphonic & stunningly beautiful	2007-03-19	9	7	2
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A1QF10TB8AYTA3	"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja"""	So, it's highly possible that I just might not be a fan of Darren Aronofsky's work. I've seen Black Swan, The Wrestler, and each film has always left me unsatisfied.What do I mean by this?It means that when you get to the end of the movie, it never quite feels satisfying to have watched it. In this instance, for me, I felt that the character of Tommy was just too one dimensional and single minded. His only goal throughout the whole film is to save his wife and he obsesses over doing this throughout the film.But it's just not that interesting from a story perspective. The film is very well acted and the emotions felt very real, but when you get past the visual spectacle and make sense of the 3 storylines which are essentially the same thing, you realize that the movie is very repetitive. It essentially repeats to you three times on why you must accept death as a part of life.We see it with the ConquistadorWe see it with Tommyand then we see it when bald Tommy supposedly hits enlightenment.I'm also surprised that no reviewers mentioned the fact that there is a lot of buddhist symbolism in this movie. From bald Tommy crossing his legs, to the conquistador being reincarnated in a different form, to the visuals. A lot of it, to me, seemed like a form of reaching enlightenment. The problem with this movie, is that it told me the same thing 3 times, in albeit different forms.I would have preferred that this movie just stick with one storyline and follow it throught, or even reduce it down to two. The whole Spanish inquisition storyline and the visuals used for that were much more interesting than modern day Dr. Tommy.Overall, I think there's a better selection of movies out there. But, some people do enjoy this movie and it really wasn't that bad. I think I just need a better plot than just, my wife is dying times three. But so far the director is 0 for 3 in my book.	2.0	Doesn't feel very satisfying	2013-10-05	1	0	1
B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	AUTBHG6070SL4	"wiredweird ""wiredweird"""	"If you can tell them apart, then you are going to miss something in this movie that really matters.Let's start with the easy parts. It's beautiful, even if it tends towards a gold-sepia monochrome and big-face closeups. It manipulates your emotions, but does it well. More important: once the movie grabs your attention, it gives something grand in return. Remember how many art spectacles don't, then understand why that matters to me. It's beautiful, and it inspires sentiment that's more than a paperback-cover deep.If you can't feel why Jackman's scientist mourns in the lab, then you've missed most of the movie. I've felt that, a little, so I've glimpsed the uniquely human emotion being portrayed: hard, shining intellect driven by white-hot emotion. That feeling takes both; if you feel the need to argue, then you've never been taken up by that frame of mind. I think I understand a little about the conquistador, too: dying-deep love of queen and country, and personal bravery in every moment. None of that precludes art, including the devotion to a work that has to go beyond death. The work has its own life, and the human workmen must sometimes pass the vision on.""The Fountain"" is baffling and nonlinear. It cloys and it brutalizes. It's just beyond belief. It's probably the most involving and evocative movie I've seen in the last twenty years. It engages emotions that I have never been able to share with anyone, not in my whole life. Maybe, just maybe, you've spent a lot of your life all alone with feelings like mine. As of now, you're not alone any more.For all that, I'm still not sure whether it's a good movie. It's great, but I don't know whether it's good. Greatness is good enough for me.//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release"	5.0	Art, Science, and Passion	2006-11-23	10	7	3

But the thing that stopped me watching wasn't the boredom factor, but the fact that the filmmakers have slipped in a bit of propganda for animal experimentation. The main character is upset that his wife is dying of a brain tumour and feels this is sufficient justification to torture an animal. And this behaviour is passed off in the film without comment or any attempt to try to justify it ethically - the animal abuse is just treated as if it's perfectly normal and acceptable.A deeply offensive film.	1.0	Animal abuse propaganda	2013-10-01	11	2	9

B00005JPAR	The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)	A9AX1D31T7J1S	Zachary Gochenour	The Fountain is a good movie, and worth re-watching.  It is a sort of fantasy/allegory that focuses a lot more on style than character development, but I still found the plot to be coherent and the movie compelling enough to care about what was going on.  You need to be in a contemplative, patient mood to watch this movie: it is not exactly action-packed, and the themes and characterization are subtle.My principle complaint is that this edition is a major disappointment.  Underwhelming visuals, essentially devoid of special features, nothing packed in the box except the disc.  When I buy a Blu-ray movie I am expecting the definitive edition for the price I am being charged.  That means carefully mastered visuals, well-done commentary tracks, deleted scenes.  I am really expecting more than what may as well be a recording of the movie off HBO.	2.0	Good movie, poor SKU	2008-10-22	2	1	1

A very emotional film, especially when Izzy dies from brain cancer just as a breakthrough is reached, and then when the Conquistador drinks from the tree of life and inevitably dies from the vegetation coming from his body.  The film sends a clear message: death can only be postponed, not prevented.  The musical score was also phenomenal, and the best part of the music was the strong accompaniment by Mogwai.
