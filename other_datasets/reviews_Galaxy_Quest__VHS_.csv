I just watched the movie for the first time and I didn't expect it to even come close to be good by watching a no good movie trailer. Actors playing actors were good and special effects were average, but good average. Many of today's B-movies wouldn't have these good graphics or costumes or creature and planet effects. I thought the movie would be bad and the first alien species we meet look silly and quite stupid and I was thinking the movie wouldn't come close to be any good. I was wrong. While the plot is in no way realistical, the movie met my goal and it is to be entertained. It was also funny at times. I liked it. Despite it been a sort of childish movie, mainly because of the plot.	4.0	Didn't expect that	2013-07-29	2	1	1

It really does show a lot of the classic parodies on the series, including the man in the red shirt. It's not as funny as Spaceballs, but  still very good. The only problem I had was, it had a period of about 45  minutes, where it got too serious, and not as funny. Aside from that, it  was very good.	4.0	A must see for Star Trek fans	2000-05-24	1	0	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A21UZ0Y95QA5LD	"Adam ""ac"""	Galaxy Quest is every thing the Trek movies should have been, but with notable exceptions(2 and 4) weren't. There is a sense of the possible in this film that makes you want to believe that this is &quot;our&quot;  universe and that something truely wonderful has happened. The cast does a  fine job both as their &quot;off-camera&quot; personas and as their show  roles. The effects by Stan Winston make you realize, just how cheap  Paramount has been with the FX budget for the &quot;real&quot; Trek films.  And the story allows the Characters to actually accomplish something, to  acheive rather than hypothesize and whine for two hours.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3L50SMPO15L0Z	"Adam E. Hirsch ""qBaz"""	GalaxyQuest managed to both make fun of and fully participate in the bizarre hubbub around all science fiction, and Star Trek in particular.  The fact that it can mock without being mean makes it a particularly nicely  balanced movie.  Very funny performances by all concerned, though Sigourney  Weaver got less character development than the two leading men.  Maybe  that's just part of the homage to traditionally sexist s/f.  Alan Rickman  and Tim Allen both do very well, and I may even forgive Tim for the  horrendously unfunny Home Improvement.  :)	4.0	Manages to both lampoon and enjoy the Trekker fantasy	2000-06-05	0	0	0

The acting is great and the actors suit the characters perfectly. The dvd has a lot of special features including deleted scenes which are brilliant and is definitely worth buying for. The plot is incredibly funny and falls nothing short of the funniest movie i have ever seen and this is the type of movie you could take to a desert island and watch it over and over, though i don't think it would keep you sane.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AQP0Y4B8MHVWY	"""ahnoor"""	No one had to convince me that this was a good movie.  I have to admit, the corny TV show clip that began the movie was almost painful to watch, as well at the crew of the N.S.E.A. Protector pimping themselves in front of a  store.  But as soon as they were beamed into space and their smug commander  showed them the ship that had been conjured into being by the Thermians,  all that drifted away.  Although this movie is a spoof on Trek, there is  genuine emotion involved (for any doubters, look into Tim Allen's eyes when  he activates the Omega 13.  I rest my case.)  It's nice to finally have a  movie that is genuine, good -natured, and funny.  Even if you HATE sci-fi,  watch this movie!  (P.S.  Am I the only one who noticed that Tony Shalhoub  went through about half the film clutching a greasy paper bag?)	5.0	It's like throwing gasoline on a flame	2000-05-05	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1A4DEENGHK51T	Alan Attebery	"Ahhhhhh.... science fiction conventions. Promoters love them. Fans love them. The egotistical main star who is hung up on himself loves them. The only people who don't like them are the supporting stars.No, I'm not talking about the cast of ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" (though it sure would apply). I'm talking about the cast of the Galaxy Quest television series.Twenty years after the cancellation of their show, the crew of the NSEA Protector is still making the convention circuit rounds, and resenting the star of the series, Jason Nesmith (played by Tim Allen), who hogs the spotlight, doesn't seem to understand the concept of being on time, and is so hung up on himself that he can't see that everyone else resents him.During one of these conventions, a race of aliens from outer space, who have mistaken the old Galaxy Quest television series for historical documents, come to recruit Jason's alter ego, Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, to help save them from their attackers. Can he and his resentful crew of washed up actors save the aliens?""Galaxy Quest"" takes a little while to get going. While the first several scenes are needed to help set up the rest of the movie, it does seem to take forever. The movie doesn't really pick up steam until the second half, but once it does it really gets rolling. It becomes a very funny and entertaining movie, more than making up for the slow first half.If you are a fan of all of those old ""outer space"" television series, or just like to make fun of them, you will want to see this movie."	4.0	Where No Comedy Has Gone Before	2002-09-12	3	3	0

I'm not sure which part is the most entertaining, whether it is the actors acting about acting, or all the hilarious lines and references  that crop up, or the whole crazy idea that a ship based on a televsion show could somehow be created by worshipful aliens.I highly recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor, a sense of adventure, and any connection to the sci-fi, Trekkie world.	5.0	It is a Wonderful Romp!	2014-01-31	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A13R0MXMCE34K5	alan jobe	GALAXY QUEST has all the touches of a true blockbuster comedy: great acting (even great LOUSY acting...!), top quality special effects, lots of laughs, and a plot that really works--all in perfect harmony and balance.  From the time I saw the very first trailer, I was captivated, and kept  thinking to myself:  &quot;I sure hope this movie lives up to the potential  of its plot!&quot; ---IT DOES. For those of you who think Tim Allen is a  hack comedian, not an actor... well, he is perfect for this role: a  comedian playing a hack actor!  Sigourney is great as the brainy lady in  the role of the mindless bimbo.  And the Thermians--they are the perfect  bumbling aliens, without being too ridiculous.  Oh, and did I mention the  special effects?  Very nearly Star Wars class, though on a smaller scale!  Unfortunately, it has received very little in the way of publicity,  critical acclaim, or popular following.  It's almost like a cult  &quot;sleeper&quot;...  I wish it was more popular, because  I Want A Sequel!	5.0	A Vastly Underrated Movie	2000-05-05	6	6	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	My wife, being a good natured gal, agreed to go see GALAXY QUEST with me.  Neither of us are hard-core trekkies, but I grew up watching Capt Kirk order &quot;fire proton torpedoes&quot; and &quot;set you phasers on  stun&quot; enough times to want to see what this show offered.Both of us  were truly surprised.  Much to her chagrin, my wife agreed that she  actually enjoyed the film a great deal.  As for myself, I seldom laugh out  loud while watching a movie -- this movie broke that trend.  There were  several laugh out loud scenes in the movie for both of us.  I bet there  will be for you, too.As for the show itself, it is, of course, a spoof  on the original &quot;Star Trek.&quot; The movie has a somewhat slow start,  but that segment is essential to setting up the rest of the show.  Once the  show gets moving, though, there is plenty of good fun for everyone.  Maybe  the reason I enjoyed it so much is that I went to see it with fairly low  expectations -- was I ever surprised!Tim Allen does a great job as the  Kirk-like captain of a long off the air sci-fi show, and his supporting  cast does a grand job as well.Join in the fun as this rag-tag cast of  TV has-beens get hooked up with a civilization of naive aliens who are in a  world of hurt.  Can the crew of GALAXY QUEST help them?  Save them?  Tune  in and see.Good special effects, a funny script, and a cast that clicks  makes for a wonderful experience from this surprising entry into the sci-fi  genre.OK, so, with that glowing recommendation, why only 4 stars instead  of five?  It is definitely worth 5 stars for the crowd who grew up watching  the original Star Trek, for people who are current trekkies, and for those  who enjoy good situation comedy.  This movie is not, however, for everyone.  There is a good supply of corniness involved, and those who never did like  Star Trek and similar shows should probably look elsewhere for their next  viewing option.You never know though...YOU JUST MIGHT LIKE IT!4  stars, not quite making it to 5.Worth a Saturday afternoon or an open  week day night.Alan Holyoak	4.0	Surprisingly entertaining, even for the &quot;Non-Trekkie&quot;	2000-06-19	2	1	1

This is a perfect parody that also remains a loving tribute to Star Trek. From the audience at the Galaxy Quest convention to the way Tim Allen sits in the command chair to Alan Rickman's dry delivery of his lines, this is a hysterical tribute to the show that started it all: Star Trek.  Even if you know nothing of Star Trek, Galaxy Quest remains a clever, brilliantly written, exceptionally well acted romp.	5.0	Star Trek fan?	2013-03-02	1	1	0

Special mention goes out to Thermian leader Enrico Colantoni for his wonderful performance.This movie lampoons with the best of them - in fact, I found myself often laughing out loud, to a bemused reaction from my family.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	ACAO2J1XCS4FL	Alexander Suraev	I am surprised there are many 3-stars reviews with all these &quot;ALMOST hilarios&quot; and &quot;falls short&quot; passages. Galaxy Quest is  evidently a quality film. It's mainstream in the most positive meaning of  the word. And the mainstream kind of comedy entertainment needed that new  addition as an argument against all that Farelli Brothers/Adam  Sandler/early Jim Carey idiocy.There are no below-the-waist jokes in  Galaxy Quest, all these over-the-hill actors, sci-fi fans and the endearing  interplanetary misfits are the objects of loving parody. Even the green  lobster monster is a cutie in his own menacing way. It echoes vaguely The  Three Amigos - second-hand thespians facing the challenge of blazing a big  bunch of baddies to hell and staying alive in the process. But it's  better.Alan Rickman is very good as the tortured genius. How I adored  him pinched by the more down-to-earth shipmates on a parking lot before the  newly opened tech supermarket moaning that -&quot; What a savings...&quot;  - debility!Tim Allen is great though I could not buy his total mood  change upon hearing two teenage jerks' unappreciating remarks in a loo. As  if these chirpings were the revelations on his current state, very  unexpected and profound.Steve Buscemi has to copyright his image - the  6th crewmate Guy was his clone. I looked for Steve in the ending credits  but got the other...Guy.Yes, I have to confess I felt a tinge of  disappointment halfway through the film, when it was slackening a bit,  losing momentum. The film's idea is so overwhelmingly promising it's  virtually impossible to meet the expectations for the whole 100%. But the  final scene erased my vague discontent completely. Two very important for  us Earthlings notions are triumphantly confirmed by that glorious crash -  there is always a hope of redemption no matter how far downhill you have  already traveled and there is a myriad of worlds out there, friendly,  menacing,all of them very exciting.So I am very enthusiastic in my  appreciation of that mainstream effort - it's less likely to make a bunch  than Adam Sandler's schlock but it's so human and intelligent it produces  the warm-hearted chukles instead of guttural laugh convulsions that rock  the seats when the waterboy traverse a screen.And true to my &quot;vote  with your dollar&quot; principle I got the DVD for my collection.	5.0	3 stars!  Come on! Be generous.	2000-07-25	3	2	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AFUDE1ULFI7PN	Alex	I really, really enjoyed this flick.  People will call it satirical, people will say it pokes fun at trekkies, etc.  But what makes this movie great is that it can stand alone.  It's funny enough that non-sci-fi buffs  can still enjoy it, and it's got enough references to sci-fi programs that  real fans of the genre will find another level of amusement.  But the story  is funny, the characters are great, and Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver are  terrific.Essentially, it's a very entertaining, relatively  easy-on-the-brain story that will give you a good hour and a half of  laughs.	5.0	As somebody who hates Star Trek...	2000-04-27	1	1	0

What I got was even funnier than I expected, as well as a story that rivaled the last  actual Trek movie (the abominible Insurrection)!  This movie was  excellent--funny, smart, and not insulting (well, not too insulting) to the  Trekkies it pokes fun at.  Well worth a watch!The DVD has excellent  picture and sound quality.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3NQU1649SH0Q4	"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,"""	"""Galaxy Quest"" is good goofy fun for anyone and especially for the trekkie or trekker.  Plot:  it's the end of the century and the cast of a 1970s TV show called ""Galaxy Quest"" is so typecast that it has  been reduced to making public appearances like mall openings.  Needless to  say, lots of the fans dress up like aliens.  Turns out one group of fans  are REAL aliens and spirit the crew up to a REAL spaceship that was  designed to mimic the Galaxy Quest spaceship in all (and I mean all)  respects.Don't worry too much about plot loopholes here; just buckle  your belt and enjoy the ride.  Tim Allen is terrific here as the  Shatneresque commander and Sigourney Weaver more than holds her own as the  buxom blonde mate.  Look for Tony Shaloob (of TV's ""Monk"") in a supporting role.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A14N5L5T089VX3	"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader"""	"I know - you've already seen a dozen other reviews that say Galaxy Quest is a wonderful send-up of the original Star Trek TV Series.  As someone who is a HUGE Star Trek fan, I can assure you, it is, and very well done.What really makes this movie work is not that it's a Star Trek parody.  The magic is in the thoughtful and well written examination of the world of those trapped in roles from a show long dead: hating what they've become, but where the only way to survive is off the microscopic income they get from conventions, ""special appearances"" and such that come their way due to their fame as a character from the show ""Galaxy Quest"".  The movie quickly makes it clear that our characters are in this situation and hate it: they hate the show, hate themselves, and hate each other.Well, at least on the surface they hate each other: they've been together for decades, and so have long standing grudges, know every one of each other's warts and quirks, and know what buttons to push to end an argument (or start one).  It's like a dysfunctional family: they can't stand each other, but know that they're all in it together.  To put it another way, and as is emphasized by a statement from the character ""Malthesar"" early in the film, the TV show portrayed a crew that worked together in perfect harmony, trust and respect of each other.  Yet, the actors behind those roles are living a life far from the ideals they once portrayed.The leader of the crew is Tim Allen, who's character, Jason Nesmith plays a very self-centered and Shatneresque ""Commander Peter Quincy Taggart"" of the Starship ""Galaxy Quest.""  He alone of the show's cast enjoys living in the past, and is center stage in every guest appearance.  He loves the attention and glory it seems to bring, but is not above stealing some of that glory from his fellow cast members.  Yet, even he, early in the film, is inescapably confronted with the fact that he's also a washed up has been.Salvation comes in the form of REAL (!) aliens (apparently) disguised as Galaxy Quest groupies who track down ""Commander Taggert"" at a convention to ask for his help.  These Thermians have no idea that the broadcasts of  ""historical documents"" about the crew of the Starship Galaxy Quest that they've been watching are, in fact, ficton.  The concept of fiction (and deceit) is totally foreign to them.An equally clueless and hung-over Jason (Allen) goes along for a ride with the Thermians, thinking he'll be visiting yet another cardboard recreation of the ship's set, but finds out that what he thought was just another bunch of fans to be treated with contempt, are in fact the real thing.Back on earth, he invites his castmates along to see.  They (of course) think he's finally cracked, but needing the money, they follow along; and the fun begins.I'm always looking for movies where there's growth in the characters and a lesson to be learned.  Slapstick humor without purpose is, to me, not worth the effort it takes to watch.  There needs to be growth, there needs to be some reason the characters are going through the situation we are seeing them in.Fortunately, Galaxy Quest does not disappoint on this score: you see our characters come to the realization that all this is real.  They try to ""act"" their way through the crisis that their desperate Thermian Hosts recruited them to solve, and quickly find that acting doesn't work in real life.  This is played all the way through with just the right mix of the ridiculous combined with the sublime.Once all seems lost, we see the Galaxy Quest actors pull together, learn from their mistakes, overcome their fears and insecurities, and really act like a team (just as their TV alter egoes always did); and (of course) save the day.The cast for this movie is seasoned and impressive, and do a superb job.  In addition to Tim Allen who does a great send-up of William Shatner, we have Sigourney Weaver (""Ghost Busters"") as Gwen Demarco playing the the absolute antihesis of her ""Ripley"" character in Aliens.  Alan Rickman (""Snape"" in ""Harry Potter"") does an excellent job as a Shakespearean actor resentfully playing the alien Dr. Lazarus.  Tony Shalhoub (from the TV series ""Monk"") is phenomonal as the ultra laid back engineer ""Fred Kwan"", and Daryl Mitchell does an excellent job portraying a now grown up former child star ""Tommy Mitchell"".Two (at the time) newcomers in the cast were Justin Long as a teenage and nerdy Galaxy Quest groupie - later to become well known for his role as ""Mac"" in the Apple ""Macintosh"" ads.  Finally, and stealing nearly every scene he's in is Sam Rockwell as a slightly neurotic wannabe actor ""Guy Fleegman"".This film didn't win any major industry awards, but, like most Tim Allen films are, combines comedy with a moral lesson: It does it well, and hits its intended target dead on.  For that reason, I give it five stars."	5.0	A Perfect(ly) Dysfunctional Star Trek	2008-10-23	2	2	0

The movie starts as the cast of a show that has been off the air for some time meets up at a convention.  They meet real aliens, who think their show was actual history, and ask for their help.  The movie then proceeds with the cast helping the aliens and all the fun that is attached to it.  Such a funny movie. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub are excellent make this movie great and hilarious.	5.0	Awesome Movie	2013-02-26	1	1	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AOA8UW0EHDKVB	Amanda HALE	&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; ALMOST makes it; the idea of a bunch of has-been actors from a TV Sci-Fi series having to save the universe 'for real' is funny in itself, and Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and the marvellous Alan  Rickman are terrific in their roles as the mis-matched losers forking out a  scant living making personal appearances at Sci-Fi conventions.  However,  once the subtext is established - it is forgotten, and we're left with a  typical 'laser-gun/scary alien/big explotion' type of movie which I feel is  aimed at a younger viewer. The problem with &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is  that it doesn't seem to 'know' its audience; there isn't enough of the  'has-been actor' theme to keep an adult audience laughing, and this idea of  'people past their prime' is lost on youngsters. There are a LOT of clever  ideas and genuinly funny lines in this movie, but they aren't 'played out',  and I can't help but wonder if this has more to do with the Hollywood  obsession with making movies for a 'young audience' to gross as much money  as possible; you feel that the movie has been told to 'hold off' on the  very intelligent subtext and focus on the laser guns!  This is a real  shame, because 'Galaxy Quest' is ALMOST hilarious - but isn't. And that's  no fault of Allen, Weaver, Rickman or the very strong supporting cast.	2.0	A near miss.	2000-07-14	26	7	19

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AOOCDN5TFZ9QP	"Amazon Customer ""benshlomo"""	"I wonder whether a non-Trekker would enjoy this movie as much as we Star Trek fans do.  The answer is, probably not quite so much or in quite the same way, but I'm pretty sure they'd like it.  That's part of what makes ""Galaxy Quest"" so special.  Who needs a movie that only works for those who dress like a Starfleet officer to walk the dog?  We'd like a decent plot and some interesting characters, too, if you don't mind.We'll get to the Star Trek references in a second - first, a little plot summary.  ""Galaxy Quest"" is about the cast of a familiar-looking television show, some 25 years after its cancellation.  Their careers stalled long ago, and they make a living by opening shopping malls and appearing at conventions, where obsessed fans dress like them and ask them highly technical questions about spaceships that never existed.  Among those fans is a group of genuine aliens who have based their entire culture on tapes of the old show, which they assume are historical documents - these beings barely even know what falsehood is, let alone know it when they see it.  In any case, they are in desperate need of help; an interstellar tyrant has nearly wiped them out and they believe that the ""Galaxy Quest"" heroes can defeat him.  It takes the actors a while to realize that they're in a real space adventure, and it takes the aliens rather longer to realize what they've let themselves in for.  At which point everyone's a little too busy not dying to say ""Uh-oh"".This movie gets it all right.  Instead of a bunch of cookie-cutter heroes, for instance, we get a group of highly distinct personalities.  The original captain is an egomaniac who can't believe his luck, the original first officer is a trained Shakespearian who bitterly resents having to keep that ridiculous makeup on, and the original communications officer is delighted to find that she has something to do besides looking sexy and repeating whatever the computer says.  The original helmsman, who was a child during the show's original run, is grown up and angry and terrified at the prospect of driving a real ship, the original engineer is calm enough to take the whole business in stride, and there's even an extra from the original program along for the ride who's just ""jazzed to be on the show again"" (although he grows a bit concerned about the likelihood that he'll die in this particular episode).Meanwhile, the aliens are a bunch of sweethearts.  They wear electronic devices that allow them to appear human (in their true form they look like psychedelic octopi, sort of) and they have the craziest imitation of human laughter you've ever heard.  They will do anything for their heroes, up to and including preparing a dish of live bugs for the supposedly non-human first officer's dinner.  As for their nemesis - well, we're told that any adventure story depends for excitement on its villain, and this guy is hideous, perfectly vicious, and extremely hard to get rid of.  Nice combination.Many of the performances here have the sort of fizz you get when serious actors have an enormous amount of fun.  Some of these folks, such as Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub, have a comic background in clubs and on television, but they are quite capable of dramatic work.  Like Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver (it's nice to see Ripley from ""Alien"" having a nice time for a change), they sensibly submit intensely dramatic performances - none of this deadly winking at the audience just to let us know that they know it's funny.  That's the kiss of death, and it's nowhere in evidence here.And while I'm on the subject, will someone please make Sam Rockwell a star already?  He's wonderful at comedy here and elsewhere, his Shakespeare in ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" was a revelation, and he made a horrifying villain of his own in ""The Green Mile""  The guy can do anything.  A word to the wise.Anyway, as I said, ""Galaxy Quest"" makes a wonderful movie on its own terms.  For us Trekkers, no kidding folks, it's just about perfect.For one thing, these characters relate to each other according to Star Trek gossip - everyone resents the captain's hogging the spotlight, the guy with the prosthetic makeup feels pretty ambiguous about it, and then there's that young fan who won't admit it but is certain the whole thing is real.  He turns out to be right, of course, and his reaction when he learns this is priceless.The show itself picks up a few in-jokes from Star Trek, like the way the characters fall uphill during space battles and the spacey scientific details that make no sense when you think about them, not to mention the fact that the captain always finds some way to show off his torso.  Fandom is presented properly, too - not only the obsessed fans themselves, but the constant availability of T-shirts and other souvenirs at conventions.And finally, there's enough emotional punch to this movie to ensure that it's more than just a novelty act.  It comes through primarily in the underlying affection between the cast members, for all their bickering, and the way that affection transfers to the aliens, particularly when the actors wonder if they will really be able to help out.  In other words, ""Galaxy Quest"" is the story of a group of people accustomed to thinking of their lives as wasted, who learn to take themselves and others seriously again.  Like many comedies, this one is really just a mushpot at its core, and the perfection of its attitude toward the old television show gets all the sentimentality down smooth and easy.Trust me, guys, you know enough about Star Trek and its environment to enjoy ""Galaxy Quest"", whether James Kirk is your captain or not.Benshlomo says, You get to poke fun at what you love."	5.0	A Very Clever Deception	2010-04-14	2	2	0

They even did Tim Allen's makeup just right - he really looks like Shatner, especially in the scene where he's hung-over and lying underneath his coffee table. They also threw in a Webster-like character to spoof 1980s TV. Classic.The cast around Tim Allen is so strong that they mask any weaknesses he might have. Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman are perfect alongside Tim Allen. I don't know who the genius was who cast those two, but he/she deserves a lot of credit.To me, this movie is more enjoyable that Star Trek I, Star Trek V, any of the Next Generation movies AND the Star Trek re-boot movies.	5.0	Star Trek spoof made by people who obviously love Star Trek	2014-02-16	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2AVV9LV9UXT6F	Amazon Customer	"The humor in this movie works on two levels.  First is the comedy that results from the movie's basic premise: a bunch of TV actors suddenly find themselves in exactly the same sorts of adventures they used to act out on screen, only now it's real.  But second, and even funnier in my opinion, is the humor derived from parodying the entire world of science fiction, and its all to often rabid, religiously devoted fans.It also showcases the darker side of being involved with a pop-culture phenomenon: actors who become so closely identified with their roles, they find they simply can't get work doing anything else.  I imagine the real cast of ""Star Trek"" could feel how close to the mark this hits (and George Reeves, TV's Superman of the 1950s, may have even killed himself in despair at suffering this fate).  The most memorable scene in the movie for me was Alan Rickman's delivery of the line ""By Grabthar's Hammer, I've never seen such savings.""  His rigid posture, hesitant speech, and stony facial expression are hilarious.  He's a classicly trained actor who's become pigeonholed in a role he considers beneath him, and he has been reduced to the humiliation of uttering childish drivel at store openings.  For all that much of the movie is made in the spirit of William Shatner's famous SNL ""get a life"" skit, the movie takes an affectionate look at fans, and two sci-fi geeks even provide indispensible help to the heroes in the end."	4.0	"Hilarious parody of ""Star Trek"" et al."	2007-04-08	6	6	0

My 34 yr old Marine daughter still talks about it 14 years after its release.I watch Galaxy Quest when I need to smile and borrow a warm feeling of friendship from &#34;the crew&#34; at the end of the movie. It is a well done parody of Star Trek in which characters transform to something better than their attitudes and behavior in the beginning.

Most of all, one can identifiy with the characters easily, they all have such diverse traits, it's simple to understand where they're coming from.This is a great sit and down watch it movie when you just need a movie to watch.

It's a bit of a spoof on Star Trek, where fans come to conferences dressed as the characters they love. During one of these conferences, aliens come to earth seeking the &#34;commanders&#34; help. The aliens have been watching the &#34;show&#34; from space and believe that each episode is a &#34;historical document&#34; depicting actual events. Since it has been a decade since &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; last aired, the actors of the show are running low on gigs, and so it is that they agree to help the aliens.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3QNMIZ4X5NGXE	Annie	I loved this movie!  You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this, even though it is a spoof.  It also captured, and somewhat exaggerated the personalities of the actors off-screen.  My absolute favorite scene of all  was when Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver had to run through the  &quot;choppers&quot; and she says something like &quot;Well SCREW  THAT!&quot; and later &quot;Whoever wrote this episode should die!&quot;  There were points where it had me falling off the couch laughing so hard.  Although it is a comedy, there are some very serious and touching moments  in it, like when Jason has to reveal to Mathazar (sp?) his real identity.  And when Saris comes disguised as Fred and begins shooting everyone, and  Jason activates the Omega 13, so that only he knows what's going on. I  think anyone would love this movie and it is a definite buy.	5.0	Hilarious!	2000-05-15	6	2	4

But generally I'd say, this film is about what makes people keep going throughout their jobs everyday, that there is hope, and even meaning in some of what we do, individually.  Maybe we matter, maybe our beliefs matter.  Many of us don't really like our jobs.  Maybe we lose conviction.  The movie approaches these ideas with a notion of hope.  It is a comedy, and most people I know have a good time watching it and like it.  I give it four stars out of five because it is a fun movie and takes itself and the comedy seriously.

Most of them go too far into the ridiculous, and they insult the fans.

You as a Trek fan, (or other sci fi fan) will  enjoy the show and not feel embarrassed or insulted for being a fan of old  Trek.  The show plays on those known behind the scenes problems that  happened between actors on the show... The elevated ego of our favorite  captain, etc.  But again, doesn't get vulgar or rude.Pick this one up,  buy it, you'll love it.  If you're a Trek fan, you'll be laughing out loud.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1LO05OQR2UAG2	"""baronnine"""	Galaxy Quest is a fun romp, not to be taken seriously but loads of fun.  It has a weak, silly plot, but unlike most movies, its real purpose is as a vehicle for the film's absolutely brilliant comedic talent found in all of  the main cast.  The acting is unbelievably good; the person(s) in charge of  casting for the film should have their salary tripled.  Tim Allen is just  perfect, even though I didn't think he'd be a great fit for the part  offhand.  This man can really act.  And although I've been a longtime fan  of Sigourney Weaver, I had no idea she could be this sexy and funny...it's  like seeing a different actress.  Sam Rockwell is side-splittingly  brilliant.  In fact, every one of the main actors does an incredible  job...their performances carry this hilarious movie.  Finally, the DVD  version has some special, very worthwhile extras, particularly those that I  consider to be some of the best parts of the experience: the &quot;Cutting  Room Floor&quot; clips.  I think I laughed more at a couple of them than at  most of the actual film (it's a shame some of them were cut)!  Galaxy Quest  is one of the few movies to convince me of the value of a completely silly  film...I really enjoyed it.  It's good-natured, hilarious, and the  chemistry and talent of the actors and actresses is incredible, probably  some of the best you'll ever see.  Great stuff.	4.0	Hilarious.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2WDSO1DQZ7J03	behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de	&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is one of the funniest recent comedies. It is not only a parody of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, it also makes fun of those who worship the series beyond belief. Yet, the film laughs with them, not about  them.The film is not a spoof in the style of &quot;Airplane&quot;. The  difference is that from the halfway mark on, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; could  almost pass for a real episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The spoof is not  too obvious which makes it all the more funny. The cast is really  fantastic, especially Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are bearly  recognizeable in their roles. Tim Allen is perfect as the Kirk-like  commander. The special effects by ILM are always as convincing as they  should be (watch out for the brilliant effects of the old &quot;Glaxy  Quest&quot;-episodes).If you like the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and  films (like me), it is extremly unlikely that you don't like &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot;. If you don't like &quot;Star Trek&quot;, you will probably  enjoy it, too?	4.0	A must for those who love (or hate) &quot;Star Trek&quot;	2000-04-26	0	0	0

Each person must learn trough trials and tribulations to overcome his or her shortcomings; this requires each to rely on the unique abilities of others to survive. They must realize the dangers in lies and deceit; then they must repent. There is death and destruction. This is a rare instance where revenge is a motive for a good outcome.They could not have picked a better cast. I have the feeling that they were playing themselves. And the chemistry that usually is between one or two people was between them all. Tim Allen plays the Commander that, while relieving himself, comes to the realization that the other actors consider him a joke. When he gets second chances visa-vie the intrusion of an alien war, he invites the other actors to join him on the ""Galaxy Quest"". After you get over the initial shock of Sigourney Weaver's appearance, she makes you feel that she is Gwen DeMarco. She takes the job that life has handed her and turns it in to a positive.Move over Gene Roddenberry.

Isn't it even better when a parody actually salutes the genre parodied and acknowledges the fans?This is a good funny movie. A simple  plot (actors mistaken by an alien race under threat to be real characters.  Same actors help to defeat the bad guys and gain self-belief) and some  wonderful situations (made all the better for being so predictable).The  stereotypes are played wonderfully: a nasty baddy with 'his' dumb cohorts,  Sigourney Weaver playing a token sex symbol so well indeed (compare her  character to Ripley for goodness sake - this is such a change), Tony  Shaloub playing the engineer and Tim Allen playing the Kirk character with  the same integrity and courage that Shatner tried to portray in his own  way.Perhaps best of all is Alan Rickman whose jaded Dr Lazarus is  transformed into a the real TV character after all.Whatever you want  from a movie, this can probably supply and it actually makes the first  series of Star Trek better to watch!	4.0	Never give in, never surrender	2000-06-22	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3DCKK2C60Z2K7	Bill Lincicome	Much, much better than I expected.  Interesting, funny and almost believable film about washed-up actors of a long-cancelled, kitschy space opera being pressed back into service to save real aliens.  The actors are  forced to play the roles of their lives and seek help from their most rabid  fans to save the day.I don't need to go much more into the plot since  it's been covered very well by other reviewers.  Some really good  laugh-out-loud scenes from Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), a  Shakespearean-trained actor whose career has been relegated to a single  catch phrase from the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; show(&quot;By Grapthar's  Hammer...&quot;) and Fred Khan (Tony Shaloub), the dimbulb  actor/&quot;engineer&quot; who falls for one of the kindly aliens.The  film pokes gentle fun at (and homage to) sci-fi conventions and their fans,  especially those of the original Star Trek series.  Very little to offend  anyone, except for the occasional strong language and suggested sexual  situation (and even THAT is funny!)  In a way, this might have been an  interesting vehicle for the original Star Trek series members to tackle  although DeForest Kelley (&quot;Dr. McCoy&quot;) recently passed.  But  perhaps that would have damaged the the thing that keeps those conventions  packed -- the belief somewhere in the back of our minds that these  adventures are real.	4.0	&quot;Uh, good movie, guys -- y'know, F.Y.I.&quot;	2000-06-10	36	32	4

Plus, having read 1000's of SF books (and I'm a female) including Jerry Pournelle's ode to fandom &quot;fallen angels&quot; lets say that I was pretty well versed in the conventions of the genre.I can truly say that Galaxy Quest was funny, exciting, a great parody and satire.  The effects were top-notch as was the acting from normally &quot;A&quot; actors.The end of the movie left me wanting to know what happens next.  Dreamworks could begin its own franchise with careful scripting.  Of course the problem with the next movie is that  the tv actors now know how to operate the ship, so the set-up would have to take that into account.	5.0	When is the Sequel?	2000-12-23	1	1	0

It was with great relief that this movie flew into the Wonderfully Brilliant catagory, Im pleased to inform you that Galaxy Quest is a fun, funny, fantastic film, for families  to watch without the worry of excessive violence (Well theres a little bit,  and it also suggests some form of Xenocide and canibalism!  but aside from  that its pretty tame!)The Actors in my opinion, are all stars, Tim  Allen may have been the head honcho but every actor contributed to the  films overall appeal I particularily enjoyed  Sigorney in the role of the  stereotypical Blonde actress (A far cry from her Ripley persona! )This  movie is pure entertainment, paying a high quality tribute to those earlier  Scifi shows, perhaps letting people who dont normally watch classic Scifi  relics (Yep Star Trek, and lost in space etc! ), a chance to view these  series from a new perspective, whether you enjoy Scifi or not Im quite sure  you will have a smile on your face and a new appreciation for a genre that  has spawned a number of truely corny and whacky shows, SO PLEASE WATCH THIS  MOVIE.

While it also ain't ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Lord Of the Rings,"" it's a fun and sometimes clever takeoff on ""Star Trek"" with a few former inside jokes that will be familiar enough to almost anyone by now, but there's plenty of twists on the old themes to keep any reasonable audience interested.  It takes the simple idea of, ""What if the bickering cast of 'Trek' actually found themselves in a 'Trek' plot in real life?"" and builds on it to the terminally unbelievable conclusion of a plot with so many holes you could fly a few space shuttles through it, but hey, suspending disbelief isn't what this kind of flick is about anyway.

The acting is spot on for this type of movie, and the &#34;spoof&#34; works on multiple levels--the Star Trek TV show is spoofed; the show's cast is spoofed; and the &#34;Trekkie&#34; fan convention circuit is spoofed.  The spoofing is cheesy exactly where it ought to be, but the whole package goes a step beyond and provides something most spoofs never achieve:  characters and a story line that actually draw you in.  It won't take long before--in between chuckles--you'll find that you're actually cheering them on.  5 stars: top notch spoofing and beyond.	5.0	Spoof done right	2014-06-13	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	The Star Trek craze has been very long over do for a dedicated film parody. Thankfully, Galaxy Quest comes as both as refreshing blast of fresh air and a worthy scfi offering in it's own right. Dean Parisot's  imagainative fish out of water story about the surprising redemption of a  group of washed up television actors is both savagely hilarious,  unexpectedly action packed with alarmingly intimidating aliens (created by  the creature effects master Stan Winston (Predator, Terminator, and  Aliens)) and filled to the rim with first class special effects created by  Lucus's Industrial Light and Magic (ILM). Starring the ever resilient Tim  Allen as the confident NSEA's Protector's Commander Peter Quincy Taggert  and his acting alter ego Jason Nesmith, Allen more than elevates the  already clever material to lofty heights with his exaggerated male  attributes and his gift for playing both stooge and straight man. Also  starring a first-rate ditsy Sigourney Weaver (Lieutenant Tawny Madison/Gwen  De Marco) a fabiously droll Alan Rickman (Dr. Lazarus/Alexander Dane), and  side-splitingly understated Tony Shalhoub (Tech Sergeant Chen/ Fred Kwan),  Galaxy Quest overflows with exceptionally clever wit and piercing Star Trek  lampooning that is as uproarious as it is ingenious. Did any Star Trek fan  ever wander about what types of food Quark or Mr. Spock would consume, the  mandatory requirement that the leading male must always remove his shirt to  prove his manlieness, the likliehood that transporters might actually do  harm to non-human life forms, or the fact that most female characters on  the show did nothing more significant than show off their cleavage. Galaxy  Quest is an hysterical assualt on Gene Roddenberry's extremely popular  Sci/Fi franchise. It does to Star Trek what Mel Brooks did to Westerns. As  for the DVD package, the film has a fantastic widescreen transfer, an  interesting  making of documentary, and several outraegous scenes that were  removed from the film's theatrical release. A definite must-buy for any  Sci-Fi fan.	5.0	Guaranteed To Be A Lot More Enjoyable Than a Vulcan Pinch!	2000-05-30	9	9	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A26GI8N3ADWGZ5	"bsy ""bern"""	There are so many bad Sci-Fi films out there producers may want to take note and think about making more Sci-Fi spoofs. They could definitely learn from Galaxy Quest (GQ) which takes true-life scenarios (Sci-Fi shows, actors, fans, & conventions) and create a wonderfully funny movie. What makes GQ succeed are excellent writing, unique storyline, great special effects, and wonderful casting.Six members of a fading Sci-Fi show (a la Star Trek) are relegated to making public appearances and signing autographs at popular conventions. Faced with no careers and never ending lines of GQ maniacs, they are simply playing out all they have left. Lo & behold, a group of actual aliens ask the Captain & crew for their help in battling an evil general bent on their extermination.What results is a fine example of comedy acting from those we never expected, namely Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman. Tim Allen, who plays the Captain, excels at comedy but I was surprised by both Weaver and Rickman's performance. In particular Rickman who plays a talented actor fallen into the typecast dust bin and forced to utter his famous line over and over. Was also impressed by Sam Rockwell playing a one episode cast member who has the unlikely role of being like one of the, Star Trek Red Shirts (expendables).  The aliens are also all well played with their intriguing accents and body gestures especially Enrico Colantoni and Missi Pyle.I was blown away by the special effects from the visuals of space to the spaceships and the evil general Saris. I guess I was expecting something low budget. However, the strength of GQ comes from the writing and acting. Great lines delivered by great actors in a compelling story. Sci-Fi cliches abound and our familiarity makes them all the more hilarious: from the heroic womanizing Captain; the highly intelligent yet under-appreciated alien; and blonde but useless bombshell for the young lads. There is nothing cerebral here but knowing how difficult comedy can be, means that someone was using their brains when they crafted this very funny and uplifting gem.  Brilliant!	4.0	Watch & Learn	2003-08-31	3	3	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AGCOCRW8A56U8	buddyhead	My friends and I couldn't believe how funny this movie was when we saw it recently for the first time, and we all agreed that it was horribly marketed at the time of its initial release.  This is not a cutsie kids' flic like the usual Tim Allen fare (The Santa Clause, etc.)- this is a sophisticated comedy with excellent performances from a talented cast.  Tony Shaloub is excellent; Sam Rockwell is excellent; Allan Rickman steps outside the box in which he's usually cast and gives a hilariously dry, stuffy performance; Tim Allen captures both the hubris and the genuine love of craft that a young William Shatner embodied, before he become a mere satire; all of the aliens (the Thermians) are a riot.  And who knew Sigourney Weaver was hot?  There is as much subtle performance as there is over-the-top slapstick material; basically, GQ offers something for every fan of good comedy.If you are a science fiction fan or can identify with that culture, the movie is an even bigger score.  It perfectly captures the dorkiness of science fiction conventions, and does an excellent job of parodying obsessed fans, without ever making them the object of ridicule.  The special effects rock, too, providing confirmation that the excellent script and story line weren't compromised by slapdash production.I have watched  Galaxy Quest several times by now, and show it any time I have friends over who haven't seen it or even heard of it.  It pleases each and every time.  A totally underrated classic.	5.0	An Instant Addition to Any List of Classic Comedies.	2003-05-19	2	2	0

The concept of having has-been actors mistaken for real space adventurers is pure genius.  I initially thought it was going to  be corny, but I quickly found that the scenes had a good balance between  humor and serious drama.  And the transition between the two worked great.  Not only did the movie successfully show us how ridiculous situations can  get, but it showed us the consequences of bad decisions when we get into  those situations.  The convention scenes suffiently looked like  &quot;DragonCon&quot; to have me laughing.  And the special effects were  surprisingly good.  I ended up watching this movie a couple of times when I  first bought it on DVD.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.	5.0	Surprisingly great movie	2000-07-08	4	4	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1PJZKEZQGREDY	California Dreaming	"I was about five or six when the original ""Star Trek"" series was first on television.  I believe that it aired on Sunday nights -- it was so long ago and I was so young that I'm guessing a bit -- and I used to literally race home to watch it.  I was mesmerized.  Naturally, I was too young to get some of the jokes, but no matter.  At that time it was probably the best SciFi show on television.  Ever.And then along came ""Star Trek:  The Next Generation,"" or perhaps one of the many other follow-up series to the beloved original.  And I pretty much hated the new series and all others that followed.  The characters were just too mechanical, and the acting was just too lame.  And they were all overly melodramatic junk.  I think that the only good Star Trek was the original, and a movie or two might have been good with the original cast.  But probably the best of them all so far:  ""Star Trek"" from 2009 with Chris Pine playing the lead.  He and Zachary Quinto absolutely nailed it, and the rest of the cast wasn't far behind.  I'm looking forward to ""Star Trek into Darkness"" when available on streaming in HD.But in reality, this film might be better than all of these shows combined.  As a matter of fact, I think that it is the best SciFi film ever; yeah better than that one or that one.  ""Star Wars,"" while being groundbreaking, is a snooze fest compared to this stuff.  (Woody Allen had at least one science fiction parody that was hilarious as well, from what I remember.)  ""Galaxy Quest"" makes fun of the original ""Star Trek"" but does it nicely.  Tim Allen plays the Captain Kirk character better than William Shatner ever dreamed possible, while Enrico Colantoni is probably the real star.  Mr. Colantoni gives a sublime performance as an overly kind and nave alien, and he just kills here.What's the theme of the film?  Well, it could be all kinds of things, but how about:  ""Necessity is the Mother of Invention""?  That one will do.  And surprisingly, this film might be the Mother of all SciFi films as well.  Take that, George Lucas!"	5.0	Out of this World!	2013-07-10	4	2	2
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	CrossStar Trek: The Complete Original Series DVD (Seasons 1-3)with the movieAirplane!and what have you got?  A laugh riot.  Most times I think movies stand on their own and should not be sequelized. This movie however is a great parody of SciFi and Star Trek in particular. The cast is superb and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Top notch special effects and music. Directing can't be beat either. This winning combination made it a hit with most audiences, not just SciFi fans. So I ask again why no sequel? For fans of drama only, you may want to see something else since this is excellent comedy done by those that have done marvelous drama as well. THIS IS COMEDY, NOT DRAMA! I would be especially surprised if anyone that has gone to a SciFi convention didn't find this hysterically fun.If by chance you have not seen this movie the story goes that a group of actors/actress that starred in a series like Star Trek are appearing at a SciFi convention. At the convention a group of aliens approaches the Commander played by Tim Allen. He thinks they are just convention goers in costume that want him for a gig at another place. When he finds out they have have modelled their spaceship and lifes after the TV show, life gets weird and very funny. The cast must have had a blast doing these roles. Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub we expect in comedy, but Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman have usually played more dramatic roles. They all do wonderful jobs of making you laugh.The DVD quality is excellent and includes a documentary and deleted scenes you will love. Picture and sound were sharp and no problems with playing. Nice menu interface that matches the theme of the movie. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.Blu-ray CON:  After waiting for six days I cancelled my Blu-ray order of this movie.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2CVP31XTYSZFE	"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom"""	"The most marvelous thing about a gem like ""Galaxy Quest"" is how it manages to skewer - but gentle affection - science fiction conventions, a cheesy and long-canceled television science fiction show, the rabid fans of said show, the long-unemployed actors who played the leads in it, and yet at the same time tell a rather ripping-good yarn incorporating some genuinely moving moments.  (And Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and William Shatner have, at the very least, proved that they are jolly good sports about being ribbed so mercilessly.)A lot of the comedy in Galaxy comes from the casting - and not just that there were top-flight acting talents in the lead roles - it is the actors, playing actors, who are playing characters who are so deliciously off-type from their actor-persona. For instance, Tony Shaloub plays Fred Kwan, (passive and suspiciously substance-addled) who is cast as TSgt. Chen, supremely competent spaceship engineer. Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, over-wrought Shakespearean, passionate about his ""craft"" - who apparently has hated every minute of being the lizardoid alien, Doctor Lazarus.  Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco - grounded and rather level-headed - is the sexpot Lt. Madison, the communications officer who apparently went through episode after episode repeating whatever the computer told her.  And Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith - self-centered and defiantly not the heroic type - is playing Captain Peter Quincy Taggart, of the NSEA Protector, who never gives up, and never abandons his crew. Along with Daryl Mitchell, as the grown-up kid actor Tommy Weber, once the helmsman Laredo, and Guy (Sam Rockwell), who had a bit part in a single episode, and ""died"" in true red-shirt Enterprise crewman fashion - all of them are transported into space, onto a ship which in every detail is the NSEA Protector. To their astonishment and horror, they are being asked to be the characters they only played, on behalf of the Thermians. The Thermians are a race of aliens who have unfortunately run afoul of a particularly brutal enemy, Sarris and his evil minions. The NSEA Protector is their last, best hope. Alas, although technologically sophisticated, the poor Thermians know not of story-telling and entertainment. And that's the plot - of the actors being given a chance to be what they only appeared to be, and the leader of the Thermians, Malthezar becoming what he wants to be - an inspiring leader. It's a movie that bears watching again, and again.Of the extras on this release, the funniest are the omitted scenes - Doctor Lazarus being given a tour of his quarters on board the Protector by the hospitable Thermians is hysterically funny. According to the commentary, some thought was given to showing the Thermian's idea of the other characters' quarters as well - which would have been also terrifically funny, but there are so many other comic scenes, lines and throw-away-bits that omission of that gag is hardly noticed. The other notable feature is a version of the movie entirely in the Thermian language. A little of that bit goes a very long way."	5.0	Bears Watching Again and Again	2010-03-20	0	0	0

""Galaxy Quest"" takes one of the weirdest phenomenon's in the last twenty  years, that of the Trekkie and the hugely popular Trekkie Conventions, and  plays it for all it's worth.Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith, and out of  work former star of a long since cancelled television show called ""Galaxy  Quest"". He and his fellow co-stars spend their time going form town to town  appearing at conventions and department store Grand Openings in character.  While all of the other cast members loathe the obvious stereotypes they  have associated with, Nesmith relishes his role of Commander Taggert, the  swashbuckling William Shatner-esque leader of the NSEA Protector.  Overhearing a restroom conversation, Nesmith learns exactly how his fellow  cast members really feel about him, and the ridiculous role he plays day in  and day out.Now, enter the Thermians, an advanced alien race, which has  somehow intercepted transmissions of the ""Galaxy Quest"" television show.  Searching for a cultural direction, the Thermian people have modeled their  society after the ""Historical Documents"" featuring Jason Nesmith and his  crew. The Thermian leader, Mathesar, comes to earth to convince the  courageous Commander Taggert to come back with them and fight their dreaded  enemy Sarris (and evil green creature bent on the destruction of the  Thermians). Nesmith unwittingly accepts the challenge thinking it is  another convention type gag, and what follows is a hilarious romp through  outer space where every Star trek law is enforced with side splitting  results:  1. The cast member with no last name always dies in the first  fifteen minutes 2. The beautiful female lead has no real job aboard the  ship 3. The captain always takes his shirt off at least once every episode  4. The hero always saves the day with one second to spare.Galaxy Quest  is well written and well acted by a great cast. Alan Rickman is hilarious  as the frustrated thespian stuck under layers of make-up. Sigourney Weaver  as the buxom blonde without a hair out of place. Tony Shaloub as the laid  back engineer. Daryl Mitchell plays the former child actor still milking  his one starring role. But I think Sam Rockwell steals some of the funniest  scenes as Guy Fleegman. Guy once played crewman #6 in one episode of the  show, and spends his time trying to horn in on the gangs convention  popularity.All in all, this is a terrific movie, and one worth owning.  If you're worried about missing some of the subtle jokes because you are  not a Star Trek fan, don't worry, because the jokes aren't that subtle."	4.0	Not a Trek Fan? No Problem!	2000-06-26	0	0	0

Things got very interesting once the cast and crew were in space. The BD is leagues better than the DVD in clarity; the planets and ships are spectacular in Bluray.

I can here everything perfectly; there are no issues with the vocals fading in and out, or the need for subtitles.Highly recommended, very entertaining and a great addition to your movie library.	5.0	Great movie and great Bluray!	2010-07-20	11	11	0

(Great article on this movie is in Wickepedia.) I'm also a fan of the main stars in this film--it's nice to see them in something other than the TV series we were used to seeing them in.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A25ZVI6RH1KA5L	"cookieman108 ""cookieman108"""	I remember seeing this movie when it came out, and I thought it was pretty funny, but seeing it again recently, I found myself liking it more than I did the first time.  The story is about the actors from a short lived sci-fi show and what they do to earn a living, surviving on faded fame.  Amid the sci-fi conventions, store grand openings, and internal squabbles, they suddenly find themselves thrust into senario straight out of their old TV show.  It seems a distance race of aliens has intercepted television transmissions from Earth and regards what they see as 'historical documents'.  They mold their lives and civilization around this old sci-fi show, right down to creating an exact replica of the space ship from the show.  As it turns out, the aliens are in serious trouble and need the assistance of the Galaxy Quest members to help them deal with another, hostile alien race.Watching the actors now having to deal with the reality of the situation, as it were, is extremely funny.  All do a great job, but my favorite is Sam Rockwell's character, Guy.  He was the actor who was one episode and credited as 'Crewman Number 6'.  In his episode, he died in a horrible fashion, and quick enough as to never have gotten a full character name.  With this extremely minor claim to fame, he milks it for all it's worth, following the mainstay actors around on their convention and store opening circuit, like a parasitic organism hanging tenously on to the best thing he has going for him.  Once the fantasy becomes reality, he provides some of the most memorable moments with his constant fears that he will die in some horrible manner due to the fact that he was such a minor character on the original show.  My favorite lines in the movie comes from his character when he's looking at a tatical display and they are about to be attacked by an enemy ship...Guy Fleegman: Hey guys, there's a red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy.Jason Nesmith: What?Guy Fleegman: Red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy. I think we're the green-thingy.Anyway, I think this movie did a great job in having fun with the whole 'Star Trek' fans while not ripping them to shreds.  This movie has a tendancy to grow on you, with its humor and the special effects are quite good.	4.0	By Grabthars hammer... you shall be avenged!	2003-07-07	1	1	0

As a long standing Trekker (no conferences but every ep. of every show on tape) there  are lots of gags and humor that will hit home and not offend.Secondly  - if you're not a Trekker but you are a Tim Allen fan then get it.  Not  only is the humor classic and timeless you'll be actually impressed with  Tim consistent character and the quality of the actual storyline.  Yes it  has a storyline - and for a parody of many different Sci-Fi series the  story line is internally consistent and actually pretty good.As for  the rest of the cast Sigourney Weaver gets to play a completely different  SciFi role as a blonde &quot;something&quot; I'm not exactly sure what her  role was but she was great in it. Alan Rickman does a great wounded  (mentally) actor in his twilight, Daryl Mitchell (ex. Veronica's Closet)  get to show he can do something else and host of other people get to be  some very funny aliens.By the way, you will need to watch it at least  twice so that you can get all the lines you missed the first time around.	5.0	Great Parody and Tim A. to boot!	2000-07-27	2	1	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	This is a very funny movie and holds up very well under repeated viewings.  I think it is Tim Allen's best work. Alan Rickman is also great as the great stage actor wannabe stuck in rubber makeup repeating a signature line he hates.  Sigourney Weaver plays against type as the show's bubble headed computer-repeating eye candy.  She does this very well.  Tony Shaloub brings his special gift for characterization to this very laid back Tech Sgt Chen.  His performance is one of the most fun in the film.This was the movie I first noticed Sam Rockwell and his role as Guy Fleegman is memorable because it is done so perfectly.  The Thermians are wonderfully done aliens who believe the TV signals they picked up were historical documents and set about making the fake sets and space ships into real space ships and transporters.What a cool idea.  Enrico Colantoni brings surprising depth to Mathesar, who could have been a simple cartoon.  The same is true for Patrick Breen, Missi Pyle, and Jed Rees.  Robin Sacs goes over the top as Sarris and that is exactly what is required for ole lobster head.  And Jeremy Howard brings Kyle to life as a teen who is smart enough to know more about the Galaxy Quest show than the people who made it, but is still kid enough to accept the show almost as the Thermians do.I just have to say that I find every scene in this movie a delight, including the continuity problems and plot flaws, just like the show it is parodying.  I mean, who cares when you are having this much fun.	5.0	On, Teb.  On!	2003-08-31	4	4	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AJTASFDVUZKJI	Craig  S Gilbertson	Galaxy Quest manages to be a tribute to and a good natured but very funny spoof of the original Star Trek television series, its cast and fans.The Premise is that for the past 17 years since their show was cancelled  the cast of a short lived science fiction series has been making a living  by making guest appearances at science fiction conventions.The cast  members including Tim Allen , Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman are  attending yet another convention when they are approached about a new gig  by a group of space aliens. The Aliens have intercepted the television  signals from the old show and mistook them for &quot;historical  documents&quot; and think the cast members are heros who can save them from  an evil foe.  The confusion and fun take off from there.  The Aliens (who  are an engaging lot) have constructed an exact working copy of the ship  from the series &quot;The Protector&quot; , duplicating even the parts they  didn't understand or need often with hilarious results. The evil adversary  awaits them and their varied efforts to do good and/or survive result in a  surprising good mix of adventure, comedy and some touching moments wrapped  up with a rousing ST type ending.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2OSERGXBYMPJ0	C. T. Mikesell	"Sometimes you're taking a chance when the only description in the review on the front of a DVD box is the single word, ""Funny."" Is it ""ha-ha"" funny or ""my soda tastes funny, try it"" funny? Fortunately Galaxy Quest delivers more than great laughs, it has well-done special effects, good writing and characterization, and acting that's well above average. Tim Allen does a good job of distancing himself from the Home Improvement Tool-Man character, while Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman portray their characters with a vulnerability they don't usually show in their more commercial work. Tony Shaloub is excellent as always.Plot-wise, Galaxy Quest is little more than ""The Three Amigos in Space"" (of course, Star Trek was pitched as &quot;Wagon Train in Space,&quot; so perhaps the similarity is apropos). It does enough new and differently with the premise, however, to make this a good film in its own right. The inclusion of the Sci-Fi convention fanboys in the climactic scene was hilarious, and at the same time managed to ring true. Cmdr. P.Q. Taggart, having to fight the twin El Guapos of the alien, Sarris, and egomania - well, that's one more El Guapo than The Three Amigos had, isn't it?There are a few bonuses on the DVD, but an actor and/or director commentary would have been nice, too. The Thermian audio track is of the native Thermian squeaking variety, not the mis-inflected English spoken most frequently in the film. Usually deleted scenes are cut for a reason: they're not very good. Several of the extra scenes on the DVD, however, could have been included in the final release without any problem (one clears up a continuity problem involving Sigourney Weaver's uniform zipper). The ""making-of"" documentary is nice. The cast/crew bios are good and provide a nice little Easter Egg Hunt, as well.I really enjoyed this movie. More than just funny, it's clever and witty, too. If the DVD packaging is ever redesigned, that's three words they can put on the cover. Check it out."	5.0	&quot;That Was a Hell of a Thing&quot;	2004-01-05	3	3	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"When Galaxy Quest was released in 2000, it was a modest success but it certainly didn't light the world on fire. Over the years, it has quietly amassed something of a cult following who delight in the film's affectionately satirical jabs at the Star Trek franchise and its fans, specifically the first incarnation with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. With this new Deluxe Edition DVD, it is about time for Galaxy Quest to be revisited and re-evaluated.""Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest"" is a retrospective making of featurette that has key cast and crew members reminiscing about the experience of working on the film. They take us through its origins and we see how the original concept was quite different but was tweaked over time. In a nice touch, the main cast members return and tell all kinds of filming anecdotes, clearly looking back at this project with genuine affection.""Never Give Up, Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector"" takes a look at the cast of Galaxy Quest and they talk about how they approached their respective roles. The filmmakers talk about why they cast the actors that are in the film and everyone dishes more wonderful stories.""By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects"" takes a look at the film's snazzy visual effects. They had Stan Winston do the aliens while ILM do the special effects. Winston speaks about his creations in archival footage.""Alien School: Creating the Thermian Race"" examines the alien race that enlists the help of the Galaxy Quest crew. Actor Enrico Colantoni talks about how he came up with his character's voice.""Actors in Space"" takes a look at how the cast made fun of their profession and their character archetypes.""Sigourney Weaver Raps"" features a taped message that she made for her agent's birthday where the veteran actress raps with help from her fellow castmates.Also included are eight deleted scenes that feature more with Fred Kwan as he tours the ship's engineering section with his Zen-like calmness. There is a scene where the cast are shown their quarters based on their characters' personalities from the show. And we also get more of them bickering among each other on the alien planet.""Thermian Audio Track"" allows you to watch the entire film dubbed in the alien language, which is actually pretty funny but I don't know if you would ever watch it more than once.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer."	5.0	Deluxe Edition Contains Extras Worth the Double Dip!	2009-05-11	17	17	0

There's many humorous references to Star Trek, but beyond that I enjoyed the clever integration  of dry wit, 70s-style SciFi camp, and moments of wackyness.  For instance,  the Thermian's mannerisms seem clearly inspired by Andy Kaufman, with a  little Al Gore stiffness thrown in.  A wonderfully silly movie that I  don't hesitate to recommend.	4.0	SciFi Laughs at Itself	2000-05-10	1	0	1

But I was surprised to see that my 7-year old son (who has never seen Trek and only saw the latest Star Wars)  absolutely loves it too. He doesn't realize it's a spoof! So, I guess it  works as a straight adventure as well. There are a few mildly suggestive  jokes (and Sigourney Weaver's cleavage) but generally it's fine for kids  even if they don't understand the levels of parody.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	`Galaxy Quest' is in all actuality a decent spoof on the `Star Trek' era.  In the film a group of washed up actors from the TV series `Galaxy Quest' are asked to help a group of aliens led by Mathesar (Colantoni) defend their people against the evil Sarris (Sachs).  In an attempt to have some `fun' Jason (Allen), the cocky jerk who was once the captain of their `ship' decides to agree and reluctantly the rest of the cast does too.  Along the way they learn to trust and care about one another, and they also get themselves in some pretty corny, yet funny, situations.  What makes this film even better than just a spoof of a series is that it spoofs a phenomenon by having our characters signing autographs at `Galaxy Quest Conventions' where `trekie' type fans have gathered, and in the end they must rely on a group of these fans to save them from peril.  If you want a good time full of laughs then `Galaxy Quest' is the ride for you.  The cast, including Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Sam Rockwell, Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell are great in their roles and add much needed comic relief.  All in all it's a great attempt at a parody.	4.0	A quest worth taking...	2006-10-05	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3TXXGPC68Y4WV	"""dan1701"""	Have you ever wondered what would happen if Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and the cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot; actually wound up on the U.S.S. Enterprise?  (There actually was a short story written about just that  subject, but that's for another time.)  That's the premise of &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot;, absolutely the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.  The  basic plot:  washed-up actors from a cancelled science fiction TV show are  enlisted by aliens to help them in their fight against a genocidal  aggressor.  Tim Allen, who now has played two space cadets (&quot;Buzz  Lightyear&quot;), gives an excellent turn as Jason Nesmith, the  Shatner-esque star of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; who chews the scenery at  every opportunity.  Allen brought a wonderful mixture of camp and honesty  to the role of an actor who actually believed himself to be &quot;the  star&quot; -- until overhearing a conversation that made him doubt his star  status, especially among his friends.  Alan Rickman is funny as the actor  Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus, and I can just imagine  Leonard Nimoy saying, &quot;If I have to say 'live long and prosper' one  more time, I'll puke!&quot;  That is the attitude Rickman brings to the  role, and he pulls it off convincingly.  Probably the most stunning casting  decision was Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lt. Tawny (where  did they get that name?) Madison.  It's hard to play a blonde bimbo,  especially when you're an intelligent actress.  Weaver gives a very  intelligent performance as the intelligent actress whose main assets are  her breasts, and her only job is to parrot the ship's computer.  &quot;Look, I have one job on this lousy ship, it's stupid, but I'm gonna  do it!  Okay?&quot;  The rest of the cast gives excellent, believable  performances, and Sam Rockwell (&quot;Crewman No. 6&quot;) almost steals  the show.  Invite your Trekker friends over to see it...it's worth watching  again and again.	5.0	&quot;Never give up ... never surrender!&quot;	2000-06-22	3	3	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AZT4G96MRIRB2	Dan Cooper	I'm not sure if it's me or not but it seems to me on the eve of the release of &quot;Evolution&quot; that there seems to be a resurrgence of sci-fi comedys in the vein of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, I.E. &quot;Men In Black&quot; and the reviewed movie here &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;.  I had missed the theatrical release of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; with little interest in the movie.  However I am a fan of the genre and when it came out on DVD in early May of 2000 I decided I would give it a chance and was pleasently surprised.Shows Like Star Trek and it's numerous offsprings have created a wealth of pop culture arguably as much if not more than &quot;Star Wars&quot;  and Galaxy Quest takes these items and runs with them.  The actors themselves as washed up have beens squelching off of a show which not only was cancelled 20 odd years ago but whose mainstream popularity long but died.  Its rather depressing.  However more than lively as the movie picks up with a plotline that would make any Star Trek Hack writer proud as the actors are confused for their characters by aliens who the actors mistake for fanatical fans.  I make it a bit more confusing than it actually is.  The characters are more than fleshed out in the beginning of the movie and are very likeable.The only problem I have with this movie is that some of the jokes are a bit to much of an in joke...take for istance the &quot;red shirt&quot;, which any Star Trek fan can tell you is a character without a last name who is expendable and who usually dies within the first few minutes of the show.  I found that bit hilarious however wondering if other family audiences , which this film is geared for, would understand it.  However with that being said I do belive the film acomplishes it's goals and hopefully more films like it will follow.	4.0	A grand Tradition	2001-06-06	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	I've never really been a fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver, so I put off watching this movie for a good while.  I kept hearing and reading about how funny it was, though, so I finally gave in and watched it.  The stories I heard are true because this is really an excellent comedy.  I myself have some natural tendencies toward the type of TV show fans being lampooned in jest here, but we geeks have an amazing quality of laughing at ourselves when what we are seeing is genuinely funny.  The idea is actually just short of brilliant; take the cast of a Star Trek-like science-fiction show cancelled twenty years ago and put them in a situation wherein they have to become the characters they played in order to save themselves and an entire civilization.  The script is excellent, introducing great characterizations of the characters early on, keeping the action and comedy coming fast and furious, and maintaining the comedy at a witty and fresh level.Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith who plays Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, an obviously Shatner-inspired character who continues to hog all of the spotlight garnered from the old Galaxy Quest series, not realizing that his fellow cast members hold him in some disdain for his egomaniacal antics.  A surprisingly blonde and very funny Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarcol who plays Lt. Tawny Madison, and she has always been unhappy about the fact her character on the show was never taken seriously.  Then there is Alan Rickman's character Alexander Dane who plays the reptilian-human Dr. Lazarus; this formerly successful British &quot;real actor&quot; despises his rubber-headed character and constantly laments the depths to which his previously distinguished career has sunk.  The other characters are also great: the fairly weird Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) who plays Tech. Sgt. Chen, former boy actor Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) who plays Lt. Laredo, and even Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), better known as the expendable character whose lack of a last name makes him expect to meet death around every corner.  You absolutely have to love the odd alien Thermians who seek the help of Commander Taggart in a last ditch effort to save their people and culture from a ruthless menace, believing all of the Galaxy Quest shows they intercepted in space to be actual historical documents of the bravest ship's crew to travel the universe.The new adventures of the crew of the NSEA Protector, with the characters pretending to be the heroes they aren't, are rollicking good times interlaced with plenty of comedy and ruminations as to how our heroes ended up in this kind of unbelievable situation.  There are even a couple of poignant moments inserted into the story which complement the comedy quite well and provide further insight into characters who, quite impressively, never really become total parodies of themselves.  The special effects are also excellent, and that is another thing that Galaxy Quest has going for it.  In this type of comedy, the special effects would seem to be of secondary importance, so their impressiveness serves to keep the storyline from sinking into campiness.  Industrial Light and Magic handled all of the space scenes and some of the alien monsters, and the preeminent Stan Winston created some incredible aliens and monsters to fill this outrageous universe.  The DVD only makes a great movie even better, throwing in such extras as an enjoyably informative making-of featurette and a number of deleted scenes.You don't have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy Galaxy Quest, although it will probably resonate more with those familiar with the Trek-like nature of the subject matter.  Underneath the laughs and thrills hides a decidedly human story that inspires as it entertains, and this kind of quality comedy should be easily recognized and enjoyed by just about everyone.  It would have been so easy to turn this kind of movie into something really silly if not insulting, but Galaxy Quest is nothing short of a brilliantly made comedy.	5.0	By Grabthar's hammer, this is a funny movie	2003-09-14	6	6	0

I'm not too enamoured of the actors involved either, although Sam Rockwell is splendid as the Everyman guiding us through the tricky switches between 'fantasy' and 'reality'.But 'Quest' is available to more than just Trekkies or Tim Allen admirers.  The (presumably) intentionally tacky set-designs yield some real flourishes (the berillium (sic?) island; the nightmarish climax).  Best of all for those who felt cheated by the 'Borges' comparisons thrown at 'Being John Malkovich', is a truly vertiginous conflation of time, narrative and identity, so that by the end, yuo're about as close to the Garden of Forking Paths as you'll ever be in Hollywood.	3.0	Mind-boggling.	2001-08-22	8	1	7

The aliens are hilarious...the plot is so funny...a big part of it is the cheese factor which is intentional.  We just love this movie.The plot plays off a typical Star Trek episode...portraying the actors as they 'really are'...and an alien civilization which picks up the broadcasts and thinks they are 'historical documents'.  This starts the action...and it really gets funnier and funnier as it goes along.  Tim Allen is perfect for the lead role...and S. Weaver is  great side kick...so many great one liners in this movie...my wife and I think it's one of the best comedies we own.I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this one.	5.0	So funny...you gotta see this..about once a year	2006-04-17	5	5	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1CK4J7YRAUQ53	"David Foughty ""DLF"""	"As I watched the dvd for the movie ""Galaxy Quest,"" I thought how surprised I was to have enjoyed what seemed as a cheesy family spoof. But the film turned to be an action adventure with some really hilarious moments. I loved the film. It has qualities of a successful science fiction drama, but also contains a variety of comical characters that had my whole family overwhelmed in laughter. ""Galaxy Quest"" is right up there with ""Toy Story"" in merit, it entertains adults and children alike, standing out as one of the year's best family films.The story details the adventures of a canceled television science fiction fantasy cast, similar in content to ""Star Trek."" ""Galaxy Quest"" is the name of the program. In their years, the stars, including Jason Nesmith, Gwen DeMarco, Fred Kwan, Alexander Dane, and Tommy Webber, were some of the biggest, most popular names in TV. Now, their means of making a living is signing fans' autographs for a price and being cast in amateur presentations.There is very detailed character development here. The characters are wonderfully cast and brilliantly portrayed. Unfortunately, most family films don't contain the patience for such necessary material. We bond with these characters; they are likable, funny, energetic and independent. These individuals are the key of success to this kind of movie.The real plot begins when strange people come to Jason beging for him to save their existence from a powerful evil force who wishes to wipe them out of the universe forever. Naturally, at first our television star is skeptical, but when the strange people turn out to be humble aliens and transport Jason to their spaceship, he realizes this is something serious. The aliens begin to explain that they think he and his ""Galaxy Quest"" team are the only people in the universe who can save their race. He rushes to the members of his old cast and tries to justify his experience. He says that there are extraterrestrial creatures who require the help of their ""Galaxy Quest"" characters. None of his friends believe him, but once again give in when they find themselves transported off earth, onto the creature's spaceship. Of course, the aliens don't realize that their hopeful heroes are simply out of work actors, but who needs to tell them? So it is up to Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, Lt. Tawny Madison, Tech Sergeant Chen, Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck, and Lt. Laredo to save the day for our innocent and haunted alien life forms.""Galaxy Quest"" is a slapstick comedy that is smart, and does not go over the edge with its humorous material. It leaves room for several other essential elements such as happiness, romance, honesty, excitement, and contains a dramatic purpose. The story is very original, and contains a firm theme of action in its premise. It also has lots of outstanding visual effects and sight gags that are effective and interesting to watch.Although the film gets a little off-track near the end, ""Galaxy Quest"" is still high energy laughs audiences will come to the theater expecting. This is one of the most victorious movies of this year in its execution of the script because we anticipate what we are going to view is a silly comic spoof. Even though parts of the film fit that definition, in the end we end up with a lot more than that."	5.0	Great Movie Superb Cast!	2010-07-16	1	1	0

For the rest of us, it's a pretty good exploration of what actors might owe, both to their audiences and the  characters they play.The shtick of this movie is that former actor Jason  Nesmith (Tim Allen) and the rest of the cast of the fictional sci-fi show  &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are mistaken for an actual starship crew by  extraterrestrials. But the slight plot fades in importance to seeing Allen,  Sigourney Weaver shift from playing actors to playing their  characters.It's worth watching, and could be enjoyably paired up with  &quot;Wes Craven's New Nightmare&quot; for another take on the same theme.

It kinda smells like a spoof movie but eventually it gets interesting. Sigourney is a very different character and seemed to have developed her body parts too. If you like sci fi with comedy & somewhat silly humor it's a good one.

The star-studded, ironic (Tim Allen (voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Sigourney Weaver (from the ""Alien"" movies) lead the way) and burnt-out cast of the fictional sci-fi TV show ""Galaxy Quest"" find themselves on a real-life mission when aliens visit the earth. The hambone acting skills and vague familiarity with a spaceship set that work so well on TV help the crew save the . . . well I'll leave it to you to find out. But Star Trek fans won't be offended as there's hardly even a ""stun"" setting in ""Galaxy Quest's"" satirical ray gun.

The writing is first-class, essential for any good film.  But the talented cast - Alan Rickman, Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell and surprise standout, Enrico Colantoni as the lead Thermian - wring every laugh and, yes, every poignant moment out of the script and its unlikely situations.  All Star Trek fans should love it for its knowing and affectionate spoof of the shows and sci-fi conventions.  But lovers of good writing, fine acting and comedy in general should enjoy this movie too.The extras are a treat, lots of interviews revealing interesting tidbits, like the way Enrico Colantoni developed the Thermian way of speaking and moving which was then taken up by the other actors playing the aliens.  It was funny to learn too that Sigourney Weaver had to fight to get her part because the filmmakers didn't want anyone who had actually done sci-fi!  As she says, who better to spoof the genre than someone who's been there and done that?  (She's the one whose character has ""one dumb job"" to do in the TV show the Thermians think is a documentary).This film, and particularly the deluxe edition DVD, are highly recommended for a good time."	4.0	"""I've got one dumb job to do on this show, and I'm doing it""!"	2009-10-04	0	0	0

I always love Alan Rickman, so no surprise, he is wonderful as the on-board alien. And Tony Shaloub is priceless too. Each time I watch this movie, I pick up something new.

And maybe  the Trekkies in the cinema laughed a little more than I did, but believe me  - there were plenty of laughs for me, too. The story is very funny, and the  acting is OK, too - the actors play the parts of actors, sick and tired of  their jobs, very convincingly. I bet that no-one were sick or tired taking  part in Galaxy Quest.

I absolutely loathe Star Trek, and I thought this would be just as awful. But once it came out, I kept reading review  after review that was so positive, that I just had to go and see it.  (Besides, there wasn't much else too choose from at the time.) But I tell  you what, I was so pleasently suprised on how much I walked away liking  this movie. It's sweet natured and good hearted; something you don't get  every day. Also I was privy to the fact that it was a great film I could  take my little sister too, and not have too worry about content.  So all you trekkies out there, I hope you had a great time at this film  that honors you; but more importantly, to all those non-trekkies out there,  you should open your minds and give this film a chance. There is plenty of  subtle comedy in it that I believe takes multiple viewings to get. But I  know you will love it. I know I did, and I am hard to please.	5.0	1999's Big Suprise	2000-04-30	12	11	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"In 1999, ""Galaxy Quest"" was a film that surprised many sci fi fans when it was released to theaters.  At first, many people were not sure if it would be a parody to ""STAR TREK"" but in the end, the film was actually paying homage to the popular television series.The film is directed by television director David Parisot (who directed shows such as ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", ""Monk"", ""ER"" and many other series) and is based on a story by David Howard and a screenplay co-written with Ric McElvin (""Men in Black II"" , ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" and ""Addicted to Love"", etc.).The film has received praise from Star Trek alumni such as George Takei, Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart and Will Wheaton and has received nearly all positive reviews from film critics upon its release in theaters back in 1999.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition"" has been digitally remastered for this DELUXE EDITION/10th Year release.  I haven't done any comparisons to my original 2000 DVD version of the film but I could tell by watching it, scenes like the mission obtain Beryllium, this would shine on Blu-ray.  But for now, on DVD the colors look vibrant with the Earth tone colors and blue skies make things absolutely beautiful.  Video is presented in widescreen.  So, overall, for a DVD release, the picture quality and the new remastering looked great.As for the audio, audio is presented ala English 5.1 Surround (as well as Spanish 5.1 Surround) and comes with a Thermian 2.0 Surround track.  I will say that watching this film again, I heard a good number special effects from the various channels.  Audio sounds very good, I was noticing small details such as the damaged spaceship, the Protector trying to use its remaining engines to move the ship and hearing it trying to move in space on your front channel and rear channels speakers.  I don't recall hearing those small details back in 2000.  I felt the audio seemed cleaner and clearer in this deluxe edition.With a new digital remaster for the DVD coinciding with the 10th Anniversary of the film's release, I can only hope that we get a 1080p High Definition transfer with lossless audio.  Knock on wood, I hope there will be a Blu-ray release coming soon!But for now, compared to the original DVD release, this is the better DVD version to own for now in terms of picture and audio quality.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition"" comes with newer special features to celebrate the film's 10th Anniversary.  The original DVD released in 2000 had special DVD Easter Eggs (related to the Omega 13) and a ""On Location in Space"" featurette that are not included on this deluxe edition, so you may not want to throw out your original 2000 DVD.  But this Deluxe Edition comes with newer features recently created in 2009 and are very enjoyable.* Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest - (18:14) A new featurette with recent interviews with Dean Parisot (Director), Bob Gordon (Screenwriter) and David Howard (screenwriter).  Also, new interviews with the cast of ""Galaxy Quest"".  A fun and informative featurette of how the film came about, how the talent felt about being at a science fiction convention and being a bit weirded out by the experience and also certain segments that play homage to ""Star Trek"".* Never Give Up. Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector - (23:25) This featurette goes into the casting of ""Galaxy Quest"".  The cast is interviewed and give their thoughts of their character and what they remember during the filming.  Interesting tidbits of Sigourney Weaver being in character once she had the blonde wig and attracting a lot of eyes.  How Alan Rickman was very cool and calm. Tim Allen and Daryl Mitchell always having fun on the set and really interesting situations that happened during the filming of ""Galaxy Quest"".* By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects - (7:03) How popular Stan Winston worked on special effects for the alien monsters and Industrial Light and Magic working on the CG effects.  How the camera work for ""Galaxy Quest"" was trying to recapture that Star Trek original series cinematography feel and much more!* Alien School - Creating the Thermian Race - (5:23) How Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar) came up with the Thermian speech from vocal training they did at Yale.  How during ""alien school"", they would have to learn how to walk and move.* Actors in Space - (6:11) In this segment, we learn how being in a popular series, an actor can get pigeonholed.  Tim Allen talks about people even today thinking he's Tim Taylor of ""Home Improvement"", Justin Long talking about despite his film work, he's still looked as ""The Mac Guy"", Daryl Mitchell known for his work on ""House Party"" and more.* Sigourney Weaver Raps - (1:59) Sigourney Weaver's agent's birthday was coming up, so Sigourney asked Daryl Mitchell to help her create a rap for Sam Cohn and together with Sam Rockwell, Missi Pyle, Jed Rees, the five created a music video as a birthday present.* Additional Scenes: Deleted Scenes (Used on 2000 release) - A total of eight deleted scenes.  Some of these features include commentary by the talent or Director Dean Parisot and David Howard.* Thermian Audio Track - An audio track featured completely in Thermian.  Personally, even when this was on the original 2000 DVD, has anyone ever watched the film completely in Thermian?* Theatrical Trailer (Used on 2000 release) - (1:54) Original theatrical trailer.The slip cover has a front cover that features Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen in character, standing cool and collected (the image shown above on this review) and when you shift the front of the cover slightly, it shows the three firing their weapons.JUDGMENT CALL:""Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition"" is definitely a wonderful 10th Anniversary release.I have never grown tired of this film and for any Star Trek fan or science fiction fan, you can't help but enjoy and laugh and be thoroughly entertained by the various talent and the overall wackiness of the storyline.The new special features is what makes this film worth buying again on DVD.  To have everyone return for an interview and talk about their love for the film and how well it was received and how it has become a sci-fi classic was just fun to watch.  And the behind-the-scenes tidbits you learn about the shenanigans that went behind-the-scenes to the actual creation of the film, was also informative and entertaining.If there is one thing that I can hope for, that would be a high definition Blu-ray release of this film.  With its 10th Anniversary, I was a bit surprised that only a new DVD was announced at this time.  But with the film now receiving a new digital remastering, I can only hope for a HD 1080p transfer and lossless audio, to me, that would be the icing on the cake.But overall, this new deluxe edition was just fantastic and if you are a big fan of ""Galaxy Quest"", on DVD, this is the definitive version to own.

Why do I like this movie so much?Because it believes in itself and its ability to entertain.  Because the cast and crew obviously had a blast making this thing.  And because, yes, I'm a closet Trek fan, and this is a Trek movie in disguise.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does play within the confines of its story:  it's a movie about the GalaxyQuest actors, not GalaxyQuest: The Motion Picture.  There are no hokey, cheesy performances except in the play within the play--the GalaxyQuest TV series.  When Taggart shouts out his signature line, ""Never give up!  Never surrender!"" you can almost hear The Voice of Kirk.Life imitates ""art"" as the crew attempt to save the Thermians for real:  Jason's shirt comes off as soon as he's left alone on the planet (ever notice how often the Trek Captains end up fighting evil all by themselves?), Gwen ends up repeating the computer and somehow tears open her uniform just enough to show her cleavage for the rest of the adventure, Alexander saves the Thermians from suffocation only to see credit go to Jason...nearly every event has a counterpart in their TV series.  It's as though they played out the TV scripts so many times that the patterns infected the real world.I don't see any indication of a sequel to this one in the offing: with the parallel between real and fictional resolved at story's end, there's no real room for one.But it sure would be sweet to see the GalaxyQuest crew again."	4.0	"This movie defines ""Guilty Pleasure."""	2002-03-18	5	5	0

It's an age old joke, the nerd in his or her basement with a 'set' of their favorite TV show or movie, dressed in a homemade costume, recreating or living their own fantasy in the fantasy world. Well, Galaxy Quest takes it a good bit further.Galaxy Quest starts where all good SciFi fans would be most suited: a SciFi convention, dedicated to a TV show cancelled years ago, but living on through its fans. Here, the actors, played by Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell, settled into their old roles for the fans. Seemingly unable to gain any other line of work, Conventions and store openings are their only way to get by.After a rude awakening by some hecklers, Tim Allen explodes over a group of young fans questions and heads home to drink it off. The next morning starts the real adventure: aliens come calling for help. Allen as Jason Nesmith as Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggert is transported to the real NSEA Protector, as envisioned by the Thermians, lead by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni. A hung over Nesmith takes everything to be exquisite set pieces and negotiates with the enemy.From here, the movie picks up as Nesmith returns to Earth to seek out his fellow actors, including the show's own Red Shirt who hitches along, to show them the real thing. Watching this movie can be like looking into a mirror for us geeks. You can either laugh because you've either seen or done or you can cringe because you've either seen it or done it.True to form, the movie runs almost entirely like you'd expect an episode to run. Ship fights (with the actors being thrown about the bridge), away missions, transporter accidents (""And exploded.""), and alien doppelgangers. But the kicker is watching the character realize what they need to do. And then do it hilariously.I can't count how many times I've watched this movie, but I always end up laughing throughout it. It's just funny watching even with a weird sense of social commentary. Unleash your nerd and give it a chance."	5.0	SciFi Fandom makes fun of itself	2009-03-15	3	3	0

That, of course, is Sigourney Weaver, who looks very good in this one despite being pretty far from a young woman in the first bloom of youth. In fact, everyone associated with the film looks good, or at least acts good, in this funny and even somewhat touching movie. One need not be a space junkie to get a kick out of it. One needs only to like a good laugh, a good natured laugh, at one of the most popular genre of  popular entertainment. Nothing in it to prevent it from being a movie of choice for the whole family (save, of course, the littlest among us who might be frightened by the action.)	5.0	Top-Flight Space Satire	2013-11-10	1	1	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2TWIZ33KJCQ54	"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP"""	"SIMPLY STATED: The best and biggest lampooning of STAR TREK that is possible in our world!FIRST I MUST SAY: that I have seen virtually all of the Star Trek episodes and movies too many times. In fact, I had my own homemade federation uniform that I wore in the 1960s, especially when the ""Original Series"" was first running. Still, I appreciate ""Galaxy Quest"" and its mission, to put STAR TREK conventionalities upside-down. Wow!HOW IT GETS STARTED: The film opens in a ""Galaxy Quest"" convention now some 18 years after the show originally aired. The crew of ""The Protector"" are waiting impatiently and acting neurotically as they await their commander's entrance so they can all make their big entrance at the convention and get this gig over with. The comradeship which seems real on the surface is immediately seen as long-gone among the crew. These actors don't like each other and, most of all, they don't respect, but do detest their ""scene-stealing hack"" of a Captain, played like the perfectly imperfect backstage James T. Kirk by Tim Allen.BUT THEN SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENS: Captain Taggert is happily going through the motions and just soaking up all the hero worship and attention he's getting at the convention by his legions of trekkie-like uniformed fans while his crew just watches with envy from the sidelines. But then as he is making his way into the crowded men's room, Nesmith overhears a group of fans making very nasty comments about what a has-been he [Jason Nesmith] has become and how everyone can see that ""even his friends can't stand him"". It sounds kind of cliche, but the setting and Tim Allen make it really work and I feel very sorry for him. Jason Nesmith the actor suddenly realizes that his life ""obviously"" is meaningless and he wants to change this. With this EPIPHANY of sorts, the movie takes on a completely different and unexpected direction at light speed [literally].That direction is comedy. We have good naive aliens that look weird. We have bad ""street-smart"" aliens that look and act bad and we have sweet gently-cute little aliens that want to eat each other and Nesmith too. We even have some wonderful lampooning of the Star Trek Original Series episode ""ARENA"" where Nesmith fights monsters against impossible odds and does his customary rolling on the ground antics which never made any sense to me when I saw Kirk doing it almost 40 years ago.But there is more. We even have fans on Earth helping Nesmith get through some of his shipboard ordeals after he explains simply that everything about the show and ship are ""all real"". Then we have humor almost beyond belief as the logic is based on Trek logic and not what we take for granted as logic.To make a very long story short, Nesmith's goal, to discover real meaning in his life is achieved, but the meaning is something that he earns along with new admiration from shipmates, fans, and aliens alike. All of this is completely integrated with the fans the aliens the starship ""Protector"" and the TV show enmeshed throughout the film.To call this film thoughtfully made would be an understatment. The ending is very well done and replete with humor, drama and some twists and surprises. When it was all done I truly wished they would make a TV series called ""Galaxy Quest"" and include ""this fine ship and this fine crew"".ABOUT THE CAST:Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith who is Captain Peter Quincy Taggert [Capt. Kirk like] on TV's ""Galaxy Quest"" fictitious programSigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco -""Lt. Tawny Madison - Repeats Computer""---*- Alan Rickman - Alexander Dane - ""Dr. Lazarus - Advisor""---*- Tony Shalhoub - Fred Kwan - ""Tech Sgt. Chin - Engineer""---*- Sam Rockwell - Guy Fleegman - ""Crewman Guy - Expendable""---*- Daryl Mitchell - Tommy Webber - ""Loredo - Helmsman""---*- Enrico Colantoni - Mathesar - ""Good Alien Leader""WHAT ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER - TOO FEW FEATURES!This is perhaps the one glaring shortcoming of this film. It has very few features. It has a few deleted scene segments, a short featurette and some short abridged filmographies. It was in Widescreen and the transfer was flawless. Dreamworks could do much better for features as this type of film attracts the kind of fans that really appreciate ""Special Features"".FINAL THOUGHTS: Not just a space-opera comedy, but a fine comedy, and a fine film which is very satisfying to see more than once. I have seen this film at least 30 times since its release, and I do prefer the Widescreen format, but I wish the DVD had more features."	5.0	WONDERFULLY TASTEFUL LAMPOONING OF STAR TREK & MUCH MORE !!!	2006-03-06	6	5	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AJU6A2336GKZ0	Dsire Greverud	I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it immensely, finding it to be a sweet, light hearted comedy, as much a tribute to Trek fandom as a satirical version of it.  I just watched the DVD last night and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly- it was even funnir than I remembered it being.  Is it funnier if you know Star Trek?  Sure, but so much of the humor is derived from the fish-out-of-water set-up that you will be laughing even if you have never heard of William Shatner or seen anyone ever give a Vulcan greeting.  Don't deny yourself the joy of seeing this film beause of some dislike for (Tim Allen, Star Trek, Sci-Fi, Silly Comedies).  Watch especially for Tony Shaloub, whose constant laxidasical understatement made me laugh every time he opened his mouth to speak a line.

This is the funniest movie to be churned out of Hollywood in recent years--and it's only PG!&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a popular cult SF show years ago, but now the stars do little but appear at conventions and sign autographs. Delightfully Shatnerian Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) is approached by perpetually smiling aliens the Thermians, who believe that the adventures of the &quot;Protector&quot;'s crew are recorded real adventures. They ask him to help them defeat the hideous insectoid General Sarris--in a real, constructed starship &quot;Protector.&quot; Thrilled out of his pants, Nesmith brings along his initially unwilling friends to save the galaxy!Tim Allen shows that he's an excellent actor OUTSIDE of sitcoms, so like Shatner that it's simply uncanny. The voice, the delivery of lines, even the rather inflated ego are all there.Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarco, who is frustrated both by her small role on the show and the fact that all interviewers have ever asked her was about her bust size. A combination Counselor Troi/ Lieutenant Uhura, she basically repeats what the computer says. She explodes in frustration at one point: &quot;I have one job on this ship--it's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay! &quot;Alan Rickman wears an alien head as Alexander Dane, a cranky actor who hates always being second fiddle and resents Allen and his role throughout the movie. Tony Shalhoub drifts innocuously through the movie, paying only marginal attention to the amazing events around him.Daryl Mitchell plays a grown-up Wesley Crusher character, who was piloting the ship at the age of ten. Sam Rockwell plays a truly unique role--he was a redshirt who got killed on the alien planet of Episode 81, and now believes that he's going to die because his character doesn't have a name. Enrico Colantoni plays the leader of the Thermians, whose vacant grin and singsong speech patterns steal all his scenes... &quot;Weeeeee... need your help.&quot;There are a million funny moments and in-jokes that Trekkers will notice: The ship scraping against spacedock, Nesmith rolling around in preparation for action, Guy freaking out because he's a redshirt and he's doomed to die, Nesmith losing his shirt during a fight to display his manly chest, Gwen yelling because of her small role, ridiculous obstacles in the bowels of the ship, and so on.Perhaps the funniest part of it all is the Thermians, who have formed their culture around the adventures and friendships of the Galaxy Quest crew.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2N4E0RILLFQML	"Ed ""edshull"""	This is a great story about a crew of type cast, out of work actors from a Star Trek type TV show.  They are enlisted by a group of peacefull endangered aliens who don't have much of a stomach, or skill for fighting.  The cast of the show is quickly brought aboard a real version of their star ship and fight the evil warlord who is hunting down the aliens.I brought my 7 year old son to see this film when it hit the theatres.  He insisted on seeing it 4 times then and loved it each of them.  This is a film I thought would be as cheesy as Jungle2Jungle, but I was very wrong.  It's great!  First you have an amazing cast.  Tim Allen (jungle2Jungle, Home Improvement) is really on top of his game in this film.  Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Working Girl) looked great and showed a side of her rarely seen in her films. Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Harry Potter) does an incredibly convincing job as a Shaksperian actor turned cheesy TV show cast member who is forever type cast.  Tony Shalhoub (Wings, Stark Raving Mad) who is in my opinion one of the funniest guys around, does a great subtle role as a laid back Trekkie crew member.  Enrico Colantoni (just Shoot Me) amazed me as the alien, and Tommy Mithcel (Sgt. Bilko, 10 Things I Hate About You), who was great on John Larroquette brings his usualy talent.  But I have to say that it was  Sam Rockwell who provided the biggest laughs.  His portrayel of a star struck former extra on the show is flawless.  It's his character that really makes you think about all the cheesy ideas of a Star Trek type show.Even though the this is one of the funniest films of the year, it's not really the humor that makes this a great film.  First, the effects are great, and if you're thinking of getting less than the DTS DVD, think again.  The sound is amazing on my DTS home system.  There is a great blend of action with the humor and it really moves the film along.  Second, this is a film with a very real messgae.  A scene where Tim Allen is channel surfing through countless gunfights and other violent scenes and ends up on his Star Trek type show makes you realize that all the Star Treks are a nice break from the typical TV line up.  It requires people to think, imagine and be creative.  How often does TV allow that?  Then there is the message of the show.  What was Star Trek really about?  Not laser fights and things blowing up, but a group of people exploring.  Loyalty, standing up for what you believe in, courage and honesty.  I'm not a huge Star Trek fan, I would rather watch Start Wars over any of the Star Trek films, and I have seen very few of the shows, but I do give them credit for having a message.  My son has watched this film so much that if it were a VHS, we would have need two replacements.  It's one of his favorites.  Just the other day his grandparents asked where he heard the phrase, &quot;Never give up, never surrender.&quot;This is a great movie for the kids.  It's fast paced, funny and doesn't contain anything that most parents would object to.	5.0	A great DVD for kids and adults!	2001-12-05	3	2	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3G2YHS3PF2AGD	Edgar	Was somehow reminded of this movie a few days ago and ordered it on a whim (and why not...at less than 10 bucks for a bluray and free 2day shipping). It was just as epic as I remembered. Seriously, this movie is pure excellence... The cast is great, particularly Alan Rickman as the frustrated Shakespearean actor who's best gig was a cheesy sci-fi show.A note on quality...There are some deleted scenes and special effects, but this has all the trademarks of a 'hey lets throw some featurettes on a bluray and release it!' quality job that you'd find in a Walmart bargain bin. I can't remember how much language was in the original, but this version seems to be edited, almost as if this is the 'for tv' version; at certain points you can see the characters mouthing, well, 'different' words than you hear, and it made it seem a bit cheap. In the end I don't really care because it's a good movie at a good price. Had I paid any more I might be a bit more upset about the presentation, but heck...it's not even 10 bucks. People pay more for...well, lots of things. Like meals from McDonalds. And we all know those only bring sadness in the end, no matter what they're called.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2KB14WCZ1DVE3	elvistcob@lvcm.com	"It wasn't so much that I wasn't a fan of Star Trek.  It was more of a complete dislike for William Shatner in the lead role.  I always found him a smug, arrogant actor that seemed to be giving the minimum amount of effort in order to garner a paycheck.  The fact that he more or less has alluded to such over the years proves the point.  The show itself was extraordinarily innovative for it's time, and it's too bad such a big presence had to bring it down.Galaxy Quest captures everything I like and hate about the show perfectly.  It begins by mercilessly slamming the situation of the former cast of the show, years after it's run on TV.  The cast is reduced to getting paychecks by enduring fans at conventions who live and breathe what the actors gave up doing years ago.  When not doing conventions, they have to endure fans who live and breathe Galaxy Quest at electronics store openings.The most hilarious character at this point is Alan Rickman, who seemed to have a budding theatrical career that was put on permanent hold when the show's popularity became his destiny.  The bad guy of ""Die Hard"" proves to be a great comedic actor as someone who would rather die than utter another of his Dr. Spockish sayings.While I don't believe William Shatner ever showed the exuberance for conventions that Tim Allen does at the beginning, it does setup  a temporary downfall that propels the rest of the plot.  Allen goes into a deep funk when overhearing in a washroom how pathetic the whole cast is.  This funk is only overcome when real aliens beam him up and he sees a chance to save the universe.  Or at least revive his career.The genius of the movie is how, once the rest of the cast is also beamed up, that we actually care deeply for the characters and start rooting for the good guys.  Excellent special effects, especially with the unstoppable Rock Monster, take them deeper and deeper into a situation where they have to make serious decisions, while at the same time keeping their comedic edge.While the veterans all do great work, my favorite is Sam Rockwell, who plays one of the superfans who happened to be an extra in one of the past episodes.  At first he elevates himself to the stardom of the others by asking if he can sit at the autograph table with the main characters and get the 8 x 10's he has made of himself also autographed.  But when the action gets fast and furious, he realizes that his role is usually to get killed off before the end of the plot.  This anxiety is hilarious throughout the movie.Oh yes, it's also great for all ages."	5.0	Nails the Star Trek world, good and bad, down cold	2002-08-29	1	0	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3KKOBGO2ZQY3P	"Ernest Kim ""An Average Joe"""	This is one those exceptionally rare modern day movies that uses leading edge visual effects in service of a wonderfully rich and engaging story.This is definitely not an effects movie (although the effects,  done by ILM, are on par with the best of the best), but a movie driven by a  simple story told exceptionally well.  The characters are developed over  time, using subtle cues, and by the end of the movie you can't help but  care what happens to them, even the ensign!As the Amazon.com review  notes, you don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy this movie, and  having seen it with people who are not Trekkies by any stretch of the  imagination, yet enjoyed it immensely, I can personally attest to this.  The only thing you need is a sense of humor.Also, as someone who is not  a big fan of Tim Allen, I can say that he was wonderful in this movie, as  was the rest of the cast.  Tony Shalhoub is simply hilarious in a fairly  minor role, and Sigourney Weaver shows us that she has a future in  comedy.This movie would make a great gift for any Trek fans or a great  addition to your library of comedies.  It would also be great as a  background movie to play at parties since it will elicit laughs no matter  where in the story a viewer gets involved.  Also, it's definitely  appropriate for the kids (they probably won't understand some of the more  subtle humor, but there's plenty to keep them interested).	5.0	Simply Wonderful!	2000-04-26	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3T7G9RD6LNB96	E. T. Young	When they created the DVD for this hilarious scifi comedy flick, something magical happened. Ignoring the movie for a moment, the DVD is funny in its own right, as the Omega-13 option on the main menu demonstrates. I won't  tell you what it is - you'll have to see it for yourself. There are also  special DVD menu animations fans are sure to enjoy.And it's hard not to  be a fan. Galaxy Quest is truly a sparkling little gem of comedy that you  and your family can enjoy for years to come. Naturally, the DVD version  includes bonus material and cut scenes. If you've seen the movie, buy the  DVD for that extra bit of fun, and if you haven't seen the movie, buy the  DVD anyway to see what you've been missing.	5.0	DVD formatting really can make a movie funnier!	2000-06-29	0	0	0

It covers with wit so many of the odd aspects and plot points that trekie and casual space adventure fans have shared that you are bound to find hilarity at each turn, but especially as Quest moves into high gear in the second half. Too many misadventures to mention... but, a few: the beaming up of a weird creature; the hall of slamming things; the mother's reply to her teenage son who explains why he is heading out with so many fireworks.I am over 70, have seen this movie at least 3 or 4 times and it never fails to please.	5.0	Intergalactic Fun	2012-12-01	0	0	0

Special effects where amazing.  However, there was something missing, may be it was the  story, I am not sure.  But as spoofs goes it was a good one.  Tim Allen  took the role as the commander with such jest, he must of been watching  William Shatner, the aging actor, trying to hang on to his youth and fame.

Such was the low-keyness of this true sleeper hit which like other simiar surprise sci-fi flicksStargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray] andThe Terminator [Blu-ray] has gone on to become one of my favourite films.  Now on blu-ray it has never looked or sounded better.  Perhaps being a Trekker myself helped me to truly pick up on all the inside jokes and spoofs of TOS although my bride enjoyed the film the first time she saw it and now after I've forced her to watch every single TOS episode together with me she now enjoys this film even more the second time around.  The special feature documentaries are also good making this an oddity in being a comedy that is still funny even after all these years.The great script helped but kudos have to go to the excellent cast some of which went on to even bigger things e.g. Rickman in the Harry Potter films and Shalhoub in ""Monk"" etc.  The aliens are hilarious and lovable and the special effects are really very good and look even better in 1080p.

And she looks great in the longer wig...)I was  very pleased to find that this was an all around pleasing film...watchable  over and over again.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2UDO7YHFWFGX7	"garrie keyman ""Embrace the Power at www.garri..."	I love this movie; everything about it smacks of gourmet cinema fare. I can count on my fingers the number of movies I would willingly watch over and over and Galaxy Quest makes the grade.  If you are a fan of sci-fi, enjoy parody, and don't take your own passions too seriously, chances are you'll agree.So, what makes this Spielberg Dreamworks video worth your time?  Plenty.  Let's start with the cast. For me, few actors (unless they happen to be named James Naughton) have sufficient draw of their own to prompt me to crack my wallet; there simply has to be more than an actor or two I've enjoyed in the past to captivate my interest in a movie.  In this regard Tim Allen (Home Improvement, The Santa Clause), Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Gorillas in the Mist), Tony Shaloub (Wings, Searching for Bobby Fisher), nor Alan Rickman (Sense &amp; Sensibility, Harry Potter) strayed from the mold. Yet in this hilarious and yet sometimes touching vehicle it is hard to imagine anyone better suited to their roles. This holds true for other cast members Sam Rockwell (The Green Mile), Enrico Colantoni (Just Shoot Me, Stigmata), and Justin Long, as well.Welcome to the tale about a crew of has-been actors from a twenty-year-old television show trying to milk their fading fame for all it's worth. While attending a fan-filled sci-fi convention, the self-absorbed Jason Nesmith (Allen) is approached by a group of Theramian emissaries hailing from the Klatu Nebula. Nesmith, who played the Kirk-ish Commander Peter Quincy Taggart on the 70's-something TV show Galaxy Quest, understandably blows-off the alien visitors as just one more clutch of costumed groupies who have spent too many days in warp drive. The Theramians are not easily put off. They have modeled their spaceship - indeed, their entire society -- after every detail garnered from the show under the mistaken belief that the transmissions of the old television series were in fact a collection of historical documents. Now, threatened with extinction by the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) who wants the ever-smiling Theramians to surrender the mysterious Omega-13 device, Mathesar (Colantoni), leader of the surviving Theramians, together with his companions continues to appeal to their hero, Nesmith, for help.The next day a hung-over Nesmith finally accompanies the Theramians to their ship -- thinking it merely another campy gig where the spaceship is little more than a highly impressive mock-up -- and proceeds to open fire on Sarris. Only when he is encapsulated in gel and jettisoned home in the most hilarious wake-up call of sci-fi movie history does Nesmith realize the Theramians, and therefore the menacing Sarris, are real.  Unfortunately, no one knows what the Omega-13 does; the series ended before that part was written into the script.Sci-fi fans will readily recognize parody of various industry standards including Star Trek (Original Series, Next Generation Series, as well as some of the movies), Gremlins, Star Wars, and Flight of the Navigator. So if you find Beryllium Spheres are strangely reminiscent of Dilithium Crystals or that Sarris and his eye-patch remind you of the formidable character Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music) portrayed in Star Trek VI, The Undiscovered Country, it's not coincidental. Yet while Galaxy Quest is a sort of ala-carte all-you-can-eat buffet of sci-fi fandom and cliche, don't err here; you needn't get the inside jokes to enjoy it. And with its PG rating, this is a movie meal the entire family can all sit down and devour together. Now that's good cookin' from Hollywood.What makes Galaxy Quest above par is that not only does it deliver on the laughs, it is well structured; well-directed (Dean Parisot); has a four-star apropos soundtrack (David Newman); and near-flawless top-drawer special effects (Stan Winston). What's more, it has the singular distinction of featuring my all-time favorite alien race. If foreign-exchange programs ever go inter-galactic, I'd pick a year with those endearingly innocent and gut-bustingly hilarious Theramians, hands-down. Galaxy Quest is precisely the kind of movie (should you stop by unannounced) that you are apt to find us re-enacting at home.There is a lot more I would love to say about this movie and the apt portrayals of the cast - all of it good - but alas, space does not allow. Suffice it to say that through the course of the movie the crew of TV has-beens sets aside their well-entrenched habit of in-fighting to save the day, although not before enduring a harrowing series of stair-step crises which build to the expected triumphant climax (this is, after all, a comedy).  Still, it isn't all silliness, and it is precisely that breed of subtle yet gripping artistry which graces the viewer here: that well-written smartly balanced blend of laughter and loss capable of propelling any would-be-winner of a movie to an enduring sell.If you like to go where no one has gone before but prefer going with friends and having a great time en route, watch this movie. Then remember one thing: Never give up; never surrender (even when you've been reduced to signing autographs at the local Sci-fi convention).	5.0	A Quest Worth Undertaking by garrie keyman	2004-02-25	3	3	0

I'm glad I got past it though because this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Allen is perfect along with the rest of the cast especially Allen Rickman as has been actors of a forgotten sci-fi t.v. show now on the convention circuit. They get thrown a real curve ball when real aliens show up needing their help. This movie is fast and funny.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1RO2Z80QVYSOL	Gertie's Galaxy	Galaxy Quest is another space-age movie but with a comedic twist. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman head the cast of actors who starred as astronauts in a cult Television series over twenty years ago called Galaxy Quest.Loyal fans still flock to Sci-Fi conventions to pay homage to their adventurous heroes. It is at one of these conventions that Commander Taggart (Allen) meets the Thermians, a race of aliens from the Klatu Nebular. They have misinterpreted episodes of the series as 'historical documents' and arrive on earth to whisk the actors into space, thinking that they can use certain 'documents' to help them defeat a deadly adversary.After a string of hilarious events, the crew are convinced that the Thermians plight is genuine and the actors are beamed up on a mission to help save them. Now it is time for them to put on the performance of their lives!All ends well when the actor Jason Nesmith (Commander Taggart) gets in contact with a fan on earth and he along with his friends who are fellow Questrian fans, guide the crew back home after they save the Thermians.Once Galaxy Quests gets you laughing, it will keep you in hysterics. In addition to the humor, this movie is full of great special effects, action, excitement and an unpredictable romance.I loved Galaxy Quest because it appealed to me as a Star Trek fan. A must see for Space Cadet fans alike. You are guaranteed to love it even if you are not into Sci-Fi films. It constantly pokes fun at this genre but at the same time, pays tribute to it without insulting its audience.Never Give Up! Never Surrender!	5.0	Put Galaxy Quest to the Test	2002-01-14	3	3	0

It is impossible to pretend to be something for very long without in some way becoming that thing. The key is what do you pretend to be? Hopefully it is something more noble than what you may have been. I don't mean that it is good to be hypocritical, just that by stiving to be the man you would like to be is better than settling for the man you are. Maybe that is way too deep for this fun spoof of the Star Trecified shows.So here's the deal, this is a funny if a bit silly spoof that just might give you something to think about if you are in the mood.	4.0	Actually a pretty good lesson	2008-09-04	6	6	0

Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman star in this &quot;Star Trek&quot; spoof. The cast plays the cast of the now defunct, but cult-status TV series &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot; and every one but Allen is totally sick of the whole deal, the  conventions the grand openings, the fans, the whole nine yards. But then  real aliens, thinking the show shows actual history, gets the cast to help  in a real deep space war.  Allen is hilarious, Rickman does his usual  excellent job, (he is perfect as the &quot;I'm too good for this crap&quot;  Spock-like character)and Weaver goes against her usual type playing a  sex-pot blonde, doing the exceptional acting job she always does while  reminding us, (at least the male viewers  :-) ) that Weaver is VERY  defintly female. There is no smut, nothing a parent would find  objectionable, (the movie is rated PG) and I would highly recommend this  one to anyone.....	4.0	Great movie!	2000-05-08	0	0	0

A very  good mixture for humour and action. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan  Rickman are the stars of this film. Alan Rickman plays a very touchy actor  whose grown to hate the spock like character he portrays in the show.  Sigourney Weaver plays an actor whose more remembered for her cleavage  rather than her acting. While Tim Allen's character gets off on being the  heroic space captain(reminds me of another captain I know). It's good to  see a Star Trek spoof that works so well.

It's about the cast of a defunct sci-fi series still clinging desperately to their only claim to fame. They've become punchlines to the media and each other, until one day a race of aliens who have seen the show and mistaken it for actual historical documents ask them for help dealing with Sarek, a malevolent and powerful alien who has nearly wiped out their race. If you take the historical document mix-up lightly (it's one of those things you just have to go with) you will surely like the movie. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is hilarious, and the characters are each delightful and well acted. It spoofs series like Star Trek in all the right ways, without insulting or demeaning the people who enjoyed them or even those who worked on them. I love this movie, and the best part is that it does not cease to be funny or enjoyable after repeated viewings (trust me, I'd know).

I never would have thought a Tim Allen movie would have been much good, so I must have read the reviews before going to see it.  I was wrong, it is.Simple plot, the cast of a long cancelled, second rate Sci Fi Tv show, now relegated to SciFi geek conventions, meet outerspace aliens who've received transmissions of the show and mistook it for &#34;historical documents&#34;, in other words, reality.  They actually built the ship, but since it was based on what they saw on the show, they aren't as effective in using it as they could be and a killer alien (who destroyed their planet) is after them, so they want the crew to help them fend off the villain.It could have gone wrong in so many ways, yet it went right at pretty much every turn.  The result is a very engaging and entertaining SciFi adventure as the cast of the TV show step into their former roles but in real life.	4.0	An Imaginative and Fun Satire	2012-12-23	1	1	0

This movie does such a great job of spoofing Star Trek and many other shows I have enjoyed over the years in a way that just keeps you laughing.

As an aging but still somewhat nostalgic post-trekkie, this film really clicked with me. The &quot;stuck in a time-warp&quot; premise as a device to explore the dynamics of leadership, blind faith, dumb luck and circumstance, revealed remarkable depth in what could otherwise have be seen as just another throwaway &quot;Hollywood&quot; comedy. In addition to this movie being a real hoot, the actors display a refreshing depth of feeling and serious attention to their craft in making even the most outrageous characters believable.  &quot;Never give up, never surrender&quot; will be etched in my memory for a long, long time.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	ARAM6WHIU854L	G W Thielman	I purchased a copy for our kids, hoping it wouldn't be too silly, or politically correct.  Granted, I don't expect much from the cultural morass that eminates from Hollywood, but &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is a gem.  My favorable opinion may be influenced by long familiarity with the movie's alter ego &quot;Star Trek&quot; (and its conventions), on which GQ is obviously based -- although don't tell Paramount's executives that.  You don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy it, but it doesn't hurt.  (However, the cute drydock departure is designed to appeal to those who remember ST-TMP.)  The technobabel, e.g., &quot;beryllium balls&quot; (in lieu of &quot;dilithium crystals&quot;), was delightful.  (It also gave me the excuse to pull out a periodical table for the kids.  I pointed out that the GQ crew should have washed their hands after retrieving the ball since that metal is toxic.)  Unlike so many sci-fi films in which a feeble or incoherent plot is plastered by gee-whiz optics (&quot;Lost in Space&quot; and the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies come to mind), GQ has a nicely arranged theme (much like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) in which, once disbelief is suspended on physical premises, the story proceeds without being disrupted by internal contradictions or leftist sermonizing.  GQ is humorous without being needlessly slapstick, and although (or maybe because) it's deliberately camp, the plot holds together quite nicely.  The acting is also very appropriate for the story.  The effects are credible, but don't overwhelm the characters or the story.  Real nice job.	5.0	wonderful parody	2000-10-11	4	3	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2FBV6BC7N8WKW	Haitianlover	I had almost as much fun reading the reviews of this great flick as I had watching it.  I love it when we are in communion, which in fact is what being a FAN is all about: communing with others who share a common object of admiration.  I communed with the other reviewers, we communed with the filmmakers (who are obviously respectful fans of the Trek), and for 120 minutes, the world was in harmony.  The same thing happens when we go to the conventions, which we take seriously.  The same thing happens when a Trek movie is released and we camp out overnight to see it.  The irony is that it was all done through satire, which is often condescending, mean spirited, irreverent, and blind to the nature of true fandom.  This film works because the satire causes us to reflect, not feel ashamed; the satire causes us to laugh gently at ourselves and our heroes, not gag.  Finally, it is so adequately done that if the humor were removed, it could almost be a serious addition to the Trek.  Finally, the most touching aspect of the film is the forging of relationships: not only the actors among themselves and the actors with the aliens, but the actors with THEIR roles and the actors with their fans.  Notice that the captain is no longer bored, jaded with, or annoyed by the millions of fans who admire him.  In short, the actors are no longer a part of the cynical outsiders who are condescending, mean spirited, irreverent, and blind to the nature of true fandom.	5.0	Brought Together by Satire, of All Things	2002-06-01	3	3	0

The Special Features aren't huge, but they are fun. And, besides, the star is this high-quality film itself. This isn't low-budget - this is the real thing. Great actors and great acting. Special effects by Oscar-winning Stan Winston as well as ILM (Industrial Light & Magic).And a script to die for. There are so many good lines and good bits, and the take-offs on the original Star Trek are tone-perfect. I have so many favorite scenes, but every time I get the biggest kick out of the ""chompers"". Gwen (Sigourney Weaver) and Jason (Tim Allen) have to shut down the ship's neutron reactor and are moving through the ""bowels of the ship"". They're guided by Brandon, teenage mega-fan, with communicators. He tells them, ""Take a left and then straight on through the chompers.""  CHOMPERS?! As Gwen squeals, ""What is this thing? There's no useful purpose for a lot of chompy things!"", I am rollicking with laughter. No, there is no useful purpose, they are a writer's invention to add to the chase scene and tension. And as I'm hugely enjoying it, I cannot agree with Gwen when she hollers, ""Whoever wrote this episode should die!""Totally excellent family entertainment.Special Features:1. ""On Location in Space"" This is an enjoyable ""making of"" short. It has lots of outtakes from the movie as well as rehearsal shots and some commentary by: Mark Johnson (producer), Alan Rickman (plays Alexander Dane), Sigourney Weaver, Charles Newrith (producer), Tim Allen, Tony Shalhoub (Fred Kwan), Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar), Stan Winston (alien make-up and creature effects), Daryl Mitchell (Tommy Webber), Robin Sachs (Sarris).Instead of just jiggling the camera when the crew is in the Protector's command center in a battle, the set is actually a big stage that is jiggled all at once. Certainly made it more real for the actors as well as the viewers.I would love to have one of the Thermian octopus-like masks that were used for the Thermians!Stan Winston's costume for lead bad buy, Sarris, is awesome, too. Robin Sachs, in his full get-up, explains his character: ""He's like Attilla the Crab"".2. ""From the Cutting Room Floor"" Seven scenes filmed but cut from the movie. Usually I've found snippets of cut scenes blah, but this was fun. For example, there's one hilarious cut scene where Quellek (Thermian played by Patrick Green) shows Alexander Dane (the actor who plays half-human communications officer Dr. Lazarus) his living quarters. They were carefully reconstructed from what had been shown in the original ""Galaxy Quest"" TV series and included a retracting bed of sharpened 2-foot spikes.3. Theatrical trailer4. Sneak preview trailers of three other movies5. Cast & Crew6. Production Notes. This is a few screens of written information. Fun to read. It took Robin Sachs 3-4 hours to get into his 80-lb Sarris costume.The planet scenes with the little blue ""miners, not MINORS!"" and Gin-Jac (rock monster) were filmed in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park. Truly looks like an alien landscape.When ever I get a request to list my favorite movies, ""Galaxy Quest"" is always on the list!"	5.0	DVD SPECIAL FEATURES for this Best Spoof EVER - full of laughter and full of heart!	2012-09-02	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A26HFSVLAGULIM	"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"THE BIGGEST & BEST LAMPOONING OF STAR TREK THAT IS POSSIBLE IN OUR GALAXY!I must admit that I have seen virtually all of the Star Trek episodes and movies too many times. In fact, I had my own homemade federation uniform that I wore in the 1960s, especially when the ""Original Series"" was first running. Still, I appreciate ""Galaxy Quest"" and its mission, to put STAR TREK conventionalities upside-down. Wow!IT ALL BEGINS:The film opens in a ""Galaxy Quest"" convention now some 18 years after the show originally aired. The crew of ""The Protector"" are waiting impatiently and acting neurotically as they await their commander's entrance so they can all make their big entrance at the convention and get this gig over with. The comradeship which seems real on the surface is immediately seen as long-gone among the crew. These actors don't like each other and, most of all, they don't respect, but do detest their ""scene-stealing hack"" of a Captain, played like the perfectly imperfect backstage James T. Kirk by Tim Allen.BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS:Captain Taggert is happily going through the motions and just soaking up all the hero worship and attention he's getting at the convention by his legions of trekkie-like uniformed fans while his crew just watches with envy from the sidelines. But then as he is making his way into the crowded men's room, Nesmith overhears a group of fans making very nasty comments about what a has-been he [Jason Nesmith] has become and how everyone can see that ""even his friends can't stand him"". It sounds kind of cliche, but the setting and Tim Allen make it really work and I feel very sorry for him. Jason Nesmith the actor suddenly realizes that his life ""obviously"" is meaningless and he wants to change this. With this EPIPHANY of sorts, the movie takes on a completely different and unexpected direction at light speed [literally].That direction is comedy. We have good naive aliens that look weird. We have bad ""street-smart"" aliens that look and act bad and we have sweet gently-cute little aliens that want to eat each other and Nesmith too. We even have some wonderful lampooning of the Star Trek Original Series episode ""ARENA"" where Nesmith fights monsters against impossible odds and does his customary rolling on the ground antics which never made any sense to me when I saw Kirk doing it almost 40 years ago.But there is more. We even have fans on Earth helping Nesmith get through some of his shipboard ordeals after he explains simply that everything about the show and ship are ""all real"". Then we have humor almost beyond belief as the logic is based on Trek logic and not what we take for granted as logic.To make a very long story short, Nesmith's goal, to discover real meaning in his life is achieved, but the meaning is something that he earns along with new admiration from shipmates, fans, and aliens alike. All of this is completely integrated with the fans the aliens the starship ""Protector"" and the TV show enmeshed throughout the film.To call this film thoughtfully made would be an understatment. The ending is very well done and replete with humor, drama and some twists and surprises. When it was all done I truly wished they would make a TV series called ""Galaxy Quest"" and include ""this fine ship and this fine crew"".ABOUT THE CAST:Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith who is Captain Peter Quincy Taggert [Capt. Kirk like] on TV's ""Galaxy Quest"" fictitious programSigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco -""Lt. Tawny Madison - Repeats Computer""Alan Rickman  - Alexander Dane  - ""Dr. Lazarus - Advisor""Tony Shalhoub  - Fred Kwan  - ""Tech Sgt. Chin - Engineer""Sam Rockwell  - Guy Fleegman  - ""Crewman Guy - Expendable""Daryl Mitchell  - Tommy Webber  - ""Loredo - Helmsman""Enrico Colantoni  - Mathesar  - ""Good Alien Leader""ABOUT THE DVD:This is perhaps the one glaring shortcoming of this film. It has very few features. It has a few deleted scene segments, a short featurette and some short abridged filmographies. It was in Widescreen and the transfer was flawless. Dreamworks could do much better for features as this type of film attracts the kind of fans that really appreciate ""Special Features""."	5.0	IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD  --  IN SPACE?	2005-10-27	3	2	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	"Is ""Galaxy Quest"" a movie I feel everyone needs to see?  No.  But if you like either comedies, Star Trek, or movies about people stepping up to responsibilities they were not sure they could handle, you will like this movie.I would divide what many call ""science fiction"" into three categories:1) ""True Science Fiction"", which is based on realistic speculation (e.g. ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea,"" ""Flowers For Algernon"");2) ""Science Fantasy"", which has a space setting, but is more of a fantasy in space than something based on true speculation (e.g. ""Star Wars""); and3) ""Science Horror"", which often leans more toward the first category, but in this case it is a horror story in a space/sci-fi setting (e.g. ""Alien"").This movie is clearly in the second category.I see parallels between this movie and two others.  One is ""Three Amigos"", another comedy about actors who are mistaken for being heroes, and finding themselves having to become heroes.  The other is ""Space Camp"", about a woman and several kids accidentally sent into space.  The ""Three Amigos"" parallel probably has been noted in other reviews; while this is more of a comedy, I feel with the size of the cast that there are a lot of similarities with ""Space Camp.""One thing I'll mention is that I am not really a Tim Allen fan.  I'm not a Tim Allen hater either, but for me, he was neither a draw nor, for the most part, a distraction from the movie.  I could never picture him being cast as a serious starship captain.The rest of the cast is good, though I think Sigourney Weaver was over-qualified as an actress for her role.  Alan Rickman was excellent in his role, an excellent crumudgeon."	4.0	A Fun, Harmless, Escape From Reality	2006-11-21	4	3	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	Galaxy Quest gets fulls marks for inventiveness, but misses out on being a true classic since it never really pushes its potential very far. This is mainly due to the fact that Dreamworks clearly cut the film down in post-production to make it a 'nice and safe' PG family film. It mostly feels like an extension of the meta-fictional show it is mocking than a genuine Star Trek parody.Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith, a mostly washed-up actor famous for only one role (a situation Allen himself should be familiar with) on the long-gone Galaxy Quest TV show. His life is nothing more than public appearances (in character) along with the rest of his disgruntled, weary co-stars. But an oddball race of naive octopus creatures called Thermians, from the other side of the universe mistakenly interpret the show as historical documents and beam-up Nesmith and his crew to an exact replica of their fictional spaceship to fight off the evil Sarris, a reptilian warlord dead-set on acquiring the mysterious 'Omega-13'.My biggest greivance with Galaxy Quest is that the production design is just so b-l-a-n-d. Most of the film is gray, gray, and more shades of gray. Give us something pretty to look at! David Newman, who seems to be the go-to guy for family movie scores, offers a very poor melody for the Galaxy Quest TV show (and therefor the whole movie). I didn't expect Goldsmith to parody his own Star Trek work for this, but SOMEONE better than Newman could have worked wonders.They had lightning in a bottle with Galaxy Quest but it fizzled out when they lost sight of any epic feel. As a TV movie it would have been great, as a theatrical effort it does indeed fall short of the mark. But I'll watch Alan Rickman in almost anything and Missi Pyle is also especially cute.The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.35:1 1080p and Dolby TrueHD.

Is he playing against type?  It's hard to say,  except that he's perfect as a sort of Shakespearian Mr. Spock manqu&eacute;.  In  fact, it's fun to see the Star Trek crew - both generations - skewered by  proxy here.Most everything is right with this movie, though I do have a  couple of quibbles about plausability with couple of scenes (Yes, with a  premise this implausable, I quibble about plausability.) but Galaxy Quest  is such an enjoyable that I rate it a solid 4 stars.	4.0	Great Saturday Night Movie!	2000-07-01	2	1	1

The cast is perfect and the acting is top notch by everyone, especially Sigourney Weaver as an aging sex bomb from the show with a hilarious job on the show.  However, the best character is Guy, or Cremember 6, who died on show in Episode 82.  He's damn funny when scary situations come up and some of his lines just make you laugh out loud.  The story is quite good for this type of fish-out-of water film, and the cast plays it well.The CGI effects used in the film are quite good, but they never overshadow the actors or the story.  Most of the dialogue is right on track and the supporting cast is very funny, especially the aliens who model themselves after the humans.  They're incredibly funny to watch as they try to walk, talk, and act like humans.If you like comedy with a satirical background, this film is definitely for you.  It's funny, smart, and quite touching at points, and you'll want to get every single one of your Trekkie friends to watch it with you so they can see how big of idiots they look at times.	5.0	Funny as all ...	2001-03-09	0	0	0

And, what it is is a fun movie that pokes fun at several sci-fi conventions such as the scene steeling lead actor, the cast member that has grown to resent being known ONLY for the role on a show that has become a cult classic, cheesy scenery, special effects and makeup. Oh, and lets not forget the ACTUAL conventions that are held in honor of all things sci-fi and the over zealous fans that know more about the shows than the people that were on it.I wouldn't go so far as to call this a &#34;great&#34; movie but, it is fun and entertaining.And you gotta love how Alan Rickman's character keeps his head-piece on through the whole movie even as it is in a constant state of being destroyed.	5.0	A fun movie that pokes fun at several sci-fi conventions	2014-02-18	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	"A little disclaimer: I held a little prejudice going into this movie; I do not like Tim Allen as a general rule. When this movie came out, I have to say that I wasn't interested at all. I wasn't into Star Trek, which this movie largely riffs on, and the movie looked cheesy from the initial trailers I saw. Add to that the fact that Tim Allen received top billing, and you might as well count the movie down for the count with me. But after hearing great word of mouth and seeing great reviews, I decided to put aside my prejudices when the blu-ray of the film was released recently.Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) are the crew of a now defunct 80's sci-fi television show called Galaxy Quest. Relegated to appearances at fan conferences and the like, answering inane questions about the show, and repeating lines from the show they wish people would forget (""By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons of Worvan, you shall be avenged..."") everyone is dealing with the fact that they are washed up has-beens living in the past and ready to throw in the towel. Just as their life seems meaningless a race of aliens asks for their help, thinking they are a real ship's crew, and the show is their ""historical documents.""I definitely made the right choice in finally giving the movie a try. Like recent ""spoof"" movies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Galaxy Quest mixes reverance and spoof with great characterizations and an amazing plot to create a hilarious and fun riff of the sci-fi genre. Written by David Howard and directed by Dean Parisot, Galaxy Quest utilizes homages to movies and TV series from Star Trek to Star Wars to get the feeling of real sci-fi films, knowing when, and when not, to take itself seriously. Not only does this help to amp up the comedy, but it also gives us characters we can believe when they're thrown into extraordinary situations.The casting is phenomenal, making for a diverse, funny, and well acted movie. The true stand outs in the film are Alan Rickman as a thespian who used to actually be a respected actor, but is now stuck spewing ridiculous catch phrases for fanboys and being upstaged by the Shatneresque Jason Nesmith; and Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, a throwaway former cast member who died on his only episode of the show that is consistently worried throughout the movie that he's going to die in real life because he died on the show. Naturally, though, the whole cast is stunning, as could be noted by the pedigree of acting included here.If I had one quibble with the movie, though, it would have to be the way the alien race is portrayed. I know they're not even humanoid creatures, but when they take the appearance of being human they could have been a little more natural, and not as stiff, or, dare I say it, annoying. They get better throughout the course of the movie, but they are still more or less caricatures throughout the movie and should have been just a little more fleshed out.All in all I have to say that the film was extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, or well done comedy spoofs, you're almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie.4.5/5"	4.0	Galaxy Quest	2009-12-19	1	1	0

After that half hour was up, I'd really begun to enjoy the  story and the characters.  Tim Allen is dead-on in his Shatner-ish captain  persona, and he works well as the spotlight-hogging has-been that his  fellow cast members of Galaxy Quest think him.  Sigourney Weaver is really  cute as the essentially useless female crew member, and her character owns  up to this in one scene by saying something to the effect of: &quot;I have  only one job on this ship, and it's a stupid one, but I'm going to do  it!&quot;  The aliens are wonderful in their naievete, and they flatly  cannot accept that the &quot;historical documents&quot; of Galaxy Quest are  in fact, a lie. Alan Rickman is hilarious as the second-fiddle, snobby,  highly advanced alien counterpart to the captain, and his smug responses to  fans delivering his most famous line will have you in stitches.  All in  all, it's a cute movie with a simple but entertaining story.  There's not a  lot of violence, so even the kids could watch (no younger than 7, I think).

The film has a great set-up and it totally delivers.  The &quot;adventure&quot; portion even ends up being better than  the last Star Trek movie.This movie was very well-cast.  Weaver is  hilarious as the ditzy blonde, but no character tops Tim Allen's unexpected  turn as a William Shatner-ish actor who finds out he got a little more than  he bargained for when he agreeded to visit the &quot;spaceship&quot; of a  few odd-looking fans.The only problem I had with the film (and it is a  small complaint) was that it turns out to be a &quot;real&quot; movie, as  opposed to an out-and-out comedy.  True, there is a lot of humor  (especially if you are a Trekker/Trekkie), but in the end, there is a real  plot as opposed to a lot of one-liners and crazy situations.How is  this a problem, you ask?  Well, maybe it isn't.  I just saw the film once  in the theater, and I was expecting a laugh-fest.  Knowing what to expect  at home, I will enjoy it a lot more (and I liked it the first time).  I  just thought you might like to know that it may not be what you expect.

I certainly missed out on seeing it on the big screen.  It was by NO MEANS a masterpiece, but being a 'Trekkie' myself, it was easy to see the obvious similarities to Star Trek and how SOME (but by no means all) of the fans practically see the show as REALITY.  Not just funny, but if you consider yourself a pretty hard-nosed Trek fan, you will either find it hilarious or an incredible insult.Tim Allen is absolutely PERFECT as the Captain from a Sci-Fi series from I would guess the late 70's to early 80's.  Since the cancellation of the series, he as well as the rest of the major characters from the series are herded from one sci-fi convention to another for a chance to sign autographs for the fans of the show that are, let's face it: so INTO it that they have memorized entire episodes and come dressed as their favorite characters.  These folks lives pretty much revolve around this show, and those who acted IN it.  But like the loveable James T. Kirk, Tim Allen is despised by the other actors because of his arrogance towards the supporting characters and nobody is more surprised than he when honest-to-goodness aliens arrive seeking help from him and his crew to save their entire civilization.This group of advanced aliens are gentle, peace-loving squid-like creatures that have intercepted 'Galaxy Quest' as it was broadcast and went beyond the reaches of our Solar System andbeing naive as they are, actually believe this TV series to be the REAL THING--even more so than the most hard-core TV fan on earth.  They ACTUALLY believe that the crew will assist them to battle an enemy who wants to destroy our peace-loving squids, well decimate the entire race, actually.  It all is full of laughs and incredible situations which they amazingly escape from (just like the characters from the TV show...imagine THAT!) and with tongue planted firmly in cheek 'Galaxy Quest' never takes itself too seriously.  If you are a Trekkie, you are in for a real treat.  If you just casually enjoy sci-fi movies, you should get a kick outta this...but if you totally dislike these kinds of films, you may want to check out something else--but I STILL think its worth a look.  All in all a fantastic and funny romp through the Universe.	5.0	A HILARIOUS send up of Star Trek's obsessive fans	2000-12-13	2	2	0

Tim Allen plays the actor who played the ego-maniac captain, sound like a  certain actor from Star Trek? Sigourney Weaver plays the beautiful blond  who plays the tight-uniform wearing actress from Galaxy Quest.  Which she  only gets interviews about her cleavage and not her career.  All the cast  members are suddenly swept away to another world where they must do what  they been acting like they were doing on TV years ago, in order to save  these alien's world.

You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this but it will certainly triple the entertainment if you are. The plot is nothing unusual, but the scripting was brilliant,  smart and very witty. Great casting too! Who could convince themselves that  Sigourney Weaver can play such a &quot;good bimbo&quot;, after being so  saturated with Alien, Aliens, Aliens3 and Aliens4 all these years? I nearly  rolled off the chair laughing when she came in bubbly jumping around and  repeating after the computer!This show is a spoof but it doesn't fall  into the category of cheap, slapstick.

It's clever, hysterically funny, well acted, and all around good fun.  The whole family can enjoy it but it's not condescending.  Particularly funny are Sam Rockwell and Tony Shaloub - they steal every scene they are in (whether together or alone)!

It is fun and anyone who has ever been to a Trek convention can so identify with the backdrop. Tim Allen is great as a washed up egomaniac who thinks everyone still loves him when actually they think he is a joke. Allen Rickman never gets out of costume and it is so great seeing him in a comedy after seeing him as Professor Snape!

Looking closer at the actors talking, I could see numerous occasions upon which the visual shows one thing, the audio says another.

TheThermians have the show mistaken for historical documents thus thinkingthat everything on the show really happend. Now the former cast findthemselves doing battle with an evil alien named Sarris on a ship thathas everything the ship on the series had, the only problem is thatthey're just actors that don't know how to use the real ship. Tim Allen, Alan Rickmanand Enrico Colantoni are very good in the movie. I thought Enrico dida great job as the leader of the Thermians, he was very funny and kidlike, he was very beleivable as a not too bright alien and I mean thatin a good way. Galaxy Questis the best zany Science Fiction film since Men in Black, if only movieslike these were made more often.

It remained perhaps truer to the essence of the old Star Trek TV shows than any of the Star Trek Movies I had seen, and managed at the same time to be a stirring redemption story that had me cheering at the end. A must-see for all Star Trek fans, and a movie that non-Trekkies will really enjoy as well.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AB2U893HHHG74	John DiBello	[This review is for the DVD version] I'll agree with and double every praise other reviewers have given this movie--a fun and funny family movie with great special effects, wonderfully acted (sometimes hilariously hammy  acting!), with a double appeal not only to people who like fantasy  adventure but also to the huge &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom who'll see the  only-slightly distorted versions of Shatner, Nimoy, Nicholls, Doohan etc.,  in an adventure we only *wish* they could have had! But I also have to give  much praise and thanks to the developers and designers of the DVD version  of this film for its incredibly fun extras: a healthy selection of deleted  scenes, a silly but fun &quot;Omega 13&quot; menu option, but best of all,  once you've watched the whole film in English, you can go back, choose the  language option, and watch the entire movie dubbed in Thermian...the movie's  fictional alien language that sounds like something between a whale call  and Andy Kaufman. Pointless? Maybe. Fun? Absolutely! For this goofy option  alone this deserves to get an award for innovative DVD of the year...and  shows that deep down, the moviemakers had a heckauva lot of fun creating  this movie and DVD...almost as much as we do watching it over and over again.	5.0	The galaxy&#65533;s first Thermian-dubbed DVD!	2000-05-06	3	3	0

The whole plot is wildly funny, and the actors are all great falling back into their reprised roles albeit more flesh than they would ever intend on. You never get tired of them running into one adventure or absurd insanity after another,like when Sigorny Weaver says Whoever wrote this should be killed! after confronting the mashers protecting the neutron reactor. BTW speaking of Sigorny, she never looked so Good, incredible.This movie was such a pleasant surprise and having just seen it again after what must be 9 years!!!!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A153MVFR0FTI6O	John Nelson	SPACEBALLS was a terrific goof on sci-fi movies.  GALAXY QUEST takes it a step further by not only parodying sci-fi TV shows but the obbsessive fans and cult stardom that usually follows not to mention the relationships of  the cast members and how sometimes more often or not, their careers can  fizzle after the show.  In the film, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a popular  early 80's Sci-Fi space adventure show much like Star Trek that was also  cancelled despite high popularity.  Years later the wash-up actors who  starred in the show make their money by making corny public appearances and  attending endless conventions all the time signing hundreds of autographs  to loving fans and being shoved out of the spotlight by the shows hero and  glory hog played by Tim Allen.  Meanwhile a group of aliens called  Thermians have been watching for many years the show &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot; and have mistaken it for &quot;Hisotrical Documents&quot; of  famous space heroes.  Fashioning their culture and technology after that of  the show they ask the actors for help in vanquishing a vile space alien  named Sariss.  With no choice but to help the Thermians and as a way to  kill the insane tedium that has become their life, the actors all  &quot;beam aboard&quot; and do their best against Sariss despite the fact  that none of them have a clue what they are doing or have any idea what  they have gotten themselves into.  There are a lot of funny parts in the  film such as where the crew try to work the ships transportaion device on  Tim Allen's character, or Alan Rickman's performance as one of the actors  who hates what his life has become-saying the same stupid catchphrase and  donning his old makeup over and over again at conventions.  To end, GALAXY  QUEST is a fun Sci-Fi movie as well as a great comedy and parody movie  rolled into an entertaining package.	4.0	Spaceballs 2-sort of	2000-06-27	1	0	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	ARNWCLQZFQECA	John Paquette	This is a funny and touching comedy which pits classical hero-worship against modern cynicism to profound effect.Tim Allen is brilliant as Micheal Nesmith, a washed-up actor stuck (with the help of his many adoring fans) in his glory days of playing TV starship Captain Peter Quincy Taggart.Nesmith's costars have had quite enough of his ego-tripping, when Nesmith discovers that he and his costars have fans *in another galaxy* -- fans who believe Peter Quincy Taggart and his crew are *real heroes*.This gimmick alone is brilliant -- but there's no way it could possibly carry the movie without a lot of excellent scripting and acting.

Yes, it has a few plot holes big enough to drive a D'deridex-class Romulan Warbird through. But the scriptwriting overall is excellent, the cast-typing first-rate, the special effects top-notch (not least those necessary to transform Sigourney Weaver into Gwen DeMarco), the acting worthy of the technical expertise and vice versa, and the respect for the phenomenon of Trekkie fandom genuine. Perhaps best of all, the DVD has extra features that add much to the product without being overwhelming (like those endless director comments in some of the Star Trek DVDs). It makes me wish that someone really would start up a Galaxy Quest TV series with all the original cast and the elements of parody firmly intact -- and put it on the Sci-Fi Channel, if necessary."	5.0	"Or as it could've been called, ""Galaxy Improvement"" @:-)"	2005-01-16	10	9	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3S71WW0FEU9DR	Jonathan M. Davis	"** This review contains spoilers. **Star Trek couldn't ask for a better parody. The film makes good fun of both the actors and characters of Star Trek: The Original Series, and several elements of The Next Generation as well. All of the unique traits are twisted and exaggerated. The TOS miniskirts are made fun of with Sigourney Weaver's cleavage. Spock (and his actor, Leonard Nemoy) is teased by a tired, hilariously ornery old grump who plays an alien with rubbery fleshy makeup who has grown weary of his oft-repeated line that everyone except himself loves. Captain James Kirk's actor Bill Shatner is poked at with all the headiness and candor of the character he played. Helmsman Sulu was portrayed by a young black kid who falls out of his chair screaming hilariously like a panicking woman when under stress. But I almost fell out of my chair in laughter when ship's engineer Scotty is portrayed in this parody by a gentle guy who nervously quotes engineering news from the engine room and asks for a group hug.The plot of the story starts off with these guys really are actors in a TV series, just like the actors of Star Trek, and they're maintaining a living by attending Star Trek conventions--er, I mean, Galaxy Quest conventions--and giving fans what they want. And it turned out that real aliens from outer space who have been receiving the television broadcast, not realizing that we human beings like to act--that is, pretend, for fun--thought the show was ""historical documents"" of humankind, specifically of the Galaxy Quest ""crew"", and they went about reproducing the whole ship and all of its technology. Their intent is to get the Galaxy Quest ""crew"" to intervene in an interplanetary conflict.These friendly aliens have technology that changes their appearance to look human. They hardly understand how to walk, and they talk like children with stage fright. And with the technology turned off or disabled, they're gigantic alien octopuses with yodeling voices. Think about this for a moment. Star Trek TOS encounters with aliens typically took on humanoid egos and demigods. That's it. So imagine seeing some yodeling octopuses running up to a confused Galaxy Quest ""crew"" who have no idea what's going on and are utterly speechless.Star Trek fans are made fun of no less. They also become co-heroes of the movie.If there's one thing to down-vote the movie for, it's the unconvincing threat. The villain--which makes fun of Klingons--is boring and neither intimidating nor funny, though it seems that the filmmakers tried for both by using villain cliches at full blast. Speaking of cliches, this movie is full of them, intentionally.There is some youthful nerdy sci-fi charm and entertainment, too. The idea of seeing a show come to real life is fun. The best part? Undocking from the docking station, and not quite clearing the walls ... as metal scrapes, .... sqeeeeeeeeeaaaakk ...

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AN55VVQSWHGCA	Jon Bjorling	Galaxy Quest isn't a bad movie.  In fact, it's very fun and humorous.  The plot, after protecting the universe for four years, the cast of Galaxy Quest have fallen victim to their roles.  No longer considered actors, they  are forced to attend endless conventions filled with the most die-hard of  fans.  Then a race of aliens facing genocide requests help.  Beliving that  these aliens are nothing more than fans who are offering a job, they  accept.  One of the best things about this film is how Galaxy Quest takes  the conventions of Star Trek and similar shows and exploits them.  One  example is from one actor who believes that he is the glorified extra who  will die a horrible death, only because no one knows his last name.  If you  like (or hate) Star Trek you'll love this movie.	4.0	A Galaxy of Adventure	2000-05-04	1	1	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1Q0UFY6YKH3V	Jon Eric Davidson	I was a bit skeptical about seeing &quot;GalaxyQuest&quot; after some mixed reviews and the so-so history of Tim Allen's other movies (the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films excluded). But I had a great time watching this  movie.The references and comparisons to &quot;Star Trek&quot; are  obvious throughout: an ego-driven star (Allen), the conventions full of  rabid, costumed fans, and some of the space sequences chief among them.  Granted, some of the hard-core &quot;Trek&quot; fans may be put off by this  parody, but I would have to believe that more often than not, most would  have a great time watching this film.Tim Allen is good playing his role  with shades of William Shatner. Sigourney Weaver is enjoyable as the the  ditzy blonde with no real function on the ship. Alan Rickman, as usual,  provides some great laughs. But my personal favorite is the performance of  Tony Shaloub, who provides some of the funniest moments of the film with  his low-key, nothing-fazes-me style.There are some elements, as in all  comedies, that are dumb, and there are parts of this film that are a bit  slow. But all in all, this is an enjoyable film for just about all ages.  And yes, even the Trekkies should enjoy it.	4.0	A fun movie that even Trekkies can laugh with	2000-05-11	4	3	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	What happens when the only good part of your acting career was a show that was cancelled many years before?  Well, if it was a science fiction show, you can relive your character at science fiction conventions.  That is what has happened to the cast of Galaxy Quest and they are not particularly happy about it.  Then they get a second chance.Aliens far out in space have intercepted Earth's television signals.  As they have no concept of fiction, they believe the shows are reality.  They have decided to base their society on that seen in Galaxy Quest.  They are peaceful but at war with another species that is anything but.  They think their only hope is the crew from Galaxy Quest.  They have seen them defeat evil on countless occasions.  They have now come to Earth to enlist the crew.The cast finds themselves in a real life and death struggle deep in space.  While they know they are only actors, they get talked into helping.  Plot complications, humor, and plenty of action keep the ball rolling right to the end.  What could easily have been a movie based on one bad joke is really so much more.  Science fiction fans will get a lot of in jokes and cliches but non-fans can also enjoy the movie fully.  A truly fun film.	5.0	Cancelled But Still Going	2005-07-07	3	3	0

Beyond that, Tim Allen's character is a parody of William Shatner, and the relationships are a lot funnier if you understand how they reflect the real-life relationships of the Star Trek cast.That said, this is a movie that even non-Trekkies will enjoy; it's probably just more like a 3.5-star movie for them.	5.0	Hilarious fun for Trekkies	2007-11-21	0	0	0

When their society is threatened by a large,  slimy warlord, they call upon the fictional captain and his crew to save  them, beaming up the bickering has-beens who played on the show.  Can these  egocentric actors find the inner strength to beat the bad guy?I'm sure  you know the answer, but don't let that stop you.  Galaxy Quest is  hyper-fun, especially for Star Trek fans but fine for noninitiates as well.  The script pokes fun at ST conventions, Shatnerian egos, and poor  production values, but doesn't betray an inherent love for all of those  things as well.  The teasing is laser-precise, but light-hearted.Don't  miss Tim Allen riffing on his macho persona, Sigourney Weaver as a blonde  (!) who plays second fiddle to her bosom, and the alien race of Thermians,  who are convincingly awkward in their human disguises.  Also note the  incredible creature design, from bad guy Serris to a bunch of pint-sized  miners to the psychedelic Thermians.I can't imagine anyone taking the  plot seriously.  We don't believe for a second that Allen and crew are  going to fail in their mission.  But that doesn't stop the laugh-laden  script from careening amiably to its predictable end.Guaranteed for  plenty of laughs and even more smiles, Galaxy Quest may be a lightweight,  but is certainly the best of that class.	4.0	Sweet, funny froth.	2000-08-29	3	2	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2GB5CG77LGQRB	Jublistic	Galaxy QuestScore: 75/100Galaxy Quest is a crowd-pleasing comedy which did surprisingly well with the critics and movie-goer's alike. It boasts a flashy cast and awesome set decoration, and is an original and watchable comedy that deserves the good-word it's got, and will continue to get.Eighteen years after their sci-fi adventure show &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was cancelled, actors Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), and Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) are making appearances at sci-fi conventions and store openings in costume and character. They're wallowing in despair and at each other's throats until aliens known as Thermians arrive and, having mistook the show for fact and consequently modeling their entire culture around it, take them into space to save them from the genocidal General Sarris and his armada.Galaxy Quest is quite simply one of the funniest movies of recent memory, and although it is pretty much a forgettable movie, it remains a spot-on Star Trek spoof which gets better with every minute. The Thermian's are a laugh, and all the actors are great; especially Sigourney Weaver as Gwen, she really needed that spice, that enchantment and that suit. The make-up for Alan Rickman is stunning and the CGI effects are sometimes stunning.Hilarious and continuously watchable, Galaxy Quest is a fun and adventurous movie which should not be missed by all audiences who just want to have a good time.	4.0	Hilarious and watchable	2001-03-24	5	5	0

Tim Allen plays a wonderful starshipcommander, and Alan Rickman is great as Dr. Lazarus !  I also loved Tech Sergeant (Tony Shaloub).  He is totally believable inhis techie sort of character who overcomes his fear of ""real"" technology because of love.  Justin Long is also fantastic as the nerdyGalaxy Quest groupie who saves the day when the ship is out of control.  This definitely is a must see movie.  It is also a terrific parodyof Star Trek groupies--costumes and make-up included.  And of course, who can forget Sigourney Weaver as the lovely Gwen DeMarco,whose only job was to reiterate what ever the computer replied to questions.

I read that this went up against Stewart little at the time so they cut a bunch of the more adult themed scenes and removed the swearing for example you can clearly see that in a scene with Tim Allen and Sigorney weaver she originally went to say the &#34;f&#34;  word and they later overdubbed it with &#34;screw that&#34; instead. I've often wondered if the movie would have been better without the sanitization and censoring, but it's still very entertaining as is.	5.0	Still great after all these years, wish they'd work on a sequel!	2014-03-27	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1V176RDEFNDXO	Kafishna	I watched it first about ten years ago. Laughed then, and have laughed just now, harder this time. However, as watching for the second time,to me, the movie seems to have a serious undertone that is uniquely American--a craving to believe in something unbelievable by most, striving to absorb the absurd as part of reality, a belief in goodness and paradoxically, having no problem upholding the positive with the spear of the negative. The naive, childlike scenarios has an appeal of second chance, an appeal to good yet to come despite bad things, an appeal to the odd motto:&#34; if you can fake it, you can make it.&#34; Sorry about so much serious talk, but it's a good show. Of course, I highly doubt the director thought about any of the above high-brow lines while making it, but, cultural core that generated that production is simply American.	5.0	"Funny, absurd, cute, nonsense and yes, hopelessly as well as ""hopefuly"", American"	2013-12-18	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AU8C496DUFA0V	Kari	In short, this film has to be one of the most ingenius works of comedic brilliance I've ever seen on screen.  I was thoroughly impressed by how utterly witty--and simply hilarious this movie is.  I rented this movie, expecting it to be stupid, but was so impressed that I had to buy it on DVD to watch again and again and again.If you're like me and was totally unimpressed by the iditoic toilet and sex humor of the disappointing and over-hyped &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; &quot;GalaxyQuest&quot; ought to cure you, even if it can't give you your money back for wasting it on &quot;Scary Movie.&quot;And you don't have to like &quot;Star Trek&quot; to understand or appreciate this movie.  &quot;GalaxyQuest&quot; is for anyone looking for a clever spoof, complete with state-of-the-art special effects.&quot;GalaxyQuest&quot; stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub (of the sitcom &quot;Wings&quot;), Sam Rockwell (&quot;The Green Mile,&quot; &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;), and Daryl Mitchell (umm...the teacher in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;) as a group of washed out actors from a 70's TV show called &quot;GalaxyQuest&quot;.Each and every one is hilarious in their respective roles.  I especially love how Sigourney Weaver's character is the big-chested, blonde bimbo, which is such a contrast to her Ripley character from the &quot;Alien&quot; movies.If you see no other spoof or comedy, you have to watch &quot;GalaxyQuest.&quot;  I promise you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Clever, Witty, Brilliant!	2001-01-27	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1GZXVLCYY3LFI	"Kasper Michelsen ""Alcibiades"""	I guess part of the secret behind the success of this movie - on the artistic front - is that it's not really to say whether it wants to pay homage to Star Trek or make fun of it. A bit of both, I suppose. Hidden in what would be an unusually stupid and cheesy plot is a group of splendidly talented actors, completely out of place - and possibly therefore doing their characters perfect. Who would ever imagine Sigourney Weaver as the extremely blond crew member with extremely tight fitting suit showing her, well, very womanly forms - whoes only job on the ship is to repeat what the computer sais? The last detail was one I found priceless.Another fine detail is the absolute irony in the extremely low-budget look of the equipment the main characters have and the aliens in their human forms - especially their ridiculous suites - and then the absolutely breath taking special effects used on the aliens when they are in outer space.Against all odds, this movie just WORKS! If I should compare it to anything, it would be The Fifth Element, but unlike the former, this movie never really got the attention at the box office it desserved. Which is not to say that this movie is less good than the former! Don't miss it.	5.0	Surprisingly funny and successfull.	2006-03-26	4	3	1

We had a blast laughing ourselves hoarse and no one could tell us to shut  up.  At one point my friend laughed so hard he almost headed himself on the  chair in front of him.This film was a terrific send-up of Trek and its  fan base.  Poking fun without skewering, it takes a very satirical look at  sci-fi and our fascination with it.  (Being a trekker myself, my friends  pointed to the screen about every three minutes and said, &quot;There you  are!&quot;)Buy it.  Definitely buy it.

We'retalking a bunch of grown people wrapped themselves up like snausages and put chains on their tires just to go see this movie! In short, Galaxy Quest is a blast!The plot is deceptively simple: cast of cheesy Star Trek type TV show gets mistaken for the Real Thing by a bunch of sweet aliens, This movie is full of Star Trek/Next Generation/Babylon 5 humor.  Every Trek stereotype is present and accounted for: the macho commander, the kid genious com guy, the busty computer girl, Chief, and the emotionless alien -- who is played by a Brit. Of course. There's also the Expendable Extra. You know the one. And of course, there are endlessly-repeated catch-phrases that the cast never wants to hear/say/ think of again. Ever. Galaxy Quest also pokes fun at fandom; but its really very wise in its portayal of &quot;questies&quot; -- who, of course, are an homage to Trekkies. Sure, the fans are &quot;abi normal&quot; but they are also smart, able to network and act under stress and are downright necessary to the survival of The Universe as We Know It.In Galaxy Quest, there are many layers and nothing is as it appears. But the message is clear: if you work as a team towards a common goal and actually care about doing the right thing, you can and will succeed. No matter how insane the situation.I whole-heartedly reccommend Galaxy Quest to anyone who appreciates Trek, fandom and alien pig lizards. Oh, and &quot;Mundanes&quot; will like it, too.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2O3HUMA1EAIV9	Keith Fraser	I love send-ups and parodies, and this movie pushed all the right buttons. As a fan of science fiction and fantasy (though not quite as ardent as some of those portrayed in the film, thank goodness), I know what it's like to obsess over completely pointless little details in fiction just for the fun of it.The premise of the movie is perfect, and hilarious in itself. The hero-worshipping aliens, with full confidence in the drunken Tim Allen, are a hoot, and the contemptuous, stereotypicallly evil villain is a great counterpoint and straight-man.The people playing the ex-cast of the TV show are all great too, especially Alan Rickman as the Shakespearean actor doomed to endlessly repeat a riduculous catch-phrase line to adoring fans. I also loved the former extra who spends the entire movie convinced he's about to die, and the technician-type bloke who falls for the female alien. Also funny was the way they all gradually crept into the roles they played in the series.Both the overall plot and the individual situations work well. I particularly enjoyed the bits where the crazed fans back on Earth helped out, and the very clever coda at the end.Funniest piece of dialogue (possibly):  &quot;You don't think Gilligan's Island is real, do you?&quot; &quot;Those poor people, stranded so far from home...&quot;Watch this movie and brighten up your day - definitely one of the best comedies I've seen.	5.0	One of the funniest movies I've ever seen	2001-01-23	1	1	0

People were walking out of the theater in droves the way that they used to walk out of Antonioni's L'AVVENTURA, unable to take in the  slightest detail due to a mental fog having set into their brains.  You know what numbskulls the US public are, and how nobody ever went broke underestimating them.  Well, writer Dean Parisot somehow made us sit up and pay attention and for once a ""high concept"" approach to metafiction paid off in a big way.  Part of it was his concern for establishing the characters, the actors whom we come to love despite their general egotism (Tim Allen), narrow view of life (Sigourney Weaver), distaste for all things American (Alan Rickman), etc.  On top of that, like a celluloid gel, was added our memories of STAR TREK and other cult shows, and on top of that, our generalized knowledge of fan bases--for even if we're not uberfans ourselves, we like to poke fun at those who are.  However in this case, the fans themselves become heroic in a genuinely surprising and resonant way, led by the redoubtable Justin Long (so funny when his mother pressures him to take out the trash, while he's in the middle of saving an entire universe from slavery and collapse).The actors are all uniformly good, except that this time around I was sort of ""not so great"" about Sam Rockwell, who seemed to be hamming it up for no reason, though his part (as a bit player on the original show, ""Crewman #2) was perhaps more shallowly executed than the others and he might have felt he had to make up for it by a trunkload of smirks and gapes.  Oh well, what would there be left to criticize if everything was perfect and everyone else practically was!  Poor Tim Allen, imagine knowing that you had once appeared in a great movie like GALAXY QUEST and now you're making WILD HOGS, though I'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank.And I didn't recognize Keith Mars until that spaceman makeup until the very last reel!"	5.0	Galaxy Quest	2008-03-23	2	2	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A34PNHKNM05TXD	Kevin P. Westmoreland	Galaxy Quest was the most fun I have had watching a movie in a long time.  My wife also enjoyed it and she is not a sci-fi fan.  That is the point with this movie.  You don't have to like science fiction, although it does  help with some of the more subtle references.Tim Allen plays the actor  playing Commander Taggert with ease, moving from a self-centered washout to  genuine hero in the span of less than two hours.  Alan Rickman delivers his  gems of dialogue with gusto - much as he did in Die Hard.  And Sigourney  Weaver is fun to watch as Gwen Demarco who has &quot;only one job on this  ship.  It's stupid, but I'm going to do it.&quot;The anamorphic  widescreen is crystal clear and the special effects in the film are better  than some I have seen in more &quot;serious&quot; sci-fi films.  The Dolby  Digital 5.1 soundtrack is fun and a decent demo for your sound system.The disk includes some nice extra features.  A featurette on the making  of the film shows that the set of Galaxy Quest was probably as much fun to  be on as the movie is to watch.  And a series of deleted scenes are  included, some of which might have made decent additions to the final  film.All-in-all a very satisfying experience and another nice value from  Dreamworks.	4.0	More fun than a barrel full of Vulcans!	2000-05-11	2	1	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; gives sci-fi lovers a swift, but soft and loving, kick in the pants.  It is dead-on with its parody of sci-fi television, the actors involved, and the herds of loving fans who, admittedly, do take their science fiction just a little too seriously.  If your a fan of shows such as &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;Farscape,&quot; or &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; you'll definitely identify with this movie.What makes this movie so unique, however, is the fact that it uses the sometimes fanatic behavior of sci-fi fans who take their favorite shows too seriously and puts that passion in actual aliens who believe the crew of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are real.It pokes fun at just about every stereotypical sci-fi fan.  From youngsters who argue over certain inaccuracies about the ship with the &quot;captain&quot; to average looking folks trying to mimic their favorite vixen from the show, it's all here.  Overacting, underappreciated and Shakespearian-trained co-stars fed up with miserable catch phrases, child-stars trying to break from the past, etc.  The stereotypes overflow.As a science fiction film, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; stands quite well on its own.  The special effects are brilliant considering this is plugged as a comedy.  The acting is superb, especially Sigourney Weaver, who pulls off being a dim-bulb blonde in great contrast of other characters she has played.  Tim Allen, Tony Shalhoub and the rest of the cast are perfect.This is a fun film worth owning, especially if you love your science fiction with a great story and brilliant visuals.Highly recommended.	4.0	Intergalactic Silliness	2004-01-28	1	1	0

The jokes had my boyfriend and I giggling for days.  The special affects are good and there's plenty of action.The only down side to this film are the appearances of the pig monster and the alien enemy. The pig monster looks exactly like what it is--a man in costume.  The enemy looked like a variant of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  In contrast, the baby aliens (obviously computer generated) were fabulous.  Both their look and their movements were superb.  Fortunately, the appearance of the pig monster is brief and it doesn't take much from the overall feel of the film.  I was able to thoroughly enjoy the movie and would love to see it again.

I have been watching this for two or three years.  Its got a lot of heart,  the obvious reference to the cast of Star Trek makes it funnier,  but its funny anyway.  The music is also sweet,  the choir that sings when great things are suddenly realized,  the flight through space,  the death of a friend.  While the lizard bad guy is hokey,  badly so,  i guess the original star trek bad guys were hokey.  But this is the onlyplace where it doesnt really work,  neither the voice nor the make up of the bad guy is right and we are taken out of the fantasy of the naive visitors from far away worlds who believe in tv shows as if they are real,  and create a whole possible world from every detail of the episodes of Galaxy Quest.  Tim and Rick are good,  but Signorney is really funny,  and as usual Sam Rockwell makes the film.  'Did you guys even Watch the show?&#34; he pleads... and you can tell he has watched everything about the show,  his character within a character honed in quite perfectly.  its fun,  watch it.  i think you'll enjoy it.	5.0	Surprisingly sweet,  funny and enduring	2012-11-26	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L	"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip"""	How could anyone not love this movie? What's not to love? I was skeptical at first about seeing this, as I am not a big sci-fi, Trek, or Tim Allen fan, but then I read several reviews that I trusted and decided what the  heck. One said it was &quot;critic proof&quot; and they were right! Someone  else compared it to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (as far as people's reactions  to it, and sort of the genre) and I agree with that too...as I said, all I  know about Star Trek I read in some Harlan Ellison books and Nichelle  Nichol's autobiography.  I never really was a fan of this show-didn't hate  it, but not my thing. And I still absolutely loved this movie! 1,000 words  are not enough for me to tell you all the great things about Galaxy  Quest-you have to see it for yourself. I can only imagine how much a fan of  the show would have loved it-and would get all the in jokes (I got some,  but I'm sure I missed plenty). I have more respect for Allen now as a  performer, he did a great job (and a great Shatner!).  Sigourney Weaver  looked gorgeous, the best I've ever seen her look in fact. I especially  respect a movie that casts a female love interest opposite the lead male  WHO IS ACTUALLY THE SAME AGE AS HIM. In fact, instead of being 20+ years  younger as the norm is, I think at 52 she's even OLDER than he is. Good for  them! Too bad that's so rare these days. Another nice feature is there's no  swearing worse than you would hear on prime-time TV in the film, but it's  still funny as hell. Alan Rickman was great, as the classically trainer  Actor who will puke if he has to say his trademark line (&quot;by  Grabthar's Hammer...&quot;) one more time. I knew there would be a moment  where he would voluntarily say it, and mean it, and I was right. The moment  when Rickman utters it, meaning every word for the first time in his life,  will make you cheer (and also get a little choked up). If you've ever been  lovingly, obsessively devoted to any TV show, (I have) like the fans in the  movie are, then this movie will definitely strike a chord with you. You'll  know just how the fans feel when they can easily bring up trivia that even  the actors on the show don't know or have forgotten, or when Allen's  character needs a fan-boy's help and tells him &quot;It's all real!&quot;,  and the fanboy's reaction-well-I'm starting to sound like Harry Knowles  here, but the kid's ecstatic reaction made the audience I saw the film with  go nuts and really hit home with me. By the way, the audience, which  included more adults than kids, actually stood up and clapped when the  movie was over-haven't seen that for a while! If you're a Trekkie-uh, I  mean Trekker- don't worry about this movie jeering at or making fun of you.  It treats the fans with humor but lovingly and with respect. It's not  super-deep, it doesn't have an Important Message other than the obvious  ones (work as a team, help out your friends, and of course &quot;Never give  up...Never Surrender!&quot;), it's probably not something that will be  nominated for an award (too bad). But it's great, hilarious, fun  entertainment for pretty much any and all. If you want to  &quot;escape&quot; for 90 minutes or so this is the movie for you, one of  those movies that transports you and is so entertaining that you get so  caught up you forget about everything else other than the flick. You can't  go wrong- take my word for it.	5.0	&quot;It doesn't take a good actor to recognize a bad one!&quot;	2000-06-15	5	4	1

Incorporating the science fiction fan base into the story line is very original.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"Take one short-run imaginative but low-budget sci-fi TV show from the '60s that has developed a huge but geeky fan base since its cancellation and a race of innocent hero-worshipping cephalopod aliens called Thermians, who think that the random electromagnetic leakage of episodes through Earth's atmosphere are ""historical documents"" beamed at them for the purpose of remaking their own culture, add an ALIEN-like genocidal alien named Saris dedicated to destroying the Thermians, toss in Tim Allen of HOME IMPROVEMENT, Sigourney Weaver (a VERY busty Sigourney Weaver), Alan Rickman of DIE HARD, Tony Shaloub of WINGS and MONK, and blend---You get not STAR TREK, but GALAXY QUEST, an affectionate and never patronizing comedic send-up of every Boomer's once-favorite Live Long and Prosper space soap, in which the sick-to-death-of-being-typecast cast are suddenly recast as true heroes after they are hijacked from a fan convention in order to save the galaxy.Laughter is not just an option, it's the only option. To enjoy GALAXY QUEST it isn't necessary to be a STAR TREK fan (the film is funny on its own terms), but the in-jokes are far more pungent if the viewer is or ever was, a fan:Allen plays the overdramatic and occasionally bare-chested Captain who veers between heroics and bemusement, fistfights good guys and bad guys both, seduces any available female, falls down an air duct with Weaver (""Why is it always an air duct?""), and somehow avoids being mashed in an antigravity pile driver of some sort.Weaver's cleavage-ridden female Deck Officer, Lt. Tawny Madison, is an homage to Grace Lee Whitney and every other pretty actress who was forced to pour herself into one of Gene Roddenberry's micro-mini maxi-mammary female crew costumes.Rickman's frustrated Shakespearean-actor-turned-crest-headed-Second Officer will be instantly recognizable, as will the dysfunctional matter transformer that reassembles lifeforms inside out so that they explode. The ship's secret weapon is something or other called Omega-13 (isn't that a vitamin pill?)The obligatory nameless crewman who dies before the intro sequence is there, and as forgettable as always, though he does refuse to do random thises and thats along the way, because, he is, after all, ""gonna die"" if he does anything.Shaloub, plays the Engineering Officer, but as the actor who plays the Engineering Officer he can't manage to sharpen a pencil without spraining his wrist: ""I am not that guy!"" He does successfully fall in love with a Thermian.Add to this the cast's constant collapsing of the fourth wall as they remember it's all a show---""Didn't we do this in Episode 16?"" ""There is no solution? Right?""A certain brand of self-serious Trekkie/Trekkers will probably not laugh at GALAXY QUEST, but since such individuals are usually too busy circling Uranus to get a life, they should be sent to that Convention Hall with padded walls, and left there to beam themselves up.For the rest of us, GALAXY QUEST is a charming parodious visit to that old familiar strange new world and new civilization we all know and love."	4.0	"""We Patterned Our Entire Culture Upon The Historic Documents You Sent Us."""	2008-01-13	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2OMVPRBFX8403	Krishna Sampath	If you have ever watched Star Trek (either TOS or TNG), you will appreciate this loving parody. Tim Allen hams it up in classic Captain Kirk fashion as Jason Nesmith, who starred as Commander James Quincy Taggert in the 70s-era show &#34;Galaxy Quest.&#34; Decades after the show's cancellation, his fellow actors scrape out a living by traveling the convention circuit, doing pathetically sad endorsements (as for example, an electronics store opening), while Nesmith reaps most of the glory, appearing to relish the thought that the show's fans take the whole thing &#8211;including his performance as Commander of the NSEA Protector (the spaceship)  &#8211;all too seriously.When a group of real aliens, who, like many of the fans, don't understand that &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; was a TV show for entertainment (and not &#34;historical documents&#34; as they.The plot is fairly simple from there, and poses little in the way of direct surprise.  But that's not the point.The point is to enjoy how the film's creators were able to so effectively lampoon &#34;Star Trek&#34; and its associated culture, while still clearly endorsing many aspects of it. In the end, the heroes really are heroes, the nerdy kids do wind up playing a role, and the bad alien gets exactly the type of comeuppance you would wish for. Having never been to a convention, I can't imagine they're ever as exciting as the final convention scene... but I imagine that it's exactly what any rabid fan of a series would wish for.What makes this movie so entertaining to watch is as the actors begin to slide into the character roles they were associated with, even when those were so clearly far from their personalities. The movie itself plays with, subverts, and deconstructs just about every established trope within the typical sci fi canon, with even characters commenting on bizarre sci fi tropes (&#34;There's no useful purpose for a bunch of chompy, crushy things in the middle of a hallway... it makes no logical sense!&#34;).Watch this movie if you're into sci fi of any stripe, or just a fan of campy, silly movies in general. &#34;By Grabthar's Hammer,&#34; you'll love it!	5.0	Thoroughly entertaining (and loving!) send-up of Trek	2014-07-05	0	0	0

And Tim Allen, whose character is reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear, is great with a good script to work with after being in countless rubbish movies (Does anyone remember The Santa Clause?). And Sigourney Weaver is suitably feisty as the ...female on board.But the really great standout performance is Enrico Colantoni, as one of the clueless aliens who thinks the team's TV show is real documentary footage of the group's adventures in space. The all of them get zapped up into outer space and uproarious mayhem ensues.It's just such fun, and with a great ensemble cast, Galaxy Quest is an outstanding comedy that stands to repeat viewings in order to uncover all the subtle gags and jokes. Effects maestro Stan Winston's alien creations are fantastic and David Newman's score adds a heroic feel to the film. The DVD is great too, with excellent sound, picture and good extras.

My only warning would be if you are not a Star Trek devotee you will miss part of the effect.  It should still be funny and enjoyable unless you just don't like science fiction genre at all.  My wife and I used to host Star Trek parties at our apartment as college students when it first appeared on TV (yes, we are that old) so the satire brought back many pleasant memories of good times and old friends.  Many of our discussions played around the same points that Quest makes use of:  Kirk could always find a reason to take his shirt off, never be an unknown crew member on an away mission, some of the uselessly weird gadgetry etc.  Just relax and enjoy.	5.0	A fun movie - nothing to think about, just enjoy.	2012-10-29	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2NYP1VC6FOFER	Larry Zieminski	When the previews for this movie came out, I wasn't interested.  It looked like it was going to be a dumb spoof of Star Trek.  Luckily, I decided to see it anyway, because it is an excellent comedy.  I believe Star Trek fans  will get the most enjoyment out of it (particularly fans of the Original  Star Trek).  Some of my friends who don't watch Star Trek felt it was too  slow and didn't get many of the jokes.The video quality on this DVD is  stunning.  Dreamworks is quickly becoming one of the better studios in  terms of DVD quality.  I could not see any real flaws in this transfer.  The sound quality is good as well.  Unfortunately I picked up the Dolby  Digital release instead of the DTS release.  If you have the equiptment,  pick up the DTS release.There are a few extras on the disk, including  some interesting deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.  The Thermian  audio track is funny...for about 10 minutes.  I couldn't watch the whole  movie with all that screeching.  I only wish the cast and/or director had  done a commentary on this film.  I would have appreciated their incites  into the comedy/spoof genre.Bottom Line - If you are a fan of comedy and  Star Trek, you MUST watch this movie.  Not only is the plot good, but the  DVD is top notch as well.	4.0	Funny Movie, especially if you're a Star Trek Fan	2000-06-09	0	0	0

Witty, clever dialogue & great acting provide lots of laughs in this fast-paced parody. The plot is unique; a group of jaded actors clinging to what remains of their popularity & fame from almost 20 yrs.ago (via their roles as space travelers in a sci-fi TV program) by grudgingly showing up to sign autographs for die-hard fans at tech store ribbon cuttings & conventions, meet a crew of actual aliens at one of their signings. The aliens, naive & gullible to a fault (& brilliantly played to perfection by each cast member) believe that Earth's TV programs are &#34;historical documents&#34; & are seeking the help & &#34;expertise&#34; of the TV actors they think are astronauts, to negotiate with an evil alien enemy out to destroy them. They are beamed aboard the alien ship (an exact replica of the ship on the TV show, except everything actually works) & the mission begins. I don't want to give any &#34;spoilers&#34; so I'll leave you here... but I will reiterate my original statement: This is a fun, enjoyable adventure that I can wholeheartedly recommend to everyone. The acting is top-notch from everyone & apparently Sigourney Weaver has made a deal with the devil (or SOMEONE with a lot of clout,) I don't think she's ever looked more gorgeous~ absolutely ravishing!

I thought it would please everyone but me, as I am bored to  death by silly comedies. But the science fiction setting and the cast list  of talented actors gave me some hope that at least I wouldn't fall asleep  in front of the TV.  Now I am so glad I bought this movie and I keep  watching it again and again, finding more subtle jokes &amp; being  impressed each time by the director's great restraint &amp; the excellent  comic timing throughout the film. Dean Parisot could have easily taken this  film over the top, but instead he keeps the humor in check and the action  tight, not allowing himself or his actors to overindulge themselves in a  scene or a gag.  Sigourney Weaver proves that she can play a dumb blonde  &amp; still be smart, and I think Tony Shalhoub is glossed over too much in  other reviews of this film. His character is not dim; he's existential and  is played, again, with such subtlety &amp; restraint, that every scene with  him is a delight. The only troublesome scene for Shalhoub's character is  the one in which he must find the courage to digitize Commander Taggert up  from the planet's surface. The scene is not a stretch for Tony Shalhoub,  but it doesn't fit the character of a man who is entertained by a crash  landing in a space shuttle, then casually opens the door and steps out like  a trusting fool.  Bravo. I'm going out right now to find more films  directed by Dean Parisot and to see more of Tony Shalhoub.	5.0	Great restraint &amp; comic timing	2000-09-13	4	3	1

Cleavelin ""Random Techie and Polymath"""	"It's probably not a good idea to write a review just to take issue with Amazon's editorial review, but I have to say something about their characterization of Fred Kwan/Tech. Sgt. Chen (Tony Shaloub) as a ""dimwit"". Kwan/Chen isn't a dimwit, he's just very, very ""Type B""; a doctor would never sedate him, because that would merely be redundant.  That difference of opinion aside, this is one of the best sci-fi satires ever made. One of the reasons it is is that it works on two levels: on the one hand it satirizes Star Trek itself (watching Tim Allen manage to pull off parodies of both William Shatner/Capt. Kirk and Patrick Stewart/Capt. Picard at the same time is, I think, priceless) and on the other hand it satirizes the whole ""Trekker culture"". Both satires are affectionate, though, there's no ridicule here, and ultimately we realize that both feed on each other; the stars need their fans just as much as the fans need the stars of their favorite show. Wonderful acting by all the principals (in addition to Shaloub, Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are simply superb (and I hope I look even 1/4 as good as Weaver when I get to be her age), and the rest of the cast work together as a tightly knit ensemble).

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3KB1H0S7T6JX1	L Gontzes	"Galaxy Quest, brings to the screen the story of the cast of a Sci-Fi TV series that is down on its luck.  Things will become a bit more complicated when a group of genuine aliens arrives on earth and attempts to recruit the cast, believing that the show's episodes are actual historical records and that the characters are real heroes...Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.The only major setback is in relation to the ""friendly"" aliens being portrayed as morons.  Why?  What was the point of that?In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, the humor, and the music are all very good.Though not a masterpiece, Galaxy Quest is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."	4.0	"""Everyone...

Other movies can be watched repeatedly and only get more funny with each watching. Galaxy Quest definitely is a multi-watch movie!The basic plot is that the cast of a long-gone sci-fi series is living off the fan conventions. They are sick of each other but plod on for the cash. Suddenly, a group of space aliens - who thinks these actors are real spacemen - drag them into an interstellar war. The actors try their best to help out and to overcome their petty quarrels.The cast is stellar. Alan Rickman is hilarious as the serious alien played by a ""British Actor"". ""I had five curtain calls,"" he complains while sitting at yet another fan convention. The tiny details he pulls are are brilliant. Tony Shaloub, now best known for his up tight detective ""Monk"", is fantastic here as the kick-back, relaxed engineer. In one scene, they land on a strange planet and he blithely sticks his head out and smells the air to see if it's safe. Talk about an anti-Monk!Sigourney Weaver, one of the most famous actresses in the ""space world"" because of her Alien series, is fantastic here as the blonde, busty ""talker"" who was only on the show for her looks. All she gets to do is repeat the lines the computer says.There are definitely jokes here that make more sense if you've watched shows like Star Trek. One of the guys is convinced he'll die because he's the ""spare crewman"" and those extras are always killed off on shows like this. In another scene, the captain wildly does shoulder-rolls to approach the enemy. The other crew-members tease him about his showing off. The ""chompers"" which make no rational sense on a ship, and which Sigourney complains about quite vocally.There are just so many tiny details that you pick up on subsequent watchings. The way all the ""Thermians"" walk with wiggly hand movements, betraying their octopoid origins. The way the watching Thermians try to be brave and stay in place even while Laredo nearly crashes the spaceship into them. There are lines I laugh out loud at no matter how many times I've seen the movie. ""Rudimentary Lathe"" gets me every time :)The DVD doesn't have many extras - but I love that they have an ENTIRE soundtrack in Thermian! You can watch the entire movie with the squeaks and squalks of the Thermian language.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2NLIB986TEESZ	L. M Young	"While, as the Amazon description says, it's helpful to be a STAR TREK fan or at least know about the series while watching this film, since inside jokes like ""I see you got your shirt off"" may make little sense if you don't, one really doesn't even have to be a science-fiction fan to get a kick out of this movie. It is representative of fandom for any popular cultural icon, going back to when 19th century ""fan fiction"" sequels were written to Jane Austen novels, girls re-enacted memorable romantic poetry scenes (think the ""Lady of Shalott"" sequence in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES), and radio listeners sent baby booties and wedding gifts whenever a birth or marriage happened on their favorite soap opera.The characters, of course, are strong TREK/SF archetypes: the stalwart commander (who in real life is a ham actor who realizes how much of his present life is a shambles), the genius alien, the miraculous engineer who can fix anything, the obligatory sex symbol, the precocious kid, and the nervous extra who realizes that if life imitates art his life is forfeit.Tim Allen lends a poignant note to Jason Nesmith when he realizes his has-been status, and does a creditable turn as an (albeit bumbling) action hero. Alan Rickman is perfect as the exasperated Brit whose alien character is beloved, but who always will be second fiddle to Nesmith's charisma, and Sigourney Weaver fun as the ""eye candy"" crewman who wishes she had had more intelligent things to do on the ship but flash her boobs and talk to the computer. Robin Sachs, the creepy ""Ethan"" on the BUFFY series, turns in a bravura performance as the menacing Sarris. Daryl Mitchell as the grown-up child actor and Sam Rockwell as the gonzo extra Guy Fleegman also turn in great performances, Enrico Colatoni is delightful as Mathazar, leader of the alien Thermians pleading for help from Nesmith and his crew, Justin Long had the right combination of smarts and geekiness as the fannish Brandon, but my favorite character in this hilarious sendup is Fred Kwan, played by Tony Shaloub. He never loses his cool (well, except once), and faces ray guns, space ships, and aliens (even one with tentacles and a big smile) with phlegmatic aplomb.This film was the reason we went out and bought our original DVD player, and now the Blu-Ray version of GALAXY QUEST is better than ever, stunning, crisp picture and even better sound than was on the original DVD release. This film is a must for every SF fan, or even for anyone who's found himself as part of any fandom."	5.0	"""Never Give Up! Never Surrender!"""	2011-04-12	11	10	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2LCSY1RNKWEY	Local Man	"""Galaxy Quest"" is, on the surface, a spoof of ""Star Trek"" and its fans.  But it is a very funny movie in its own right, spoofing the entire genre of Science Fiction shows and movies.  My kids have not really seen the original ""Star Trek"" series, but still love this film.It has a ""stellar"" cast (pun intended).  Tim Allen, in one of his best movie roles, is Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, suggesting but not imitating William Shatner.  Alan Rickman, one of the best actors for movie villains, gets to play a good guy for once, as an alien member of the crew indirectly spoofing Leonard Nemoy's Mr. Spock.  Sigourny Weaver is wonderful in this comedic role as the communications officer.  Tony Shaloob (""Monk"") is the quirky Ship's Engineer, and Sam Rockwell (""Iron Man 2,"" ""Moon"") does what he does best as a fan who was once an extra on the show.  Even Justin Long has a small role as one of the die-hard fans.The plot of the film is unique: The cast of ""Galaxy Quest,"" an old Science Fiction television show, are surviving seventeen years after the show was cancelled by making appearances at Science Fiction Conventions for die-hard fans.  One group of fans turn out to actually be ""Thermians,"" aliens who thought that the TV show was a historical record of actual events.  They have carefully built the ship and all of its gadgets and now need the Captain and Crew to help them when an evil alien is trying to wipe out their race.Like many great comedies, this film has a bunch of quotable lines which will remind fans of funny moments.  While there are plenty of laughs, the film does not sacrifice story for comedy.  ""Galaxy Quest"" combines comedy, action & adventure with just a touch of romance.  It is one of those movies that I often recommend to people who have not seen it.  This is one of the movies I like to re-watch every few months, and I am constantly going, ""Oh, this is my favorite part . . ."""	5.0	One of my Family's favorite films	2013-11-07	1	1	0

Such is the case with the cornball science fantasy movie ""Galaxy Quest.""""Galaxy Quest"" was a science fiction television show with more than a passing similarity to ""Star Trek.""  As with the latter show, ""Galaxy Quest"" was cancelled.  Now the dispirited actors seem doomed to an endless cycle of overzealous fans at ""Galaxy Quest"" conventions.  Adding to the actor's torment is the attitude of Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the show.  Nesmith's cheery attitude and self-importance have worn thin on his fellow cast mates, Gwen Demarco as sexy Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane as brainy Dr. Lazarus (Alan Rickman), and Fred Kwan as Tech Sgt. Chen (Tony Shalhoub).Interrupting their doldrums is a group of individuals who would appear weird to anyone outside a science fiction convention.  As members of the convention they appear to be about as strange, or normal, depending on your point of view, as anyone else.  However, Jason Nesmith soon learns that this strange foursome is more than they seem as they spirit him off to their genuine spaceship, NSEA Protector.At first Jason is somewhat excited at the opportunity to be on a genuine spaceship, and eventually brings the rest of the crew, including bit part player Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), back to the ship with him.  However, the aliens crewing the ship, the Thermians, have a very real, very ruthless nemesis to contend with, and the former crew of ""Galaxy Quest"" discover they are out of their depth.The Thermians brought the crew of ""Galaxy Quest"" on board because they discovered certain ""historical documents"" that were transmitted into space many years earlier.  The somewhat innocent, though highly intelligent and creative, Thermians were unable to recognize the television show ""Galaxy Quest"" as being make-believe.The movie moves forward with a number of creative and often humorous moments, alternating between hilarity and seriousness, with even a few moments of compassion.  Every clich&eacute; and stereotype from the original ""Star Trek"" is exploited for a laugh.  In the climax the actors rely on hardcore fans for their in-depth knowledge of the show to save them.  It is difficult to avoid enjoying the ending, even if you are not a fan of science fiction.""Galaxy Quest"" is an excellent companion movie to the original ""Star Trek"" television series.  Even non-Trek fans will pick up on most of the gags.  There is a lot of action and you can expect the usual implausibilities that tend to accompany television science fiction.  However, the results are humorous and enjoyable.  You will find this movie worth more than one watch."	4.0	After the Show Is Over	2004-12-02	59	52	7

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"This is a very, very silly and yet EXTREMELY funny and entertaining parody of ""Star Trek"" - and also, surprisingly a great and clever tribute to this legendary franchise. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.PRECISION: if you never saw at least one episode of ORIGINAL ""Star Trek"" series, watching this film doesn't make any sense - you will just lose your time. My SINCERE advice for all those who are until now completely ""Star Trek"" free - watch one episode of the ORIGINAL series! My personal recommended favourites are ""Arena"", ""The Omega Glory"", ""Space seed"", ""Mirror, mirror"", ""Balance of terror"", ""The enemy within"", ""Bread and circuses"", ""Patterns of force"", ""Amok time"", ""Day of the dove"" and of course ""The trouble with tribbles""...)))In this film we follow the initially not so glamorous adventures of the cast of a once-popular television space-drama ""Galaxy Quest"". Those fictional series which are an almost exact replica of original ""Star Trek"" series starred Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) as the commander of a spaceship called the NSEA Protector, Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) as the ship's alien science officer, Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) as the chief engineer, Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) as the computer officer, and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) as a precocious child pilot.Since the cancellation of the show neither of them could find any more real acting jobs and they survive mostly by making commercials and appearing during fan gatherings... With the exception of pathologically optimistic Fred Kwan they are mostly not very happy about their lifes and careers, with two of them suffering especially badly: Jason Nesmith is an alcoholic and Alexander Dane is actually suicidal... And then one day a group of VERY peculiar fans makes contact with Nesmith and then the film really begins...This film is a surprisingly succesful parody/tribute. It is of course a pure comedy, without even one serious moment in it and it is also a GOOD comedy - but it is also a surprisingly gentle, tender parody, absolutely NOT like those ""Scary movies"" abominations and not even as mildly incisive as Mel Brooks ""Spaceballs"". In fact it reminded me more of Mel Brooks ""Frankenstein junior"", because this film mocks massively and mercilessly both the ""Star trek"" show and its fans - and yet there is a surprising lot of tenderness towards the original material and the love fans feel for it... At the end, after watching the last scenes, I was not only amused but also a little bit moved...The great casting choices helped a lot to make this film a success. Alan Rickman who plays a long-suffering actor who had great ambitions but now is destined to be remembered only for silly make up and cheesy quotes (""No, no, no, no, I played once Richard III, I absolutely totally refuse to say this stupid line one more time!"") is an ABSOLUTE NUMBER ONE treasure in this film. Sigourney Weaver is impossibly sexy in the blond wig and her character is another treasure (""I have only one job to do on board of this darn ship and even if it is completely stupid I am gonna do it!""). Tim Allen portrays a great parody of both Captain Kirk AND William Shattner and Tony Shalhoub, let's stress it again, is simply incredible as a pathologically optimistic guy (he is so happy and cheerful that we simply want to slap him around - and at the last moment we simply cannot, so disarming he is) and finally, last but not least, there is also Sam Rockwelll who plays incredibly well Guy Fleegman, an extra who made just a cameo in one of episodes and who never fully recovered from it...)))...)))...)))By looking on the cover of the DVD you can guess that some real aliens will appear - and they give a great show, especially the alien babe Laliari (Misi Pyle), the hottest, sexiest cephalopode I ever saw...))) Fanboys of ""Star Trek"" are not forgotten and they are of course mocked mercilessly, but also with some tenderness and tact. There is nothing here even remotely similar to the obscene vulgarity of this ""Fanboys"" film, which dealt with ""Star Wars"" fans...Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT, extremely funny and yet surprisingly gentle and even tender comedy, which is also a relatively rare thing - a well done ""parody of and tribute to"" the original material. An absolutely recommended viewing! ENJOY!"	5.0	"""Hey guys, there's a red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy... and I think we're the green-thingy!"""	2014-07-01	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AG8LKZ50HKFW4	"Marius Maxwell Krause ""In Space No One Can He..."	"Galaxy Quest is probably the most underrated comedies ever in entire history of movie business. It was never fully appreciated by audience and also not liked initially by film critics. The truth is that if you are fan of science-fiction or you know some of s-f classics you will find this movie incredibly funny.Story focused on actors who were starring in TV series Galaxy Quest. That is obviously link to Star Trek. Cast is simply amazing: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Allan Rickman are creating probably their best comedy performances. Big shock to everyone who knows Ms. Weaver as she plays typical blond bimbo who ""does only one lazy job"" in TV series (repeats computer's messages). They are fantastic team together.  Also all supportive cast of aliens is terrific, i.e: Enrico Colantoni as  Mathesar, Patrick Breen as Quellek and (especially) Missi Pyle as Laliari are extremely funny.Special effects are on the highest level. It is comedy of course but all space ships, space itself, equipment etc. are really believable (even beryl sphere!).Worth mentioning are extras on latest Blu-Ray edition. You get full bucket of super supplements and one of the funniest moment ever is to watch rap performed by Sigourney Weaver & the team.US Blu-Ray edition contains English, French, Portuguese, Spanish subtitles and disc is region-free that means you can play it everywhere outside US as well.Galaxy Quest [Blu-ray]Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)Galaxy Quest"	5.0	The most underrated comedy ever!	2011-11-08	4	4	0

Boy was I in  for the Surprise of my life.Galaxy Quest turned out to be an excellent  movie that also was an excellent parody of _Star Trek_.Tim Allen does a  wonderful job, but it is his crew that steals the show.The DVD itself is  funny and has some good stuff on it.All in all a movie that can be  highly reccommended.&quot;Never Give Up.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Galaxy Quest was a very popular TV show from the late 70's, but the actors have not been able to move on with their careers and live on personal appearances. One day, they unknowingly agree to make an appearance for real aliens, the Thermians, and find themselves in space with a race that believe the shows were real. Now, they must learn to deal with each other and technology they made up to stay alive and save the Thermians from the evil Sarris who wants to destroy them all.This movie is a must for Star Trek fans, but non-Trekkies will enjoy the humor as well. It manages to make fun of every aspect of the series, including the fans, while still using these elements to further the story. The cast gives a wonderful performance as actors out of their element trying not to give away who they really are to the aliens they have befriended. I find myself laughing all the way through this movie every time I watch it. And the deleted scenes on the DVD are as funny as anything in the movie.This is a pleasant comedy that should appeal to all ages.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A14QQTY7MG5Y2D	Mark	I actually give this movie a 3.5.  Galaxy Quest is about former actors who participate in a real life battle with alien foes.  Ridiculous this concept may seem but it actually does well when it comes to entertaining you.  The movie was funny, it had a well developed plot, the acting was good, and you feel for the characters as they tried to defeat the forces of evil.  The main characters had depth to them and the characters depicting a show gave a nice twist to things.  Kids will especially like this film as it is silly and has flashy special effects.  But adults will find this movie unrealistic and that I think will turn them off from this movie a bit.  (A boulder monster?)  I think this movie defies every law of physics on the books.  In conclusion I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie and I recommend it to kids and people who like to get lost in fantasies.  Got any thing to say about what I said?

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A11A8GWG0IXBZH	"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!"""	Most people who have seen `Galaxy Quest' probably have never seen a science fiction convention before, well take from someone with first hand knowledge, it was pretty much like what you saw on the big screen. Large  rooms filled with frothing fanboys dressed as Vulcans or Klingons, and  those are the guys who run the dealer tables, over priced merchandise that  you could have found at your local comic shop for half the price, crammed  into too small lecture halls watching 9th generation copy of Urutskodoji,  or a chance to meet the guy who almost played the stand in for Patrick  Stewart in episode 406 of Star Trek: The Next Humiliation. And perhaps  worst of all, the fans themselves, who care more about how warp drive works  than personal hygiene.The horror. The horror.`Galaxy Quest'  is a good-natured poke at science fiction fandom, which is good, because  there are a lot of good things about fandom, having met many good friends  at conventions, seen wonderful costumes by very passionate and talented  people, and engaged in some very good discussions and debates with some  very smart people. In `Galaxy Quest', Tim Allen place Jason Nesbet, the  star of a long since cancelled TV series of the same name that has a very  loyal following of fans, and like Stat Trek, just can't let the series die.  Allen is joined by Sigourney Weaver in a grey and red jump suit with blonde  hair...the single best part of the film, as burnt out actors who attend  these conventions, sometimes as their only means of making money. (Not  really a joke, check to see how much James Doohan makes for appearing at a  World Con.)All of the actors are upset at Nesbet as his ego spirals  out of control and he ends up alienating most of his fellow cast members  (are we paying attention Mr. Shatner?). they gripe about him always getting  the girl, always getting to take his shirt off, that is until they find  themselves aboard a very real working replica vessel of the one they used  in the TV series and fighting a very real war. Built by aliens who received  transmissions of the show and believed them to be historical documents,  they rebuilt everything they saw on the show, even the massive starship  Protector (incidentally, the `NTE' in `NTE-3120' stands for `Not The  Enterprise'), against a race of reptilian alien uglies who want to destroy  this nice alien race who built all of this great stuff because,...well,  that's not important. Strangely, the film actually pulls itself together as  a friendship piece. Did I just write that?Sometimes I got the  feeling that they writers really wanted to take some gut shots at fandom,  other times the jabs were well meaning and flattering. It also becomes  apparent that the series endures because of the fans (something Paramount  has never learned about Star Trek. How many web sites have they closed?).  `Galaxy Quest' has some honestly funny moments, but where it falls apart is  the editing, which comes across as very unprofessional with one bad take  leading into another. The special effects, (ILM again), are first rate,  even the stuff they did as out takes from the old series had a nice period  look to them. The NTE-Protector is actually quite beautiful, with just a  hint of Enterprise for inspiration. A great film? No. A good one? Yes. Mel  Brooks' `Spaceballs' did it first and did it better.	3.0	A Good Try	2000-07-14	8	3	5

When the cast of a sputtered-out sci-fi series take to the fan-boy circuit to perpetuate the TV dream, they are approached by genuine e.t.s' to assist them in helping save their planet.  They gradually realize that they have the 'stuff' to assist them, but the funny stuff happens as they arrive at that conclusion.  Well worth watching!"	5.0	a terrific parody. . .	2011-11-15	2	2	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2DLX21QMUGBH1	Mark McKinney	Many skits and comedians have tried to poke fun at  the finest science fiction show ever made, but this is by far the best I have seen. It is easy to make fun of something bad, but not nearly as easy to make fun of  something good, but this film was able to do that. Tim Allen was a fine  choice for the Shatner role as an egomaniac actor caught up in himself.  Alan Rickman plays a thespian who has been locked into an alien role and he  cringes whenever he hears his famous line. There was a short story from the  book Star Trek the new voyages called Visit to a weird planet revisited and  it Shatner, Nimoy and De Kelly being beamed from the enterprise set to the  real ship where they tried to play out their characters. This film is  similar to that story and just as funny. It pokes fun at not just Star Trek  fans, but all rabid fans and actors who are typecast and sometimes cannot  escape a role. Star Trek fans will get more of the in jokes, but I think  this film is funny enough that you do not have to be a fan to appreciate  it.	4.0	Fine spoof	2000-07-19	2	1	1

The only negative aspect of the movie was the weak  ending - much like a sitcom it is all wrapped up in a neat little package  at the end and the kid-hero appears to get nothing more than a thank you at  the end.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3ONTLXQ85EE4G	Marshall Lord	"This review is based on having watched the film at home on both DVD and Blu-Ray. It is near the top of my list of all-time favourite films and IMHO is one of the funniest ever made (an opinion I share with Readers Digest, who have it on their list of the 100 funniest films).""Galaxy Quest"" takes the mickey, very gently and sympathetically, out of science fiction TV and films in general and Star Trek in particular, of the actors who take part in them, and the fans who follow them.It tells the story of a group of actors who had been the stars of a former Science Fiction TV series, long since cancelled, who suddenly find themselves on a real and fully functional starship exactly like the NSEA Protector, the ship in their TV series, among aliens who think the actors really are the characters they played in the series.So the headline stars, Tim Allen, Alan Rickman, and Sigourney Weaver, are not really playing spoofs of Kirk, Spock, and a mix of Uhura and Deanna Troi, although the roles their characters played in the TV series within the film were clearly based on those Star Trek characters. Allen, Rickman, and Weaver are playing spoofs of Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Nichelle Nichols/Marina Sirtis, and how actors who played their parts might react if they found themselves having to perform those roles for real.The fans are also a major part of the story and in fact the actors and their ship only survive because they are able to contact a fanatical group of dedicated Trekkies - sorry, ""Questerians"" (that's the word used in the film for the equivalent of Star Trek fanatics) - who know the details of the Enterprise - sorry, the NSEA Protector - so well that they can tell the actors how to fix a particular issue with the real ship.Many aspects of the series are lampooned on the show but in a sympathetic way - for example, Sam Rockwell puts on a hysterically funny performance as Guy Fleegwell, an actor who had a very minor role in the original show and keeps getting convinced that he is doing the equivalent of ""beaming down in a red shirt"" and therefore about to get killed. Guy's fears are the result of confusing reality with fiction, but sometimes they are fully justified, as when he prevents the other actors from doing something that would probably have got them killed for real with the words ""Didn't you guys ever watch the show?""Similarly on realising that she's about to have to do for real something incredibly dangerous from one of the episodes, Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco (the Uhura/Troi figure) complains bitterly that the relevant episode was badly written, and later calls out in terrified rage, ""The person who wrote this episode should die!""All the acting was excellent, and in addition to the three leads I would single out Enrico Colantoni who plays Mathesar, leader of a friendly alien race called the Thermians, and Justin Long as Brandon, a leader of a group of devoted Galaxy Quest fans with an encyclopedic knowledge of the show.The Blu-ray version of this film is really spectacular, and I also liked some of the extras, particularly a ""Galactopedia"" reference facility which you can access while watching the film and which describes the universe of the ""Galaxy Quest"" series in great detail, just like the Star Trek reference books often put together by fans.I can only agree with J.J. Abrams who created the two most recent Star Trek films, when he descibed Galaxy Quest as ""One of the best Star Trek movies ever made."""	5.0	In Space no-one can hear you fall about laughing ...	2013-09-25	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Galaxy Quest opened around Christmas 1999 against a lot of high profile movies. It never set any records, but it ran and ran and ran, eventually doing better than many of its competitors. It's easy to see why. It's mindless and daffy, yet also amiable and funny. It's the gentlest of satires. It does not aspire to greatness. It aspires to entertain, and that it does.The title refers to a fictional TV show about space travel and conquest, and it seems suspiciously like Star Trek. The movie opens with the has- been cast of the show, which ended twenty years ago, at a convention of fans. Most of the actors are there for the money and not for the geeky, obsessed fans. The exception is Jason Nesmith [Tim Allen], who played Commander Peter Taggart. Nesmith tries hard not to ruin the fans' fantasies. One group actually tells him they are there to enlist the crew in saving their planet, and he atiently plays along. Later, in the men's room, Nesmith overhears two kids talking about how sad and stupid the cast and the fans are. Crushed, he flees the convention and goes home, where he promptly consumes a great deal of whiskey. The next morning finds him passed out on his living room floor. Outside the sliding glass door, the same weird group that wanted him to help them is knocking on the glass. In a fog, he lets them in. One thing leads to another, and he discovers that they really ARE aliens. They think that the TV show is real, a historical record of real events. Apparently these aliens have no imaginations, and when they recorded the show's TV signal, the idea that the information might be false never crossed their minds. Oh, how earthling advertisers would love this crowd!It isn't long before Nesmith and the aliens have enlisted the rest of the stars - Lt. Tawny Madison [Sigourney Weaver], Dr. Lazurus [Alan Rickman], Tech. Sgt. Chen [Tony Shalhoub], and even an extra, Crew Member 6 [Sam Rockwell]. This group of very earthbound people suddenly finds itself in outer space aboard a craft that is based on their old TV show sets. What are they supposed to do? How can they work instruments that never really existed or combat monsters and aliens which are not actors in costumes? The answers they come up with help make this one of the funnier comedies in recent memory.Allen and Weaver are perfectly cast, for who would be better in this parody than the fumbling star of Home Improvement and the heroine of the Aliens movies? What could be funnier than to have Alan Rickman basically reprise his role as Col. Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, only this time in space? What could be more clever than to include an extra, who spends the entire movie knowing he's going to die in the next ten minutes because that's what happened on the TV show? And the aliens? They are hysterical to watch. Theier actual body shapes resemble giant squids, but they have the ability to transform into human-looking beings. Only problem is that they can't quite get the body movements down right, not to mention the voices.I think it must be hard to make a movie that's just plain fun, but Galaxy Quest succeeds nearly all the time. Frankly, I was never much of a Star Trek or a Star Wars fan. I appreciated their appeal but never got caught up in the fantasies. I enjoyed this movie immensely, even though most of the in jokes were lost on me. I can only imagine how appealing it must be to people who are more informed about the things it parodies than I am.	4.0	Goofy satire of sci-fi genre is hysterically funny	2002-03-19	2	2	0

Great movie, light-hearted fun, pokes fun of Star Trek  fanatics with great wit.  Sigourney Weaver gets to flex her funny bone,  something I've never seen in all her dramatic roles, and she's great.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3P7GYZQXT0QNK	Matthew Murray	With a movie like Galaxy Quest, you're probably expecting a light-hearted spoof of low budget TV science-fiction series, with maybe a few Hollywood quips thrown in, but probably not much else.  Galaxy Quest delivers.  The  performances are all good, if mostly undistinguished, and the script is  mostly funny, if never hilarious.  The DVD has some nice extras, but they  strike the same note as the rest of the movie:  Good, but not great.  If  you're a fan of Star Trek, Battlestar: Galactica, or other series of that  ilk, though, you definitely shouldn't miss Galaxy Quest.	4.0	Entertaining and funny, but little beneath the surface.	2000-07-26	2	0	2
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3OID6I7PNHKCT	Matthew T.	Being a big fan of Star Trek, I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. So of course I bought the DVD when it came out and was a little underwhelmed by the special features. Cut to years later with this Blu-ray edition of Galaxy Quest and I am much more satisfied. With interviews with cast a crew on their processes on making the film and the behind the scenes footage is an awesome addition. Plus, the movie itself looks awesome in HD!	4.0	"One of the best ""Fish-out-of-water"" movies!"	2012-08-13	1	1	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"Disclosure: I am a Trekkie. Dyed-in-the-wool, through and through. So I approach this film from that perspective.The movie:""Galaxy Quest"" does the impossible - it makes me enjoy something with Tim Allen in it. I place this movie in that rarefied category of ""spoof movies that are equally entertaining as spoofs and as stand-alones."" By this, I mean that you could never have watched an episode of Star Trek (shame on you!) and still enjoy this as a science fiction movie. Other films in this category include ""Hot Fuzz"" (Buddy Cop pics) and ""Shaun of the Dead"" (Zombie flicks). We are given a plot revolving around the cast of a Star Trek-like show, a few decades after their run on TV. They are stuck in a dreary cycle of conventions and appearances cashing in on their previous fame. Then, something strange happens: real aliens approach them, asking them for their help in an interstellar war.What is especially surprising is how emotional this movie made me. I think its loving depiction of fan devotion, mixed with the somewhat sad portrayal of middle-aged actors who are bitter over typecasting, really hit home for me. The happy ending was made all the more affecting. I was pretty much ready to check my brain and critical eye at the door by the time this movie was finished, however formulaic the resolution might be, objectively speaking.The cast is very good and the humor is dead-on target. Allen is perfectly cast as a self-important blowhard with an undercurrent of insecurity. Sigourney Weaver is also a standout, demonstrating fine comic timing. The alien characters are charming and quirky. The effects are also surprisingly good, equal to some of the later Star Trek films!The Blu-Ray:The 1080p image presented on this disc is a definite uprade from the SD DVD, but it isn't exactly a ""beat you over the head"" HD image. It shows a bit of softness and a bit of Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). The movie was filmed in 1999, and this does look better than some images of that vintage (""Dark City"" springs to mind as a DNR'ed mess from about the same year). It's just not a spectacular transfer, at the quality level of, say, 1999's ""Fight Club."" That said, the faces do not have the waxy look of the worst DNR, and certain shots show nice detail, especially in cloth. The effects shots also look very nice. The print is pretty clean, too. It's just somewhat evident that there was no major restoration work.The soundtrack is a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 channel mix that does a fine job. Dialogue is never overpowered, and some of the battles and explosions contain booming bass and rear channel surround information. Most of the track is pretty front-loaded, however.Extras include about an hour and 15 minutes worth of documentary features. The most interesting are a feature on the ILM effects (which were pretty good), as well as features on casting, production, and the like. Unfortunately, all the features are in SD. Only the included movie trailer is in HD. 12 minutes of deleted scenes round out the extras.Bottom line: This is great family-friendly entertainment. At the inexpensive Blu-Ray price, if you don't own it, and you love either Star Trek or Sci-Fi in general, you really can't go wrong. It would have been nice to have had a fancier set and a slightly better transfer, but even with its SD features, this is better than most bare-bones releases of ""less successful"" movies.I see this as a ""love letter"" of sorts to both Trekkies and the Trek cast and crew. I enjoy watching this more than the new Trek movie, for what it's worth. If you haven't seen it, you really should!"	4.0	**Blu-Ray Specific Review** A Lovely Film Gets a Decent Blu-Ray	2010-04-02	18	16	2

Warmhearted, funny, well acted, no chessy effects, not so perfect plot.  Yet I didn't really give a darn about the plot, the characters were great! It was nice to see Tim Allen again, I miss him... the last thing I saw him in was &quot;Home Imporvement&quot; series finale and how long ago was that?  Signory (sp?) Weaver can do comedy-and I want to see more!  The cast was wonderful down to the funny looking aliens to that um... bad green guy I can't remember his name.Well pick up a copy, sit back with some butter popcorn and enjoy it!DramWorks keep producing movies like this, I know that movie &quot;Evolution&quot; is coming and and I'm sooo looking forward to it!PS-Wouldn't it be funny if they did a spoof with the actors from the XF, where David Duchovny (Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Scully) have to end up saving the world, but not as their characters-but as themselves.

Whether you are a Trekkie or a patient friend of a Trekkie, you must own this film! &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; pokes good-natured fun of sci fi conventions, rabid sci fi fans, middle-aged  washed-up actors, and cheesy television shows. It also delivers  hysterically funny dialogue, well-written characters, superb acting and  fun, attention-grabbing plot.Tim Allen plays the famous but  washed-up lead in one of television's cult sci fi classics (sound like  someone we know?). He is hilarious in his many goof-ball escapades as he  drags his fellow actors into space to help save the Thermians. I loved  Sigourney Weaver as the not-so-bright crew member; this film helped to once  again remind us that she has such incredible depth as an actress...she  ain't just Ripley! And I have to say that Alan Rickman's dry humor and  dead-pan delivery were, once again, brilliant additions to the film. I  happen to think he is magnificent and love to watch him in anything. And  Tony Shalhoub...!  He had some of the greatest lines in the movie.See this with an open mind. It is very much tongue-in-cheek, and the  punch lines are nonstop. But it has a simple message: believe in yourself  and you can accomplish great things. It was refreshing to see an enjoyable  movie without gratuitous sex, violence, cursing, etc. I would feel  comfortable taking my young nephew to this flick. Although I was a little  tired of Weaver's breasts by the end of the film (but that may be a selling  point for some of you!). It's a good, clean, hilarious romp.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In December of 1999, director Dean Parisot unleashed what is arguably the funniest sci-fi/comedy film of all time, ""Galaxy Quest"", which focuses upon the dissatisfied lives of five actors who had starred in a long-cancelled sci-fi television series of the same name.  Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played ship's captain Commander Peter Quincey Taggart.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver, who is no stranger to sci-fi with her roles in the ""Alien"" films) played Lt. Madison.  Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, also known for his roles as Hans Gruber in the 1988 film ""Die Hard"" and Professor Snape in the two ""Harry Potter"" films) played Dr. Lazarus.  Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) played ship's engineer Tech Sgt. Chen and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) played ship's pilot Laredo.  Following the cancellation of the TV series, none of the actors had found descent acting jobs. Instead, they were relegated to appearing occasionally as their former ""Galaxy Quest"" characters at fan conventions and infrequent commercials.  Especially frustrated is Alexander Dane, a trained Shakespearean actor who cannot escape the stigma of having said those immortal words, ""By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!""The film begins at a ""Galaxy Quest"" convention where the quintet is preparing to appear.  Unbeknownst to them, not all of the conventioneers dressed as aliens are pretending.  A group of uniformed ""aliens"" approach Jason (dressed as Commander Taggart) saying that they are in dire need of his assistance.  Jason quickly agrees and assumes that the group is planning to pay him to appear as Commander Taggart at a fan-function.  Following a night of drinking at his home, the ""aliens"" arrive in a limousine (per Jason's request) to escort him to their function.  The ""aliens"", calling themselves Thermians, are Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees) and Laliari (Missi Pyle).  While en route to their function, Teb recites the lengthy history of Thermia to Jason, but Jason (who has a hangover) falls asleep.  (Jason doesn't take the Thermians seriously; instead believing that they are simply ""Galaxy Quest"" fans.)  Jason awakens to what he believes is a very elaborate set mimicking the NSEA Protector from the ""Galaxy Quest"" show. Mathesar (who always refers to Jason as Commander Taggart) tells him that the Thermians want him to negotiate a peace treaty with General Sarris (Robin Sachs).  Instead, ""Commander Taggart"" orders the Thermians to fire upon Sarris' ship.  Assuming that he has completed his performance, Jason tells Mathesar that he is ready to return home.  Mathesar escorts him to an empty room and leaves.  Jason, not understanding what is happening, is suddenly enveloped within a strange substance and raised to the ship's exterior where he sees millions of stars in deep space.  He is suddenly shot from the ship, then finds himself standing next to his swimming pool at home.  Jason finally realizes that the Thermians are real extraterrestrials, and that they mistakenly regard the ""Galaxy Quest"" show (which they received in deep space) as being historical fact.The other four ""Galaxy Quest"" actors are busy filming a commercial for the opening of an electronics store and are disgusted because Jason isn't there.  Jason arrives late and tells them about his experience with the Thermians, but they think he has lost his mind.  Jason tells them that the Thermians want him to return and that he wants them to come also.  They initially reject it, but change their minds when they mistakenly believe that it's a paying job.  Gwen, Alexander, Fred and Tommy are whisked away to the Thermian's NSEA Protector, along with another actor named Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), who had played a bit part on the original ""Galaxy Quest"" show.  With that, the most important role for each of the washed up ""Galaxy Quest"" actors begins!Dean Parisot, along with writers David Howard and Robert Gordon, created a brilliant and engaging spoof of the show ""Star Trek"", its conventions and trekkies with ""Galaxy Quest"".  Tim Allen equated with William Shatner (Kirk), Alan Rickman with Leonard Nimoy (Spock), Sigourney Weaver with Nichelle Nichols (Uhura), Tony Shalhoub with James Doohan (Scotty) and Daryl Mitchell with George Takei (Sulu).  Other sci-fi comedy spoof that predate ""Galaxy Quest"" (such as ""Ice Pirates"", ""Pluto Nash"" and ""Spaceballs"") are no where near as good, engaging or funny.All of the actors in ""Galaxy Quest"" performed their roles exceptionally well.  Two actor who played significant minor roles were Patrick Breen, who played the Thermian named Quelleck, and Jeremy Howard, who played the young and very helpful ""Galaxy Quest"" fan named Kyle.I highly recommend purchasing ""Galaxy Quest"" on DVD, which has superior picture and sound quality, and includes several deleted scenes, trailers, biographies, the feature ""On Location in Space"" and production notes.  ""Galaxy Quest"" is a film that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  Sit back and remember those immortal words, ""Never give up! Never surrender!"" as you are whisked away into the fantastic world of ""Galaxy Quest""!"	5.0	"""By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged!"""	2003-01-31	159	143	16

The atmosphere and the attitude of the fans at some of these conventions are captured exactly by the director.In this movie, the actors from on old television series very much like Star Trek, attend a convention.  They are harangued by the fans and peppered with questions about the science in some of the more obscure episodes.  Tim Allen is the William Shatner like character of the series and he meets some weird ""fans"" that ask him for help.  Tim laughingly agrees.  What he doesn't realize is that these are not fans but in actuality real aliens that think Allen is his persona in the TV series.  On their planet they do not know what a lie or acting is so they accept Allen's ""offer"" of help and whisk him to a spaceship in another part of the solar system.Allen then has to convince his co-stars to help the aliens and they agree not realizing what they are up against.  They must battle an alien warlord who is ruthless as Star Trek's Khan.There are some hilarious scenes in this movie that literally had me splitting my sides, especially with the actor who plays the ship's engineer (he is the same actor from the Monk tv series).Much funnier and better conceived than Spaceballs!"	5.0	Hilarious!	2004-10-13	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2JY2G1Y276N9X	Michael Burnstein	Tim Allen mocking Captain Kirk, Sigourney Weaver repeating everything the ship's computer says, classic.  Bored, bitter and alcoholic from touring the conventions, the washed up has beens are suddenly beamed onto a ship modeled on their TV series and expected to defeat a formidable foe.  The problem is -- even though their hosts expect them to know how to do everything (after all, they did on the show) -- they initially can't even perform basic tasks.  This is a silly movie, but if you liked Star Trek and can handle some silliness, this is among the best you can get.	4.0	Excellent Star Trek Spoof	2007-05-16	2	2	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	This is a delightful movie, full of the kind of overboard heroics, histrionics and mayhem that made STAR TREK as popular as it was.  Seeing the conventions with all the GALAXY QUEST questies is so incredibly ironic.  But what makes this movie work is the superb direction and acting that manages to bring such wonderful life and credibility to its pedestrian plot.  Although the idea of having actors forced to do the real thing is far above pedestrian, so forget that comment!  It's a good plot.Tim Allen is wonderful as the Shatneresque hero who uses his egotistical bravado to commandeer the Thermian's ship.  And yes, it's funny how he loses his shirt to the rock monster!  Sigourney Weaver, a simply amazing and versatile actress, shines as Tawny, the blonde airhead who repeats everything the computer says.  (She's quite dishy too as a blonde!).  Alan Rickman is wryly humorous as the serious actor who abhors his role, but comes through solidly when necessary.  A marvelous performance.  Sam Rockwell as the only non-series persona is hilarious as the actor who knows he's gonna get killed because he's just a &quot;guest star.&quot;  Tony Shalhoub is great as Fred, too.  The entire cast of Thermians is delightful in their innocence and awe of the actors who they think are the real thing!It's a fun out of this world comedy and one of the best spoofs in a long time.Relax and enjoy!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	5.0	JOLLY GOOD SHOW	2003-11-27	5	4	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1WGF3DAX2WUV0	Michael Dyckman	I didn't have high expectations for Galaxy Quest, but really enjoyed it. This film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Tony Shalhoub as actors from a `Star Trek' type show whose professional lives are reduced to lame  store openings and nerdy conventions. Aliens (led by the hilarious Enrico  Colantoni from TV's Just Shoot Me) need these heroes to save their planet,  since they've watched these heroes from space. The aliens, however, believe  that the show was real, (they refer to the show as the `historical  documents') and now this ragged team of hack actors is in for a fight with  some nasty space creatures. The special effects are terrific, Allen enjoys  spoofing space movies and his Buzz Lightyear persona, and Weaver, usually a  dramatic actress, lightens up well. Alan Rickman is also good as a  Shakespearean-trained actor who is constantly complaining that he is only  recognized in his alien garb. Galaxy Quest is a light comedy that is  definitely worth seeing.	4.0	Funny, light sci-fi comedy	2000-07-18	1	0	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A252UDYPJ9Q6R7	mike phillips	Galaxy quest is without a doubt a send up of Star Trek, and really no  other s/f movie or tv series. It is an incredible, fast paced homage to one  of the most beloved tv show and its rabid fans. One can only feel the  annoyance which Shatner &amp; co. must go thru at convention in scenes like  Allen meeting a group of 3 nerds who ask him some impossible technical  question about the series that even its creators couldn't answer.The story  isnt really anything special. It's been done before in a variety of ways,  the one which comes to mind first being Starfighter, where a top level  arcade playing teen is recruited by aliens to save the galaxy due to his  eye/hand coordination when it comes to gaming. So how does dean Parisot who  directed the incredibly BAD film Home Fries score a hit here? Simple. The  cast is incredible. Consisting of Tim Allen, the always incredible Alan  Rickman, and the gorgeous Sigourny Weaver, not to mention Tony Shaloob, you  can't go wrong. Even the more minor characters are engaging. The Star Trek  in-jokes and references are too many to mention&gt; Suffice it to say that  Parisot must have had much more interest in this subject matterr than his  last lame film to create something as good as Galaxy Quest.The little  criticism that I have noticed regarding this film, is directed towards  Sigouney Weaver's cleavage (which in my opinion barely detracted from the  movie). Indeed, you have to get the dvd version w/the cut scenes to even  see the most exploitative moment w/Weaver that was ultimately left on the  cutting room floor. Take it from a fan, this is a great, funny,feel good  film!	4.0	One of the more pleasant films I've seen lately	2000-05-26	1	1	0

By the time Guy is calling for his ""mommy"" in the shuttle scene going to the planet for a varillium sphere i had already been wiping tears of laughter from my face.We saw it one more time.I have since bought the movie (as soon as it came out) and have seen it so many times that i still don't know where to start when it comes to telling HOW WONDERFULLLLL this movie is.  I've shown this to my mother (who is up in age) and at several points almost fell out her seat from bending over in laughter. She was smiling from ear to ear after the movie; she told me the movie made her day as she was wiping warm laugh tears from her face. She thouroughly enjoyed  the charachters and their anxt.  If you are a Kirk Star Trek fan-you will get it.If you are not-You still will get it.  This movie is hillarious, fun, and SPOT ON as a spoof, and you REALLY care about the charachters. Gets this!!!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A873NN1HNDUG8	Minh Doan	Everybody must have realized it!  It is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; parody gone out of control!  You know the story from the numerous reviews here at  Amazon:  1- Actors from a cancelled show are reduced to doing conventions  and ceremonies;  2- Aliens, thinking everything on TV is real,  &quot;beams&quot; the actors on a REAL starship to help them save the  world;  3- The actors, caught off guard (and without a script or stunt  double to back them up) must save the world.Brilliant!  Why did nobody  think of this before?  This movie appeals to those who can relate to the  Star Trek experience, as well as to those who believe all the people who  dresses up in alien costumes are whacked!Since there were numerous  reviews about the movie (most of them positive), I'll concentrate on the  DVD version.DreamWorks really knows how to do DVDs.  Grab a copy of  &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; for an example.  In &quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot;, the extras that I have noticed and liked:-the &quot;Making  of&quot; short documentary, well made, interesting facts about the  movie;-lost clips (Really, some of them were touched up!  The clips were  edited before post-production actually began, but the director liked them  so much that FULL FX were added to them!  You got to admire that!  The only  weak clip where the effects were obviously not on par was an edited clip of  the rock monster battle, but it is still entertaining.);-The ENTIRE  movie dubbed in ALIEN LANGUAGE audio track!  Interesting, but it does get  annoying.  Recommend watching it with English subtitles if that's you  stuff;-Three other movie trailers (Chicken Run, Road Trip, El  Dorado).The presentation is great as well.  Most studios don't seem to  put much effort in the visual menus, but DreamWorks matched an excellent  interface with an excellent movie.  This DVD movie is highly recommended.  I urge you to buy it, even if you already have the VHS version......of  course you should have a DVD player first...	5.0	It's hard not to like it!	2000-08-06	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A25AIU10URSUW3	"M. McMullan ""Entertainment Consumer"""	"I've seen other reviewers summarize the plot, or tell you that you need to have seen Star Trek to enjoy this movie.I won't be doing that.This movie is hilarious, and the only thing that being a Star Trek fan brings to the table is that some of the jokes will have a different meaning for you than they might to someone who has avoided that aspect of pop culture.I know that when I watched it with my mother and father, who only know Star Trek through what's seeped into their awareness over the years, they laughed at pretty much the times one would expect and enjoyed it quite a bit.The movie is more subtle than some people give it credit for, playing on stereotypes that may be based on famous personalities from the various incarnations of Star Trek but have a connection with anyone who's been exposed to the ups and downs of ANY set of t.v. actors through the years. Something it's been hard to avoid in our age of ""Intimate Portraits"" and ""Biography"" specials.Suffice to say that there is something in this movie for everyone, as the crew of a t.v.-show starship that's been off the air for a while try and save the day for real... the laughs are accessable for everyone from Star Trek geeks (Wil Wheaton says it reminded him of what was great about conventions) to normal folk to people who made fun of Star Trek geeks.You'll laugh, you'll cry... and you'll laugh while watching ""Roy"" cry.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3EHH6JLPEEM2B	Monkey	This movie is truly brilliant. As a life long Star Trek fan and attendee of sci-fi conventions, the reason this movie is so brilliant is because it's TRUE. From the weary actors having to bear the curse of Eternal Type Casting, the goofiness of devoted fans, the chore or listening to the same fan boy stories and the obnoxious male lead, I never stopped laughing. Alan Rickman is perfect in his role as the frustrated serious actor reduced to wearing an alien head. The casting of the ultimate Sci Fi female icon, Sigourney Weaver, is priceless. She really embraces her inner bimbo and has fun. Tim Allen as a Shatner-esque is a win!	5.0	Pure fun!	2008-07-24	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"Almost 20 years after their phenomenally successful sci-fi TV show has been cancelled, the once proud cast of ""Galaxy Quest"" is relegated to making autograph signing appearances at science fiction conventions and strip mall openings. Only their faux captain, Jason Nesmith, who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart on the show (played here by ""Home Improvement's"" Tim Allen), still enjoys his fame among the obsessive fanatics. That is until Jason overhears what a joke he and his ""crew"" have become among the less enamored public. Jason's zest for life and his sci-fi legacy is renewed, however, when he is approached by a group of odd ""Galaxy Quest"" fans in need of help that turn out to be REAL aliens! Before long, Jason has the whole ""Galaxy Quest"" cast along for the ride of their lives in a spaceship designed to look and work exactly like the one on their old TV show. The benevolent Thermians believe the TV show ""Galaxy Quest"" is actual historical footage. Commander Taggart and his crew are their heroes, and they've modeled every aspect of their lives, and their highly advanced technology, after the hokey television fantasy. Now, they have sought out Commander Taggart and the crew of the NSEA Protector to help rid them of a villainous alien warlord (played by Robin Sachs) who has already destroyed the majority of their population! It's all a bit overwhelming for the group of mostly disgruntled actors who are both terrified and clueless about how to handle the situation. To defeat the evil General Sarris, each will have to adopt the talents and tact their characters had all those years ago, not to mention the bonds those fictional counterparts shared!""Galaxy Quest"" is unquestionably one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences the science-fiction fanatic can have outside the realms of his or her own obsession! Gently poking fun and paying tribute to everything from the obvious Star Trek to X-Files, Sailor Moon, Star Wars, Heavy Metal, and a million more, it does so gracefully and hilariously! Tim Allen leads a crew made up of Sigourney Weaver as the resident blonde bombshell (and I've never seen her look so good!), Alan Rickman as the bitter Shakespearian sell-out, Tony Shalhoub as the far too mellow Fred Kwan, Daryl Mitchell as the cast's junior member, and Sam Rockwell as Guy, the one-episode cast member with great fear of being killed-off in real-life as quickly as he was in the show! All make up an ensemble cast that plays perfectly together! Backing them up are Enrico Colantoni as Thermian leader Mathesar, the always hilarious Justin Long as obsessed fan Brandon Wheeger, fantastic music by David Newman, and glorious creatures and effects by masters Stan Winston and ILM. The sci-fi fan-pleasing ending is not to be missed! ""Galaxy Quest"" looks great on this widescreen DVD which includes fun animated menus, a behind the scenes featurette, hilarious deleted scenes, an actual Thermian language track (I'll have to check that out, I only just found out about it by reading the back cover), cast and crew bios, production notes, and the customary theatrical trailer. If you are a major fan of any sci-fi show or film that is popular enough to warrant a convention or lifelong devotion, ""Galaxy Quest"" should be added to your wish list today! Also highly recommended are ""Free Enterprise,"" ""Comic Book the Movie,"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back!"""	5.0	"""Never Give Up! Never Surrender!"""	2005-12-31	4	4	0

Galaxy Quest takes actors that played space travelers on tv and gets the abducted by real aliens at a reunion convention. The actors think it's them being paid to perform but when things start to become very real they must band together to defeat an alien enemy and save a race of aliens.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A28ZAU1AQXHUA2	"""movie-psyko"""	Bang-on-target sci-fi send-up, which works wonderfully as both a witty urine extraction of Star Trek cliches, conventions and its scary fan-base, as well a fabulousy original twist on musty space opera secenarios. Even if you're not a prone to dressing up in blue spandex, talking into your electric shaver and pretending your Twister mat is some sort of transportation device, you'll be thoroughly entertained by this classy cosmic comedy.The crew of NSEA Protector spent four successful seasons from 1979-1982, boldy going etc. Nowadays, TV Actors Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dayne (Alan Rickman), Guy Fleegman (Tony Shalhoub) and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), are reduced to opening stores and receiving the adoration of Galaxy Quest enthusiasts at their yearly convention. The cynical Nesmith's used to being approached by fans in full alien regalia, so when a bunch of Thermians from the Klatu Nebula ask desperately for his help, he naturally assumes it's some sort of promotional appearance and agrees to tag along. Once he realises that this is for real and the aliens believe Galaxy Quest to be a 'historical document' of life on board a spacecraft, Nesmith enlists the rest of the jaded actors to fight off the unpleasant Roth'h' ar Sarros of Fatu-Krey. And they'll need the performance of a lifetime to pull this one off...A mouth-watering premise, given full justice by an excellent script that leaves no Star Trek stone unturned, skilfully subverting every sci-fi cliche imaginable. Intelligent plotting, too, as various disposable plot-points resurface satisfyingly in the movie's action packed latter stages. The cast are clearly having a marvellous time, each raising their roles above mere caricature. Their great screen chemistry, fantastic one-liners and perfect balance of knowing silliness and straight-faced seriousness make for a memorable and highly engaging comic adventure.Clearly, the makers of Galaxy Quest have set their sights on creating a satirical sci-fi spectacular that will appeal to audiences right across the board. They've succeeded.	4.0	First contract.	2000-11-05	8	6	2

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3VATOPR0UJH3S	MR ANDREW J RICHARDS	Parody often fails - as a genre, there is often not really enough material to run the full length of a feature film.So why does this one work so well?  Possibly because, although it is not the worlds most serious film ever, it is far more than just a Star Trek parody.  Whilst having a bit of a dig at the show and it's cliches, it does it with affection, and most importantly it does have a story to tell, albeit a rather unlikely one.The cast are superb, led by the splendid Tim Allen, who sometimes actually looks and sounds so much like William Shatner you almost wish he could have a go at it for real.  Alan Rickman is also fantastic as the Shakespeare character actor who finds himself unable to work since his appearance on Galaxy Quest - but not to worry, because soon they are running a starship for real!Highlights are scenes where the ship leaves the space station, (you just wish Sulu had made that mistake!), the moment when they realise they're under attack (&quot;There's a red thing moving toward the green thingy.  I think we're the green thingy!&quot;) and also fan who helps them out by knowing the specifications of the Protector better than the actors.  It's funny, it's stylish, it has great effects, and most of all, it has Sigourney Weaver running around in a shocking blonde wig.The DVD extras are cool too - extra scenes, a featurette, and even the whole film dubbed into an alien language!Buy this.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	Galaxy Quest, as I'm sure everybody already knows, is a send up of Star Trek. Tim Allen is cast in the William Shatner role, Sigourney weaver is the Uhura of the show and a dead pan Alan Rickman is the Leonard Nimoy of Galaxy Quest. Having had their show cancelled several years previously the cast of the now defunct Galaxy Quest make their living by doing personal appearances at conventions organised by their all too obsessive fan club. However their careers are given a new lease of life, and a definite change of direction, when they are enlisted by some very hapless (but genuine) aliens to assist them in fighting a war against a ruthless enemy who has been terrorising their `people'. The unfortunate ET's however do not realise that Galaxy Quest is merely a TV show and instead believe that each episode is a historical document. From this false belief the unfortunately dim-witted and naive aliens have modelled their whole ethical system on the show and created an exact replica of the Galaxy Quest star-ship to assist them in their quest for survival.I love Galaxy Quest. There I said it. I think it is one of the funniest yet most under appreciated movies of the last few years. I own it on DVD, yet every time it is on satellite TV I still end up watching it again and again and laughing again and again. To put this in perspective I'm not even a great fan of comedies, I'm not even a great fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver (although they are both decent actors) but this movie just tickles me pink and has me giggling like a kid every time I watch it.This movie is simply a joy. Unlike many spoofs it doesn't over egg the mix. It is told straight and there are no nudge nudge wink wink asides to the camera. Every joke pretty much hits its mark and there is so much fine observational humour that it perhaps requires a couple of viewings to completely appreciate its subtleties. Galaxy Quest is in many ways the sci-fi equivalent to the Scream movies, in that it sends up all the old clich&eacute;s of sci-fi movies and of course in particular, Star Trek. That said it is not done in a disrespectful manner. I grew up with the original Star Trek and as an adult have enjoyed The Next Generation immensely, which definitely added to my viewing pleasure of Galaxy Quest, which is absolutely choc-full of witty knowing dialogue. Much of the credit for this must go to the invention of writers David Howard and Robert Gordon for what is obviously an affectionate and extremely clever and knowledgeable spoof. Kudos also to Director Dean Parisot for his subtle direction and decision to play the movie straight. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, in fact the whole cast are just great. Galaxy Quest never misses a beat and I highly recommend it!Five stars.	5.0	I LOVE THIS MOVIE	2002-12-27	2	2	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3KXFQQFBPJTQE	"Mr N Forbes-warren ""author of RESURGENCE and ..."	HILARIOUS is the word to describe this affectionate and fun-poking spoof of all those old cheesy sci-fi shows like the early STAR TREK(especially), BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and so on. This movie succeeds with geek sci-fi where  MYSTERY MEN failed with its lame spoof of comic strip heroes. Tim Allen,  Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman(he's funny with his deadpan and miserable  manner as he was in DOGMA) et al play the cast of a sci-fi series(of the  film's title) who are reduced to appearing at Trekkie-geek conventions  where kids nit-pick at technical errors in the series and dress up like  their favourite characters(the Klingons in the toilet scene is a real  hoot). So what happens when a group of real aliens who think their TV  exploits will help them win an interstellar war want them to play their  roles for real? Watch and I guarantee you'lll laugh yourself silly! This  movie is obsessively intent with never letting a laugh get away.

It's a hysterical parody of sci-fi convention culture, mixed with the genuine surprise that - Hey, those phasers aren't shooting blanks.  I was a bit skeptical that Tim Allen could pull off the larger than life role of the captain of a starship; but, nobody warned him that it couldn't be done.

Tim Allen's dead-on William  Shatner imitation (&quot;Never give up!  Never surrender!&quot;), Sigourney  Weaver's surprisingly effective Wonderbra-sporting lieutenant, the always  great Alan Rickman doing that patented exasperated eye roll as the Spock  clone, and scene-stealer Tony Shalhoub (you might remember him as Antonio  on &quot;Wings&quot;) as the laid-back tech sergeant are all in fine form  and obviously having fun.  It's not &quot;American Beauty&quot; (or even a  &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie that takes itself too seriously), but it is a  fun movie to watch.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1TWNOCUFHAQYB	"""nijhazer"""	I'd like to commend the team responsible for the creation of this one-disc DVD package. If it had a filming journal composed by the crew during filming (as Gladiator does) and DTS sound included (as Gladiator does), it would be the best DVD I've ever purchased. As it is, the sheer quality of this DVD is amazing.First things first: the negatives. You get Dolby 5.1 sound with this edition, but you don't get a Dolby DTS track. However, for those who must have DTS sound there is a separate edition which provides it. Also, there are no alternate language tracks that will be of use to anyone (more on that in a minute).But what this DVD does have is a great digital transfer, fantastic Dolby 5.1 sound-- and the best extras I've seen on any DVD in a long time.The Galaxy Quest DVD includes a making-of featurette, production notes, bios on the entire cast, theatrical trailers, TV spots, a novelty audio track (more on that in a minute), and an amusing Easter egg (hint: there is a reason why you must wait thirteen seconds to access the beginning menu). More importantly, you get a slew of deleted scenes that are as entertaining in themselves as some of the full feature's best moments-- a testament to the ability of this excellent ensemble cast.My personal favorite feature is the &quot;novelty audio track&quot; mentioned earlier. I'm still amazed that the producers had the guts to include it, but this movie is a comedy and including a Thermian audio track (Thermian is the odd squawking-noise language spoken by the aliens in the film), in place of something more conventional like Spanish or French, is very fitting.As for the movie-- chances are that if you know how to use your computer well enough to read this review, you've seen Galaxy Quest, but if you haven't, then you certainly should. On the one hand it's a jab at the Star Trek phenomenon; on the other hand it's a very clever movie carried to extreme effectiveness by a fantastic ensemble cast. Sigourney Weaver as a ditzy blonde, Alan Rickman with a big rubber thing on his head... and Tony Shalhoub's performance here-- it's all part of some sort of underlying genius that I can't quite put into words except to say that it's funny even when it isn't trying to be, and it's always good. This is one of the few films that I enjoy more each time I see it.Folks, this DVD is a must-own, and there aren't many of those. Get it now.	5.0	An exercise in DVD genius	2001-09-23	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A37B4DPEOVRESJ	"""notlouise"""	Those of you who crave great movies that don't try to appeal to your most prurient, violent or sophomoric instincts:  Galaxy Quest is it!  And kudos to the writer, Robert Gordon, for that.  This is the perfect movie to see  as a family, even if your family (like mine) is devoid of a single Trekkie  or sci-fi fan.  While Galaxy Quest isn't just for kids, it's loaded with  priceless kid-level humor.  But the humor is all driven by an impressively  witty story, and that story is told with so much sophisticated humor on top  of it all that tears will run down your cheeks.  (Or the cheeks of the  people you give it to as gifts.)  Sure, credit must be given to the able  Director, Dean Parisot, as well as to the great cast.  However, Gordon, the  writer of the movie we saw up on the screen, has to get credit for pulling  off a feat that many of us thought was no longer possible among Hollywood  writers--story-telling with wit, dramatic impact, heart, and decent values.  (To be fair, David Howard did come up with the original concept, and it's  truly funny.  However, I've read both writers' scripts, and it was Gordon  who came up with the the plot, the characters, the whole shebang including  every single one of the jokes and pithy sayings.)  So get Galaxy Quest on  tape or DVD, and maybe Hollywood will take the hint and keep hiring people  like Robert Gordon to write the kind of movie we've been wanting more of!	5.0	This is a classic for all the right reasons!	2000-04-27	21	19	2

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1U0DBMEVYP10M	O.L.J.C.	With all the Christmas time movies which came out with Galaxy Quest, we almost over looked it. Good thing we didn't. The first time I saw it I couldn't stop laughing from a little ways in on! With the childish humor of  Larado(sp?) to the quick wit of Doctor Lazarus, this movie delivers it all.  The movie is such a spoof of Star Tre!. From the conventions with people  dressed like the characters right down the the blue drink(Romulin Ale in  Star Trek) Star Trek is written all over it. When a bunch of has-been  actors/actress are contacted by real aliens they don't know what they're  getting in to. They end up in space fight bad guys, steering through  astroid fields, and  stoping the distruction sequence. We eventually saw  this three times in the theater and now own it on video. There is only one  place the Lord's name is taken and through the rest of the movie there is  only moderate bad language. The only really objctionalble thing is at the  end Lt. Madison's suit gets torn at the top exposing her bra. This is mild  and is only that way for 5 minutes. Other than that, a definite buy!	5.0	Great!	2000-05-24	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2KM2CJJ1PEX6V	"""orionkid"""	It's become one of my all-time-favorite. And I must tell you, without sounding conceited, that I have more than low IQ, as opposed to one of the reviewers' comment. I enjoyed it like a little kid; actually I have become  a kid all over again. It s a wonderful story for the entire family.As  for Alvin D. Lewis, just keep watching &quot;Who wants to be a  Millionaire&quot;. It's a lot of &quot;fun&quot;, besides someday you might  become one. LOL!  In the meantime miss all the good, lovely little movies  that bring joy and laughter in your meaningless, petty life. And I'm not  kidding! You can learn a lot more from books, and browsing the Internet  than from &quot;Who wants to be a millionaire&quot;. By the way, I like  Regis and his show a lot. It's very good. But...If something is silly,  it's not necessarily stupid. Yes, it is a silly movie, but funny, enjoyable  with great characters. It has all the ingredients that make up a good  motion picture. Well written story line, I'm a writer too, rolling actions  that ultimately lead to the final showdown, and the glorious victory of the  &quot;actor-astronaut&quot; team. Lovely, silly alieans, who though  misinterpreted the TV signals, turned out to be brave and victorious in the  end too, in a way that they didn't need the Commander and his crew's help  anymore.The visual effects were fantastic too, much better than one  could expect from a comedy movie. ILM has done yet an other excellent work.  Most of the effects were more eye-catching than in some hit sci-fi movies.  The cast was marvelous, especially the three lead characters, Tim Allen,  Sigourney( oh, I just love her), and Alan Rickman, whom by the way I have  never seen in a comedy before. (I might have missed it). And of course,  Methasar... Don't you just adore him? I can't see how one could not like  him.All in all, it is an enjoyable, loveble, funny little movie, yes,  for future generations too! Two thumbs up, but only because I don't have  more than that. If I had four, then I would say: Ten Thumbs Up! Whatever  anybody says, &quot;Never give up! Never surrender!&quot; IT IS(! ) A  GREAT FILM!	5.0	Glaxy Quest	2000-06-03	3	2	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2OTLGW7CVTN0H	OST ROADIE	This was one of the funniest movies I have seen.  It is ranked in the top 10.  Overall it is about 5 actors and a actor roadie (who is tagging along for the fun of it) who are mistaken, by aliens, for their characters they play in the hit tv series 'Galexy Quest'.I 100% assure you that you will love the movie.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	This film is high concept comedy that comes through with lots of friendly joyful moments and genuine good feelings in what is a cracking entertaining story. Basically this takes the concept of Star Trek (ST) and ports it over to Galaxy Quest, a cheesy version of ST on a lower budget, where after the show has been cancelled and years later the crew find themselves earning a mediocre living at conventions and fan clubs and at the same time falling apart as a group because their leader won't take the conventions seriously plus they are having some relationship issues. Suddenly things change when an alien race hijacks the actors, thinking they are really heroes who have engaged and won great battles based on historical documents (intercepted television transmissions of their television show) and ask the actors to save them from an evil galactic villain. It turns out to be much more enjoyable than what a comedy like this usually ought to be and just steals your heart throughout even when it is being corny. If you haven't seen it, then watch it. Galaxy Quest could be one of the funniest family orientated films of all time. If only most comedies where this good.	5.0	Actors having a lot of fun playing actors	2008-12-11	4	4	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1QRCLZTKHCLE	Paris Capulet	As much a send-up of fan-hood as sci-fi tv, this clever adventure has something to offer everyone. Star Trek fans will see the jokes coming minutes in advance...but that's why we're so cool. The alien race called Thermians present themselves as Pee-Wee's Playhouse rejects, as they grovel and beg for assistance in fending off a deadly enemy. Unaware the mercenaries they have drafted are actually typecast actors who now make a buck as celebrity Mall grand-openers, they take great pride in having secured what they believe are the bravest warriors in the galaxy. The amotivational &quot;rock monster&quot; is a highlight, and is strikingly reminscent of many Star Trek TOS episodes. Very easy to swallow; and Sigourney, as Gwen, as Madison, makes quite the ravishing blonde. Heart-warming finale leaves one wishing for a sequel.	3.0	THOUGHTFULLY CRAFTED SATIRE	2001-07-18	6	4	2
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3II1ACACC5MTX	Pastor of Disaster	"Some actors think they are acting in a scenario where they fight some baddies but actually its real! Robert Downey Junior pretends he is a black character and Martin Shortt is a former childstar with a famed ""quick draw."" Ok, well, its Tropic Thunder and 3 Amigos which features the same plot, but this spoof out does them both. The humour is dry and the character observation spot on. I wonder if Bill Shatner has seen it and if he recognised himself in it. Rickman is wonderful as cynical ""Dr Lazarus"". The whole film is a little lads' fantasy and one that I'm sure appeals to us chaps in our adult world, who wouldn't want to be suddenly in command of a real star ship tasked with saving the Galaxy?What I particularly like is the reluctance of most of the actors to be associated with their work. I remember attending a conference and hosting Blackadder star Tony Robinson some years ago. The PR people had one word of instruction, we were under no circumstances to refer to him as ""Balders"" or ""Baldrick"" as he is particularly un-humorous when it comes to being associated with one of the best comic creations of recent times. Well, what else are you going to say to him?  Its true, je doesn't like being called Balders! He should have got a job on a checkout if that is his attitude! Humph.This is one of those brilliantly watchable films you can safely add to your dvd collection as it can be watched many times and still be funny. Would highly recommend a double bill of Galaxy Quest and ""Mystery Men"" for an enjoyable ""beers in/wife out"" evening of entertainment."	5.0	Quality satire	2009-01-28	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2A1XYSB692L6J	"Patricia ""A Reader"""	"Tim Allen, (""Home Improvement""), Sigorney Weaver, (The ""Alien"" films), Tony Shaloub, (""Monk""), and Alan Rickman, (usually known for playing very serious and often villanous roles, including the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991's ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"",are ""amongst the stars"", in this wonderful, funny, and totallydelightful comedy, called ""GALAXY QUEST"".  They are ""Amongst The Stars"" in more ways than one!  Playing stars of a cancelled TV science fiction show, they are first seen at a sci-fi convention, honouring them and their show, surrounded by adoring fans.  Unknown to the stars of the cancelled show, however, (and their fans as well), is the fact that, amongst the crowd of humnan fans, are some REAL aliens!  They are ""good guy"" aliens, being menaced by ""bad guy""  aliens -- and they think the TV show was real!  They think that the stars of the show are NOT actors - but actually the space heros they portray.  These ET alien good guys want -- nay, NEED -- the help of what they perceive to be Human good guys....and QUICK!Thus begins this truly funny, truly original, and truly engrossing film.  Full of ""Star Trek""-like references, (the soup which the actor who played the Spock-like alien on the cancelled TV show, (Alan Rickman), is given to drink is a stand-out!), clever dialogue, and a very followable story which continues, (very logically!) to give excitement, enjoyment, and laughs, from beginning to end, this film is truly a winner!  Because of the great script and story, good directing, suspenseful music, and actors who are not only good, but  take their roles, and the movie's story seriously....whilst still having fun, there is a fine believability in this story which, sadly, is missing in far too many science fiction/fantasy/horror stories today.THIS is the film to show those you know who do not like science fiction, but whom you would like to like science fiction.  Because it's not just a sci-fi flick.  It is a true comedy, mixing elements of screwball comedy and slapstick comedy, with the aforesaid great story and script, and fine production values.  It's not a film to learn from -- just a film to enjoy.  Then again -- maybe it IS a film to learn from.  Watching it, one learns how great comedies are made! : )"	5.0	F U N N Y.......B E L I E V A B L E.......G R E A T ...!	2010-09-15	3	2	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AZJTA95WSM0ND	Patrick Flanagan	Of spoof movies, I think this has to be my favourite and a definite classic: loved it from the day I saw it, as a teen, and appreciate it in new ways now as an adult.  Writing this in late 2013, the visuals hold up really well from the time it was made until now, and watching it in HD the quality was fantastic and clear, without having an 'aged' feel to it.  There are some fantastic actors in here, and they really are what make the movie- we also see some supporting actors that later make much more of a name for themselves.The plot of the movie- well, I've never seen a spoof that quite grabbed me like this one, both for its originality, lack of over-reliance on the source concept, and strength of individual plot.  The quality acting, directing, and writing really helps in connecting to the characters and crossing the line of suspension of disbelief.  One can laugh hard with it, and yet at points find some deep emotion.  While I feel the ending was a bit showy and a let-down (would have been better if they'd stopped just a tad sooner), it was/is an excellent movie and definitely worth watching at least once for everyone.	5.0	Classic Spoof Comedy done right	2013-11-05	1	1	0

After The Phantom Menace, it's great to see actors who actually care about their  roles, or in this case, two roles.  Buy or at least Rent this movie.  Perhaps a sequel will be made.  Or a series!  And the rubber monsters were  a great touch.  But weren't they on that Ninja Turtles Live action TV  series?  In any event, this is a movie for everyone, and you will not  regret watching this movie.  I give this movie 5 stars only because its the  limit.  But it deserves at least 8.

Delahanty	I'm sure you've read a ton of reviews on Galaxy Quest already and chances are that if you're reading this you already know what the movie's about.  However, you might be wondering what the extras are on the DVD.  One is  called &quot;Omega 13&quot; and isn't accessable until AFTER you watch the  movie.  Once you use it, it's a major disappointment...but it does about  what you'd expect it to.  (I won't say what since it would ruin the movie's  ending.) The other unusual feature is the other language track that's  included on the DVD.  It's the Thermian language.  They've got voice actors  doing voices for everyone in the Thermian language...basically all squeaks  and squeals.  It's funny that they did it for the WHOLE movie and actually  had different voices for different characters, but nobody can possibly sit  through more than two minutes of it without going insane.Although the  DVD doesn't have any director commentary, there is a short piece on the  making of the movie that is basically just a publicity number.  You'll also  find the trailer and some mildly entertaining cut scenes.	5.0	Galaxy Quest DVD has unusual extras	2000-05-05	0	0	0

I am a fan of Star Trek, but that is not necessary to enjoy the spot on parody of cookie cutter 40 minute TV drama plots and the typecast characters that inhabit them.  Alan Rickman as the supercilious alien science officer is a parody not only on the trope but also of Rickman himself. Delicious!  Tim Allen plays the macho captain and Sigourney Weaver the token female cast member sexy eye-candy with her jumpsuit zipper seemingly perpetually half undone.The aliens, who look like cast members from Saturday Night Live's &#34;Sprockets&#34; segment, are hilarious as they try to grasp the concept of fiction and that the television shows they have intercepted of the human spaceship eternally saving the day is not fact based.Watch this movie - you will not regret it.	5.0	Laugh out loud fun for Trekkies everywhere	2014-02-12	1	1	0

It must be noted that this movie is both a deft and total send-up of Star Trek and a vindication of everything Star Trek stood for. Hope, vision, the future, the power of myth and storytelling. It is massively humanistic and great-hearted even as it shows everyone in it to have feet of clay.This two-prong attack even extends to fandom (and Trekkies were the first great modern fandom, excepting only Wagnerites, possibly); it pokes fun at the fans even as it claims that their wonky faith is not at all misplaced.	5.0	The Best Star Trek movie ever made	2014-01-04	0	0	0

Do they defeat Sarris, the Uber-Villian?This movie left me nauseous from laughter and I hope it has the same effect on you!Galaxy Quest is every Star Trek parody rolled into one and IT WORKS to great comical effect!If you find Star Trek cliches a source of amusement, you will love this comedy-action-sciencefiction melange!!!!PS: If you find this review helpful, your marking it as such is greatly appreciated!"	5.0	THE Perfect Star Trek Parody!	2014-07-07	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A343DKR8HKOE0K	Peter	A great comedy but before watching this, I would recommend that you have seen at least some of the Star Trek TVshows/films because a good amount of the comedy rips it off, and frankly, you won't get some of the jokes  otherwise. Tim Allen is cast for a perfect role in portraying the old  captain (Kirk).  The aliens are hilarious and their attempts to act like  Earthlings contain some of the funniest stuff in this flick. The great  thing about this movie is that even though it's making fun of the nerdy  Trekkie atmosphere, it still gives you &quot;goosebumps&quot; in the final  battle scenes in that &quot;melodramatic&quot; way that all Star Trek  movies tend to.	4.0	Galaxy Quest	2000-05-29	0	0	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1Q4ATEMG4CFL5	Peter	I don't deny the fact that the entire concept of the movie is like nothing we have ever seen or heard of before.  Since there is a staggering amount of Star Trek fanatics who actually DO go to many conventions dressed up as  their favourite characters and sometimes even live their lives by the words  dreamed up by Gene Roddenberry et al, the premise of this movie doesn't  really go that far off the mark.Can you imagine what William Shatner  would be like if it were to have happened to him?  Leonard Nimoy would  probably be calling for his mommy.  Frankly, you could have a field day  poking as much fun as you like here.As far as the movie goes, it moves  along very well.  It's well written, the special effects are quite nice,  and it's overall quite fantastic and believable.  I particularily liked the  fact that the 'aliens' were not actually humanoid form (as almost all of  them are in almost every Star Trek episode) but rather had 'image  projectors' or something of the sort.  It was smart, I must admit.  'Smart'  it probably a good to describe this movie.  It does a wonderful job at  finding humor in television series, and if you look closely, there are  little nuances which when you pick out, make you think to yourself  'wow...they've done their homework...look how that alien is walking'.  The  movie's wit, however is something more akin to 'simple'.  I am not saying  that simplicity is bad, but with some of the reviews that I was reading  about this movie, people were making this flick out to be something  absolutely out of this world (pun intended).  I am thinking that most of  those five-star ratings must have been written by many Star Trek fans who  just could not stop laughing at themselves and their manias.Overall,  this movie is WELL done, and I don't want to deter anyone from either  renting or buying it.  Yet, I find that it didn't have me losing control of  my bodily functions due to laugher (e.g.: Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The  Party, Austin Powers 1 -- even though it is extremely silly).  I recommend  this movie to anyone who is interested in a good chuckle, but if you are  the type of person who would rather spend time watching witty, clever and  more intricate humour, then don't expect to be rolling on the floor  laughing to the point where you have to rewind the tape.  By all means, you  WILL be entertained.  I was laughing with this movie, but I think that the  majority of people who rated it hyped it up too much for me.	4.0	It's NOT BAD, but it's NOT STELLAR either!	2000-05-03	2	1	1
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A17BT73RVRQYSP	Peter Ingemi	Sometimes when I write a review and give five stars I pause. After all 5 stars makes a picture equal to THE GODFATHER or GONE WITH THE WIND, and BEN HUR etc. Thus when you have a light film such as GALAXY QUEST I think, &quot;Can I really make this movie equal to them?&quot;The answer is easy: Most people don't watch movies for artistic merrits (Stop fainting you cultured ones) we watch it to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, in fact if you are not a SCIFI fan you will find it even funnier.The plot is classic, every American knows somebody who goves a little overborad with their fandom (on any subject.) We joke about the actors who are typecast so we know this movie almost before we see it.The characters are great, and the performances wonderful.  (This is the closest thing to a sympathetic role that Alan Rickman has ever had.) Sam Rockwell almost steals the show with some great lines:&quot;Didn't you even watch the show?&quot;They may seem harmless now but in a second the'll turn mean and they'll be thousands of em.&quot;&quot;I'm the crewman who always dies to show the problem is serious!&quot;Sigorney Weaver however has the best one, when confronted with something she has to do because it was on the show:&quot;Well I'm not doing it this episode was badly written.&quot;You can't help but smile here.  Even the actors must have been tickled by that.  She is also a parody of herself in the big chace scene near the end as her front zipper gets lower and lower.  It is unclear if it is a parody of that situation on every Sci-Fi series or if it's just to show her clevage which is still attractive at age 50.In the end Tim Allen and crew of course as humans always do adapt and succeed. It's a fun journey, that actually reminds me of Gilligan's Island, (which of course gets a plug here.) it that its a story of Americans who can make it anywhere.Its clean, its fun and will bring you up, buy it and watch it.	5.0	It's not Ben Hur but it doesn't have to be.	2001-10-21	3	3	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2K4A203CSFUCE	Petr SLADEK	Having seen this movie in theatre I knew I have to have it on DVD. But due stupid DVD encoding and even more stupid region locking which only prevents DVD technology from replacing VHS and which only lower profit of movie companies, I had to find out few fixes to my DVD and PC.But it worth! Galaxy Quest is one of the finest SF parody I have ever seen and it uses well known StarTrek like background where group of ex-STlike-TV-series is hired by group od aliens (Thermians) to protect the remnant of their race from evil attakers led by Sarris. You should have to have at least some knowledge about StarTrek (TOS and TNG) series and its common plots and schemes. Just compare the way how Tim Allen behave like William Shattner on the bridge (sitting at cpt's chair, gesturing before lift-off etc.)I do not like to reveal any of many gags and funny events stuffed into this film, so I tell you instead that I like this movie as well as SHREK or MONSTER INC.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3HJAIFRRFHUAB	"Phred ""Phred"""	"As I write this the online voting for Galaxy Quest is over 660, four or five star reviews, and exactly 20, one or two star reviews. It would appear that at least half of the one and two star reviews are not about the movie. This movie is not a guilty pleasure - it is a pleasure.On the odd chance that you have not seen Galaxy Quest and do not know anything about this movie Tim Allen as Jason Smith is the has-been actor of a now out of production but beloved by its nerdy fans, television science fiction show of the same name as this movie. He and his former costars - an unlikely collection that includes Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (take that Harry Potter) and a thoroughly funny Tony Shalhoub(!)- are reduced to paying gigs at science fiction conventions and grocery store openings. The change-up happens when an alien race the Thermanains arrive and draft this team to command their exact mockup of the television spaceship in a life or death battle in a galaxy far away.The parody throughout includes many references to the Star Trek shows with a few asides to the well-known personality conflicts and inside issues among the performers in Star Trek series. Tim Allen is as usual the likable phony but he has such wonderful lines and an unintentional commanding presence.  Alan Rickman as the classically trained Shakespearean actor reduced to such silliness as "" by Grabthar's Hammer"" is brilliant. Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco :..."" it serves no useful purpose for there to be a bunch of chompy, crushy things in the middle of a hallway. No, I mean we shouldn't have to do this, it makes no logical sense, why is it here?"" Have not all of us wondered why there are choppy crushing things inside of science fiction engineering spaces?At the risk of giving away secrets the ending includes a truly clever ""revenge of the nerds"".To those who will talk about obvious jokes and thin plot lines I have no answer. All I know is this is a fun movie. Relax enjoy your popcorn and try not to squirt soda out of your nose when you laugh."	5.0	Okey dokey.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	I have been a Star Trek fan for the longest time &amp; for that simple reason, my girl friend never bothered watching the series with me.  But then again, unknowingly, Star Trek's culture has imbedded into our day to  day living.  If you say phrases like &quot;Beam Me Up, Scottie&quot;;  &quot;Live Long &amp; Prosper&quot; whilst displaying the V sign, your  friends just understand immediately what you're implying.  Anyway, my girl  friend came with me to the cinema reluctantly &amp; she couldn't help  shaking her head noticing that the cinema was filled with males especially  the geeky type, something like me!  Anyway, when the movie started, she  couldn't help laughing her heads off with the goofy storyline.  On top of  the mockery of the Star Trek series, what I'm finding this movie endearing  is seeing all those familiar actors from TV series such as Elliott in Just  Shoot Me, Mitchell from Veronica's Closet, Tim Allen in Home Improvement,  the taxi guy from Wings strutting their stuff.  What's even amusing is  seeing Sigourney Weaver playing a busty bimbo (a far cry from her Ripley  role in Alien &amp; sequels), &amp; Alan Rickman virtually playing himself  as an actor with English theatre background forcing himself re-enacting the  role of  this Spock character again &amp; again &amp; still, the spotlight  is always taken by Tim Allen who's potraying the role of William Shatner.  What's even more delightful about the movie is that in the end, good  prevails over evil. The underlying themes of the movies would be the  significance of teamwork, &amp; self belief. A wonderful film to be shared  with family members &amp; friends.  What's even more unbelievable is that  my girl friend can't wait for the sequel, if there's any!  On the sideline,  Stan Winston, the special effect guy who had brought us the Alien creature  is in his usual best. By the way, the space ship is as corny as ever.	4.0	It Must Be Guys' Things	2000-04-29	81	70	11

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q	Priscilla Stafford	If you have never seen this movie, I must tell you now that you're missing out on one of the funniest movies ever made! The year 1999 has had some of my favorite movies, including &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;October Sky&quot;. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is in that list.There was a TV series called &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; which is the story of the NSEA Protector and it's crew - &quot;Commander Peter Quincy Taggart&quot; played by Jason Nesmith (played by Timm Allen), &quot;Lt. Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor.Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating. But not only that I don't think kids will really understand it or even get most of the jokes. More likely teenagers and adults will enjoy this movie much more. I'm most certain by the time you've watched this movie a couple of times, you'll be reciting all of the funny lines from the movie (my family does all of the time!)	5.0	&quot;Never Give Up, Never Surrender&quot;	2001-11-29	2	2	0

With a witty script and a marvelous blend of adequate special effects and action, this film is a comedy with its tongue-in-cheek humor affectionately administered. Tim Allen is good as the parody of James T. Kirk while Siguorney Weaver provides ""ample"" support as a communications officer with limited skills. Allan Rickman does a fine job in the ""Leonard Nimoy/Mr. Spock-role as the actor forever typecast as a result of his character's popularity. Darryl Mitchell as the ""token"" minority ""speaks"" for the underused talents of Star Trek vets Nichele Nichols and George Takai. Most of all, it is Sam Rockwell who really steals the show as a ""bit player"" who accidentally gets taken on an adventure of a lifetime.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"The stars of a cult television series are recruited by real aliens to help save them, in ""Galaxy Quest,"" a top-notch parody from director Dean  Parisot.  For four years it was a hit show, the crew of the NSEA ship  ""Protector"" keeping the Universe safe on a weekly basis; then it was  canceled.  Now, twenty years later, actor Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), better  known as Commander Peter Quincy Taggert, and four other members of his  ""crew"" are on the convention circuit.  When he is approached by a small  contingent of aliens (they've taken on human form, or course) at ""Quest  18,"" he understandably looks upon them as just so many more obsessed fans.  The next day, however, they show up at his home; soon Jason is aboard their  ship in deep space, where he discovers that their entire civilization,  apparently, is based upon the ""Historical documents"" (weekly episodes) of  ""Galaxy Quest"" they've intercepted over the air waves.  They also have the  real technology by which they are capable of inter-galactic space travel,  and have built an actual version of the ""Protector.""  What they lack is  leadership; a true Commander.  They simply do not possess the wherewithal  to oppose the aggression of the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) who is  threatening the very existence of their race.  Jason returns to earth to  gather the rest of his crew, and they're off to ""negotiate"" with Sarris;  Jason being the only one who knows that it's all real.  The others agree to  come along only because they think Jason has scored a good gig and they  don't want to be left out.  After all, work is work;  you take what you can  get.  It takes a number of things to make a movie like this work, not  the least of which is the right cast; and this one more than fits the bill.  Tim Allen lends just the right amount of bravura and ego to make his Jason  believable, while demonstrating the restraint needed to prevent him from  becoming overblown into a mere caricature.  Alan Rickman is perfect as the  dour British thespian, Sir Alexander Dane, who portrayed the Spock-like Dr.  Lazarus in the show, as is Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), the actress who  had little else to do on the show but look good.  Tony Shalhoub (Fred  Kwan), imbues his character with a singular eccentricity which adds that  ""something extra"" that makes him so memorable, and Daryl Mitchell (Tommy  Webber) is engaging as the pilot who finally gets to do it for real (and  much to his chagrin, initially).  But the versatile Sam Rockwell (Guy  Fleegman) very nearly steals the show as the actor who only appeared in  ""Episode 81"" as ""Crewman #6"" (and was killed off before the first  commercial), and who is thrilled to finally be one of the ""crew.""  At least  until things start going for real much as they did in that fatal (for him)  episode 81.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Patrick Breen (Quellek),  Missi Pyle (Laliari), Jed Rees (Teb), Justin Long (Brandon), and Enrico  Colantoni, who does an especially fine job of bringing Mathesar, the leader  of the aliens, to life.  Parisot must be given credit for not  resorting to slapstick nor playing the comedy too broadly here, either of  which could easily have been an option with a project like this (and would  have been to the detriment of the film).  Instead he has taken an  intelligent (and very funny) screenplay and made the most of it.  The  timing is excellent, and the action tight.  Writers David Howard and Robert  Gordon have sprinkled detailed bits throughout the film, with which Star  Trek fans especially will be able to identify, and they have managed to  capture the look and ""feel"" of the original Star Trek series, particularly  in the scene which takes place on the alien planet.  ""Star Trek"" may have  been the main course, but now ""Galaxy Quest"" is the delicious dessert; and,  as such, it will keep you coming back for more.  This is a movie you will  want to watch over and over again, without ever tiring of it.

Since there was nothing else to do, and no other movie choices, I watched it - expecting a cheesy B-grade trekkie-spoof.  Well, I certainly didn't expect  the film to turn out the way that it did.  I ended up watching it twice!  Why?  Well, it is very well acted, considering that the actors are playing  actors, and that they are taking off the 60's trek shows.  It is also very,  very funny.  On the second viewing, I found even more site gags that I  missed the first time round.  The humour is excellent, and the corny scenes  fit just beautifully.  It is very well directed, and the movie flowed well,  kept you entertained, and made you laugh out loud a lot.  Even if you  aren't a trekkie, you'll appreciate the plot.  But, if you - like me - grew  up with Star Trek, you'll appreciate the humour that little bit more.  Certainly worth watching at the flicks, and definately worth owning so you  can watch it a couple of times.	5.0	You don't need to be a trekkie - but it helps	2000-05-11	2	1	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"I recently re-watched GALAXY QUEST after a roughly decade long hiatus.  I think it may have gotten even better with time.  If you wanted to make a movie spoofing the original STAR TREK series and the cultural phenomenon it has become...you simply couldn't do better than this film.  It pokes fun of the genre, the cast, the fans, the cheesiness and the conventions.  Often, rather pointed jabs.  But it's infused with real affection, and it even tells a pretty exciting and moving story of its own.""Galaxy Quest"" was the name of a `60s TV series that looks an awful lot like STAR TREK, the original series.  You've got the handsome, womanizing captain whose shirt is often ripped off to expose a glistening bare torso (Tim Allen), you've got the token woman working on the bridge, whose only job is to repeat the things the computer is saying outloud already (Sigourney Weaver), the alien with the serious demeanor and no sense of humor (Alan Rickman), and even the guy without a name who always beams down to the planet and gets killed in the opening few minutes (Sam Rockwell).  And while Engineer Scotty isn't directly spoofed, you've got Tony Shaloub as the blissed-out, mellow actor who once filled that role.Twenty years later, these actors have little to do but make paid appearances at conventions, in costume.  Some absolutely hate it (Rickman), others tolerate it and for Allen, it's the highlight of his life...although at home, he's a hopeless lush.  These old cast members can barely stand each other, and lord knows they are pretty sick of never getting to do anything else.Turns out, though, that the broadcasts of their shows have traveled through space and been intercepted by an alien race on a distant planet.  These aliens, however, think the broadcasts are ""historical documents"" and they create the science needed to perfectly replicate what they see on the show.  And now these gentle aliens are in trouble and so travel to earth to enlist the help of their old heroes...the cast of ""Galaxy Quest.""I won't say much about the plot, except to note that it plays out much like a Star Trek episode...it's a legitimate adventure story, coupled with a great spoof.  Will our weary cast members rise to the challenge?  Will they find redemption?  Can you guess the answer?  And because you can guess...your enjoyment should actually be enhanced, because the film finds delightful ways to surprise you throughout.The script is very good.  The jokes aren't exactly Oscar quality...but neither are they cheap.  The film takes the time to develop real characters...and is careful to make the aliens quite unique themselves.  These aren't just cookie-cutter aliens designed to fill the needs of the plot.  We can actually see how these actors might actually take a liking to these aliens.And if the script is good, the cast is GREAT.  This is a modest film, overall (even though the special effect still look pretty good even today)...but these actors are clearly fully engaged in what they're doing.  Weaver is hilarious, really spoofing both Star Trek and Ellen Ripley.  Often, I find Weaver to be a bit tight as an actress...very good, but lacking a breezy quality.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's relaxed and having great fun.  Shaloub is a delight, stealing most of the scenes he's in.  Sam Rockwell takes his manic energy and puts it to perfect use...he's convinced that he's destined to be ""that guy who dies on that planet.""  Rickman is droll and understated.  At first, his character is seething with resentment at having to wear that awful makeup and say those stupid lines.  Watching his gradual growth is a subtle pleasure of the film.  And Tim Allen (outside of his great voicework in the TOY STORY films) may actually give his most credible film performance here.  He's not a great actor, nor even a particularly adept comic...but this role is almost custom-fitted to him.  He only has to be ""serious"" a little bit, and he can handle it.  He is called on to be glib and self-mocking...and is able to muster than quite readily.GALAXY QUEST was a real treat to revisit, and I heartily recommend it for either a repeat viewing or a first time adventure...particularly if you're familiar with what it is spoofing!"	4.0	A very funny & well-conceived spoof!	2010-03-08	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Tip one: never, ever go to a PG-rated film at 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. I got spoiled by having empty theaters for the last few movies I went to. I haven't seen a theatre this full since Sleepy Hollow. At least the subject  matter was more appropriate this time.Despite the presence of some  serious starpower, this had the potential to be a truly awful movie.  Thankfully, it managed to avoid that, although it took the easy way out.  The cast of an old TV show called Galaxy Quest are making their living  showing up at conventions. (Sound familiar?) They are approached by a band  of real aliens, who think that the reruns are actually documentaries, who  ask them to save their planet from the evil lizard-bird-alien-thing Saris.  The commander (Tim Allen), who thinks they're asking him to do a faked  appearance, goes along and discovers himself actually out in space, in a  real replica of the Galaxy Quest ship. He lures the others (including an  extra who was killed five minutes into his episode-- sound familiar?) into  helping him battle Saris. With, of course, the expected results.This  could have also degenerated into simple parody. And it's good enough simple  parody of the first few crossover Star Trek films (while Tim Allen's  character is obviously modeled on Jim Kirk, Alan Rickman seems to be an odd  cross of Spock and Picard-- early on, he mumbles to himself, &quot;Why am I  doing this? I played Richard III!&quot;), with more than enough laughs to  stand, but what turns this puerile silliness into truly biting satire is  the second level of parody; if you see Star Trek itself as a self-parody,  something that was meant to be cheesy, then you can see a lot of Galaxy  Quest as parody within parody. The miners (you've seen the trailers, right?  The ones Sigourney Weaver says &quot;look like little children&quot;) bear  a more-than-passing resemblance to Teletubbies, carrying on the Star Trek  tradition of pop-culture cannibalism; jokes are made about Tim Allen's  character sleeping with everything that moves; etc.All is well and  good with the last hour of this film. It's funny, smart (well, okay, in a  stupid way), well-acted, and cheesy as all get-out. It's the first twenty  minutes that I couldn't get my head around. The slowest of slow starts,  which usually spells death for a comedy; the strength of the movie's  remaining time is all that saves it. The cast are capable. The script is  stupid, but it's supposed to be (and intent is everything). Sigourney  Weaver still looks fabulous with half her clothing ripped off.The  tagline is &quot;never give up; never surrender.&quot; I wish they'd  circumvented it long enough to give up the first twenty minutes of this  movie. ** 1/2	3.0	Hit the fast-forward button for twenty mnutes	2000-06-18	5	0	5

The DVD makes it even better, with a rich menu of extras, esp. supplemental documentaries and outtakes. We can argue about whether the outtakes belonged in the film -- though it helps to see what the director felt compelled to discard (though I think Dr. Lazarus' tour of his quarters was worth retaining). DVD sound and video quality superb.The actors' backgrounds show how remarkable this film is, in that several dramatic actors -- Sigorney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Alan Rickman -- hand in hilarious out-of-type performances in Galaxy Quest.Very worth owning.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A23VTC6VKNFZVE	Robert D. Williams	"Late in the 20th century, the Thermian High Command had intercepted earth's Historical Documents accidently beamed into space.  With this knowledge, they were able to recreate the NSEA Protector, a highly advanced interstelar space craft crewed by Commander Peter Quincy Taggart (Tim Allen), Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Dr. Lazarus (Allen Rickman), Fred Quan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell).  Having squid-like bodies in real life, they were forced to take on a more human like appearance to operate the controls.Sarris, a reptilian villain, has been making life miserable for the Thermians and has killed many of them.  In order to save their world, their commander, Mathesar seeks earth's assistance.  He finds Taggart and begs his help.  Mathesar, as well as all the Thermians believe the""Historical Records"" are real.  They don't know the meaning of the word deception.  They do not know that Taggart and the whole Protector crew are only actors and that the real Protector is a ship 6 in. long. Thinking this a stunt and possibly a gig for the retired actor, Taggart  agrees to board their ship.  He soon realizes this is no gig and that Sarris is painfully real.  Taggart convinces other members of the old TV sci-fi series to help the Thermians in their fight for survival.The entire film is a spoof on the Star Trek series.  It is funny and serious at the same time.  But, worth mentioning, it does not impugn Roddenberry's classic work.  More likely, it glorifies it.  Allen, Weaver, Rickman and Shalhoub give outstanding performances in the film and carry the predictable plot. It is an enjoyable movie that all Star Trek and sci-fi fans should enjoy.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	"You don't have to be a fan of ""Star Trek"" to like ""Galaxy Quest,"" but it helps. This lighthearted spoof skewers all the conventions of the sci fi genre without mocking them. Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver are the big stars here, but I liked the totally unhinged performances from Sam Rockwell and Tony Shalhoub (unsurprisingly typecast as a neurotic engineer) best. The premise is simple: an aging television show has a crew who are scraping the bottom of the professional barrel when real aliens who have patterned their entire civilization around them recruit them to help negotiate with (and later militarily defeat) Sarris, an impossibly ugly and cruel alien who clearly pays homage to the Klingons from ""Star Trek"" (his ship likewise bodges together features of a Klingon ship and the planet killer from the classic ""Star Trek"" episode ""The Doomsday Machine."") Through much drama and entirely predictable scenes (Tim Allen loses his shirt in an epic battle with space babies, a pig-lizard, and a rock monster, for instance) the actors learn to be a real starship crew keeping the universe safe for civilization in the end. As an aside I did find the joke about ""Gilligan's Island"" (""Those poor people..."") from the Thermian's ""historical documents"" hilarious, and laughed out loud at the delightful deadpan delivery.I have to admit that I took a while to warm up to this movie, and therein resides my point reduction for the review. The film dragged on occasion, especially in the first half where the interpersonal dynamics were established in the crew (we get it: Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith is an arrogant slacker who his co-stars can barely stand to be in the room with; he's an undependable lout who never shows up on time...let's move along.) I eventually gave the film a four star rating, but in the first half I was considering less. Mercifully the pacing of the second half is much snappier and more satirically on point. I won't spoil the plot, but I was a particular fan of the great twist ending and the last ten minutes of the film, which convinced me the film was worth a solid four stars overall. Special effects are first rate (I particularly liked the Thermian's cephalopod forms,) and the film is quite lavish especially given the subject matter (I did like the vintage ""Galaxy Quest"" footage shown in the film-within-a-film scenes where the Thermians come to grasp with the concept of acting.) If you want to see a light comedy with a sci fi bent, and particularly if you are a ""Star Trek"" fan, ""Galaxy Quest"" should be high on your viewing list."	4.0	"""They Were Termites!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AW3FTPCBPVQNB	Robert J. Schneider	Dean Parisot's GALAXY QUEST (1999) was released at around the same time as some very big, high-profile, Oscar-nominated films during the Holiday season, advertising itself as the light in the midst of all the dark. Starring Tin Allen, who at that time had starred in films ranging only from cute (THE SANTA CLAUSE--1994, TOY STORY--1995) to lame (JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE, FOR RICHER OR POORER, both 1997), I had the sickening feeling from the trailer that this would prove to be the latter. I was encouraged by the presence of Sigourney Weaver, although unsure of her blond-bimbo role, Tony Shalhoub and Alan Rickman. But still, I wasn't sure...That is, until I began reading the reviews, and then saw the film as soon as it came out on DVD. This is one of those movies that I can't believe has taken me this long to write about on these pages. Make that rave about: GALAXY QUEST is one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and would be in my Top 30 Listmania List if I were allowed to go to 30. It does help that I'm a STAR TREK fan (although not quite a Trekkie; please read my review of the documentary TREKKIES for more exposition on this point), but I honestly think that anyone with a good sense of humor will like this movie. It is written with a knowing wink to the Trekkie phenomenon as well as to Star Trek, and has smart dialogue courtesy of David Howard; unbelievably enough, this was his first---and still his only---film for which he has written.The film opens with a convention for the immensely popular &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; series, which starred full-of-himself screen hog Jason Nesmith (Allen) as Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart (not dissimilar to James Tiberius Kirk), Gwen DeMarco (Weaver) as Lt. Tawny Madison, former Shakesperean actor Alexander Dane (Rickman) and former child actor Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) as Lt. Laredo, the ship's (very) young Navigational Officer. Nesmith secretly hates the Conventions, but plays up to the shows' fans, whose attention he monopolizes at every turn. Naturally, this long-established practice has alienated him from his co-stars, who hate his guts but like participating in the Conventions (except for Alexander Dane, who rues the day he became more famous for his character, and his character's famous rallying cry, than for being a 30+ year veteran of the Shakespeare stage). Nesmith finally loses his cool when being overly nagged by a teenaged nerdy fan (Justin Long), and yells at him in a manner that instantly recalls the &quot;Get a life!&quot; mock admonition that William Shatner gave in a 1986 Saturday Night Live skit. However, on the next drunken-hangover morning, Nesmith is visited by a strange-looking and talking man (Enrico Colantoni) who introduces himself as Thermian Cmdr. Mathesar, whose people are under attack by an evil alien leader named General Sarris (Robin Sachs). He pleads for Taggart's assistance, having seen the &quot;historical documents&quot; of his crew's many victories over greater enemies. Nesmith hazily just assumes that this is another nerdy fan with no life and goes along with him just to appease, and perhaps he has nothing better to do at this point. But then he finds out...Of course, Mathesar and the Thermians are real aliens who had picked up the TV-wave transmission of the &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; show and, in their childish impressionability, have assumed that the crew, the ship, everything was real. They have replicated the ship in full, both inside &amp; out (since you know, for example, that Star Trek has always been so detailed that exact replicas of the Enterprise have numbered in the thousands) and have modeled their society from their example. Nesmith exitedly gets back to his fellow cynical and unbelieving actors, who go along only because they think it may be a well-paying job. Then they find out...GALAXY QUEST is smart, funny and has a lot of fun with the TREK phenomenon, as portrayed through this fictional TV show and its characters. It also has fun with all the conventions (that is, *customs*) of Sci-Fi TV shows, such as gigantic, death-defying devices being present in a starship's engine room, or that the fate of our heroes comes down to one final second. It nudges &amp; prods at all of these (plus more) with a complete love for the Sci-Fi genre. It also manages to convey a *sense of wonder* through visual effects that are really excellent. As for the acting, everybody---yes, including Tim Allen---gives a terrific performance, including Sam Rockwell as a minor &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; character who constantly fears for his life during the actors' real mission, because nobody knows his last name, which, of course, is a sure sign that he is going to die, just like his character did on the one episode of the TV show! Enrico Colantoni's performance as Mathesar is infectious, and is perhaps the biggest revelation in the entire film; it can be argued that he may have deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Robin Sachs creates an evil presence as the murderous, slimy alien General Sarris. Best of all, everybody's in on the joke.GALAXY QUEST is a great buy on DVD. The &quot;On Location In Space&quot; feature is entertaining and informative. The deleted scenes are a hoot! All in all, this film is a great way to entertain the entire family, as it is among the few comedies that are intelligent yet can be viewed by children. I wholeheartedly give it a &quot;thumbs-up&quot;---wait, no, that's the other guy! In other words, I deem this movie to beHIGHLY RECOMMENDED; AGES 8 &amp; UP	5.0	Wonderful Spoof Of Both Trek AND Trekkies!	2004-06-27	6	6	0

It's one of the first movies that I own on VHS and DVD both (the only other two being 'The Last Starfighter' and 'The Iron Giant').  However, the DVD, while actually very  well done, just seems to be missing something.  The missing scenes included  in the film are fine, but there were scenes in the film's original previews  that are oddly missing, and a lack of a director's track on this DVD is  something I find detracts from the overall quality.  It feels like somebody  spent a lot of effort, but forgot a few key things.Is it worth your money?  Oh, absolutely!  It has all the things that made the film so watchable and  entertaining, and the 'Thermian Language' Dolby track is inspired (though  it does get old quickly.)  Some of the animations and linking sequences in  the DVD menu are quite entertaining and clever, but I find myself wishing  there was a 'Collector's Edition' of this film for nutso completionist fans  like myself.Until then, though, this DVD will do just fine.Questarians  unite!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	`Galaxy Quest,' a good-natured bit of sci-fi parody, plays upon a universal fantasy most of us have nurtured since childhood: what would happen if all those action/adventure fantasy games we spent hours acting  out in the backyard suddenly became reality? What if we were called upon to  actually perform the feats of heroic derring-do - battling evil enemies,  securing last-minute rescues, saving entire galaxies - which comprised many  of the idle waking hours of our &quot;misspent&quot; youth?In `Galaxy  Quest,' a group of actors gets this chance. The stars of an early-80's  pseudo-Star Trek adventure series, these performers are reduced to spending  their time making appearances at well-attended retrospectives, replete with  fans who dress in costumes, recite whole lines of memorized dialogue and  demonstrate a decidedly unhealthy inability to differentiate between the  world of reality and the world of the `Galaxy Quest' series. The film pokes  gentle and affectionate fun at this strange subculture of obsessed fans  that seems to attach itself inexplicably to these examples of mind-numbing  mass media creations - yet these fans get the final laugh. For suddenly,  some benign, terminally cheerful, genuine aliens, initially  indistinguishable from the earthbound fans of the show, kidnap the actors,  believing them to be the genuine articles and just the heroes they need to  defeat their evil enemy, the malevolent Sarris. Before we know it, the  stunned actors, after an initial state of understandable hesitation and  insecurity, discover the inner strength and knowledge to emerge as  bona-fide heroes for the occasion.`Galaxy Quest,' handed a clever  premise, manages to generate a sufficient number of genuine laughs to  compensate for the occasionally wearying effect of redundancy that  invariably accompanies comedies based on a one-joke formula. The cast - Tim  Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl  Mitchell - seems to be having an enormous amount of silly fun, as their  characters all assume the roles they have been playing so long on TV, even  though logically, no one actor should be the natural commander more than  any other. This sense of formalized logic manifesting itself in the  decidedly illogical context of this story provides much of the giddy fun of  the film.The special effects are spectacular and the set design pays  clever homage to all the `Star Wars/Star Trek' productions that have come  before it. Yes, the film is loopy and, as with most comedies, the jokes  that work don't come fast and frequently enough to fill in all the dull  passages that, unfortunately, seem to be inevitable in this genre. Still,  for a bit of mindless fun and a few hearty chuckles, `Galaxy Quest' is  worth donning your World Federation uniform and strapping yourself in for.  It turns out to be a pretty enjoyable ride.	3.0	fun, goodnatured parody	2000-07-25	8	4	4

Penola	The inspired casting of this movie is what really makes it tick, and the idea of jaded television star has-beens being whisked off to an alien planet to save the world certainly unfolds with its share of lunacy and  laughs.  Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are particularly funny, playing  the entire fantasy straight.  The special effects are top-notch, and the  humor often delivers, but the movie is one star away from comic explosion,  and it could have been.  What with the intrinsically funny idea of  Trekkie-type rabid fans and the faded glory of popular icons who merely  acted their way to glory, is a premise ripe with wildly funny possiblities.  This movie is breezy, has its charming moments, but, if made for example  by the skewed comic genius of Christopher Guest, without quite as much  PC/tender moments, might have been a comedy classic.	4.0	FUN FUN FUN	2000-04-26	3	2	1

The last time I saw this so effectively done  was in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors,&quot; where an opening &quot;Broadway  song&quot; sequence not only lampooned those kinds of productions, but had  impressive production values in its own right (gosh, maybe there's a term  for this sort of thing, but I'm at a loss here).&quot;Galaxy  Quest&quot; is a big hit because it will appeal to: 1) those who have a  fondness for &quot;Star Trek&quot; and similar SF shows. 2) those who have  wondered about the seemingly obsessive devotion to such shows 3) those who  may not be all too familiar with such SF series, but nevertheless would  enjoy a well-developed script, suspenseful action, and even a few subtle  moral lessons (note how Commander Taggart, at the end, invites his fellow  crew to &quot;share the stage&quot; with him, and how some lessons on  leadership slyly sneak into the story).This is also a movie that an  entire family can enjoy, with humor working on different levels so that  even very young kids can find something to laugh about. There are various  inside jokes, that those who are even minimally familiar with past SF  television and movies will find amusing (listen for Sigourney Weaver's  comment alluding to her &quot;Aliens&quot; roles).  So all in all, an  extremely likeable movie that has enough clever humor that it does not  readily wear thin.  Probably worth a video purchase if you've ever had any  affection of a SF series or movie dealing with outer space. &quot;Never  give up...&quot; Hollywood sometimes finds a way to hit all the right  buttons (even blue ones)!	4.0	Rare Hollywood Comedy -- It's Clever and Fun!	2000-06-08	0	0	0

What do they do years after the series has been canceled?And just what DOES happen to those radio signals of old Star Trek (and Gilligan) shows escaping the Earth, and traveling outwards at the speed of light?The Thermians discovered these ""historical documents"" (unfortunately for the Thermians, they had not invented fantasy, lying, or acting), and develop their society based on the principles of ""Galaxy Quest"" (a mock version of Star Trek) and its crew.  But another race is now fighting the Thermians, and winning.  The Thermians need the commander of the ship, the NSEA Protector.  They don't need the Protector, however, because, based on the historical documents, they built their own.Thus the adventures begin.The similarities to the original Star Trek series are interspersed throughout, and done well.  The bad dudes are very bad, and the Thermians are really just lovable.  No wonder they are losing!  But the key element of this movie is the transformation of the Protector's crew from actors to space-faring adventurers.  The vital connection they have with their groupies back on Earth is also well done.Great movie!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2FA18B50XGXJX	Sam Damon Jr.	Galaxy Quest is not just a comedy. In fact, its the FIRST movie since the early 60s Star Trek show to really capture the adventure of space travel. ALL of the other Sci-Fi movies since and before the original Star Trek show have failed to capture the spirit of adventure--think about it---Star Wars are really a war movie, where you have a narrow focus of getting from point A to B etc. All the others have a similar narrow focus and even the Star Trek movies could never quite recapture the adventure and mystique of being able to go anywhere in space and find things out...yet Galaxy Quest succeeds. How?GQ does this cleverly by taking us, the cynical audience and placing us at a Sci-Fi convention where all our cynicism are showing, and then drops the bomb--what IF REAL ALIENS SHOWED UP? And this then propels us as we identify with the phony TV cast into a world of possibilities----and we are soon sweeping through the skies of space on a real adventure...[GQ succeeds] where ALL others have failed....	5.0	First to capture spirit of adventure since Star Trek	2000-11-22	1	1	0

There were a few moments that were humorous, but I kept waiting for the film to go somewhere. Maybe my sense of humor is delegated to films  such as &quot;Hot Shots&quot;, &quot;Naked Gun&quot;, &quot;Airplane&quot;,  etc. If it relied more on Star Trek where you could identify the characters  or situations, it might have been funnier.

But it was only loosely so and I remember going a couple of times because it had so much depth to it. The Blu Ray Edition is terrific in that it looks great and has wonderful special features. I watched all of them before watching the movie and it really made things better! If you are not a Star Trek fan you'll still 'get' this movie. It definitely stands alone in it's class.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	"This is the best satire comedy on the market, making fun of the old Star Trek show and all the conventions and Trekkies that followed the show.The aging actors of the Galaxy Quest show still attend conventions, signing autographs for money, and no other acting career left because of the previous popularity of their show.  Commander Peter Quincy Taggert is just Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), a has been actor with a big ego.  He's in dutch with his fellow cast members for taking side jobs without them.  At a convention, Jason runs into the Thermians, who request his help to negotiate with Sarris, the general of an evil reptilian race.  Jason believes they are simply fans, and has no idea that the Thermians are true aliens who have modeled their lives, and their ship, after watching transmissions of the show.  The Thermians believe the show is historical documents, not old reruns of entertainment television.After discovering the Thermians are real, Jason convinces his crew to come with him into space.  The Thermians put the crew in charge, not knowing they are just actors.  What follows is a hilarious romp through space with 'B' grade actors fleeing Sarris's revenge while trying to save the Thermians.  All of the cheesiest aspects of the old Star Trek shows are brought back to comedic life. (""Look around you, can you construct some sort of rudimentary lathe?"")Stealing the show is Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco (""I have one job on this lousy ship, it's stupid, but I'm going to do it!""), Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan (a laid-back, stoner type), and relatively unknown Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman (the expendable crewman).  Their comedic performances are absolutely top notch in this film, and there's a lot more humor hidden in it than just a first time watch can capture.  It's a movie to watch over and over again.Whether you love or hate the old Star Trek shows, as long as you love excellent satirical comedy, you will definitely enjoy this movie.  10 Stars!

I was thrilled when I realized I could buy it on DVD.  I have the old VHS tape version somewhere.This follows the story of a cast of an old Sci-Fi (very ""Star Trek""-ish) show that are still going to conventions.  There's a race of aliens who watch the show and think that it's real.  They imploy the help of the cast of the show, having built everything about their culture around it, in order to save their race.The cast has to come together, putting aside all differences, and try to tackle the situation at hand.  They also end up with a better understanding of what had come between their relationships over the last so many decades and also how to better respect their fanbase."	5.0	A Must Have!	2009-08-22	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	If you have seen the earlier episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, you'll know how effective a cleverly done sci-fi satire can be.Galaxy Quest mines a shuttle-full of sci-fi cliches for its banter, and while I don't remember anything laugh-out-loud rip-roarious, there is a good deal of congenial charm that permeates throughout. Which makes it a perfect family flick to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.Apart from the spoof gags, what took me by surprise were the superb special effects, as octopodal aliens morph effortlessly into humans and back again in articulately designed space (the interior of the spaceship itself borrowed its staid cardboard looks from Star Trek of yore, perhaps as an intentional sardonic effect)Overall, the film's affection for its audience (especially those weaned on Lost in Space, or The Next Generation, etc) and for the characters it parodies covers up for the gaping blackholes in its highly implausible and goofy plotline.Great rental, and even a good buy because it lends itself easily to repeat viewing.	4.0	MISCHIEVOUSLY CLEVER AND SLICK SCI-FI SATIRE	2004-06-19	13	13	0
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AHPEZ3WPUU2NK	Shawn Fuller	This particular movie was entertaining.  Not only was there quite a bit of comedy it had great sense loyalty and friendship all throught it.  When the movie first started there was a lot of anger amd tension in the crew of  Galaxy Quest.  The commander and crew were feeling like their lives were a  huge washout.  But after they were recruited to help &quot;real  aliens&quot; they relized that they were more than just a bunch of  insignificant small humans. They were closer to the characters that they  played on television than they thought.  The sound quaility of this movie I  rate a 3 in 5.1 surround sound.

I appreciated the tongue-in-cheek elbow in the ribs this film  gave to Star Trek fans and conventions, and a lot of other sci-fi shows for  that matter, but the timing seemed a little off to evoke spontaneous  humor.Great make-up and good acting. The DVD's look at deleted scenes is  a must-see... it's funny to see what scenes were cut, and why and to hear  the commentary. This was a clever film, but it fell short of what the  trailer promised. The funniest scenes were already shown in the previews,  so it was hard to glean other laughs from the rest of the film.A film  that takes a more direct approach to making  light of ST fans is  &quot;Trekkies&quot; .... which blows this film away in regards to quick  wit and non-stop laughs.Some very cool animated characters and other SFX  make the film worth watching for lovers of eye candy.	3.0	Funny, but not &quot;all that&quot;	2000-06-30	11	5	6

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3R324C4OITNR7	Shlomo Pestcoe	Confession: I'm what you'd call a &quot;soft&quot; Trekkie. I've never been to a Trekkie Convention or donned Spock ears but I'm versed enough in all the original series episodes to know that if you see kids in the first  scene, you'd better switch the channel. So, when the rave reviews for  GALAXY QUEST began to appear hailing the flick as a hilarious send-up of  STAR TREK, you know I just had to check it out. Well, I'm glad I did 'cause  this one's definitely a winner and a keeper!To begin with, the film's  writers are familiar enough with the STAR TREK universe to whip out some  well-aimed satirical phaser blasts. The thinly-veiled jabs at William  Shatner (the ham everyone loves to peck at)-- and his often rocky relations  with the rest of the STAR TREK cast (read their books)-- are witty and  on-target but not mean-spirited. Likewise, their take on the die-hard  Trekkies-- who have been mercilessly lampooned on everything from SATURDAY  NIGHT LIVE to THE SIMPSONS-- is hysterical without being nasty. I could go  on and on, but I think you get the point.STAR TREK spoofing aside,  GALAXY QUEST has all the essential ingredients of a truly enjoyable sci-fi  film: great character development; a script that really, really works; and  very cool effects. And it's a laugh-riot too! Whoa, what a concept...Hey, George Lucas, maybe you should check this one out.

It is hard to imagine a parody of William Shatner, since he was and is something of a full time parody of himself, but Tim Allen plays the self-important commander to great effect. The secondary roles are of equal importance, especially the Sam Rockwell as the guy who had a bit part in one episode of the show and is now certain he will die because the unnamed characters always die.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3FZ06XRKW5JC5	"snalen ""snalen"""	`Galaxy Quest' is an old, long discontinued TV space adventure series with an extremely geeky cult following. To put it another way, `Galaxy Quest' is `Star Trek' modified just enough to keep the intellectual property lawyers at bay. Its cast featured the macho captain Taggart played by Jason Nesmith played by Tim Allen; Lt. Madison played by Gwen DeMarco played by Sigourney Weaver, whose job on the ship is to repeat everything the computer says and have great breasts; Spock analogue, the alien Dr Larazus played by Alexander Dane played by Alan Rickman; and a few others. None of them have tasted remotely comparable acting success since, so they continue a little desperately to squeeze a living from their GQ celebrity. It's not something they mostly much enjoy, especially Dane who remains in his dreams at least true to his former self-conception as some great Shakespearean actor.  Even the normally enthusiastic Nesmith is starting to find the whole business depressing.Meanwhile in a distant part of the universe, the Thermians pick up transmissions of GQ. Having no concept of fiction they assume they are watching reality: `historical documents'. Inspired, they model their society on the values they see embodied in the show. And then, endangered by a threat from evil alien Sarris, they turn up at a GQ convention to ask for help. Next thing our old troopers know they are on a very real replica of their fictitious spaceship and expected to take command in a serious emergency. A few large problems present themselves. Sarris, for one thing is desperate to know what the ships most spectacular hi-tech gizmo, the Omega 13, actually does. But of this Nesmith et al have no idea, they' re just actors after all. Indeed there is a pile of stuff about how everything works they have no clue about and they have to solve the problem by getting in contact with a few skinny geek schoolboys back on Earth with an unhealthy obsession with every obscure technical aspect of the TV show...This is one of the very best American movie comedies of the late 1990s. The idea is a splendid one and it is stuffed full of rich comic conceits. It works beautifully as a gentle affectionate parody of the whole `Star Trek' world. And it works beautifully too as a self-contained, character-driven comedy. Indeed, comedy aside, just as an adventure story with good guys in conflict with ugly green baddies, it's a lot more exciting and enjoyable than 100 other sci-fi movies that play it straight. It is intelligently written, ably directed and very well acted. Rickman and Allen are especially good among those playing human characters; Robin Sachs is a brilliantly malign Sarris; but the film is completely stolen by Enrico Colantoni as Thermian Commander Mathesar, at once the funniest and most lovable alien you are likely to encounter at the movies any time soon.	5.0	Low Key But First Rate Comic Space Adventure	2004-03-03	4	4	0

As a Star Trek fan from WAY back, I love this spoof of the original series, (with elements from &#34;Next Generation&#34;), but also love the modern special effects that enhance the tale. The premise? Imagine Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, et al, trying to put on a brave face years after the series was cancelled, making the rounds of comic-cons and store openings with a degree of dignity. Suddenly they find themselves in outer space, expected to BE the characters they portrayed as they face some truly scary other-worlders.

There are some very clever skewerings of &quot;Star Trek&quot; pretzel logic, and the  aliens (especially their leader) are hilarious. I especially loved Tony  Shalhoub as the almost comatose &quot;engineer&quot;. But the biggest  problem with this movie is that its lead is played by Tim Allen. This man,  along with Ben Affleck, embodies the death of charisma. Horrible,  absolutely horrible performance, all mugging and smirking. Give me Shatner  any day -- at least his hamming is delivered with a wink. Still,  &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is definitely worth checking out. You can't do  worse than Tim Allen, but you can do a lot worse with a sci-fi flick (like  &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;).	3.0	Good movie with some flaws.	2000-05-18	5	1	4
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AJ1XZYGXJGKU4	Stephen C. Coyle	"I love movies where the main character starts off as a selfish, self-absorbed, uncaring jerk and evolves into something better by the time the closing credits are rolling down the screen. Galaxy Quest is just such a moive.Jason Nesmith is a successful actor with money, fame and a gorgeous house in the Hollywood hills.  He's also something of a shallow,selfish, insensitive jerk who treats his fellow Galaxy Quest actors very poorly.  He basically doesn't care about anybody other than himself.Then a race of alien beings (who mistakenly believe that Nesmith is the great military leader he portrayed on a television show) tranport him across the galaxy to help them confront an evil alien general, bent on military conquest of the Thermians and any other race he can conquer.Nesmith is forced to learn real quick about self-sacrifice and teamwork in order to survive and to save the Thermians, his fellow actors and himself.By the end of the movie, Nesmith is a much better person than he was at the beginning of the movie.  He redeems himself.I suppose it's an old theme (Charles Dickens worked the same theme in ""A Christmas Carol"" in 1843), but it's still a popular theme.And while Tim Allen (as Jason Nesmith) was the star of this movie, I rather enjoyed Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, Sigourney Weaver as Gwen Demarco and Tony Shaloub as Fred Kwan.Tony Shaloub is a bit character in this movie with only a few lines, but make sure not to miss any of them.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A33BV2080KHNT5	steve_of_the_jungle	When I first saw this, it was time when Trekkies and such were out. Star Trek was hot as a flashback/pop culture thing, and this movie looked to be a cheap cash-in.But that couldn't be farther from the truth. I was shocked at how good it was. The story is spot-on, making fun of all the aspects that deserve it (fans, plot devices, typecasting, James Tiberius Kirk and more) and the cast was a fantastic get for a movie that plays as just a spoof. When you can get Sam Rockwell (in his 2nd best Sci-Fi role) to play a bit part, you're doing very well. And Tim Allen, who so often turns out poorly instead shows us all that with a good script, he can hold his own against actors like Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub who would seem to far outclass him.This movie is entertaining all the way, with only a very few short dead spots. All the characters are played well and it actually works as its own story, beyond being a Star Trek riff.I could hardly imagine how this could be made better. Even making it actually mention Star Trek directly would only limit their ability to make light of the characters and actors.I could not possibly recommend this more to fans of Star Trek, Sci-Fi or just good comedy. This movie is one of a select few that I watch over and over when I need entertainment (alongside Caddyshack, Trading Places and Office Space), it's just that good.	5.0	far, far better than you could expect	2009-11-17	29	26	3

I thought it was a lot of fun &amp; worthwhile.I don't usually go for Tim Allen - his barking-ape act never did it for me, but he's perfect for this role as the hammy goof thrown into the deep water.  The whole thing came together perfectly around a strong concept.  Star Trek itself is kind of stale and might have expired of old age, but it's nice to see that there's still a lot of love out there for this material.	5.0	Very Good &amp; Well Written	2004-04-12	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A21CN7UXGRT53J	Susan Shwartz	I saw GALAXY QUEST in company with about 20 other writers and editors of STAR TREK novels, scripts, and CDs:  we didn't quite scare the projectionist with our shrieks of laughter at the star's Kirk imitation as  he sat in the center seat, the reference to the Klaatu Nebula, the Romulan  ale on the dinner table, the Gorn, and Alan Rickman's sardonic comment that  he sees that Allen as the Jim Kirk wannabe, managed to get his shirt off,  and many others.The action is as nonstop as the humor, and the special  effects, while stunning, do not get in the way of story, action, and the  spirit of what is really a very sweet-natured film.From the first  pullback shot of the Questarians on convention (I've spoken at SF  conventions and STAR TREK conventions, so I can attest to the  &quot;reality&quot; of the scene) to the way that the fans band together  and, essentially, save the day, to the look of utter joy on the kids' faces  as they guide the wandering starship home, this is a film that makes gentle  fun of the people who will understand it best, but that laughs along with  them, and leaves them, not just laughing, but the ultimate winners.Even  the biggest cynics, like Rickman's irascible actor with his five curtain  calls playing RICHARD III, get beyond their disillusionment thanks to the  faith, trust, and technical skill of the Thermians, while Tim Allen's  confession that he &quot;lied&quot; marks the beginning of a rebirth of his  spirit -- and Mathesar's evolution into his own command abilities.  And  Sigourney Weaver and her Wonderbra chronicle how a &quot;dumb blonde&quot;  develops courage, love, and self-respect.A wonderful film.  You don't  need to know STAR TREK to love it -- but it's more fun if you do.  Pass the  popcorn.	5.0	Never give up; never stop laughing!	2000-05-24	4	4	0

I think whether being a fan of Star Trek or not isn't really important.  ""Galaxy Quest"" is about a cast of actors who share a history (having worked together in a discontinued long-running Star Trek-like television series), have been resting on their laurels and finding it tedious and one another irritating, and are hoping for another t.v. gig.  When they find themselves zapped into their old show, but for real and facing honest-to-goodness aliens, their ensemble acting skills kick in.  Many important life lessons, sweet and bittersweet, are shared using uproarous humor and sensitivity.  The acting is outstanding all around -- everyone shines.

If you've never watched Star Trek or any of the Star Trek Movies, you'll find it moderately amusing but you'll  be missing a tremendous amount of the humor.If you watched the old  Star Trek show and/or any of the movies, you'll find if pretty funny.  You'll get some of the jokes, and recognize a few of the characters.If  you've ever gone to a Star Trek convention, you'll get most of the jokes,  recognize almost all of the characters, and probably fall off the sofa  laughing.The one complaint I have with the DVD is that the  &quot;mocumentery&quot; that they created for the Sci-Fi Channel isn't on  there.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2KP1SXTMHK8ZO	"TheBanshee ""M.J."""	"Alan Rickman had me from the get-go. In Galaxy Quest, he plays a former legitimate-theatre actor who had the mixed blessing of playing a Mr. Spock-like character in a long-defunct ""Star Trek""-like TV show. These days, he is reduced to appearances in full makeup and uniform at fan conventions and ribbon cutting ceremonies at local strip malls, and his anguish is a riot.(That's where the title of my review comes in. It's delivered by Rickman at a ribbon-cutting with such despair and distate, you find yourself laughing).This movie is hilarious. There are so many quotable lines, as I'm sure a lot of reviewers here have already indicated.Anyway, it turns out that there really are aliens out there, and they have caught every episode of the Galaxy Quest TV show and interpreted them as real-life occurences transmitted from Earth. Believing the Galaxy Quest cast to be real starship personnel, the aliens plead for their help.I won't say anything else, except that a catsuit and blonde wig is a very good look for Sigourney Weaver :)"	5.0	By Grabthar's hammer... what a saving!	2007-10-14	1	1	0

It's premise sparks some genuinely comic situations as it cheerfully but not disrespectfully sends up the &quot;Star Trek&quot; phenomenon and it's legion of fans.  The most amazing thing about &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is that it looks like a film that it sends up.  This is not a cheap, low-budget parody like &quot;Scary Movie&quot; or the first &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film.  &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is a lavishly produced and features the expert talents of Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and the underrated Tim Allen.	4.0	&quot;...two, two,..four-two...two,two..four-two...&quot;	2000-11-24	0	0	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3RKKEF3UC5Y9V	"The Honourable Husband ""Honourable"""	I stumbled onto this movie on a plane, casually flipping through the  programmes.  I thought it would just be a string of cheap gags a la  &quot;Naked Gun&quot;(not that there's anything wrong with that).But  it's actually quite a droll little morality tale.  Witty, well-observed and  based on a truly inspired idea.  Perfect casting, too--Sigourney Weaver has  a ball avenging her numerous space-jockey roles, and the aliens push their  characters to the limit without crossing the fine line into overacting.  Alan Rickman steals the show, though.I watched it twice (it was a long  flight; it beat listening to Bob Newhart on the comedy channel for the  millionth time) and bought the DVD.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	"GALAXY QUEST could have been the greatest STAR TREK film ever made.  I wonder if the filmmakers had bothered pitching it to the Trek franchise.  Can you imagine if Shatner had played the lead?  Shatner playing Shatner playing Kirk.  If the original Trek cast had been in this movie--and it would not have been tough to taylor it a bit back to its original source--it could've been a hilarious classic in the Trek canon.But I don't want to take anything away from the cast in the film.  Tim Allen really breaks out of his stand-up/sitcom persona and plays a Shatner-esque role.  I was really surprised as to how good he was in this movie.Sigourney Weaver is almost too intimidating as a serious actress.  Depsite the blond hair and push-up bra, she's still Sigourney Weaver, Academy Award nominated actress.  In GHOSTBUSTERS, she played the straight gal to Bill Murray, an Academy Award nominated comedian.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's playing another washed-up sci fi actress...but I still see Sigourney Weaver!  Wasn't too distracting and she was very good.  (But when you think about it, how great could some of the typecast actors and actresses have been if they hadn't been pigeon-holed by a iconic role?)Alan Rickman is another incredibly talented actor (although best known as Hans Gruber, the slick German mastermind in DIE HARD).  If he hadn't been hidden under his silly alien makeup, his impressive talent might have been distracting as well--but it's not!  He's excellent.  The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Tony Shalhoub and Sam Rockwell.One of the reasons I waited to see this film was because I thought it would goof on the Trek fans.  With scenes at a sci-fi convention and fans as characters, I was afraid that the film would pile on to make fun of them.  Kind of like when Shatner did the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch where he tells the Trekkies to ""get a life.""  Funny, but too easy of a target.Well, GALAXY QUEST doesn't take that easy route.  It doesn't poke fun at the fans.  In fact, the fans actually come out as heroes in some scenes.  It's a film that understands the fan's affection and doesn't insult them.A funny and fun movie!

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2T918KPLK74LL	"""themancalledsam"""	When I first saw the ads for this movie, I squealed in disgust, because, quite simply, all the ads on tv made it look like just another typical cliched piece of garbage. Luckily for me, I was struck down by insomnia on  the night my family rented this, and ended up discovering this movie to be  the gem it is. This film satires the whole Star Trek concept, along with  all the other low grade scifi shows of the 60s and 70s. The woman who's a  pair of ambulatory breasts. The gallant captain who loses his shirt during  battle, showing what a man he is. These scenes are so well integrated into  the film that when Tim Allen's shirt was torn off, I at first thought  &quot;oh, what a blatant attempt to make him look good.&quot; This movie  also features multitude of funny little lines and moments.  The aliens get  kind of annoying pretty quickly, but hey, the movie's good enough. I  definitely recommend it for rental if you need a nice flick, but not worth  a buy.	4.0	Unexpected gold!	2000-05-14	2	0	2
0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	AENS008HCBVC5	Theodore Illenberg	This is a movie about a group of actors from a canceled SCFI TV show. These actors make the money by making appearances at the shows fan conventions. These actors are mistaken for the real thing by a group of aliens who are being slaughtered. They ask for their help. They have biult an actual ship based on the television transmissions of this show.This show is a great spoof of Star Trek and its fans who have a hard time grasping reality. The ending is fantastic when they have a shootout with the bad guys. The show is renewed as &quot;Galaxy Quest: The saga continues&quot;.

I can still taste this movie.Hollywood is still at it: putting all the budget into special effects, and nothing into a decent script. I could've written a better script while taking using the restroom.Now, why did I watch this thing? Well, Sigourney was looking pretttty cheeeeeky in those commercials. And the special effects looked impressive. As for Tim Allen, I never much cared for him; matter of fact, he's not even talented enough for public-access TV.So, looking at Sigourney and the special effects, I sat down eagerly for this movie. Then boredom went through me like a catheter. And later pity. First self-pity, then pity for the poor actor who played the villain in Die Hard; and here he is playing third string in this noxious bit of cow-fodder.The only other merit this movie has is as a cure for insomnia.Boredom, they name is Galaxy Quest.	1.0	Jettison This Movie	2000-10-18	142	8	134

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A22QTZ5F98PSBS	"""thezerg"""	I love when these movies that look childish come out and are more or less  aimed at an older viewing audience.  This DVD is served to be a classic in  your collection of other movies.  The quest was simple, save an alien  planet from destruction, but it turned much worse when they pick  out-of-work actors and actresses from a show called StarQuest.  Trying to  help the aliens out, they come upon many bluders and faults in there search  for victory.  Not only does the cast really bring this movie alive, the  special effects and comedy really keep you up and interested.  Comedy is a  big portion of this movie and it really keeps comming at you, if your  observant, you'll notice many little things happening in the background as  a scene is going on.  This movie is creative no the less and should be  viewed by all, even the kids.

It's a parody of the Star Trek series and its fans, but it isn't mean-spirited in this ribbing.  Fans of the series who don't take themselves too seriously will be able to thoroughly enjoy this movie.  Tim Allen plays the domineering captain of an old science fiction television show called Galaxy Quest.  The way he tries to steal attention from his co-stars is taken directly from William Shatner's grandstanding.  The stand-out performance comes from Alan Rickman as Dr. Lazarus, the Spock of the Galaxy Quest series.  Tim and Alan are continually sniping at each other which brings on the laughs.The story opens with the cast of Galaxy Quest making an appearance at a convention for Galaxy Quest fans.  Obviously, the only one who is enjoying it is the captain.  All of the other cast members are in living hell.  During the convention, even the captain loses his enthusiasm.  While in a deep depression, he is contacted by some strange fans who turn out to be real aliens.  Can the washed-out actors of Galaxy Quest handle a real space crisis?  Check it out.

Picture the crew of a SF TV series, sick to death of conventions and the unwashed masses that adore them. Okay, the captian loves them but gets his kick in the pants... Now what would happen if the transmissions of the show were taken seriously by aliens? If they were in trouble and needed help... who would they turn to? Yes! They come to Earth and enlist the help of the less-than-sober captian who thinks it is some sort of amateur ""shoot"", but he descovers the truth on the return to Earth. The real fun begins when the aliens return because the badguy isn't defeated - just ticked off... One of my favorite films ever, if you were ever into sci-fi or think that scf-fi fans are head cases, it will probably entertain you. The fact that actors try to operate a fully-functional starship based on the one from the TV seris is a real hoot! Simply a 'must see' - hands down!

But it's the rare comedy that can make you laugh and also make you feel so good.I have also been an irredeemable Trekkie (yes, Trekkie, though I did watch the later series, I am truly a child of TOS) from childhood.  It is amazing how this film walks that fine line of poking fun, yet at the same time showing enormous respect for both the series and the conventiongoing fans (of which I am an occasional one.)The beauty of this movie (and as I understand it, it was originally written with all the Star Trek characters in place and later revised due to all kinds of legal and logistical issues) is that the story itself, even without the reference to the original Star Trek series, is a heartwarming story of the real nature of heroes, the value of loyalty and friendship, and the power of myth.One of the best examples of this is in a scene later in the movie when Sir Alexander Dane (played beautifully by Alan Rickman, better known as ""Professer Snape"") sets aside his pride and immerses himself in his role for the good of the Thermians as he and Quillig begin the Mok Tarr (sp?) Chant of Strength together trying to open a door to save their friends.Really, the Thermians' child like belief in the Galaxy Quest crew and the way their faith (and that of a few dedicated earthbound fans) both redeems the actors and is rewarded in the end is as satisfying as the very best fairy tales.  It may even leave a lump in your throat!This movie has great effects, wonderful action, spot-on acting, loads of laugh-out-loud moments.  It is simply fun from front to back.  They don't usually give academy awards to these kinds of pictures, which is understandable in a way, but I would wager that there are very few award winners that will warm your heart and have you feeling as good as this one will by the end."	5.0	"Pitch Perfect Trekker (or ""ie""!)

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F	"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions"""	"I am a Star Trek fan, and I had read that this movie was an outrage to all that is Star Trek.I have to disagree with that. I felt that it took an interesting turn. What would happen if actors had to LIVE the roles they play on TV? (okay, there was a Twilight Zone episode that asked the same question, but it wasn't funny.)It also begs an interesting question... since our TV transmissions DO go out into space... what would real aliens think of them? Would they know that so much of it is fiction? Would aliens even have fiction in their lives?What would they think of game shows? Comedies? Cartoons? Would they be able to tell the difference between a news show and a political opinion show? Maybe we should be more careful about what goes on the air!Back on earth we tend to believe what we see on TV, and a Star Trek Universe looks pretty inviting (except there are no bathrooms on Starships). We also tend to think that actors behave in life like their characters. This is sometimes a point of contention for movie stars who are trying to shop for groceries! ""Galaxy Quest"" explores these issues in a gentle but touching way.Here we look at the ""reality"" of a sci-fi fantasy universe. Only, it's just as unreal, but the characters have to take some of it seriously because they are stuck in it. Its like looking at the reflection of a mirror. Wonderful stuff!The characters, well, they're just so funny and sometimes so sweet. They could not have a better cast!The film actually does play with our emotions. Although it is a comedy, some of the characters die (not who we expect) and it is very touching and sad. Some characters are tortured, and that is painful to watch. It's because as silly as everyone is, we like them and feel for them. When the ""chief engineer"" gets the Beryllium Sphere working again, he calls his team for a group hug. How sweet is that?The script writing is very witty and clever.Imagine a universe where aliens can make technology but ""Our attempts to use it have proved disastrous"". I could say the same of my AT&T; Go Phone. Come on, this is wildly silly and fun!The film pays homage to other films of the genre (The line - ""Theremins from the Klaatu Nebula"" is a reference to ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" which used theremins (the musical instrument) in the score). It's all played tongue-in-cheek to great effect.And it proves that sci-fi doesn't have to take itself so seriously to be entertaining.Watch it for the jokes, they come fast and frequent.Some of the best lines from the film (I'm paraphrasing here):""I have ONE job to do on this ship. It's STUPID, but I'm going to do it!""""Listen to me -- it's all real!""""Did you even WATCH the show?""""Set it to Screen Saver Two""When negotiating with an enemy alien about a potential doomsday weapon:""We don't know what it is either. (referring to the Omega 13 device) We were hoping you did.""Pros:Wonderful cast - top notchGood set design and props.Good special effects.Wonderful jokes.Excellent characters and interactions.Nice musical score.So silly it is absurd in an amusing way.Cons:None to speak of really,(I have it on VHS and it looks just fine.)"	5.0	Wonderful film, great jokes, Wonderfully Silly!	2012-11-04	1	1	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1NGENT0TNW1ZW	Tufster	&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is a lighthearted satire of the whole sci-fi world, especially the &quot;Star Trek&quot; gang (here called &quot;Quest-arians&quot;).  A group of TV actors now make their living from appearances and autograph signings, after being on the cult favorite TV show, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;.  Real aliens then come and need their help to save the aliens' planet.  Tim Allen is positively Shatneresque as Commander Peter Quincy Taggert (shades of Captain James Tiberius Kirk!)  Sigourney Weaver (playing actress Gwen DeMarco who plays Lieutenant Tawny Madison) has only one job to do - as she says, &quot;Oh my God, I'm repeating the computer!&quot;  Tony Shalhoub is hilarious as Tech Sergeant Chen, sort of a Scotty-on-tranquilizers.... in a deadpan voice, &quot;Commander, they tell me that the engines are about to blow...just a FYI...&quot;  Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane playing &quot;Doctor Lazarus&quot; gives a great performance as a classically trained Shakespearean actor who has been typecast as the Spock-like alien of the show.  He's known for just one line (&quot;If I have to say that line again I'll throw up!&quot;)  But since The Show Must Go On, he does say it again and again.  &quot;By Grapthar's Hammer, I will avenge you!&quot;  One question for the fellow Quest-arians out there.  The movie ended (SPOILER WARNING!  SPOILER WARNING!)  with our heroes taking part of the real alien ship and landing it pretty hard in the convention parking lot and convention hall!  That is, scattered cars, busted walls, torn-up stage flooring all over the place!  Now how are they going to explain this?	4.0	But What Happened After The Convention?	2000-11-27	1	0	1

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3P7T395UWBCRQ	T. Wallace	I vaguely recall hearing about this film, and I don't even remember what it was I heard.  All I know is I had no desire to see it because Mars Attacks! kept coming into my head, and I hated that film.In 2006, on a Chrismtas flight back home, I happened to look up at the monitors from time to time and caught a few bits and pieces of the film while listening to my MP3 music. Without sound, the film seemed stupid, the villain seemed corny and the acting looked horrible.  The only thing that kept my attention was wondering if the blonde was actually Sigourney or just a younger look-alike.  Hey, the in-flight monitors are small!  Bottom line is, I never realized the film was mainly a comedy.Flash ahead four months when I was moving into a new place and a friend had given me the Galaxy Quest DVD as a house-warming present.  I hooked up the home theater system first thing so I could get some activity going in the new place, and I took a break and watched a little of Galaxy Quest - and the rest is history.  I instantly loved it and have watched it more times than I care to admit.For all the reasons and more that many of the previous reviewers enjoyed this film, I do, as well.It's a solid story with great acting and writing, terrific spoofs, excellent special effects, and is tremendously pure and funny.  Move over, Spaceballs, there's a new kid on the block!  Without a doubt, the single-best sci-fi comedy ever created!  And the drama is good, too.  It's a great combination of everything, which is why it's so entertaining and can be watched countless times.  Can't believe as an avid sci-fi moviegoer that I somehow neglected to find this gem sooner.Other sci-fi flicks I enjoy include: Alien, MIB, Evolution, Deep Rising, Zathura, Explorers, Bi-Centennial Man, iRobot, H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, King Kong (2005), Jurassic Park 3, Cube Zero.Sci-fi flicks I don't like include:  Star Wars series, Harry Potter series, LOTR series,	5.0	A very pleasant surprise!	2007-07-14	4	4	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3NP0CTPOH3UXE	"""uhhuhyep"""	Galaxy Quest is a funny movie that kids over the age of 5 will enjoy. It stars Tim Allen as an actor named Jason who stars as Captain Peter Quincy Taggart on a show called Galaxy Quest. But when aliens from another planet think that the show is real, they call on Jason and his 'crew' (Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell)for help on defeating the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs).This movie has very funny characters including Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), the leader of the aliens, Lalari (Missi Pyle from Josie &amp; the Pussycats), Fred (Tony Shalhoub)'s alien girlfriend and Quellek (Patrick Breen), Alexander (Alan Rickman)'s biggest alien fan.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A16GAIJJE39T1S	Ulfilas	Galaxy Quest provides a look into the Star Trek TV and movie and genre that is both amusing and illuminating.  To think of the hapless aliens who mistake the televised adventures of the crew of U.S.S. Protector for actual deeds still makes me smile!  Tim Allen gives an inspired performance as the shoot-from-the-hip Kirk-like commander who mistakes the enemy they must face for a character in a fictitious scenario presented by fans of their canceled TV show.  Sigourney Weaver is charming as the sexy but operationally superfluous female officer.  Allen Rickman is hilarious as a British Shakespearian actor chafing under his ridiculous role as the obligatory (and latex-crowned) alien member of the crew.  An amusing minor character is the high school kid sci-fi geek who ultimately provides them with the essential details for their starship needed to triumph over their galactic enemies.  Don't miss the crash landing of their starship at a Sci-Fi convention--or Sigourney Weaver's new, improved, and cleavage-enhancing uniform!	5.0	Blast first, realize that you've enraged a galactic terror later!	2011-12-22	3	3	0

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A20W1IU4Q0ZI3	Warren	I have been a fan of Star Trek since it was originally aired, however, I have never been a trekkie.  This film is an entertaining spoof of the series and it's fans. The cast (Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Daryl Mitchell, Sam rockwell & Tony Shaloub) of a long discontinued TV show (Galaxy Quest) make their living doing dedications and fan conventions. Aliens (Thermians) that have little self-confidence in their own abilities, recruit the actors to a lead them in their battle against evil General Sarris. After a less than successful encounter against Sarris, resulting in the near loss of their ship and a broken power core, they encounter a couple of other strange species while barely surviving, but maintaining the confidence of their recruiters.  This is a movie after all, so after their ship is captured by the enemy who nearly kills all and attempts to destroy the Protector, they make a heroic comeback. By outsmarting the brutish thugs attempting to kill them, they escape. With the help of some young &#34;Questies&#34;, they stop a &#34;core implosion&#34;, free the Thermians that are being sufficated by lack of oxygen, defeat the enemy aboard their ship and eventually destroy Sarris' battleship.  Sarris of course escapes & they must battle him once more with the use of a secret weapon, the &#34;Omega 13&#34;.  While trying to return to Earth, they are unable to stop the Protector, so they have to seperate the command module and use that to land.  Of course, they end up crashing into a Galaxy Quest convention, where they finally kill Sarris, once and for all and of course have their TV Show revived. Not a masterpiece, but enjoyable.	4.0	Campy, Sci-Fi Spoof	2013-12-31	0	0	0

As long as you've seen even a few episodes of any of the Star Trek series and are a fan of laughing this movie is a MUST see/have, this is one of those movies you want to watch over and over, when I first saw it in the theater, the 3 people I was with and I all wanted to see it again immediately, though that was already the last showing :(Even the concept is funny, (mostly based on the original Star Trek series) the actors from the tv show ""galaxy quest"" haven't done any acting, except for that show in a long time, they just attend the 'trekkie' conventions signing autographs, but at the convention is a small group of actual aliens who ask the captian to come with them and help fight off the bad guy endangering their species, unfortunately the captian is drunk and thinks it is just ""a gig"" in a overly big fans basement.  He doesn't realize that it was all real until he gets 'beamed' back to earth and then trys to convice his costars that it is all real.  The aliens come back for more help and they the whole crew gets beamed aboard, much to their shock and amazement.  Now the crew who doesn't want to admit that the ""historical documents""  (the galaxy quest tv show) were not really historical documents but just entertainment, must try to help the aliens fight the bad guys based on their memory of what they did on the show.A great line-up of characters--including Guy -- ""crewman #6"" who is scared the whole time knowing that, ""crewman #?

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3ANJVW0VLFC0N	"William E. Hunter ""Ummagumma"""	Those are the best two words to describe Galaxy Quest.  Another good phrase would be &quot;one of the best movies Dreamworks has produced so far&quot;.It's been a long time since I've seen a parody film hit  its intended targets with such accuracy and finesse.  The movie deals with  the crew of the Protector, a spaceship that exists only in reruns of the  strangely familiar early 80's ensemble SF TV show Galaxy Quest.  Exiled to  mall shows and science-fiction fan conventions, they  live out their days  signing autographs for fanatical, show-quoting groupies until they're  propositioned by some rather distinctive &quot;fans&quot; for a very  special mission...What ensues is an incredibly fun skewering of the  whole Star Trek experience, effortlessly bouncing from knowing parody to  rollicking action to heartfelt emotion.  And it's all headed by a  top-flight cast led by Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith/Commander Peter Quincy  Taggart.  Aiding and abeting him is his flouncy blonde side-kick, played  by...Sigourney Weaver!  This brilliant casting coup alone should tip you  off to the film-makers' attitude towards the subject matter.  Also present  is Alan Rickman in an incredible turn as the token alien cast member who  longs to return to Shakespeare, Tony Shalhoub as the boggled engineer, and  Daryl Mitchell as the cute kid who is now all grown up.  But as good as the  human cast is, they fade into the background whenever they interact with  the true aliens of the picture, the Thermanians.  Masking their true  squidlike form in a human disquise, they lurch across the screen speaking  in stretched and strangled accents with ever-present goofy grins on their  faces.It matters not if you're a bred-in-the-bone Trekkie or wouldn't  know a Mark I phaser if it jumped up and stunned you...there is just so  much to enjoy here.  It probably does help if you're at least familiar with  the source of the various in-jokes contained within, but Galaxy Quest is  careful to surround its Trekian pokes with a surprisingly touching story of  personal redemption.Sure there are plot holes the size of black holes,  and the motivations for the aliens' actions are as vaporous as a plasma  cloud.  But this is one of those movies that revels in its own wonderous  creations so much that you really just don't give a damn about blasted  logic.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A1IPLGELO76EC6	william woolum	Galaxy Quest is a parody that goes beyond poking fun and making its audience laugh (which it does beautifully).  This is also a movie about a man who doesn't take himself very seriously.  He has  become so absorbed in  the fame of his old television role that he's a real nowhere man, but he  develops sincere love and loyalty for the aliens who have called him into  service and becomes a true leader in a crisis.  I will watch this movie  often because it explores the way in which courage and goodness are basic  and essential human qualities. They exist within us, even when hidden  behind laziness and being inauthentic.These characters find courage, a  courage that grows our of their desire to rescue their beloved alien  friends from danger.  One can enjoy this movie as a spoof.  But it also  invites one to be inspired by the  transformation its characters experience  in the heat of battle and in protecting justice.	5.0	A Perfect Comedy:  funny, inspiring	2000-05-03	3	3	0

The running &#34;expendable guy&#34; joke is a riot and never gets old - &#34;maybe you're the plucky comic relief.&#34; The aliens are amazingly human . . . one wonders what the offspring will look like.This is one to settle into with a jug of Klingon Blood Wine and watch one more time.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A3OI841P5R6FCH	Zagnorch	"Wow, a sci-fi spoof that not only pokes fun at sci-fi/space opera shows, but also takes aim at the fans and conventions! It even goes after the actor's love/hate relationships with each other. Much like the original Trek crew's general dislike of William Shatner, the broken-down thespians of ""GalaxyQuest"" don't particularly care for the attitude of the `captain' (Tim Allen). Then there's the `crushy, chompy things' scene that rags on space opera shows' more implausible plot devices &amp; gimmicks used to add suspense to the adventure. There's even a `Thermian' language track (a very annoying language to listen to after 30 seconds, BTW), which I'm sure is a take-off of the unbelievable popularity of the Klingon tongue; a language that's actually taught at some colleges no less!Although `Star Trek' is never mentioned in the movie or `making of' documentary, its influence can definitely be seen, especially by one who's immersed him/herself in the sci-fi/space opera culture, and has hit a few geek conventions. The con clips of the ""Galaxy Quest"" show had the exact look and style of the original series episodes. The cardboard bridge, the paper-mache rocks that made up the `planetbound' scenes- it's all too familiar to the hardcore Trekkie. They even take a shot at the NextGen show, with a (then) twelve-year-old flying the ship a la Wesley Crusher! And the NSEA Protector looks like it could fit right in with any other ship in the UFP's Starfleet. All in all, ""Galaxy Quest"" is a really good poke at `Trek's look and style, yet done in a way that also pays tribute to the show and its subsequent space-opera competitors &amp; spin-offs.I was also amazed by make-up/creature FX designer Stan Winston's work on this flick. Winston combines the various E.T.s' other-worldly `realism' with a just a smidge of cartoonish Muppet-style silliness to make them look real, yet unreal at the same time. General Sarris and his minions exemplified this look to a T: threateningly deadly, yet yet a tad silly-looking, too. The pig-lizard thingy and the Thermians' `true' appearances also displayed a neat combo of strange and ridiculous.As for features &amp; extras, this offering has all that one would pretty much expect from a big-budget digital video release. The picture &amp; sound clarity are top-notch. And of course it's in widescreen so you can see the whole thing without missing what's on the right and left. Then there's the usual theatrical trailer &amp; cast/crew career bios &amp; production notes thrown in. Of course, ther's also those things that aren't always present in every DVD release, such as outtakes, cut scenes, and a secondary dialogue track (the aforementioned Thermian dub). I found most of the cut scenes rather amusing, and I was disappointed that many of them weren't restored to the movie itself. Some of them, however, had incomplete CGI effects, and a few were alternate scenes with different outcomes from what was shown in the movie, which likely made it hard for the DreamWorks powers-that-be to pick &amp; choose between what should be restored and what should not.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2GCLRTA6MDTPO	Zardoz2293	"I have always been a Sci-Fi fan.  Even the poorly written Sci-Fi flicks with their backyard quality special effects captured my heart as a child.  I remember when this movie was in the theaters, unfortunately, I saw a distributor preview and thought ""Great, they have ruined another movie experience by showing too much...""  A friend said you have to see it!  I must say that my experience with the preview left such a bad impression with me that I just recently decided to view it, thinking it was going to be a visit to the dentist.  To my surprise and great pleasure it was and is very enjoyable.  If you are a Star Trek or Sci-Fi fan in general you will enjoy this movie.  Most films today are poorly written and use special effects as the only driving force behind the film (i.e., Star Wars, Episode I) and therefore have a once only viewable rating.  Galaxy Quest is not one of these movies.  I am sure you will enjoy viewing it over the years.I added this excellent film to my large DVD collection last week.  Relative to all the DVDs I have viewed; this is, without question, the poorest quality mastering you most likely see in a DVD by a major distributor.  If you never play your DVDs on your computer or you don't have a large TV you will most likely never notice any problems.  However, if you play this DVD (DTS version) on your computer you will immediately notice on a high resolution monitor the inappropriate high level of compression used.  What is interesting is that if you view Gladiator, also from DreamWorks, you will not encounter the 'pixel blocks' or sound sync (sometimes) problems encountered on the Galaxy Quest DTS product.  After a careful study of the 'quality' issues and comparing to various sized TV formats, using different DVD players, and viewing another DTS version relative to the non-DTS product, it appears that it the problem is only on the DTS version of Galaxy Quest.  If you own a DSS and are satisfied with the frequency of 'macro block' pixels then the DTS product will not be a problem for you, otherwise, buyer beware.---UPDATED November 2011Review is based on ""DVD: Galaxy Quest - DTS"" version.Transfer: 1/5 Stars.

0783241038	Galaxy Quest [VHS]	A2IBS27RBKV3LJ	"Zorikh Lequidre ""Zorikh"""	This is, most importantly, a spoof of Star Trek and the Star Trek phenomenon. The story follows the adventures of the cast of a wildly popular cancelled sci-fi tv show, now living off their past glory as they travel to conventions and suffer their fans' adulation, as they are brought into outer space by aliens who believe their TV adventures were real to save their civilization from...well, I'm not gonna give it ALL away. The characters and situations are all very obviously based on their &quot;Star Trek&quot; couterparts: the heroic womanizing captain, the sexy female, the alien played by a frustrated thespian, the anonymous ensign who is supposed to get killed, and so forth. The characterization of the fandom phenomenon is slightly over-the-top, but only very slightly (if you know a devout &quot;trekker,&quot; you know what I mean).For what it's worth, the comedy is funny and the adventure is exciting. The thrill comes from watching people overcone their insecurities to find the heroes within themselves. Much of the humor comes from seeing normal people trying to deal with the fact something they always thought was fiction is actually real. With that in mind, the film is enjoyable even if you're not familiar with &quot;Trek.&quot;The movie succeeds in keeping things light. Things do get dark and down on occasion, but you're never worried that things will not turn out alright, you just wonder how. And of course the ending ties up all the loose ends and sets up an optimistic future for everybody.This lighness is a bit of a relief fom some of the over-long, intense, heavy-duty epics that have been clogging up the Oscar nominations these past few years. On the other hand, it does leave a feeling of needing just a little something extra. In my opinion, this film wants a cartoon, newsreel, and second feature. That's right, this is a perfect movie for a Saturday matinee; not too long, thrilling but not too heavy, and leaving you with enough room to digest something else. I believe that the perfect movie to see with this would be another sci-fi movie that came out not long after this one, that is simillarly not too long and not too deep, but is darker and more serious: &quot;Pitch Black.&quot; I'll be writing a review of that movie soon.	4.0	PERFECT SATIRICAL MATINEE FARE, ESP.
