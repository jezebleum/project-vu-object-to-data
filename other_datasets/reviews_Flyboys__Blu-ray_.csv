B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2KLBMCKEX9VJ9	2204rob	Good story potential but the script kinda sucked, it was not well directed and the editing didnt have a good flow to it. Underacted by Franco (probably on purpose, but it doesn't work). Some of the dogfights were quite good, except for the cutaways to the actors ... especially when one would give the slightest nod of the chin to let the other guy know he &#34;understood&#34; .... from 100 yards away at 150mph, while someone was shooting at them. It's paying attention to detail that makes a good movie. This didn't have it. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was for the actors that played the American Ace and the French commander. Oh, and it had a lion in it too. Really?	2.0	Really not very good. Sorry fellas.	2014-05-07	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3UT41TWD7N0D5	AbeStreet	To begin with I&#8217;ll state that I found this film to be highly enjoyable.  I know it bombed at the box office and was rated poorly by many critics but I can&#8217;t help it, this is a good film.  There are a couple of ways to evaluate this film and I&#8217;ll list them below.1. Historic perspective:  As many reviewers have indicated in previous reviews this film suffers from many inaccuracies.  For true history and war film buffs this may ruin the film them.  Myself, I knew very little of the details, other than the German planes were not colored correctly, and so the story line kept me interested.  In fact, this film sparked such an interest in the story of the Lafayette Escadrille that I did a lot of research reading on the topic.  I would encourage people to read up on the actual events and people.2. Film locations & special effects:  I&#8217;m thought the costume design, set locations, props, flying sequences, and special effects were extremely well done.  I was completely sold on the time period and setting in which this film takes place.  No doubt the film relied on CG animation for some of the fight scenes.  These effects were so well done that there is no jarring juxtaposition from real life to animation that the viewer is momentarily distracted from the film&#8217;s story.3. Story:  I found the story to be very good.  Not overly complex but that does not mean it is a simple color by number type story.  The supporting characters are given enough attention and screen time, some more than others, that the viewer is emotionally connected to their fates.Lastly, I would say that the main reason this film works for me is that I&#8217;m drawn into the story.  The writing was good, the acting was good, and the story was believable.  Special Effects, good sets, and costume design don&#8217;t make a good film, think PEARL HARBOR (2001).  The story is the thing that links all these other things together and this film links them together pretty well.	4.0	Time well spent!!!!!	2014-07-01	1	0	1
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2RO5BKNBR7BSR	"A. BOSTON ""***"""	I was expecting Flyboys to tank. And it didnt. The movie could have had some help at the box office if it had a different name (Flyboys sounds dumb to me) and more advertising leading up to its release. When viewing the movie you cant find fault with the acting. Everyone does a good job. The plot and writing arent perfect but get the point across. The bond between the men as they battle together works well. The romance though is the key here for me. We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love. Its the heart of the movie in my opinion. The action is great, though I could argue that the dogfighting is too short. You just get the blood pumping and that particular fight ends too soon. The battles could have been longer but they are well executed. Very good movie!!!	4.0	Very good, trust me	2007-02-04	6	4	2
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The film starts with a view of the heavens. The recently invented flying machine was adopted by armies as an observation platform that was better than the earlier tethered balloon. In September 1914 an observation airplane saw the German flanking attack, they were able to stop it at the first Battle of the Marne using the taxis of Paris (fast mechanized deployment). The way to stop observation airplanes was to shoot them down with another armed airplane. First rifles, then machine guns. The way to stop an armed fighter was with another armed fighter. Bombing was another development, as well as anti-aircraft guns. Trench warfare prevented the maneuvers used by generals of the past. A stalemate followed.A young man in Texas wants to get out of town. Another leaves Nebraska for ""The War to End War"". An American boxer joins the Lafayette Escadrille. So too a dropout from Harvard. The men meet their mascot ""Whiskey"" and the issue of racism. The men undergo elementary training in flying and tactics. The average life of a pilot was six weeks. The German Air Force predominated in 1916. Fighters will accompany Handley-Page bombers to attack German supplies. No parachutes for pilots. ""Beware of the Hun in the sun!"" There is a dogfight, some are shot down. One flyer seeks love. There is a pleasant scene. Then they are scrambled to pursue German bombers. Another dogfight with wins and losses.One flyer returns to see a girlfriend. There is a drama in the history of one flyer. Why did he miss his target? A flight of Fokkers attacked a town, the Lafayette Escadrille comes to the rescue. One pilot lands in No Man's Land, and is rescued in an incredible manner. Was the war meaningless? Who will win? Can one flyer rescue his girlfriend? [Did anyone fly at night then?] It was a dramatic rescue. ""Don't ever do that again!"" Next they attack a Zeppelin. [These bombed London at night.] The film shows the effects of machine gun fire on the pilots and airplanes. The hospital is being evacuated. Will they meet again? There is another mission to attack Jametz. This time it will be a flanking attack to surprise the enemy with escorted bombers. There is another dogfight to let the bombers get through. There is a last dogfight between the fighter airplanes. Will the good guy survive? The last scenes tell about the flyer's future.This is a good film in spite of the story. This film uses CGI to recreate the known past. A better story makes a better film. You may find a book about this subject educational. Hollywood provides entertainment, not history.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ADLVFFE4VBT8	"A. Dent ""Aragorn"""	There's something both romantic and intimidating about the mechanized slaughter that plagued Europe at the beginning of the 20th century during what that generation called 'the GREAT War' and we call World War One. While French and Germans were slaughtering each other on the ground by the millions with the help of first generation tanks, early model machine guns and clouds of mustard gas, some privileged few were confronting their enemies in the air, riding on small, fragile, underpowered but deadly airplanes, trying to obliterate opponents riding the same or protecting/attacking bomb-carrying larger, motorized flying machines or giant, bloated, terror-inspiring airships.It's a historical fact that a handful of American took sides in this battle at a time their own country, the United States, was officially neutral. They decided to help the French side by forming their own Escadrille Lafayette of flying knights. The Escadrille, famous for its bravery AND its partying while off duty, distinguished itself at Verdun and many of its members were recognized as Aces, some receiving valuable French medals for bravery.The movie attempts to follow, to the extent that a fiction movie can, the historical record. We see the initial members as they make their decision to fight for France, we watch them train and then we watch them fight the Germans. It's fighter vs. fighter, fighter attacking the enemy's bombers, fighter protecting their own bombers, fighter attacking the Zeppelin and fighter strafing the enemy air base and, on several occasions, we watch air duels between Aces on either side. In addition, there is some romance, a tiny bit of racial tension and we watch some personal problems as they are dealt with by the squad's members.This is a very visual, CGI enhanced to the point of almost cartoonish-looking movie when it comes to the numerous dogfight scenes and its most attractive feature is the air battles. The scruffy and fragile-looking French fighters, the intimidating, red-colored German Fokkers, the bombers, the Zeppelin, they all look spectacular in ways that only today's video enhancement technologies can produce. One may conclude that, maybe there's too much fighting and too little character development but this is not a psychological drama. It's about aerial fighting and this is what we get to see in a movie that comes pretty close to being a WW1 documentary. All the little conflicts between the squad's members or between them and the French military or the other American volunteers are insignificant when viewed within the context of the war against the Germans.The movie is good at what it attempts to deliver - in this case, the dogfights -  but, after a while, the fighting gets repetitive and the movie seems to be stretching a bit too long. This is as close to a pure dogfight action movie as it gets.Recommended as a rental or even as a keeper for any lover of war action videos.P.S. While many of the details are fictionalized enhancements or pure inventions, it is historically true that the squadron had lions as pets. The movie shows us one. In fact, they had TWO lion cubs named Whiskey and Soda.	3.0	Watchable World War One Dogfight Movie	2009-01-24	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A194V8ZDJMGY45	Akashishi	Another reviewer -- who obviously knows nothing at all about WWI, biplanes in general, or the Lafayette Escadrille in particular -- claimed that this movie was a historically accurate portrayal of their exploits.Well, it's not. Period.In fact, it's so full of historical, scientific, military, and logical inaccuracies that it's almost laughable. I won't even bother to list them all, although there is one particular inaccuracy that I *must* point out, because it is stunningly, mind-bogglingly asinine: More than once in the movie, several of the protagonists are flying in formation, and they shout across to one another -- and on one occasion, they even have a  moderately lengthy conversation in this manner.Well, I have flown in an open-cockpit biplane, so I can assure you from personal experience that such a conversation is absolutely, completely and totally *impossible*. I flew as a passenger in a two-seater, with a friend squeezed into the front cockpit beside me (with his brother, the pilot, behind us), and we *tried* to converse by shouting at the top of our lungs -- literally, *directly* into each other's ears, from a distance of less than an inch -- and neither of us could hear a single damned word.Even if you  haven't had the experience, it's really quite easy to understand. When you are sitting in an open-cockpit biplane, the wind is roaring past you at somewhere between 150-200mph, and there is a tremendous, screaming engine right in front of you. You can't hear *anything* but that engine. That's why in the Real World -- the historically accurate one, as opposed to the idiotic Hollywood caricature of it -- *REAL* WWI pilots communicated solely by hand signals or the occasional flare gun.So every time this movie shows you pilots shouting across to each other, it is insulting your intelligence. The only way it could have been *more* absurd is if they were having these shouted fighter-to-fighter conversations in the vacuum of outer space.To that kind of idiocy, add ham-handed direction, acting that swings from utterly lifeless to inexplicably melodramatic with no apparent connection to whatever is transpiring, and a contrived and imbecilic story full of plot holes bigger than the Death Star / Zeppelin featured in the big climactic fight scene (in which innumerable laws of physics were violated).The result is garbage. Insufferable, ridiculous garbage.There are very good reasons that this movie did so horribly in the theaters -- and the blatant historical inaccuracies were the *least* of them.	1.0	Vacuous, Insipid Rubbish	2014-05-02	1	1	0

It had nice effects that did a pretty nice job of bringing WWI aerial battles to life.  However, it was a pretty typical cheap, generic war story with typical dramatic themes... I noticed a couple of pretty glaring problems which I can't believe that the director didn't catch.  First of all, James Franco's hair was frosted.  I'm not expert on 1916 men's hairstyles, but from what I know, hair frosting was not common practice.  The other thing was that Franco's Southern accent kind of faded in and faded out.  In certain scenes, he put on the Texas accent.  However, in the majority of the movie, he spoke with his natural, Northern accent.  I'd like explanation on this.	2.0	A Very Average Movie	2014-02-28	1	1	0

It's nice to not have the top-of-the-line actors doing all the performances. It was also nice that it was done in a fashion that would allow these events to have actually taken place and happened. It did not rush them like they would in the, oh say, James Bond movies, but allowed a more natural time scope. Some of the comments call it slow, and yes, it is slow, but it's a natural slowness which is nice to see in a movie.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A38QXT22EYG1R3	"Amazon Customer ""Ron"""	"This is an underappreciated film.  Its based on composite characters and the exploits of the Lafayette Escadrille (Lafayette Squadron) of the fledgling French Air Force in the trench warfare days of WW I prior to the US joining the effort.  In the days before reliable combat aircraft, no parachutes, no aircraft radios, and next to no instruments, flying by ""the seat of one's pants"" was the norm.  Low level, low speed flying gets plenty fast when you are only 300 feet off the ground in a dogfight!  The CGI graphics are, overall, excelllent, at least by today's standards, with computer's doing a passable job of demonstrating the various flight characteristics of the various aircraft (fighters, bombers, and zeppalins) of the day, including crews crawling out on the wings to service engines during a mission!This film, and the historical information on the bonus DVD, does a good job in not only demonstrating the world of aviation in WW I, but also in appealing to viewers who enjoy good historical fiction.  As with ""Memphis Belle,"" all the various events in the movie actually occured (or something very much like them), though perhaps with a bit of ""Hollywood"" thrown in for romance, time constraints, etc."	4.0	Great movie to appreciate pioneers of combat flying	2007-03-21	6	3	3

They really show you what it was like - no parachutes, even. These men joined the French forces, which were recruiting anyone as if they were a basketball team - to ward off many Germans, who allied with Austria-Hungary. (The leader of Austria was assassinated, along with his wife, by Serbs, which is what caused the war; and WW2 no doubt, stemmed from that) Their technique was the only thing that saved them in the air.  The movie shows all this.  Anyone who wants to see how it really went down back then - watch this.  And you see the human-side of all the men, too.  Heroism back then was almost a dime a dozen, since they had to be constantly alert and watch out for eachother.  There were a total of Thirty million casualties.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	This movie could have been so much better than it was.  Still, I think the pros just BARELY outweigh the cons, so if you want to see it, it's entirely up to you.  I think there are some good qualities to be enjoyed here, but just be prepared to sit through some dull moments, uninspired dialogue, and formulaic nonsense.PROS:* Rarity: There aren't many WWI movies made these days, and particularly after the recent glut of WWII films (of which I am very thankful for... mostly).  Even harder to find are aerial combat movies that focus on this period of history.  Fighter and bomber planes were very new to the scene, and seeing as how the airplane had really only be &#34;invented&#34; less than a decade before the war broke out, it was astonishing to think of how quickly the technology progressed.* Air Combat: Given the lack of working planes from that era still in service (no surprise), I thought they did a decent job of marrying actual planes (repros and one or two originals) with the CGI scenes.  I'm not sure how I feel about the smoke tracers on nearly every bullet, but whatever.  It was intense at times, mostly believable, and certainly action-packed.* Acting: For a group comprising of James Franco, Jean Reno, and a long list of somewhat unknowns, the acting was actually pretty decent.  Franco certainly held his own, and he definitely seemed to take on his role pretty thoroughly.  It was pretty good across the board, but not really worthy of any awards for best of the year.  But, better than many!* History: For all of the inaccuracies, the movie did venture into the historical non-fiction realm quite nicely from time to time.  It was interested to see how families were brutally altered by this terrible war.  The stance of the US was also a focus now and then, and it was interesting to see why people chose to volunteer.CONS:* Dialogue: Okay, it wasn't atrocious, but it was stymied and choppy a lot of the time.  How many 'courageous' speeches can Reno give before the boys go into battle?  How many times do Franco and Henderson have to have the same exact conversation about how bad-ass/mopey the other is?  Don't get me started on the romance, which, by the way... totally unnecessary.* Plot: Um... where was it?  There was something about... um... Americans.  Joining up with the... uh... French?  Along side the English?  Yeah, I think so.  And they were in France.  And there was this war going on.  Oh, and I'm sure there was unnecessary and probably grotesquely fictitious romances that sprung up across the countryside.  Seriously!  What plot?  It was a mish-mesh of jumbled pithy platitudes simmered in a time period of war, and it had so much potential to focus on that and be something more!  But, alas...* Accuracy: Enough people have already torn this to shreds for the false history, so I'll leave it at that, but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed.  I am by no means an expert on WWI history, but I know enough to recognize that the Fokker tri-planes were VERY rare and interspersed throughout the squadrons.  And only one was every all-red.  And that was the Red Baron's squadron.  To say nothing of the planes the Allies flew, or the engines, paint schemes, etc.  I guess when your ONE MILITARY ADVISER turned out to be a FRAUD, you have to take what you get.* Formulaic: Nothing new here.  The guy that is vaguely racist of course gets his life saved by a person of color.  Every &#34;watch out for...,&#34; &#34;be sure to remember...,&#34; and &#34;don't forget to...&#34; will come back in some way, shape, or form, don't you worry.  You can predict the ending to each vignette before it really gets underway.  And that's unfortunate, really; I thought we'd finally gotten away from the standard formula.* Scare Tactics: Okay, I get it.  Starting an engine on a WWI-era plane was a noisy prospect.  Stop blowing out my eardrum every chance you get, and completely out of nowhere!  There's no excuse for that!  You're not making a horror movie (right?), you're supposed to be telling a dramatic story set in a key moment of European and American history.Overall, I really was quite disappointed in how they really dropped the ball in certain key areas.  I really want to give this three stars for the efforts made in certain spots in the film.  Overall, though, it crashes (pun intended) due to flimsy structure and obnoxious laziness on the part of the filmmakers.  What could (and should) have been a solid offering in the genre instead turned into a blotch in an otherwise glowing resume.  Worth seeing?  Yeah, I think so.  But, only once, probably.	2.0	So much potential	2014-06-01	1	1	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AOXL514GEE4AA	"Anthony &#34;Is Blu for You&#34; Scultore ""Up..."	Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!	4.0	FLYBOYS SOARS! Blu ray review.	2010-01-19	2	0	2
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2I4VTPKGSQZ75	Anthony Hand	"Looking through the past reviews of this film / DVD I am  forced to wonder what film some other reviewers were watching. I cannot imagine anybody above the age of 20 finding this film either entertaining or convincing. I find it impossible to recommend anything about ""Flyboys"", except perhaps a couple of good performances to lighten up the absolute failure of its execution.Like the majority of people who chose to watch this film, I approached it because a) It was a war film and b) it was a film about air combat.However, neither of these parameters was satisfied, even minimally.Regarding its depiction of war, well you can forget it. Besides some truly strange ""history"" involving mythical German advances, none of the actual nods to WWI make any impact whatsoever. I was NEVER once convinced that the film makers had a clue about the period in which their story was set. There is no real sense of worry or despair throughout the film that accompanied the WWI pilots of real life. The Pretty boys of the Lafayette Escadrille don't share the same sense of ""not coming back"" as the RFC (Royal Flying Corps) pilots of ""Aces High"" or the Jasta pilots of ""The Blue Max"". I know the pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille were volunteers, but there is no doubt or cynicism regarding the war or a sense of nervousness or apprehension. In fact all the pilots seem somewhat happy to be there. They obviously weren't aware of the average lifespan of a WWI pilot or the fact that none of the major combatants allowed their pilots to use parachutes until the Germans introduced the practice in 1917. Being issued a pistol to shoot yourself in the head instead of being burned alive should have caused some raised eyebrows.The aerial sequences, which should have been the star of this film, are in a word `terrible'. There are more convincing effects, physics and graphics in most computer games these days than there are in ""Flyboys"". It's really a shame that the producers didn't get some physicians on board to point out that WWI aircraft were subject to real life limitations....and of course, every German aircraft was a Fokker DR1 triplane....and painted red.""Flyboys"" also includes some of the usual clich&eacute;s of modern Hollywood war movies. There is the obligatory love interest and the obligatory black sacrifice, this time in the shape of Jennifer Decker and Abdul Salis.As the unlikely love of James Franco's lead character, Decker is just irritating. Their scenes are obviously there as a clumsy filler in between the flying scenes and they are a complete waste of time.Salis's character, presumably based on real life pilot Eugene Bullard (the only black pilot of WWI), is also extremely annoying. The idea of introducing a black pilot into the film should have been a good one (even if a little forced), but in ""Flyboys"" one gets the feeling that he is reduced to the level filling the ranks of the ""good guys"" simply as a PC device. I don't think there's anything mentioned regarding the difficulty Bullard faced in real life, or that he was barred from entry to a US squadron on racial grounds. It's very misleading and it's hard not to be cynical about it. A movie about Eugene Bullard proper would have been a great idea, but I doubt that will ever happen.The bottom line about ""Flyboys"" comes down to this, if you want to watch a colour film about flying in WWI, then watch ""The Blue Max"", ""Aces High"" or Roger Corman's ""Von Richthofen and Brown"". Even with the errors those films incorporate, they are still far, far ahead of the fiasco that is ""Flyboys""."	1.0	Another one shot down in flames	2007-02-21	21	14	7

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2JVTIF4ZN1P9D	A Reviewer	"I have to say that I agree with pretty much everyone - ratings 1 through 5 stars!  All of its warts are real, but the bottom line is that if you just remember that it's NOT a documentary (although the film did make a nod to the fact that there was a WWI, and a Lafayette Escadrille, which had American volunteer pilots, and they fought the Germans!) and simply sit back and enjoy, I thought that it was a fun couple of hours.  It absolutely does have the Hollywood hokum GENEROUSLY spread throughout.There are a couple of things specifically (and I'm not sure why these inaccuracies bothered me more than the many others!) that historically ""stuck in my craw,"" though, and they have to do with the aircraft and the computer graphics.  The Allied aircraft, supposedly Nieuport (yes, the ""i"" is correct) 17's (introduced into service in March, 1916 as the successor to the 11) had a ROTARY engine, but it's portrayed as a RADIAL.  What's the diff?  Both have the cylinders arrayed like the spokes of a wheel, but a ROTARY engine actually turns around itself, unlike a radial (of extensive WWII fame, particularly), which has stationary cylinders.  If you look at the Flyboy engines, they don't move!  I guess that the producers either didn't know the difference, or it's too difficult to make the engine turn in the computer program (??).  There's one fleeting scene showing some mechanics working on an engine in the hangar, and IT DOES ROTATE, so someone knew something.  Sorry, this little tidbit just bugged me!  By the way, the rotary was one reason why pilots usually had greasy faces after a flight - the rotary had to have its lubricating oil mixed with the fuel (it was castor oil, which doesn't mix with gasoline) - so along with the exaust, unburned oil flew back in the slipstream and over the pilot.  Likewise, some of the machines have ""V"" shaped upper planes.  Nieuports had straight wings.  At least they got it right that they were sesquiplanes (lower wing smaller than upper).  The wing differences are hard to understand in a computer generated film.  In older movies, when they used real aircraft, it's easy to see why there were differences (look at Blue Max) - there just simply aren't enough biplanes that remotely resemble WWI aircraft still flying, so ""look-(something)alikes"" had to be used.  If you're building all of the aircraft in a computer, why not make it as accurate as possible?However, I'm forgetting that this was simply entertainment.  If you leave it at that, again, it's not that bad.  I, for one, despite its problems, do plan to pick up a copy for fun.  Enjoy!"	4.0	Just sit back and enjoy the ride!	2007-02-28	13	10	3

Thing is, you cannot make a decent movie with single competent actor (the French Commander), a few helmets worth of greasy grimaces, and an endless stream of cartoon-like dogfights. Franco stinks as the lead hero. The screenplay no doubt was written by a poorly read, prepubescent author. Every major twist in the plot was perfectly predictable, and the smaller ones just got in the way. This film might best be enjoyed disassembled into 100 still photographs pasted into a scrapbook while one sips a little port. If you refrain from adding captions to the photos, the power of the pictures would jump off the page. As a film.....Ugh!

When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like.This is a much later postscript. I came across another review of this film where the person wrote, and I'm paraphrasing, ""If the film makers had decided to have the pilots flying prehistoric Pterodactyls, this film would have been just as accurate a portrayal, and a lot more entertaining.""I agree."	1.0	Be Forwarned!!!	2007-07-08	15	11	4

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2809U2S14N0K1	BernardZ	This is the story in WW1 of Americans that became pilots in a French unit before the USA entered the war. It shows how they came for many reasons adventure, to escape, idealism etc. How accurate is it, I suspect a fair  bit although I did not like the way the Germans are shown as evil in this film. Something I don't think warranted by their behaviour in WW1.The acting is below average. When they showed the daily lives of the people and the pilots in no scenes could I say they grabbed me. Often I found them boring even scenes that were suppose to be gripping. Partly I suspect because the lives of the people were not interesting, real life often is not gripping and partly because I did not think much of their acting.However it is different with the action scenes. They were terrific. Imagine being is such a plane, which in today's terms is junk without a parachute. Dangerous to just fly and these guys were fighting one another up there. If anything goes wrong with the plane you are dead. They must have been extremely brave men. You could feel what it must have been like.The filming is good.It is worth a look if you like air force movies.	4.0	If only these guys had a decent parachute?	2007-07-20	3	3	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2SZ86FLBMZPLL	"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive"""	"When this movie was about to enter theaters, I was VERY impressed by the trailer and wanted to see it at the theaters - a rare event for me and the Mrs. (we prefer the obvious advantages & benefits of at-home rentals, although The Star Cinema Grill in Clear Lake City is a great place to see movies if you have to see one in the theater.  I digress.)As mentioned, I am someone whose interest in seeing a movie is largely based on the impression I get from the trailer, plus a look at the story synopsis.  I was a little disappointed that this movie did not stay at theaters long, and just figured (not surprisingly) that this kind of movie, which was once very popular, does not have the same wide audience base in a time when movies like Jackass 2 and Borat can bring in the ticketbuyers.I took a look for myself.  The movie has some great dogfighting scenes with outstanding CGFX, which was what I rented it for.  However, it made the same mistake Pearl Harbor did (trying to have a romantic film and a war film and a buddy film all tied together).  As a result, the pacing was a little slower than I would have liked, and it probably was a factor in why the film did not do well at the box office (the war aspect may have turned off many potential female fans who might have been interested in the romantic story; though it does have a beautiful girl as the romantic interest: actress Jennifer Decker).  Another factor in its disappointing revenues may be that in a time of high-tech aerial warfare marvels (I was even an aircrew member in a couple of them), there seems to be little appreciation or interest in the saga of cloth & wood & wire aircraft, which is ironic since the level of morbid interest and excitement (higher fatality rates) would be better represented by World War 1 aircraft.  In fact, one of the things that the film did not really address was the danger and unpredictability of early airplanes, especially in combat, let alone just during landings and other ""routine"" operations.The character development was brief but sufficient, since more of it would have only slowed the pacing further without adding much in the way of interest.  The fight scenes are excellent, so if your remote has a working fast-forward button, this should be an okay rent."	3.0	It's okay...	2007-04-03	4	4	0

Once in a while an airplane would be to &#34;stiff&#34;, but other times, the fx were amazing. Real aircraft were used as well, so it was a good mixture.

I couldn't believe such a great movie got such ho-hum treatment by the critics, but as usual, what do they know.  I'd rate this the 2nd all-time best war movie, after Private Ryan.  (With Enemy at the Gates #3).  I am so glad they make movies like this, to educate people about long-forgotten times.  It has everything, action packed scenes, Americans volunteering to go in harm's way - once again in France.  The Lafayette Escadrille was a volunteer group of American aviators, similar to the Flying Tigers in WW2 - the AVG (American Volunteer Group).  This is WWI, and it follows their adventures and combat, they are trained by the French, and fly their planes into the teeth of combat with Germany's best.  I was amazed at the accuracy of many details, like the German infantry's uniforms, and correct rifles, and the use of the lozenge camoflage on the German bombers - all correct.  I love it when war movies get it right.  And this one has some super action scenes that will take your breath away as you hang there in the sky with the flyboys with not much more than canvas and string for wings and a single-blade wooden prop, it is so harrowing and uplifting to see.  Talk about entertainment.  I absolutely love this movie and am proud to own it.  This was by far the best movie of 2006.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A304XIMZMW3A2B	Camry Owner	Every character in &#34;Flyboys&#34; has a tragic background story to bring to the narrative. Each one is dealing with some kind of loss or rejection that shows up in the dynamics of the group relationships. The rejected son of a top one per center has to live with the son of a slave in his squad. This gives one of the best lines in the film when the rich kid finally recognizes his racism and asks Skinner what his father had thought about something. Skinner's response put the deep personal differences of the characters in true relief. The flight scenes are surpassed only by &#34;Wings&#34;. Bravado and liquor are the most common defense against the absurdity of life as a pilot whose sole purpose has become killing more of the enemy each day before the enemy kills them. James Franco is entirely believable as Rawlings with his deeply held convictions of right and wrong that frequently put him at odds with those around him. &#34;Flyboys&#34; is well done and well worth watching again.	4.0	Life is hard.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A4FUIWXOPPQ9V	CarlsThunder	I wasn't sure what to think of the movie since I remembered hearing little about it. But it has become one of my favorite movies, especially war movies that try to tell some real truth about the time frames they cover. The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would. I believe the movie is excellent. The DVD arrived two days earlier than expected, so the seller gets a solid A, not only for speed of shipment but for speed of receipt. DVD in perfect condition.	5.0	Overall purchase	2012-10-05	1	1	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1IHJA581AXH3H	CARLTON B SMITH	Seems the subject of WW I air battles is always going to be a favorite subject for film. Starting with the first &#34;Wings&#34;a favorite silent film of mine. In the case of &#34;Flyboys&#34; the fliming was excellent, a bit more graphic than earlier films of this type, but that is expected these days. I am a fan of Franco's acting style in particualr and he was his usual best in this production.	5.0	A well done period film!	2014-03-25	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A91BK8S5QH98K	CelticWomanFanPiano	This movie is a very enjoyable movie.  With a lot of clever flight action and tactics.  For present day standards, it is actually fairly clean.  So it can be suitable for family viewing, provided the kids are a little older.  The plot centers around a group of American mercenary pilots in France during World War I, prior to the U.S.' entry into the war.  They all come from different backgrounds and they all have different hopes and dreams.  And before the movies ends you'll find yourself really liking every one of them.  James Franco portrays the leader of the group and he comes across as likeable.  Perhaps a little not quite Texan enough looking, but likeable nonetheless.  And the love story between him and an orphaned French girl is a very sweet one.  The main flaw I found in the  movie is that the dialogue was unusually soft while the background music is unusually loud.  Which made it to where at times I found myself reading the subtitles in order to fully understand the plot.  (And I'm not hard of hearing!)  However, that flaw is well overcome by the plot and the nice characters.  I heartily recommend this movie.	5.0	I enjoyed it!	2010-06-22	3	2	1

Dickison ""Charles A"""	"This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife.  The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences.

The aerial sequences were much like a video game. Try ""Flight Simulator"". WWI biplanes hanging on their props??? Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered ""no man's land"" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	I'm not too sure what some of these reviewers are talking about or what movie they saw, but it sure wasn't the FLYBOYS movie that I saw. TOP GUN rip off with extended volleyball scenes? What? American men vacationing in France? For the record. I didn't see one volleyball in the film. In fact, I didn't see one guy without his shirt or a shower scene. Don't listen to bogus reviews. Please, don't listen to these comments, because you will be missing a marvelous, sharp, beautiful and BASED ON A TRUE STORY World War I picture that blew me away.The extent that the filmmakers went to make this a realistic, poigniant and time capturing homage to the FLYBOYS of World War I who went over to France BEFORE America joined the war, is stunning. After watching this film, I couldn't believe that this film hasn't received more accolades.It's a little one dimensional, but that was the way life was for the pilots of World War I who were volunteering to fly war planes only years after the plane was even invented. They arrived in France, they trained for three weeks and they were flying missions that had claimed thousands of lives and had a less than 5% return rate.In between missions, their lives were dull and simple. Parked in the middle of a French country side, they would frequent a single pub and drink to the men who didn't return that day.FLYBOYS is based on real stories from journals of the real men the movie portrays. The lives they left behind to become pilot gods. The loves they lost and left behind. The people they met and the amazing world changing missions they embarked on.James Franco plays Blaine Rawlings, a young man who was about to lose his ranch and be arrested, motivating him to enter World War I as a fighter pilot before the American government joined the fight. He meets a beautiful french women named Lucienne (newcomer Jennifer Decker) who speaks little english, but their bond is realistic and beauiful portrayed.The most breathtaking part of FLYBOYS is the battle scenes themselves. The planes circle and dart between the clouds, streaming their clouds of bullets across the sky. The rudementry targeting system and the flaws in their guns. Everything is captured.Bottom line. FLYBOYS is breath-taking. A wonderful film and exactly the kind of movie that Howard Hughes wanted to make.

The dog fight footage is brilliant! The airplane had only recently been invented when it was introduced to the war effort, so the faith and bravery it took to get into these early planes had to be incredible. Jean Reno is outstanding as the captain of the young pilots who don't have a long life expectancy.

Choi	I was intrigued by the storyline of Americans who joined the Lafayette Escadrille prior to America's official involvement, and the dogfighting scenes looked pretty promising in the trailer. This is just an meh movie with some historical teaching value.The movie plotline follows James Franco as a young, hotshot pilot from Texas, and his experience as a newbie in the L.E. You see some of the historical challenges the French faced, as the German triplanes had a technological advantage, and some of the struggles of men who lost comrades almost daily. Historically, these scenes were fairly interesting and educational. There is also a subplot with a mysterious French woman who is destined to get away, but it was not very interesting.	3.0	Just an okay historical drama, falls pretty flat as a movie.	2014-04-04	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1E0PMNE8N7DTG	Cionnaith	I read a few of the reviews of this movie and didn't quite understand the amount of negativity.  Granted, this movie has some historical inaccuracies (e.g. type of plane portrayed not in service at time, etc) but, personally, I choose not to get too hung up on that sort of thing unless it is just completely outrageous.  I found the film to be very entertaining.  Perfect CG or not, the dogfight sequences were outstanding and there were plenty of them.  I did appreciate the love story, but appreciated more that it did not take the central focus in the film.  It was just enough to show some more humanity.  So, the balance there was good.  Now the plot is quite simple...There is a German nemesis that has to be dealt with by someone...I don't want to include spoilers.  Negative reviews point out just how simple and contrived such a plot line is.  However, I base my judgement based on the entertainment factor.  Did I find myself wanting to see the Nemesis go down?  Yes.  Did I route for the good guys?  Specifically, did I identify with some of the characters (albeit not perfectly developed) and want to see them vindicated?  Yes.  In short, despite the lack of character development, somewhat predictable plot, and not quite perfect CGI, I found the film to be very entertaining.  On top of that, I appreciated the story.  We do not see a lot of WWI movies made.  Given the importance of that war in our world's history, it is nice to see a story dealing with it, even though the film has flaws in a number of areas.	4.0	Entertaining...	2014-03-15	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"Man, I enjoyed this film! It might be my favorite movie of 2006. Usually when I look forward to a movie, as I was with this one, I can expect too much and then be disappointed. It's rare but sometimes the film is even better than I anticipated....and that's the case here.This is a  beautifully-photographed, classy film with interesting characters, excellent action scenes in the air with the World War I bi-planes and tri-planes, and a subtle and sweetly-told romance. In other words, this film had a lot to like. Acting-wise, everyone was good. I wasn't familiar with any of these people except for veteran Frenchman Jean Reno, who played ""Captain Thenault"", the main instructor and head of the Lafayette Escadrille. He was excellent, as usual, and played a likable character.The aerial-battle scenes might be the best-ever shown on film but with today's ever-improving cameras, techniques, special-effects with computer knowledge, it's no surprise the flying scenes looked so good. (Think what we'll see on screen in 10 years!) The fight scenes are not overdone, either.Most of the movie centers more on the drama and romantic side than that of action. The romance only involves one of the fliers and it's nicely, tastefully done...and very touching. The actress who plays the part, Jennifer Decker (""Lucienne""), is just beautiful and a wholesome-looking lady. You can see why the flier ""Blaine Rawlings (James Frano) fell for her right away, even though neither could speak the other's language.Anyway, the main story is all about all the fighters and some of the missions they flew. This is based on fact and that means it's not always a happy ending for everyone. In some respects, World War I might be the most brutal war ever fought.Overall, this a nice, old-fashioned epic-type story told without much profanity so I would it would suitable for most of the family."	5.0	Exceeded High Expectations - An Epic Film	2007-09-09	4	3	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A28WJUJF6D2ULA	Dai-keag-ity	"I think people rag on this movie a little too much. If it's not as good as the reigning classic of World War One dogfight films, 1966's The Blue Max, then at least it was a notch above most of what sat beside it in the multiplex in the fortnight it was out. (How many reviewers, seeking originality, headlined their write-ups ""Bombs Away""? More than a few.) Movies about the First World War are almost nonexistent today and I salute the courage it took to go out on a limb to tell a forgotten story.All that said, yes, the technical inaccuracies, which I won't list here, did irk sensibilities a time or ten, and one couldn't help but feel the plot was something that got in the way of the special effects, which were often little short of spectacular, but the funny thing is I've found that the very points which instigated the greatest number of complaints about this film turned out to be those things which actually were based on the historical reality of the Escadrille de Lafayette, its experiences and its members. Go figure.Flyboys isn't going to be a classic but what is? I personally think we're residing in the age of the anti-classic. Flyboys is watchable, has some good parts, and means well even when it comes up short. I admire the effort to produce this kind of low-appeal movie in the age of ""a blockbuster or else"" film making and am glad I own this title.And, oh, yeah, that's NOT Stephen Baldwin in there, guys!"	3.0	Well, I Enjoyed It, Anyway	2010-04-06	2	1	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"Where does one start when reviewing a movie like ""Flyboys""? Does one discuss the attention to historical detail? The facts behind the real-life Lafayette Escadrille? The surprisingly great acting from a cast largely comprised of unknowns? The amazing flying sequences and special effects?Really, the movie ""Flyboys"" is a monumental achievement and an effort of which everyone involved in it can take pride.Prior to the United States entry into World War I a number of American men traveled to Europe lured by a fascination with the relatively new ability to fly (many people had never seen an airplane at this time). They joined a squadron known as the Lafayette Escadrille (named after the French general who aided America during the Revolutionary War).Airflight was incredibly dangerous at this time and even more so when flying into a combat zone. Aerial dog-fighting was also a close quarters affair with mere feet between opposing pilots. Indeed the life expectancy for WWI pilots was also extremely short. As one character comments of another's hard edged nature ""Bet he doesn't make friends easily."" The always excellent Jean Reno interjects with ""All of his friends are dead!""So into this backdrop comes ""Flyboys"" which follows the stories of a group of mismatched new arrivals to the squadron.  We have, among others, a Texas rancher faced with the repossession of his land, a young aristocrat seeking the approval of his father, an African American prize fighter eager to repay the kindness shown to him by the French and a young man seeking to follow in his families military heritage.Together they forge a friendship and from stumbling beginnings an effective fighting force.It's an engaging drama and one that I have already ewatched three times. It is nicely complemented on this DVD release by an impressive number of special features the prize of which, for me at least, is the documentary on the inspirations for the characters and historical research and a second one on the real-life Lafayette Escadrille. There is of course a very engaging commentary track which also highlights the great amount of detail that went into the making of the movie.When it was released the movie was criticized by some rather ignorant reviewers who railed against some of the details in the movie. They complained for example about the gunman atop a zeppelin shooting at the fighters buzzing around him. This, however, as the producer Dean Devlin explains, was based on historical fact when Devlin came across a picture of one such gunman in a history book of WWI.Yes, ""Flyboys"" is an impressive achievement and well worth your time and money."	5.0	'Flyboys' is an impressive achievement	2007-01-31	18	15	3
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"The real actors?Well, there's poor James Franco, a fine young actor, who must be cursing his bad luck in getting to play the leading man only in movies plagued by rotten screenplays and supporting casts, and also in losing the leading man role (and then having to play second fiddle) to some wimp in that blockbuster series of all time, Spider-man...And then there's Jean Reno, Hollywood's favorite token Frenchman (even though he was born in Morocco to Spanish parents, as Juan Moreno), once again playing the earnest, understanding wise man with the funny French accent........ gosh, if only all French people could be just like him! ......especially those nasty waiters and shopkeepers in Paris, and those anti-American French politicians......This movie had so many clich&eacute;d scenes in it that I began to realize that the filmmakers must have thought that they could get away with it because the younger movie-going generation wouldn't recognize these as clich&eacute;s, since most are from an older generation of movies.  It must save money to just recycle the old classic scenes, instead of hiring better, more original screenwriters.There's the obligatory sendoff at the train station with the girlfriend running alongside the train (I winced during this scene, half expecting the girl to run splat into a signpost.........ooops, wrong movie, that was from one of the ""Hot Shots"" series);  the obligatory first fight at the bar amongst the airmen;  the obligatory hero's death with kamikaze swan dive into the mission target;  the obligatory hero saves girl - hero loses girl plot;  the obligatory devout Christian, who might as well have also been carrying a sign saying ""I'LL BE DEAD MEAT SOON"" along with his Bible.So what about the non-actors?Chief among them has to be David Ellison,  son of billionaire Larry Ellison of Oracle Software.  Daddy helped finance a good chunk of the $60 million budget of this movie which meant that, despite a complete lack of any acting ability, on a scale similar to the fiasco that was Jake Lloyd (little Anakin - Stars Wars, Phantom Menace), and despite an intensely annoying screen presence equivalent to that of Jar Jar Binks from that same movie, David Ellison gets huge amounts of screen time, including a constant series of brief cutaway shots focused on him, designed to subliminally remind the viewer that he's in this movie........OOOOOFFTA........can you spell N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T ?Another near non-actor, Jennifer Decker - the girl who plays James Franco's love interest Lucienne.  OK, she's sort of cute, but who told her that the way to play a French girl who doesn't speak English is to act like a deaf-mute?  How the heck did SHE get this role?  We used to come to the answer to that question quite easily, but unfortunately, it is no longer politically correct to say such things in public.Historically, a number of things are not quite right.  The Nieuport 17s that the airmen are supposedly flying had rotary engines, not the radial engines depicted.  NONE of the fighters of WWI had radial engines in fact, since air cooling technology had not developed fully to allow for fixed cylinder heads (in the rotary engines, the cylinder heads of the engine spun around together with the propeller, thus providing superior air cooling).  In any case, the Lafayette Escadrille would quickly lose the Nieuport 17s and mostly fly SPADs (which had inline engines) for much of the war.And those bullet holes!  Come on!  The planes were made of fabric and wood, and had absolutely NO ARMOR!  If bullets hit all around the cockpit, the pilot is DEAD!  How the heck could James Franco's plane be so riddled with bullets in that last dogfight, and he only gets hit ONCE!?That's just my two bits on the historical inaccuracies - there are a great many in this movie which have been pointed out by other reviewers already.However, in spite of all its flaws, this was a moderately entertaining movie.  I watched it as a $2 rental, on my 23"" widescreen computer monitor, so that I could surf the Internet whenever the movie got too inane.  It's the only way to watch this movie, as far as I'm concerned.  Whenever Jar Jar..., I mean, David Ellison,... appeared onscreen, I would Google something about him or his billionaire father - these multi-tasking distractions helped to get me through those scenes, and reminded me also that money has its privileges.I give the movie one star for James Franco's earnest performance, one star for the CGI flying sequences, and one star for trying to tell some of the history of WWI, even if the details got mangled"	3.0	Can you spot the real actors in this movie?	2007-04-25	11	10	1
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ANEP7R6LM206E	Dave92270	I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This clich&eacute;-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3UUGZRTBS81YN	David W. Jones	On Dec 17, 1903, Orville Wright made history by flying the Kitty Hawk about ten feet above the ground.  The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered less than 200 feet.  He was moving at a speed of just 7 miles per hour!  Within a dozen years or so, technology had proceeded to the point where planes could fly over 100 MPH, with ceilings up to 20,000 feet.  Mount a machine gun and voila!  You have a new dimension in modern warfare: aerial combat.Flyboys tells the story of a ragtag group of Americans who flew for France in World War I, before the United States officially entered the war.  The plot is fairly predictable for this genre, even cliche at points, but the movie still works thanks to some amazing CGI that gives photo realistic images of the aerial combat.  The cinematography is well done all around.The acting was passable.  The performance of French actress Jennifer Decker was memorable, despite limited screen time.The blu-ray transfer is outstanding--one of the best I have seen.  Amazing detail; rich colors; little or no film grain, even in nighttime shots.  Because of the gorgeous cinematography and CGI effects, this is a film where you want the best possible clarity, and this blu-ray delivers.  The sound is also very good.  The battle noises are effective, and the epic soundtrack plays great.Parental Advisory: Flyboys features realistic wartime violence, mild language, drinking (but not drunkenness), and a couple of scenes in a brothel (but very tame by modern standards).  Also, a couple kiss in one scene.  The PG-13 rating is for the violence.  Apart from that, it would have been a mild PG.  This is a throwback to an older style of movie making.I recommend this movie.  While fairly predictable, it nevertheless has some patriotic spirit and is beautiful to watch.  The three-star rating is for the movie.  If I were rating the blu-ray transfer only, I would give it a full five stars.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, do it.  You will not be sorry.	3.0	Patriotism Soars	2012-12-03	2	2	0

Maybe they have no affection for (or perhaps knowledge of) the genre war movies of the 40s. They want these movies to be ""meaningful"". They want them to ""resonate"".But movies like this are just fun, like the old Errol Flynn/Clark Gable/John Wayne movies. They are Saturday afternoon popcorn movies, and there aren't nearly enough of them. I didn't care how ""accurate"" the movie was. I had fun. I loved it. And the romance (no sex) occupied only a small part of it, as it should (unlike Pearl Harbor, which sank under the weight of it).4 stars out of 5 due to its being somewhat overlong. But it definitely should be seen at least once on the big screen.Old-fashioned, cliche-ridden, and predictable. But loads of fun. Highly recommended."	4.0	The critics don't get it	2006-09-24	10	5	5

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1DJXNV9IULUBD	D. Doughty	Flyboys is a film about American volunteer aviators during the first World War before America declared war on Germany in April 1917.  The movie is action packed and exciting as far as the special effects.  Hollywood is long over do for a Good WWI aviation film and this is an area where I would like to see more movies about considering WWI Aviation is my hobby.Hollywood does a descent job with historical accuracy however I did find some errors in it.  But if you are looking for a good film to watch for excitement and adventure then this is a good pick.  If you don't care about historical accuracies, stopreading now. :-)Some of the historical inaccuracies I found were: 1) The French Neuport 17 biplanes had rotory engines, not radial engines.  Rotory engines were round like radials but spun on the camshaft with the propeller. I believe the Neuports used a 80 horse power Le Rhone engine.  The rotory engines in early and mid WWI had two speeds, on and off.  2) The German Fokker DR1 triplanes did not enter the war until August of 1917 when the Flyboys would have been flying SPAD VII.  The movie should have depicted either Halberstadt DII or Albatros DII and DIII.  Fokker Eindeckers (monoplanes) were near the end of thier life span in mid to late 1916 when this story is depicted.  3) Maneuvers pulled by the fragile Neuports depicted in the film would have ripped the upper wings off which was a weakness of the Neuport series, especially pulling out of deep dives.  4) Not every German Fokker DR1 was all red.  Manfred von Richtofen, the Red Baron flew an all red fokker DR1 and was killed in one but even the Red Baron fly non-all red triplanes from time to time.  Although squadrons usually keep to the squadrons markings some German pilots of certain rank and/or number of kills could mark their planes with their own personal markings.  5) The straight (latin) cross on the German Fokkers did not come to being until March 1918, long after the dis-banning of the Lafayette Escadrille.  6) Where is there mention of Raoul Lufbery and William Thaw two of America's first aces and early members of the Escadrille?  7) From my research I have not found where the Lafayette Escadrille brought down a German Zepplin....I'll keep researching.But again as a film to watch for action, Flyboys meets the bill.  And as mentioned in other reviews Hollywood did get some things right histoical.	3.0	Good Exciting Adventure Film.	2006-11-11	6	5	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1S8Z4Z8ATJ0PW	"D. E. Geibel ""warbird aficionado"""	"Set against the backdrop of what is pretty much the forgotten war of the 20th century, Flyboys depicts the Americans of the Lafayette Escadrille struggling to combat not only the German foe but also a seemingly endless wave of anachronisms.  It is doubtful whether the Huns had that many Fokker triplanes in 1918, much less a year earlier.  Along the way, the viewer is also asked to accept a romantic subplot that is thrown in for -- well, why was it thrown in?  To influence female viewers?  To flesh the protagonist out?  Who can tell?Regardless, the aerial scenes are breathtaking, and more than overcome whatever limitations there are in the plot.  In a world where fighter ""jocks"" can kill or be killed from 40 miles away, it is awesome to trace the roots and see a time when men flew in machines made of wood and canvas, and could look one another in the eye."	4.0	Lethal Fun with the Hun	2007-03-08	2	1	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2XPYSB889DBJT	Dharmapaula	I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. The only thing that keeps me from giving a five-star rating is that the script was mediocre. With such a story, a great cast, and wonderful CGI, I would think they could have produced an equally great script. What a shame. Nothing snappy, witty or fun about the dialogue, and that's really too bad. However, get beyond the lame script, and enjoy this movie for the fabulous aerial combat sequences. Wow. Suspenseful, dramatic, amazing. In addition, it was very interesting to see the different kinds of aircraft that were flown at that time--some of which I previously did not know existed. How different aviation was then: very immediate, close, exposed. Yes, there is a love story, of sorts. Nearing the end of the movie I was afraid they were going to make it sappy, but thank goodness they resisted that temptation. For those who are history buffs, WWI buffs, who want to see some really great aerial combat, or who just like James Franco's fabulous smile, I heartily recommend.

The film has some of the best aerial shots I have ever seen and the machine gun fire (and also the damage it causes) is so realistic!

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1NHNED4X7LXRE	"Doc Martin ""DakotaDocMartin"""	I had been very much looking forward to seeing this movie as I am avidly interested in WWI aircraft.  It is too bad they used so many CGI graphics in the making of the movie and too bad the technical director didn't know much, if anything, about how airplanes fly.  They had aircraft doing things that are impossible to do in real life.  It was very obvious throughout the movie also.  To make matters worse, the special effects showed curly smoke trails following each bullet as they were fired.  The bullet impacts in the fabric covering of the airplanes didn't make round holes with the edges curved inwards, but rather made triangular and squarish shaped holes that blew through from the inside out.This movie ends up being very much like watching a video game instead of transporting the viewer into the timeframe of the era.  A movie that is believable is an enjoyable movie to watch and therefore becomes real entertainment.  Flyboys was neither and was a waste of time and money.	1.0	The CGI special effects ruined the whole movie!	2007-02-02	14	8	6

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3I0P6SRAXCIIQ	"Donald Ender ""D.Ender"""	I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.	5.0	FLYBOYS	2007-02-23	3	3	0

Pullen ""Don Pullen"""	I found the airplanes shown to be very accurate in detail, and the flying scenes to be representative of the flying in that era.  The background story was good enough to hold it all together.  I am 80, and have been a WWI aviation buff since I was 8 years old. I flew a wood and fabric biplane, a replica Bucker Jungmeister, for 15 years, and was once in a dogfight, sans guns, with a Fokker Tripe, so I feel a kinship of sorts with the pilots of that era.  Great movie for WWI aviation buffs and historians.	5.0	FLY BOYS	2007-03-08	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	"Here is a story about some of the very first military aviators the world has ever seen.  While hot air balloons were used during the Civil War to survey battlefields, WWI was the first conflict in which military aviation made a huge impact on the outcome.Long before flight simulators, ejection seats and pilot training schools (which take years & years to complete), the world saw pilots who flew by the seat-of-their pants and took just a few months to become qualified to take to the skies.  They used incredibly primitive flight simulators to learn what they could on the ground, and there was little rm to develop bad habits as they were pushed straight into conflict as soon as they were able to control their aircraft.James Franco is an up & coming actor who has his chance as a sort Errol Flynn role, and he pulls it off nicely.  His character is a Texan who finds himself @ the end of his rope.  So, he sets off for France during WWI and becomes a fighter pilot.  Along the way, he meets up with several other Americans doing the same thing.  While they may have fudged some details, all of the major characters in the film depict historical people.It's unfortunate that this movie didn't do all that great at the box office.  World War One doesn't generate a lot of interest these days, and that's a shame.  Up until WWII, it was the most important war the world had ever seen.  Sadly, its mantra as the ""War to end all wars"" has long since become an obsolete concept.  Nevertheless, it is a vitally important war for us to understand as its a war our great grandparents fought in.  While the FX of this film are quite impressive, the main reason you should pick this DVD up is simply because it's history on the screen.  It's your history, and it's my history."	5.0	Up up & away!	2008-05-04	4	3	1

The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior.

Sorry, but WWI rotary engines had only wide open or no ignition settings. Partial power was achieved by intermittent blipping of the ignition kill switch and the inertia of the rotating engine mass keep them from stalling.They had chocks on the wheels and the ground crew spun the prop. They usually took off from where they were parked and they taxied in blipping away to their parking place. If The Black Falcon propped his own airplane in the middle of the field, I can guarantee that his own prop would slice him up like a deli salami!Also, very few DR-1's were painted all red.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A10I199V8AAHW8	"Eric Husher ""The Searat"""	You know, in this day of CG animation, there is absolutely no excuse for the problems with this film!  As for it being 'based on a true story,' the only things 'true' about it could be counted on one hand.  Yes, there WAS a Lafayette Escadrille; yes, they DID have a lion as a mascot named 'Whiskey;' yes, there WAS a black pilot in the squadron; yes, Vanderbilt DID rent a chateau for them to use as a barracks, and yes, they did fly Nieuports for a while.  As for the rest of the story, it is either rubbish, or was composed of a number of incidents actually attributable to a large number of pilots from other squadrons.  But even that didn't bother me so much as the PLANES used in this movie!  I can't understand it!  They got so many of the other details correct (motorcycles, the aerodrome, cars, etc, etc.), how could they screw up the planes so badly, when almost all of them and almost all of the flying scenes were CG??  Is there ANYONE who does not know that the famous Red Baron Von Richtofen was the ONLY German to fly an all-red triplane?  As far as I am aware, he was the ONLY German to fly an all-red airplane, period.  So why are there entire squadrons of all-red triplanes flying around in this movie?  This is an idiotic mistake that could only have happened because the stupid CG animators simply copied the red triplanes out of some stupid video game (probably along with the rest of the planes as well).  Blue, green, yellow, checkerboard, just about any OTHER color or color combination could have worked!  Also, why did the two-seater (called a Sopwith 1 1/2 strutter, for those that care) not have FRENCH markings, since it belonged to the squadron as their training plane (it was in British markings throughout the movie)?  As this was a real aircraft (along with one of the Nieuports, an SE-5, a Bristol, and perhaps one of the Fokker Triplanes, the rest were all CG), my guess is the real owners didn't want their nice British paint job screwed up, but the CG animators could easily have made the changes after filming.  Continuity!!  And considering the film-makers were in close contact with all the owners and fliers of the real aircraft, all of whom may be considered experts on WW1 aircraft and markings, why is it none of these issues were ever dealt with?  All of these things were acceptable when WW1 flying movies were filmed in the '20's and 30's, because the technology was simply not available to make the movies truly accurate.  And I know there are a lot of people out there that think I am being too fussy, but dammit!  Think about the movie 'Top Gun,' and imagine it filmed with Cessnas instead of F14's, and perhaps you might get the idea.  Looks like we will all just have to wait for the 'perfect' WW1 flying movie.  In the meantime, I recommend you watch 'The Blue Max' for some real flying with real planes on film...	3.0	No excuse!!	2006-09-24	11	4	7

There's action, romance, tragedy, comedy....The historical purists will cry foul at the historical inaccuracies, but for the most part, those inaccuracies were intentional---in order to make the film a little more accessible for viewers who haven't spent years studying WWI aviation.  I spotted several ""ooh, that's not right!"" moments, but in the end, they didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.The CGI dogfights are well-done, in my opinion.  Would it have been better if they had used real planes?  You bet!  Would using real planes have been a realistic objective?  NO!  Those old planes were dangerous as heck when they were brand new, and even modern reproduction methods haven't done much to reduce the risk.  Put 40 or 50 planes in the air at once and try to choreograph a dogfight---someone's gonna die. And not all of those original pilots died in combat. There were shockingly high numbers of men killed due to engine failure and other mechanical failures.  If you use CGI, you can eliminate most of the risk, plus you can get more realistic with crates catching fire, breaking up in mid-air,crashing, etc.The extras on the 2-disc DVD are pretty extensive, cover the making of the movie, and address some of the gaps between the film and the true history."	4.0	Knights of the air	2007-02-01	5	4	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AJ2R6CAFEHCD7	"F. Durand ""student of life"""	All the elements of a great movie. What can I say, I love to study the elements of war, and I enjoy a good love story along the way. This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie.	5.0	Romanticism and Reality	2007-02-11	4	2	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2U8TLK3X01KXJ	FingolfinsWrath	I saw this film when it came out in 2006 and recently watched it again in a little higher definition.  I really enjoyed this film back then and loved it when I saw it again.  If you like any of the themes: WWI, history, flight ... watch it!Pros:- I feel this film has an authentic feel to the film itself.  The planes, outfits, locations.  All awesome.- The dogfights are amazing.  CGI and angles in the plane cockpits are all very well done.- Fun storyline.- Jennifer Decker.Cons:- The acting is wooden at times.  Not from everyone all the time, but just, awkward.- The storyline, while fun as I stated above, is not well developed.  The only character who was properly developed was Cassidy.  Franco's character isn't bad but is a bit inconsistent.  You won't feel much connection to the characters that die.I've read a few places that Franco did not like the film, which is unfortunate if true, because this is a fun film despite it's inconsistencies.	4.0	Enjoyable film all the way around	2014-05-13	0	0	0

This film as SPECTACULAR in its multiple air combat footage, NO hints of computer animation, excellent plot, and a stand up performance by Jean Reno (The Professional) as French Squadron captain, and great sets. Yes, there is a small element of a love story here but beleivable to the times and does not dominate the movie's theme. You end up staying watching the credits after the movie!!! How many times does one do that?This is a must see movie, historcally accurate, even to the point that costumes are all wool and leather, if you have read your WWI history. This one is a sleeper and I predict some sort of Oscar nominiation aty least for either direction, cinematography, or costume design.I'll be getting this one on DVD as a ""good match"" to the ""Flying Leathernecks"" with John Wayne.

As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of ""the skunk of the year award"" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that? Will we ever find out?Well for me The Blue Max towers above this movie despite being over 40 years its senior.

There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages.  The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual ""composite characters"" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a ""team,"" but this was better than most.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3S583K80QN1VG	"G. M. Handlon ""the brewfisher"""	"What Flyboys is not is a documentary.  I can see that pains a lot of people reviewing it, because they didn't have those planes that year, or they didn't fire that ammo that year, or the planes are the wrong color, or zeppelins didn't bomb in the daytime. What. Ever.  Go rent a documentary or read a history book if that's what you seek.  This movie was BASED on a true story, and did not claim to be factual in every way.Flyboys was a story about people with nothing to lose.  For the most part, they came from various trials in life back in the States that seemed hopeless for them, and they were committed to making a meaningful contribution in the great war, regardless of the risk to their own lives.  (just like the fine men and women in our military today). They must overcome cultural, racial and national prejudices to do so.This is the first movie I've watched in some time which cast the French in a positive light.  It reminded me that they were once a brave nation that stood to fight against those that would overrun them.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jean Reno as French Capt. Thenault of the Lafayette Escadrille.  Although the script nods to the French disdain for Americans, it's not long before we see Thenault's compassion, love and admiration for the yankee expats who have come to die for his country and cause.This film both condemns and glamorizes war.  We see front-line battle, the death of civilians, the destruction of beautiful historical buildings, the struggle with killing, the admiration of a skilled enemy and both honor and disgrace in battle.  There are also the thrills of victory, however small, bitterness of loss and defeat, and hope for the future.It is laced with a love story made to feel genuine by the lack of common language.  That love goes surprisingly unfulfilled at the end, as was surely the case uncountable times in the Euro wars (or any for that matter).There are no big name actors to suck the air from the film, so it is an opportunity to enjoy some fresh faces and performances.  One of my favorites was Michael Jibson as Porter, flying into battle singing ""Onward Christian Soldiers"".  It was funny because the Germans could hear him as he was doing battle with them.  Jennifer Decker as Lucienne was WOW good-looking.  And when she was injured, she was made to look so, instead of glam wounded.  Gunnar Winbergh played the evil German ace Black Falcon, and without a word of dialog he makes us hate every molecule of his being.Bottom line, this was a fun flick.  I watched it twice in one weekend.  If you're so into WW1 artifacts and minutia re-creationism that it means everything, I feel sorry for you that you would let it spoil your enjoyment of Flyboys."	4.0	Very entertaining	2007-02-28	9	7	2

Ward, and Evans) to recreate the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, a disparate group of young Americans who volunteered for the French military to become the country's first fighter pilots before the USA entered World War I.  He manages to find the world atmosphere during the Great War, a time when young American boys who had no chance for significance in the tough times USA to go 'over there' to fight the Germans.  He begins with the lad Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) who has just lost his family's farm to the bank, with William Jensen (Philip Winchester) who must live up to his family's fame as heroes, with Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) whose father sees him as a complete loss to his wealthy gentrified family, with Eddie Beagle (David Ellison) who leaves for war with his sweetheart's picture against his breast, with frustrated black fighter Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) - a crew of boys who become bonded through the efforts of the French Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and the loner flyer Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).Planes are designed, the boys are rigorously trained, and off they go to missions never before flown, missions that waste some, and make heroes of others.  Along the way Rawlings meets Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), a French girl who speaks no English but whose heart emboldens Rawlings to feats of heroism.The fighting scenes are terrific to watch as they seem to be done with toys, so light are the aircraft that started flying fighters.  Yes, there are problems in depicting these missions because there are no stunt men who would dare fly such machines even for a movie.  But Tony Bill keeps our attnetion with his direction and with the aerial cinematography of Henry Braham.  The costumes are excellent and the musical score by Trevor Rabin recalls the period well. James Franco and his fellow actors offer solid performances.  This is a bit of the past that is well to re-examine: FLYBOYS provides an evening of nostalgia and a fine story though at 140 minutes it could have been edited).

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AH39OFADI4W11	Granten Lee	"Not an epic film, but it does what a movie is supposed to do: entertain you with drama, suspense, action, and a little humor.  Like many here, I absolutely love history.  I am also often disappointed when ""historic"" movies totally fumble historic facts.  But I've given up on trying to get 100% accurate history from dramatic movies.  I've got plenty of books that can give me that.  I read some of the reviews here of those who know WWI better than me.  I ABSOLUTELY respect them, but I can't help but feel that if these movies were made with the accuracy they demanded, a lot of the audience would be lost.  I think the people who made this film care about history, but they can't afford to lose money.  ""Gods and Generals,"" a huge box office flop, was a good example of real accuracy losing its audience.Three things I really appreciated about ""Flyboys:""The role of Eugene Skinner, based on the real Euguene Jacques Bullard (who was from my father's hometown of Columbus, GA).  Bullard was not technically in the Lafayette Escadrille, but it is so important to have him in the movie to communicate his story.  Like the producers said, a lot of people will think he was a ""PC"" Hollywood creation.  I hope the day comes soon when people will stop assuming these things.The role of Lyle Porter, or the cliche ""religious one.""  I don't know if he was based on one of the real pilots, but I'm glad they treated his Christianity with dignity and respect.And I really liked the scene where the pilots trained.  When I watch it, I feel like I'm watching the birth of United States aviation as it happened back then.  I feel like I'm watching history even if the participants don't realize the impact of what they were doing.  Some of the bravest military men are the ones who sign up to go into battle with new, untried weapons.Read a book for the real story and the real facts.  In the meantime, this is a decent film, well worth watching."	4.0	A Nice Film to Watch	2007-02-05	4	3	1
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A26TY6GCGBF5HT	Graves	"I'm a big WW1 buff and really looked forward to this movie.Purported to be the real tale of the Lafeyette Escardrille, Americans who flew for France before 1917, it is only a disservice to those men. To look at it is very pretty and if you can overlook some flawed images, like all the Fokker triplanes being pained red, it looks good.Unfortuneatly this is where the good points end. Even without getting into the historical flaws the film rapidly become predictable, painfully so. You know who will die and can almost predict when and how an hour a head of time. A pointless love story with a french peasant is supposed to add an emotional touch but anyone familiar with a good war film knows this isn't needed. A crash in no man's land results in the feared German Army comming off more like the gang that couldn't shoot straight than the ravening Huns.The French officer is well done, but the actor can hardly turn in a bad performance even when playing opposite a CGI fire breathing lizard. The film even misses it's chance at the ""Eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die"" out look that developed among the real pilots on both sides as they realized the mortality rate would probably claim them long before the war ended. This was something touched on far better by the David Niven, Errol Flynn film ""Dawn Patrol.""Ultimately what I hated about this was not the historically flawed plot, I love Errol Flynn's films, but the unforgivably predictable altitude this falls to, all to fast.Get a parachute and save yourself."	2.0	Pretty but pointless	2007-02-05	4	2	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AFCP7JOM1AGS0	Harold F. Rosenbaum	Much has been written about the ground and trench warfare horrors of WW I. The air war was a competitively small part of the war. The Lafayette Es quadrille was the name given to a group of young American men who volunteered to fight the Germans under the flag of France. Its vague title belies a well-told story, told from the point-of-view of a volunteer, of what exactly these young men did in the service of France, during this long and ghastly war. Battle scenes in the air provided a clear understanding of what it meant to fly military, in those early days. There were no parachutes: pilots were issued revolvers to destroy themselves if their plane could no longer fly, or land. The movie shows very well how the few pilots who survived for more than one or two missions. Morale was not high: French officers beyond their immediate command structure ignored them. Despite this, examples of their heroism fill this picture. Yet, only a few went home and made flying their postwar career. If you love flying be sure to see this.	5.0	"""Flyboys,"" A Must See For History Buffs"	2014-06-18	1	0	1

I have heard many people say that it is not very accurate, but I have done extensive research into WWI air combat and the Lafayette Escadrille in particular, and I thought the movie was very well done. The only real anachronism I saw was that all the German planes in the movie were painted like the Red Baron, but in truth, the planes from both sides, looked so much alike that on a movie screen, it would be hard to tell who was shooting who, so I think it was a liberty that needed to be taken so as not to confuse the viewer. The extra features on the second disk were also enjoyable for anyone who is interested in the time period, and I really suggest the deleted scenes as well. I thought they added to the movie a lot and wished they hadn't been deleted!

I love all war/historical movies that are based on real people. This movie follows about 7 military pilots in WWI that are based on real Americans or on composite characters. It's not as dramatic and over-the-top as a big-budget war movie, but that makes it a lighter form of entertainment. I'm going to buy the DVD so I can watch it again and share it with other people, whereas I couldn't stomach re-watching Private Ryan. If you've ever enjoyed an airshow, you'll love the old-time planes in the movie. The pilots are exposed to the elements, sticking out of small paper-wing airplanes with prop engines that need to be started by hand, and glide to a stop in open fields. One of the characters says ""planes were only invented 10 years ago!"" All the pilots had interesting life stories, one an aristocrat, one the son of a slave.. there is also a love story with the James Franco/Blaine character which I liked (he's quite handsome!)."	4.0	Better than advertised.	2007-07-07	2	0	2

The young American men who volunteered to help France in the the air war before America joined the Allies in the European war, were brave young lions, anxious to learn about flying planes that were no more than bits of wood and canvas held together with nails and wire.  If they were shot down, they had no parachutes.  They were often reduced to firing pistols at enemy pilots when their machine guns didn't work which was often.  The death rate was astronomical.  But these young brave men with the bitbetween their teeth were the vanguard in the importance of fighter planes and fearless pilots that played a major role in WWII.  The action is nonstop and the air battles dizzying.  This movie is gripping and poignant.  Most who view it will be moved by it.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Let's say it clear. This is not only a remarkable gaze around those epic times where to fly a plane was a true invitation to a secure death; far beyond the different approaches or motivations of a crowd of people who decided to enlist in this air-force; extraordinary well supported by visual effects, that tell us about the courage, bravery and epic spirit of a bunch of men without name but with enormous wishes of winning an absurd war.Although the dramatic construction has told so many times before, there are moments of undeniable tenderness when the love appears by mere casualty. The racial prejudices, the coveted revenge of a spiritually man wounded for having lost his old partners, the spiritual growing up of another one and the heroic disinterestedness of a Texan boy who have nothing to lose in this conflict because he has no family, a loser from of his own country who finds a motive to demonstrate himself and his country he is much more a simple inheritor of a farm, vanished by legal reasons.But the highlight of this movie are undeniably, the spectacular aerial sequences, plenty of adrenaline and mercurial vitality. The camerawork is overwhelming and so the two climax final sequences that obviously will run for you once you rent or acquire it.	5.0	The Texan eagle against the German hawk !	2007-01-26	18	13	5
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3C0XV71IXR075	Historian	I have now concluded critics are the only ones wrong more often than liberal pundits and weather men. This ranks in the top 5 war movies I have ever seen and I have seen them all. WWI is the forgotten war and brave American expatriots who volunteered to fight with the French were not only ahead of their countrymen. they were ahead of their time. Airplanes were only 12 years old when they were adapted for combat use.The characters were strong and believeable. Their evolution from civilian to warrior is timeless while the bonds forged in combat are never reproduced under any other circumstances. The special effects were stunning. It wins on every level.I could speculate ad nauseum as to why films like The Patriot and Gods and Generals are assasinated out of the gate but the bottom line in critics are captive to agendas that have nothing to do with good films.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1EP6R5Z1WGGXA	Hoplon Casidy	"""Flyboys"" is amazing. It manages to be a dull movie about a fascinating subject, the Lafayette Escadrille, a dull love story, and a dull movie about Great War dog fighting, which this reviewer did not believe possible.Although the film is trying and makes an effort at historical detail and dramatic content it falls flat. The viewer doesn't get chance to know any of the characters ably played by some new faces as well as the venerable Jean Reno. (Reno must have a bell that rings in his agent's office every time an American script calls for a French character.) But no amount of acting can pull this lack luster script from the trenches of tedium.The missing piece in ""Flyboys,"" other than the absence of Von Richthofen, is the near complete lack of any actual aerial photography. ""Top Gun"" is a mediocre film at best but has phenomenal aerial photography which is exciting and engaging. In ""Flyboys"" we have only CGI which is sterile. The performers don't have close ups of their faces against sub-zero wind (for which they are woefully underdressed) which detracts from the danger and excitement of a film about Great War pilots. It is obvious they are against a green screen in Vancouver. If ""Flyboys"" had gone the extra mile and had at least one dog fight done for ""real"" it would have saved the film. Granted, there aren't may flying bi and tri planes in the world but if massive trebuchets can be built for ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and Fort William Henry can be rebuilt for ""Last of the Mohicans,"" and fiberglass tanks can be built for ""A Bridge Too Far,"" and a working Tiger can be found for ""Saving Pvt. Ryan,"" then  I'm sure the producers of this film could have found a way to bring some excitement to ""Flyboys.""However ""Flyboys"" will be a boon to sleep researchers who now have a new way to put test subjects to sleep without the side effects of narcotics or entertainment value"	2.0	The Year Von Richthofen Had Off	2007-02-01	11	4	7

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1H5IAUCZVTZYK	Jack Diamond	I read one of the reviews here about this film,it was well written and it lowered my expectations. I watched it despite the reviewers warning that it was all cliche. Well if this was cliche then so was High Noon. That is not a comparison of the two films. However to say everything in this film has been done before so it is all cliche is like saying every western has men on horseback, a sheriff facing a bad guy and his gang, towns people afraid to help and they all have guns strapped to their waist. Yes they fly biplanes in this movie, yes there are good guys and bad guys, ya sorta have to to make a story. So yes we have seen these things before, but not like this. The planes flying through debris of exploded planes may, as the other reviewer put it, have been there for the 3D effect but I would not have thought of that if he hadn't said it. I thought the debris whizzing by was new, they didn't do that in the past! Those scenes, I thought the cg was fine, really helped make it feel as dangerous as it must have been to those pilots back in the day. The love story the human drama the loss and the elation of survival made this a film to be watched. Director Tony Bill knows how to get the best from his actors and put it on film, this he did here time and again. He is also a great story teller which is one reason I chose to watch this film despite the review I read. You get to know and care deeply about each and every character regardless of the screen time they get. Although we only see the German Ace a couple of times and never hear him speak, Bill caught this mans essence in those few frames. I WAS NO WHERE NEAR DISAPPOINTED.  You won't be either. No cliches here!	4.0	What's Old is New Again	2014-03-09	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ACPZGES3M7WHT	Jackson E.	Great production values, and it was cool to see this view of World War One aviation combat since there really aren't any others.However, it's a predictable, stale war movie with stereotypical characters. I won't go into a rant that would be full of spoilers, but if you've seen any 3-4 good war movies you can add them up and divide them by poor writing and end up with this result. It feels extremely forced and hits its marks with difficulty, just clocking in to get the point across and then clocking out after another overplayed war scene half-done. If you've seen the friendly and sometimes jealous inter-squadron camaraderie of Top Gun, the war-time disillusionment of Full Metal Jacket and the cowboy do-the-right-thing-forget-about-regulations antics of William Shatner's OR Chris Pine's James Kirk, then you've seen this movie several times. It switches back and forth sporadically between taking itself very seriously and then making a flippant mockery of military life and wartime conditions. Save the time, unless you've got time to waste and you've already seen the above listed flicks a dozen times.	2.0	Stale	2014-03-30	0	0	0

Dogfights, attention to details, special effects are awesome!If you're not then it can be slow going since real life can be that way especially during wartime and it's not always fast paced and exciting as portrayed in the most movies, and that's probably why it got so many bad reviews when it came out, but the special effects might still interest you.Will be helpful if you know French because even with captions turned on it doesn't tell you what the French girl is saying.Then again makes it more realistic I guess.

In my opinion Fly Boys is better. Fly Boys sticks more closely to the air combat theme, while still allowing for a human side to the story, and those combat scenes! They are great.Not wishing to give the story line away to anyone lucky enough to still be looking forward to seeing this film for the first time, I won't go into any details, but you will not be disappointed.In particular, the always good Jean Reno as Captain Thenault, Jennifer Decker as Lucienne, and James Franco as Blaine Rawlings were outstanding. My feeling is that this is Jean Reno's best fit in a role since Ronin. And he has been plenty good in several films since then.	5.0	Better ThanThe Blue Max	2006-12-18	15	9	6

The personal evolution of these &#34;Flyboys&#34; is touched on, but, not I feel really made the focus the focus of the film. Therefore, for me, a three star film that will see me seeking other information to do justice to the memories of these hero's that,  basically flew the equivalent of a machine gun mounted on an ultralight!	3.0	More At Home In The Air!	2014-04-02	0	0	0

The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch.  And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad.  What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had.  Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2N2JR73104EXN	"James M. Joyce ""Indy"""	Contrary to many critics out there, I actually enjoyed this movie.  In case you haven't heard anything about the movie, it is about some gutsy American pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille fighting for the French during WWI prior to America's entry into the war.  Some good news for all of you married guys out there...my wife can't stand war flicks (yes, I dragged her in anyway LOL), but she really enjoyed this one. There is enough romance in the movie to keep the women happy, but not so much as to make their male counterparts gag.  The dogfighting scenes are amazing.  It is the first time I've seen a movie where the digital effects and standard film are seemless.  I really couldn't tell the difference!  The extras are worth the purchase.  They explain the true story of the pilots, which were just as crazy as the characters portrayed by the actors.  These guys flew planes that broke up in hard maneuvers without parachutes, and one other thing...pet lions.  Yeah, I said pet lions.  These guys really were crazy!The only reason that I gave this movie four stars instead of five is because of some historical faux-pas any aero dilettante would notice, and James Franco's metro-blond highlights in a early 20th century setting.  Other than that, sit down and enjoy the ride!	4.0	Flyboys-collector's edition	2007-03-13	4	2	2

What was the director going for because I can't see any discernible direction to the film.  It isn't historically accurate at all, it isn't much fun to watch, there is little to no story and the scripting is awful, no tension or resolution, nothing that makes you care one way or another who lives or dies, and for being set during one of the bloodiest wars in history it is strikingly devoid of actually feeling like a war is even in progress save for the Germans who arrive right when they are supposed to and are out of the picture for the rest of the time.This is one of those movies that I didn't even make it through in the first sitting.

From the opening credits to the final scene, the viewer is in suspense - at times on the edge of the seat and others applauding out loud for the bravery and heroism of young Americans with a can-do spirit.Whatever the critics might say, this is a joy to see.Our heroes are diverse, young, knuckle-headed kids who are willing to risk it all for a casue they dimly understand and a country they do not know. Their skills improve just quickly enough to save their skins; mostly.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	"James Franco stars in this exciting movie based on the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a group of American pilots flying for the French in the early days of World war I.Franco portrays Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher from Texas who's family ranch has just been repossessed.  While watching a movie at the local moviehouse, he sees a newsreel about pilots fighting in Europe.  He decides to enlist with the French Lafayette Escadrille and battle the Germans.  Soon, Rawlings and fellow pilots William Jensen (Philip Winchester), Lyle Porter (Michael Jibson), Eddie Beagle (David Ellison), Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), and Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) are on their way to France.  All have come from different backgrounds and circumstances, but they all share one common goal; to fight and defeat the Germans.Upon arriving in France, they are met by Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno).  It's Thenault's job to train the American pilots proper tactics in order to battle the Germans.  There are already some American pilots in France.  One is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).  He has become one of the best pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, already having shot down over twenty German aircraft.  The lead pilot for the Germans is the menacing Black Falcon (Gunnar Winbergh) and his group of skilled pilots.  All of the Germans fly the famed Fokker triplane, painted blood-red.  All except the Falcon's, who's is jet black.After completing their training, the Americans are finally ready to take to the skies and do battle with the Germans.  During the course of the movie, there are several thrilling aerial combat sequences between the Americans and Germans, especially the sequence where the Germans send a zeppelin to bomb Paris.  Relationships develop among the pilots as well.  Rawlings becomes the de facto leader of the group, and many of the other pilots look to him for support and advice.  Rawlings has also developed a relationship with a local French girl named Lucienne (Jennifer Decker).  She bandaged Rawlings' leg after a flying accident, and he became attracted to her.  However, she can't speak English and he can't speak French.  But the language barrier can't hide the feelings between the two.The missions become more and more dangerous for the Americans, and soon, some of the pilots are lost in combat.  But the Americans keep going up to fight it out with the Germans despite their lack of experience.  Their will to fight and courage is unquestioned as these heroic men continue to do battle with the enemy.This is an outstanding movie.  The story of the famed Lafayette Escadrille is told with complete historical accuracy.  The acting, especially by James Franco and Jean Reno, is excellent.  The plot is well-conceived, and the amazing aerial combat sequences are the highlight of the film.  The romance between Rawlings and Lucienne his handled wonderfully.  It does not become so out of control as to take over the movie.  Rather, it is allowed to grow at a slower pace that holds the viewer's interest.I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  History fans will enjoy it for its great combat sequences and attention to detail.  Laypersons will enjoy the romance between Rawlings and Lucienne.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AAS9RQ10D0Q7F	Jerry M. Hansen	I have watched this movie 3 times. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only complaint I have is the fact that the german tri planes are almost all red. Which is totally inaccurate. The only plane that was red in reality, was the Red Baron. Who was not even in this movie, otherwise all the americans would be dead. roflol:)Seriously though, the fighting sequences are great to watch, especially when you see the bullets flying through the air. If they would come out with more movies like this one, with the same technology, that would be great. Maybe less romance, and more flying action. the flying sequences were too short in my opinion.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ATVW8IF4482DM	"Jesse D. Hamm ""jessehamm124"""	"""The first WWI aviation film in 40 years"", so director Tony Bill reported gloats in a recent interview.  Actually, ""30"" would present a more accurate figure, considering the 1976 release of the JAck Gold's ""Aces High"", but no bother.  I needn't fret about Bill's lack of affinity for cinematic history; his readily apparent ineptitude in both the historical and technical departments is bad enough.Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich&eacute; imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly ""obliterates"" the entirety of Paris.And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess that of the actual performance capabilities of World War I aircraft, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of First World War-era fighters.Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misinterpretations about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a trivial and widespread popular misconception that by default associates World War One German aircraft with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, rarely were aircrew assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available in a manner that typically resulted sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as blatantly misrepresnted by the  closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated ""playing a really cool video game"" as opposed to providing a genuine ""in the cockpit"" sensation for the expreiences of piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel (the only moment in the entire film in which I cheered).Ultimately, the inclusion of a photograph of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing, I can recommend virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like ""Blue Max"" and ""Aces High"" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of ""Ace of Aces"" and ""Von Richtofen and Brown""."	1.0	Curse you, Tony Bill!	2006-10-07	28	9	19

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2B0DPQK20LYYJ	J. Michael	"As someone with a great interest in WWI, I had high hopes for ""Flyboys"" but found it to be a rather excruciating experience watching one-dimensional cardboard cutouts religiously follow every single last cliche' in the Hollywood playbook. A movie about a group of Americans who violated their nation's neutrality laws to fight for a foreign power in a senseless, fratricidal war, I was going to give it 2 stars for the impressive dogfighting scenes, thinking at least some of it was performed by actual pilot reenactors, until I found out that it was all CGI-generated and technologically anachronistic to boot. In any case, all the action in the world couldn't save a movie with such a predictable story and such generically boring characters.A professor once told me that a quick test of the quality of a novel or movie's characterization is whether you remember the characters' names. This movie was so mind-numbing, I was lucky to remember my own name by the end, never mind the protagonist's! I don't know if these were bad actors or they just had bad material to work with, but my family and I certainly didn't remember anyone's names, and were forced to refer to the characters by their physical attributes. Unfortunately, only a few of them- Blackie, Fatty and Spiderman-guy- had any kind of unique features, while the rest seemed as undistinguishable as snowflakes. We were glad when one of them got his hand cut off, because he then gained an identity as ""Hookhand"", and we were hoping the others would similarly discover their individuality- i.e. Burnedface, Lack-nose, One-eye - but we were disappointed.As terrible as the characters were- and I can't describe to you the interminable horror of watching a monolingual American try to woo a retarded French girl- the plot was even more disgraceful. If you've ever seen any sports movie, you've seen this one: A motley group of American misfits initially get their clocks cleaned by big, bad German bullies, led by the ""Black Falcon."" Our scrappy Yanks get their act together and start to hold their own against the German B-team. When the Black Falcon knocks out our ace, the young hero vows revenge, which he dramatically achieves with the unexpected help of a character previously thought to be useless. Look up the word ""formulaic"" in the dictionary and the definition will probably say ""the plot of 'Flyboys.'"" Skip this one, and let's just pretend it doesn't exist."	1.0	Crash and burn	2007-12-13	22	16	6

He falls in love in France where they are stationed (he is enlisted as a U.S. help towards France before U.S. enters the war).  He saves her and her dead brother's 3 children at the last moment.The end:  The movie ends with a ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" written ending, one where each character has their life play out.

Being an aviation buff for many years, I am so glad that movie making technology has reached the state it has today when aircaft have a chance to be represented at least CLOSE to what they actually looked like. Just look at some of the previous movies where enemy aircraft have been represented by aircraft which they did not even closely resemble: P-51 Mustangs painted gray to represent Me-109 German aircraft in WWII movies or AT-6 aircraft marked with Japanese insignia. The reason: they were not available anywhere either in flying condition or even for display on a flying field. Maybe the aircraft in ""Flyboys"" weren't completely historically correct in markings or the combat scenes weren't what you would expect but how many of the reviewers of this movie are historical experts or have ever seen a Neuiport 17? Maybe the computer folks who made this movie needed to do a little more research on markings and such before they released this movie but at least their techniques are a start.

Hartnett ""Jordan Hartnett"""	"Not only did this movie have great special effects, the effects were used to enhance the story and didn't take away from the movie. The aerial combat scenes were the most realistic and exciting one I had ever seen.The combat in this movie show what real air combat is like, especially in the World War I era, and what these amazing (now primitive) machines could do.A lot of reviewers missed the accuracy of the aerial combat in this movie. Yes, it was ""slow"" but instead of ""Making it into an exciting Hollywood fight or combat scene"" the producers of this movie allowed what actually would take place to stand on it's own.I am glad that there are Hollywood directors and producers who care about historical accuracy and won't sell out to make something that is already breath taking and exciting, over improvised and over done with the standard Hollywood effects and making it look good.My only criticism of this movie is that it was long in certain parts and some of the characterization could have been shortened.This movie gets 4 stars because of the historical accuracy and for not turning into another ""What can we do with out fancy Hollywood Special Effects?"" It also gets the stars for the excellent backstory of the heroes involved. True, it's not as exciting as other Hollywood movies, but then again most lives of heroes aren't that exciting.

This movie gives honor to those early American flyers who joined the French Air Force a year before the US entered the war. Also, some of the terrors faced by early pilots, like burning alive in a flaming aircraft, or falling to your death gives us some idea of what risks these men faced. I think that the few technical inaccuracies and a few over dramatization can be excused as the movie gets across the main idea of these brave American pilots venturing into an unknown warfare method and making a legendary name for their country.	4.0	Good Insight into US Aviators in WW1	2014-03-22	0	0	0

I would have to say the best actor in the movie probably was the lion.  Yes, there is a lion in a WWI movie, can you believe it?I found the dramatic dog fighting scenes actually quite comical.  Once you realize the planes are CGI, the dogfights are almost as enjoyable as watching a PS3 game.  The true horror of the film is watching the star of the show (Spiderman's best friend) try to woo a (almost retarded) French girl that likes to visit a local brothel for recreation.  I had to vomit several times during their less than bearable dialogue.  In one part of the movie, the leading character flies to her house to give her a joy ride in his plane. Yeah, I'm sure that happened all the time during a little war like WWI.  Also, I swear the movie's soundtrack was used in about every other major blockbuster movie of the past, in an attempt to make the movie seem of a higher quality.  I was actually relieved when the scratched blu-ray I rented locked up during the ending of the movie, so I wouldn't have to sit through much more of this pathetic excuse for a war movie.Questions to ask:Why was a French girl bandaging up injured war pilots in a brothel?How does a guy land a plane 100 yards next to his girlfriend's house with German guards all around without anyone noticing?How come they give a guy a medal rather than shooting him on site for stealing a squadron plane to save his retarded girlfriend?How do you chop off someone's hand with a dull field shovel?How is it that new pilots are suddenly artistic enough to paint professional looking logos on their planes?How can you shout commands at each other over the plane engines and wind noise during a dogfight?Why would you stand and wave your arms in open enemy territory after being shot down during a dogfight?Why would you do a solo suicide mission against a dozen nazi fighters, so you could revenge your friends?How do you do -3 G jet fighter maneuvers in a 65 Horsepower WWI plane?What was Bubba Gump's little brother doing in this movie?Why was there a pet lion used in a WWI movie?

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	MOVIE: Flyboys is a strange thing to dissect. It's a movie you really want to like, but you just can't help but face the fact that it's so cliched and poorly written. The story is centered around Blaine Rawlings, a young man who leaves his past to go fly planes in France. Each of the young men has a story behind them. Some do it for glory, some because they are forced to, some trying to make better lives for themselves, or some escaping their troubles. The film tells the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a fleet of young Americans who flew planes for the French in WWI before the U.S entered the war. The entire film is schmaltzy with some lame dialogue and weak acting, but it's entertaining. The dogfights, even though the CGI seems unpolished, are quick paced and really great. The story does a good job of building the characters, but since the characters are very flat we really don't care when they get shot down and die. Every formulaic cliche is followed and the movie itself can be followed like a map, there is no surprise as to where it builds and leads to. The audience can pretty much stay one step ahead of the characters, and that is due to the poorly written story. Decent cinematography and set design enhance the atmosphere of the movie, and the dogfights are intense and entertaining to watch. The movie just doesn't exceed in any area to make it memorable. The narrative is greatly enhanced by Trevor Rabins score. Rabin flexes his orchestral muscles and delivers one of his best scores ever. All in all the movie was a good experience, but it's just so cliched.ACTING: The moment after I saw the trailer I asked myself why couldn't they have spent some money on a good cast. James Franco seems to play the same person in every movie. In his previous outing, The Great Raid, he played pretty much the same person. At least The Great Raid had Joseph Fiennes and Marton Csokas. The only credible actor here is Jean Reno who is always great even though the only reason he got the role was because he's French. Martin Henderson never lands good roles and I really don't like him. He tries to pull off a tough guy with a troubled past here, but you just want to flick his nose and laugh every time he gets all up in James Franco's face. A better cast could have helped with the lack of a quality script, it sure did with The Great Raid.BOTTOM LINE: Amazing dogfights that should be seen on the big screen, but poor acting and a weak contrived script hinders this film from being anything extraordinary.	3.0	Cliched, Contrived, Laughable Dialogue, But A Great Score With Amazing Dogfight Sequences Make It Worthwhile	2006-09-25	16	6	10

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2JRDHU1D0S0TE	Keith Thompson	Flyboys is a decent adventure film, but with apologies to reviewer Monty Rainey, it can hardly be praised for its historical accuracy.  The computer-generated planes zip around more like jet fighters than WW1 planes, making snap-rolls & vertical climbs rather than Immelman turns & the slower, more gradual maneuvers the real planes were capable of. The Nieuports the Escadrille fly were obsolete & replaced by Spads by late 1916/early 1917 (when the movie takes place--they mention the USA entering the war which was April, 1917), and the Fokker Triplane didn't enter service until the winter of 1917 & never in great numbers (very few were red by the way). These quibbles aside, what really destroys the believabilty of the movie is when one of the Flyboys gets shot down & crashes in no-man's land (at a point where the German & French lines seem to be about 50 yards apart when a half mile is about the closest they ever actually got).  Though he's in the cockpit when it crashes, the pilot somehow gets his hand trapped between the ground & the upper wing (which miraculously didn't collapse when the plane flipped upside down). And he can't get it out! His friend has to land (apparently also in no-man's land), run THRU no-man's land perpendicular to all the Germans shooting at him, & help his friend get his hand out. (I won't spoil it by saying how.) WW1 fighters weighed roughly 1000 lbs, with the engine & guns comprising over half the total weight.  The top wing his hand was trapped under would have weighed about 100 lbs total.  If your hand was trapped under one side, you'd simply lift it off with your free hand.  Also the trailing edge of the Nieuport was made up of a pine-wood stringer which was one inch square. He could have cut your way thru it with a penknife.  OR, since his hand was trapped between the wing & the GROUND, he could have simply dug the earth away underneath it.Other blatant inaccuracies: the Germans invade with tanks of British design a year before the tank was invented; they've made a massive breakthrough within a few miles of the airfield & the pilots (& the hero's French girlfriend living in the war zone) are completely unaware of it; the hero takes off at night, lands (where? in a field, in the dark?) by his girl friend's house, & none of the thousands of German soldiers in the area hear the plane. . .For all that, it's not a bad action movie, but as far as being realistic?  They should have just made the movie about the real Escadrille pilots. Raoul Lufbery's true exploits would have been much more exciting. (To anyone interested in the true story of the Escadrille, I heartily recommend Jeff Shaara's novel about WW1, TO THE LAST MAN. And for a movie that gets to the heart of what flying in WW1 was really like, try THE DAWN PATROL with Errol Flynn (coming out in March on dvd).	3.0	Historically accurate?	2007-01-13	161	139	22

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2TH2WQV4P3C2Q	Kevin Maspons	"'Flyboys' is one of the best films I have ever seen, period. I was a skeptic of the movie at first, there have been so many good war movies made already, what could this one do to top any of them? While watching however, I was pleasantly surprised by not only the acting and storyline, but the soundtrack by Trevor Rabin put this one over the top.Also, 'Flyboys' is based on the real life adventures of the Escadrille Lafayette, created during the early years of WWI by the French to allow volunteer American pilots to fight even though the U.S. had not entered the war. The fact that every character in this film was real makes it hit home. You really become attached to each of the main characters as they struggle to live and fight honorably in a war with very little purpose behind it.'Flyboys' is the first 'modern' era film to attempt a portrayal of this particular story, and it does an AMAZING job. The effects, particularly the dogfights, are epic, and as mentioned, Trevor Rabin's soundtrack compliments the movie perfectly. The film summarizes itself succinctly  during the opening titles...""Though the airplane was only recently invented, it was quickly adapted for war. The young men who flew them became the first fighter pilots, and a new kind of hero was born...""This movie is a must have for any cinema enthusiast or history buff, and spring an extra couple of bucks for the collector's edition, it comes with some neat postcards."	5.0	Even better than 'Top Gun'	2009-05-13	5	2	3
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2S6A83EVSPAV8	Kevin Spangler	This was one of the worst WWI airplane movies I've ever seen. Full of phony looking CGI WWI aircraft, flitting around like spaceships in Star Wars. If you want to see an excellent WWI airplane movie go get The Blue Max, or Wings.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2HUN9JGERD87U	killabsting	Excellent portrayal of the WW1 entry of american fliers into the Lafayette Escadrille. The story was fun and exciting, the reality of the historical aspects were very well portrayed including the dog-fights and the esprit d' corps that each flyer had in both armies. James Franco was a natural for this part and did his character justice. I believed his portrayal of the character to the point of forgetting that he was acting a role. Very well scripted movie as was the cinematography and directing skills. Just to mention that the acting of all the characters was superbly first class and I would have been remiss if I were not to have mentioned it. The movie was excellent.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2CK2JAWK61XC4	Krystal	Not a horribly bad movie. It did have real good aspects but i felt it needed a little more.The good things:-The love story. Not too common, the language barrier was an interesting aspect and no happy ending like most.-Realistic. Its not like those movies where everyone survives. Theres realistic deaths and only a couple of the characters make it to the end.-Variety. The different nationalities of the characters is good. Of course, it is World War I, so it was expected, but interesting nonetheless.The bad things:-Nothing very concrete. I'm still undecided about this being good or bad. You get only a tiny bit of information on the characters. Theres really no indication of their strengths and weaknesses. Probably because there are so many characters that they dont focus on but one or two.-Repeated plot. Its not a thorough war movie that concentrates on one incidence or place. Its just about them going up in the air several times, taking them down and coming back.-No climax. Its not really a movie in which it builds up to anything. The plot is just continuous, so theres really no high point.Overall, its an ok movie. Its good for someone that doesnt like concentration on main characters and a war plot that doesnt narrow in on one incident.	3.0	Needed more elaborating	2006-12-14	18	10	8

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"""Flyboys"" pretends to be the 21st century version of the first Academy Award winner for best picture,Wings (1927). There are a lot of similarities in the film -- both feature American boys going off to France in World War I as aerial aces; both films have lengthy romantic interludes; and both feature pretty good air action scenes in dogfights with Germans.Yet it is, ironically, the older film that is more authentic, more fun, has better flying scenes, and has better music than its newer mate. ""Wings"", which was among Gary Cooper's first films, is more naive in its ""script"" (it's a silent film) but far more realistic and exciting in its all-important aerial scenes.What ""Flyboys"" does with aerial excitement is pretty typical and bland by 21st century standards. Most of the scenes are computer-generated and feature things that could not possibly happen mixed with a perfection that obviously wasn't the case in 1918, when the United States officially entered the war.In one instance, an American flyboy -- being tailed by a German -- lets off the throttle, the plane goes backward, and his stationary wheels rip through the upper fuselage of the German plane, knocking it out of air. Sure, that could happen, uh huh.Both films features lengthy and boring love scenes but, again, the older movie has the better stuff. The love scenes between Buddy Rogers and his female star in ""Wings"" is more authentic, more interesting and, frankly, more realistic than the nonsense that goes on being American flyboys and French girls that don't even speak the same language.Still, this movie is good for an evening's entertainment but people around here giving it five stars and saying it's great apparently have never seen another film. This movie has long, long boring sequences between the action and it goes on far too long. At almost 130 minutes, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. It could have been edited compactly to fit a 95-minute span that would have left viewers fresh and involved. As it is, it overstays its welcome by at least a half-hour.If you are thinking of renting or buying ""Flyboys"", do yourself a favor and watch ""Wings"" from 1927 instead. That movie has the best World War I air sequences ever filmed and, by comparison with ""Flyboys"", is still exceptionally relevant in 2008."	3.0	A bland romance with some flying action thrown in	2008-04-19	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1RQE7WXWF9VTB	L. Dequesada	"I highly recommend this film especially to those military aviation fans. It is about a story of the famed ""Lafayette Escadrille"" of the French Airforce in World War I. It was like a foreign legion of the air. It shows American volunteers who joined the glorius escadrille to fight against their German foes. The film also shows that there were both good and bad, like the German pilot of the red, crossed swords marked, red colored Fokker D-VII Triplane, a good man, who spares his American nemesis realizing his machine gun was jammed. But then there was the Black Fokker pilot,also depicting the drawing of a black falcon who was a heartless butcher.This film shows the famed escadrille in action, the way it was, which is now only remembered on connoseur or expert circles. The film also demonstrates a pilot's courage in those days, lest we forget that the parachute had not been invented yet or was at least in the drawing boards, so if your aircraft was hit or disabled you could not bail out thus the pilots were given guns, so that they could shoot themselves rather than be incinerated alive. The acting was great and credible. This film is based on a true action story. Do not miss it."	5.0	"""FLYBOYS""- DVD Format"	2007-03-14	11	7	4

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3VLAZEPO9UJEA	L. E. Cantrell	"I have just had an interesting time perusing the 101 previous reviews.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me there's a wide range of opinion out there.  How often do we find headlines running from one-starred ""Save your money"" to three-starred ""Good enough"" to five-starred ""Best movie of 2006 - also best kept secret""?  And all three comments in consecutive reviews on a single Amazon ""page""?[For the enlightenment of any cynics out there, I read the reviews and the attached comments as well as the headlines.]The main objection to ""Flyboys"" seemed to arise from the innumerable errors found on the screen.  They ranged from the airplanes that did not exist at the time of the film, to the super-abundance of Red Barons infesting the skies above France, to the breathtaking indifference to the laws of physics, to the positively giddy misapprehensions about what actually took place in the First World War (aka The Great War aka The War to End All Wars ... ahem.)  Now you may think that these historical boners, these intellectual clunkers are characteristic of video game-addled, Star Wars-bedazzled, comic book-educated lunkheads and lamebrains rather than of responsible adults given control over the millions and millions of dollars required to make a motion picture--but I say to err is human and to provide reason for selling all that overpriced popcorn is near-divine (at least for the theater owners.)A smaller group of naysayers held forth that the plot of the movie made no sense and that the people on the screen masquerading as actors displayed no slightest hint of talent.  I heartily dispute the latter.  The always excellent Jean Reno, who portrayed the French commandant of the flyboy squadron, was right up there on the screen to show what a competent actor looks like.  For several minutes, at least.Enough negativity.  Most reviewers clearly loved this picture.  Many of them took up such stirring war cries as, ""Never listen to the CRITICS!  This is one of the BEST!!!!"", ""Never mind the critics"" and ""The critics don't get it,""--not to mention the immortal, ""Don't listen to the `experts.'""  And the reasons they gave to turn off your mind and just drool in your seat were ... uh, and ....  Oh, yes, here's one, and by far the best of the bunch: ""I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.""  Yes! Absolutely!!  Take that you hyper-critical snobs!!!As for myself , I shall venture just one small criticism: not one minute, not one second, not one frame of the flying sequences looked convincing.  ""Flyboys"" is the most compelling argument I have ever seen against using CGI on a motion picture screen.  ""Cheesy,"" ""unreal"" and unintentionally hilarious"" don't even come close to expressing the way I feel about this visual train wreck.Take the vaunted Zeppelin sequence: the animation in ""Wallace and Grommet"" was more convincing.  Much more.  Now look at the Zeppelin sequence in Howard Hughes' 1930 blockbuster, ""Hell's Angels.""  Both are special effects sequences.  The 21st century version just lies down and dies, leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Its 76 year-old predecessor (in color, mind you!) pins you back in your seat.  When the Zep crashes, if I hadn't known the date of ""Hell's Angels"" I'd have  believed that Hughes had intercut some lost color film of the Hindenberg tragedy.DVD STUFF: In my journey through the earlier reviews, I noticed that some critics looked askance at comments addressed solely to the film and not to the DVD.  With that in mind I hasten to inform everyone that ""Flyboys"" appears on one or more plastic disks, and that in some editions it is accompanied by other stuff of no discernible significance.A FINAL WISTFUL THOUGHT: Wouldn't it be nice if somebody, somewhere, someday made a movie about the Lafayette Escadrille?"	1.0	A swing and a miss, not even a flyball	2007-02-19	35	27	8

The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film. So if you don't worry about the historical inaccuracy, this is a film you will enjoy.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AZWRXCCI8L9YG	Linebacker	"I am a huge fan of war movies, particularly air war movies, but unfortunately Hollywood releases few movies in this genre.  When they do release a war movie it is usually poorly rendered, such as ""Pearl Harbor.""  They do not seem to understand that war is a human endeavor, probably the most serious endeavor in which humans are involved.  They also do not understand that movies are about story telling and war stories need to be told.  Adding to the difficulty is the expense of filming a war saga (all those tanks and planes and ships are expensive to render on the big screen).  Computer generated images (CGI) should have done a lot to mitigate the cost of producing war movies but such releases are still few and far between.When a new war film is released it often does not rise to meet expectations.  I waited months for ""Pearl Harbor"" to be released and was sorely disappointed when it was.  It should have been spectacular but only perhaps fifteen minutes of it were worth the money.  There was an excellent Battle of Britain sequence at the beginning, a few first rate shots of the Pearl Harbor attack in the middle and some really good flight scenes of the Doolittle Raid.  The story was horrible, the acting was miserable and I was left thinking that someone should have made a movie about the Battle of Britain, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid.There are many war subjects which scream for attention but Hollywood seems to have a problem making movies which illustrate heroism, valor and self-sacrifice.  One particular subject which has never been portrayed on the big screen is the story of the pilots of Torpedo Squadron 8 who flew into the Battle of Midway during World War II.  Flying from Midway Island and the U.S.S. Hornet, a few Americans fought a fight to the finish against overwhelming odds when everything hung in the balance. If there is an American ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" this was it.  Attacking a fleet of four Japanese aircraft carriers, these pilots were all shot down without ever hitting a Japanese ship.  Their sacrifice, however, allowed the American dive-bombers to reach their targets and sink most of the Japanese fleet in what was the greatest U.S. Naval victory of all time.  Yet, Hollywood has never seen fit to depict this story on the big screen (however, the attack by Luke Skywalker on the first Deathstar could have been based on the story of Torpedo 8).With all this in mind, I looked forward to seeing ""Flyboys"" with not a little trepidation.  The lead up to the movie was not encouraging.  There was little advertising and I had to go online to see the trailer.  It was as if Hollywood was saying: ""Oh yeah, and we have this war film, too.""When ""Flyboys"" was finally released, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a fictionalized account of the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of American pilots who fought for the French before the U.S. entered World War I.  I think that the real story would have been just as good (someone should do a movie on Raoul Lufbery or Frank Luke) but the movie is close enough to the truth that even an amateur historian can enjoy it.  Historical fiction, when done well, such as in the books of Michael or Jeff Shaara, can accurately depict real events and the makers of ""Flyboys"" succeeded in doing so.The flight scenes were spectacular and excellently rendered.  The planes were accurate depictions of the aircraft used during the period, the characters were representative of those who actually flew in the Escadrille and the actors performed in a manner which did justice to the unit.  Particularly exciting were the attacks by the Escadrille on the German bombers.  There were some historical inaccuracies but those were not glaring.  Most of the tactics used by the pilots in the movie were believable and I could think of an example of each from the reading I have done on the pilots of that era .  Some did stretch the rules of physics somewhat but did not detract from the movie (I don't think bi-planes could fly upside down for long as the fuel systems relied on gravity but I am no expert).Not wanting to spoil movie surprises, I will attempt to explain a few things that will only make sense within the context of the movie.  The fear of fire was such that some pilots did carry pistols with which to end their lives rather than burn to death as parachutes were not yet commonly used.  Attacks on balloons and on Zeppelins were particularly dangerous.  Early in the war, when airplanes were used merely for reconnaissance, pilots carried firearms with which to shoot at enemy pilots and some actually did.  Chivalry between pilots during the war did exist up to a point. Pilots did crash land in no-man's land and were forced to run for their lives. Some pilots did machine-gun enemy pilots who had crashed landed (though this was not common). The mascot of the Lafayette Escadrille was the same kind as that shown in the movie. Finally, if a man was born a slave in, say, 1855, and he had a son in, say, 1899 at the age of 44, that son could have flown for the Lafayette Escadrille at the age of 18.The movie depicted a romance of sorts between the main character and a French woman but it was of the type common during the war.  It added to the movie rather than detracted from it (the ""Pearl Harbor"" romance, destroyed that film, leaving the movie with no sympathetic characters).  I am no real judge of ""chick flicks"" but my wife and daughters saw ""Flyboys"" and all want to see it again.The soundtrack from ""Flyboys,"" written by Trevor Rabin, really added to whole movie experience.  I am a true John Williams fan and Rabin's music is right up there with Williams.  The first thing I did when I reached my computer after seeing the movie was to check Amazon.com to see if the soundtrack had been released (it will be available 10 October).Maybe only once every ten years is a good war movie released and this one should not be missed.  I suggest that you see it at the theater if possible (on the biggest screen available).  I suggest you hurry as it was only at my theater for two weeks but I managed to see it three times.  It is also number one on my ""must buy"" list of DVD's.Now I can only hope that the upcoming movie ""Flags of our Fathers,"" based on the excellent book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, is as good as this movie was."	5.0	Its about time we had a first rate war movie.	2006-10-07	20	15	5

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1LCEJMBC630OJ	"L. McIlmoil ""Mac McIlmoil"""	I bought this one looking for a good historical action drama with good effects.  Flyboys far exceeded my expectations.  I am familiar with the Lafayette Esquadrille from history class and old movies.  The movie stayed pretty close to the truth.The characters were solid, well developed and believable.  The sets and settings were on the money.  Unique historical details (like use of landing gear in combat) were accurate (with two big intentional exceptations).  The arial dog fights were fantastic.Special effects were on par if not better than those in 'Pearl Harbor'.  Motion Capture of actual arial stunts made a huge difference.Extra features were some of the best I've seen.	5.0	Outstanding in every way.	2007-02-08	8	7	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"As a drama, this film lacks a lot.  The characters almost have depth, almost.  The romance almost has depth, almost.  The film almost has facts, almost.  There is a lot of almost in this film, which is this movie's primary problem.The story is quite straightforward.  A group of hot-blooded young lads head for France during The Great War to fly airplanes against Germany.  One of the future pilots takes the Aquitania to Europe, which had to have been a bit of a challenge since the Aquitania was not in civilian service at the time.Once in France, the excitement builds as the young pilots fly against Fokker Triplanes, even though those planes did not enter the war until later, and then only in small numbers.  The Fokker was notorious for being slow and occasionally falling apart because of a variety of problems.  However, the Fokker had an excellent climb rate and was maneuverable.  Baron Von Richthofen's plane was one of the few painted completely red.  I understand that the choice of red was made to help tell the good guys from the bad guys.Skipping past all the historical inaccuracies, which this film boasts in abundance, the movie finally gets into two stories.  There is a shallow love story and the dog fights.  The love story is shallow because our two love birds have to develop this love story in between dog fights and the love story seemed to me to be a distraction to the rest of the story.The real heart of this movie is the dog fights.  Boasting hundreds of CGI effects, this movie is a video game.  Planes roar and fly with awesome-looking bullet effects.  The zeppelin is a masterpiece, and one of the scenes on the zeppelin is a reprise of a similar scene used at least once, in the movie ""The Rocketeer.""  I do not have sufficient knowledge of the aircraft used in World War I to know whether they could turn as well as the aircraft shown in this movie, but the turns did seem too tight to me, especially for the Fokker with its wing structural issues.So we get to see a series of scenes where the good guys and the bad guys fight each other in the skies over France.  The good guys lose pilots and shoot down the bad guys, and the good guys are on the side of right and eventually they must have to gain some kind of moral victory.The biggest problem with this movie is lack of story.  The backgrounds of the various characters and the nominal love story are merely doorways to get these characters into dogfights.  I have seen this movie compared to ""Top Gun,"" but though that movie had its own issues, the dogfight scenes were secondary to the conflicted character that Tom Cruise played.  In this movie the dogfights are the entire reason for the movie, and everything else is secondary.On the other hand, the dogfight scenes are a blast to watch.  If you have ever liked video games, especially flight simulator type games or war games, this movie brings those games to life.  The special effects used to show the planes are phenomenal.  The special effects provide the redeeming qualities of this movie and save it from being a two-star movie.Other reviews of this movie are quite polarized.  However, the reason for the polarization is obvious.  If you expect even a nominal attempt at accuracy, then this movie will likely be disappointing for you to watch.  If you want to watch a movie about that is vaguely inspired by World War I dogfights and can wait for the movie to start showing them, then you will likely enjoy this movie.Good Luck!"	3.0	Lots of Juice but Little Meat	2007-04-23	6	5	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"This is a story based on true events, about American volunteers who came to fight in France before their country entered the war and who became fighter pilots in the, now legendary, Escadrille Lafayette. I am a little surprised by the very poor reviews this movie is getting, because I rather liked it, although I am the first to recognise that it could be much, much better.The strong point of this movie are the computer generated planes and air fights. WW I dogfights were a great movie material, because of their short range personal character - in fact, strangely enough, they remind me a little the STAR WARS fights between X-Wings and TIE fighters. Here the planes look really like real ones and the effect is great for any fan of aviation: Nieuport and Fokker fighters, Handley-Page and Gotha bombers and the gigantic L32 Zeppelin, they all give a great show. The movie is quite realistic and stresses well the incredibly idiotic decision of allied high command to NOT provide pilots with parachutes (Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians and even Turks had them, from the beginning of the war) on the incredible assumption, that pilots will jump from their planes at the first occasion!! That explains why the casualty rates in French, British, Italian and later American aviation were so high.There are some very weak spots. Relations between pilots and especially all the conflicts are too pinky easy and sweet, which takes away most of the realism. The main hero accomplishes alone all the most incredible things, the rest of the unit being mostly his sidekicks. The ending is a little too previsible. The love story is going nowhere and we do not even know why. There is only one really bad guy in the movie and of course he is German, etc., etc.;Jean Reno indeed is not very much used but this is a nice effort from Hollywood to hire a French to play a French officer, rather than just use an American and make him speak with a French accent... On this point, let's stress that this movie is a welcome pause in French bashing, which seems to be a kind of national sport in Hollywood this last years....But all those weak points notwithstanding, I forgive to this movie a lot, for the scenes, when the Escadrille Lafayette takes off and is flying over the beautiful French landscapes, together with a flight of cranes... And then there is this unique scene, when a whole horde of red painted Fokkers emerges from the sunlight to butcher the unsuspecting American rookies, with the Black Falcon in the lead (yes, you guessed right, the Black Falcon is the plane of the BAD GUY).There is also some good humor in ""Flyboys"" - a mascot lion named Whiskey, an American pilot who simply can not shoot straight no matters how much he tries, until.... well, no, no hints here, you will see by yourself. And the decorations of the planes, with my favorite being a seriously deranged woodpecker... This is a nice war movie, and a must if you are a fan of aviation and can simply not resist the sight of a flight of Fokkers going after some heavy Handley-Page bombers...."	4.0	Not a great movie, but very watchable	2012-06-06	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AXZSJ1QGXDXQT	Marina J. Neary	"This is one of those weepy boy movies, up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though a little easier on the stomach) and ""The Right Stuff"".  I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.  This movie has something for everyone - heroism, camaraderie, adventure, romance, history.  The romance portion was handled well, without excess.  No cheesy love ballads, no love confessions.  It's a good thing that the Boy and the Girl spoke different languages.  If say said ""I love you"", that would have been too much.  It's a good thing that the movie remained a War Movie, not a Love Story.Here are a few historical inaccuracies.  The tri-planes were not common in 1916.  They were really hard to manipulate.  But I understand that the director put them in the film for extra visual stimulation, because they do look menacing.  Also, I find it hard to believe that the American pilots gained such control over their planes in such a short period of time.  The film makes it look like they spent 2 weeks training and emerged master pilots."	5.0	Weepy boy flick at its best	2006-09-23	6	3	3

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2HWGK45RBQX63	"Mark ""a longtime record buyer"""	"This is an awfully good looking movie put together by some very gifted veteran film makers.  Unfortunately, it seems not to have occurred to any of them to consult even a rudimentary history of World War I before embarking on this.""Flyboys"" is supposedly set against the backdrop of that war but in fact it is not.  It takes place in an alternate universe where things are very different.Okay, a good movie has dramatic needs.  But usually its fictions are things that ""could have happened"" within the context of a larger historical backdrop.  Consider...(1) The actual war opened with a German drive on Paris in 1914 which stalled out at the Marne.  Both sides dug in there, and each extended their flanks until parallel trench lines ran uninterrupted for 475 miles from the Swiss border to the sea. And there they sat...This was the notorious ""trench deadlock"" that gripped the western front from late 1914 through early 1918.  The film supposedly takes place during this period but...(2) ""Flyboys"" forgets the trenches and strangely posits an imaginary German drive on Paris around 1916.  Airmen of the Escadrille try to thwart it by escorting bombers to attack German supply depots.  What is even more odd is that when this raid fails, they simply lose interest in the threat to Paris and turn to other missions.(3) The only major German offensive in this period was actually at Verdun.  It was a bloody struggle that lasted months and accomplished little, but cost over a million  lives.  The Escadrille is based at Verdun in the movie so its airmen should be in the middle of this crisis.  Yet they seem blissfully unaware something is amiss.(4) There is mention of ""sending children to England"" for safety.  A touching cinematic moment, but there was no need to flee France in World War I.  If necessary, you simply moved farther away from the front.(5) Around mid-film the surprising announcement is made that ""the Germans have moved across the Meuse"" -- and indeed we see soldiers marching across open fields.But again, as with the drive on Paris, how did these troops get past the Allied trenches?A massive breech of the Allied line would be needed, with follow up forces penetrating deep into open country in the rear. Such a staggering event would have shaken France to the core.But here it merely provides the hero an opportunity to fly to the rescue of his sweetheart and evacuate her by air to safety.  After that bit of personal drama the film once again simply loses interest in the situation.(6) The Zeppelin daylight suicide raid on Paris seems like another fanciful concoction.  Zeppelins raided England at night but were never very effective.  Here we are given a lovely cinematic death ride that makes no sense.(7) Toward the end of the film the Germans renew that strange drive on Paris.  This time it triggers an evacuation of the French capital, apparently to create a poignant background against which the romance between the airman and French girl plays out.Germany was incapable of such an attempt until the collapse of Russia in 1917, which allowed transfer of a million troops from the east.  Then came the great German offensives of 1918, but none were aimed at Paris and there was no evacuation.Bottom line:""Flyboys"" routinely destroys any remote possibility of understanding this important event with its huge and impossible distortions for the most casual and fleeting of purposes. There is more than enough exceptional material in the history of this war to meet any dramatic requirements of film makers. They seem not to have bothered to even look at it.It is strange to see young student reviewers call this film ""a good way to learn about WW I.""Look, I'm no historian.  These remarks are from memory based on having read a few books on this war some years back.  That's not much, but it was enough to bedevil sincere efforts on my part to get some sort of handle on the peculiar world of ""Flyboys.""I very much wanted to like this movie but fear it is a pleasure reserved for those who know little about its subject matter."	3.0	STRANGE HISTORY	2007-02-14	21	18	3

The acting is excellent, but people used to the over-the-top emotionalism of most acting these days are probably not going to appreciate it. There is no self-pity and no tantrums.They captured the historical reality of air missions during the first world war as well as anyone ever has. And the CGI, despite its limitations visually, allowed them to recreate a richer variety of aircraft in battle than previous live-action films were able to show. With some notible exceptions, many past WWI air films ended up in the air being dogfights between a small set of fighters. This is different.The film has a strong male point of view to it which is almost never seen these days. Rather than drunk supermen with a gun in one hand and a woman in the other ready, rather than prettyboys (Top Gun), rather than crybabies, you get ordinary guys with motivations that most people can understand.Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault does an excellent job in playing his part as well.This is a first-class retelling of some of the stories of the Escadrille LaFayette. Most films these days are unwatchable junk.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2MUWWHK6VFLXK	Mary M. Twillman	It's not Oscar time for this film, but it was diverting. I thought it did give a good overview of the Escadrille and the motivations of the characters who came from the US to volunteer. True, the terrors of war weren't driven home as in Saving Private Ryan, but this just isn't that kind of movie. Fortunately, as it was my 9-year-old son's interest in WWI planes that motivated the purchase. He was able to watch it without too many disturbing scenes (although the scene in the trenches was pretty intense). If you're looking for intense, gripping action and emotional turmoil, along with Titanic-level accuracy, this isn't the one for you. But for a family movie I thought it was pretty good.	4.0	A good DVD movie	2007-03-08	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2CHKTBRQHDQQ8	"Mason Vaquero ""Engineer"""	Flyboys has some historical inaccuracies, but so did a lot of movies that were made about WWII.  In this case, it is about WWI and it is based off of the Lafayette Escadrille, which was basically the French Air Force (then called French Air Service) during that time.  There were a number of American men who joined this service to help fight for the French but also to learn to fly and become a part of history.  The airplane had been invented not very long before, so for these men they really were being a part of history in more ways than one:  They were the first combat pilots in a war.  I wanted to talk about the Collector's edition disc first.  I see a lot of people exploding at the mouth, ears, nose and overall body cavity when railing on this film.  Many of the comments are that the flight scenes are not realistic because of CG and impossible capabilities of the airplane.  I find this funny because in the special edition it shows how they had stunt pilots do these very things and have it all recorded.  The construction of the Zeppelin was also interesting and yet debunks another myth that it was a 100% CG creation.  Last but not least they do show a history of the real Escadrille and amazingly despite all the exploding heads, I found that it seemed to be far more accurate than some people are claiming when accusing it of being false.Overall the story is good for representing dog fights and training exercises, and although I didn't feel moved by every character's story, I still feel it had enough different things going on to make it good.  The romance was a nice touch and when Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is hiding from the Germans in the house it was very scary, especially thinking moments like that really happened back then.  I also really liked the fact that they showed some ground battle and portrayed the trenches and the soldiers who fought in them.  Many don't realize how many fought and died right there in the trenches, because if a bullet or bayonet did not get you, the mustard gas did.  The team of men do start out somewhat as misfits and spoiled brats but then are shown to come together in their training and off base hanging out time to become a team.  It is not the greatest portrayal of WWI nor is it the most accurate, but the story I thought was very moving and it is close enough to representing some of the men that I liked it.  Eugene Skinner was one of my favorite people and Abdul Salis did a great job playing this role.  James Franco and Jean Reno also are great in their roles.  Franco is not everyone's favorite male actor but he seems much better than if they were to put Colin Farrel in there.	4.0	Flyboys - two disc collector's edition	2007-02-28	8	5	3

So do not get annoyed when lots of tri-planes shows up or a zeppelin intends to bomb Paris, those are the usual ""historical licenses"" of this kind of films.I regard this movie as an ""action film"" as for example ""Indiana Jones"" or ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and as such is quite good.""Flyboys"" (2006) was directed by multifaceted Tony Bill who is also actor and producer of many films.The story is based on the ventures of young Americans volunteers to become pilots of Lafayette Escadrille. From all over the States with different motivations they go to France without even knowing a French word.There they are trained and launched, still green, into the fry suffering losses and evolving step by step into veteran and even aces.I love the special effects now possible with CGI, crowds of planes may be shown, fighting each other fiercely and giving the word ""action"" a full new meaning.Play acting is correct, with only Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault over par, beautiful French actress Jennifer Decker as Lucienne give way to romance.The runtime, 140 minutes, is a little excessive.A good movie for a variety of audiences: WWI buffs, action movie's fan, romance fans.Reviewed by Max Yofre."	4.0	WWI: Over the Skies of France!	2011-12-31	0	0	0

Having said that, I spent money on the dumb thing so I guess I have a right to speak. Actually I want to second all the critical brickbats that have been directed at this film. The complaints about the poor script, one-dimensional characters, uneven pacing, flat acting, unbelievable CGI effects, almost total lack of historical accuracy, etc. are all justified. The producers, director and screenwriters really hit  the mark with this one!If you're interested in WWI aviation movies, look for THE BLUE MAX, DAWN PATROL, WINGS, HELL'S ANGELS or even VON RICHTHOFEN AND BROWN.

Mcintire	This film claims that it is based on historical fact,  the only historical fact that it can claim is that world war 1 did indeed take place, and that there was a Lafayette escadrille.  Hollywood does not understand guys, real warriors.  Instead it takes a bite out of the moody warrior, the liar,  preacher ect,  but fails to show the spirit,  the fear, and reality of young men going into battle. The poor attempts to show young pilots preparing to go to war, shows very little of flying, The gunge ho spirit these young men had, just a blase attempt to get 20 minutes of film shot, although there are several amusing spots, your left feeling lost, after 20 minutes you are waiting for something, anything to happen.  Add to this poorly written love story that takes up a third of the movie.  If you are able to watch the entire film you are left with the image that the pilots of ww1 flew perhaps once a week, spent the rest of the time feeling sorry for themselves, chasing after a long lost Love, our, drinking themselves to death.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A5GZ8MCC21XZD	Michael T. McNamara	I was looking forward to this film as I had heard good things about it. Unfortunately the good things came from ill-informed people. This film did little but anger me. It certainly did not entertain.I am a sucker for airplane movies. I like James Franco and Jean Reno as actors. So I stayed with it and the longer I did the more upset I got.First and foremost are the blatant historical and factual inaccuracies. Yes, the Lafayette Escadrille existed and was manned by American volunteers. NO, they did not train in their operational unit. The French had an entirely separate, not entirely logical system for training new pilots. Worse, they used Nieuport 17s, which had rotary engines NOT radial engines. The entire mass of a rotary rotates around its crankshaft, greatly affecting maneuvarability, while a radial - although they cylinders are arranged in similar fashion - sits still in the aircraft while the crank rotates. There are a number of close-up scenes in which the nose of the plane is prominent and in all the engine sits still.This alone had my teeth grinding. Then there is the story-telling.There are several scenes in which Franco takes of on a usually love interest-driven mission that shows him in the air. Cut to him walking from the plane in some sort of rough, plowed field. Gimme a break. How does one make the jump from being in the air to walking away from an impossible landing?I can go on and on but this is already taking more effort than the film is worth. This should have been an homage to the brave men who flew for France before America entered the Great War. Instead it is a farce. Don't even get me started on how the producers and director wasted Jean Reno. I am certain he was blushing as he cashed his check and \paid his French taxes.To be sure, the CGI stuff is awesome and worth watching on a streaming service. This film is not worth, however, spending a centime of your own money.	1.0	Great eye candy, deficient on facts and story-telling	2014-04-03	0	0	0

The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right.  Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage.  Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner.  In execution, it is a disappointment.  They ruined a potentially good story.  Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno.  He is the good part of this film.	1.0	Flyboys	2008-05-03	6	4	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ADA1RCKE7NX9Z	MJG	"Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,""  Flyboys is a big letdown.  Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous:  aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film.  More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon.""

Flyboys won't win any awards, but it sure entertained my packed theater. People laughed at most of the little jokes scattered throughout this long film. Clocking in at over two hours it is a bit too long and some of the dialogue is lacking, but the romance is handled well (unlike Pearl Harbor, thank God!), as are the many amazing CGI dogfight scenes. If your bored one afternoon, you should check out Flyboys, otherwise just wait for the DVD.	4.0	Better than I was led to believe	2006-09-23	142	128	14
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A32J48LYJ2BNNY	Monty Rainey	"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie but became reluctant after reading the rather mediocre reviews it received from the so-called ""experts"". I decided to ahead and, as usual, the ""experts"" got it all wrong. FLYBOYS not only met my expectations, but also exceeded them.I'm a big history buff and am usually very disappointed with Hollywood's rendition of historical events. For me, it really detracts from a movie when I see things like Sea Sparrow missile launchers on the deck of a destroyer in Pearl Harbor, or when William Wallace supposedly has a torrid affair with a Princess who was, in reality, only three years old at the time of his death, and I expected to find similar fault with this movie. I found no such errors here. The true life story was most accurate, including such details as the lion which served as the mascot for the Escadrille LaFayette, the dented bullets which the flying aces had to sort through before each flight, and the fact that over one million allied soldiers lost their lives at Verdun.Hollywood movie critics have a difficult time with true stories. True life, especially when accurately presented, doesn't always have the same flair as fictionalized accounts, and critics have given rather harsh reviews of the plot, totally missing so many details surrounding such things as camaraderie, respect and traumatic real life emotions. And no, in real life, people don't always live happily ever after and the hero doesn't always ride off into the sunset with his sweetheart.Beyond the historical accuracy portrayed here, the film has sensational filming, particularly in the air battle scenes. The aerial views depict the miles of devastation of French countryside surrounding the trenches. The casting is more than adequate with particular mention going to Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault. James Franco also gives a superb portrayal of American Ace Blaine Rawlings.If you are a history lover, and particularly interested, as I am, in the Great War, I urge you to go and watch this movie. You will find it historically accurate and yet able to bridge the gap into being an entertaining movie. Remember that this is not some Hollywood enhanced idea of war, but rather an accurate depiction of the real life events that surrounded the American pilots who became the Escadrille LaFayette. The critics got this one all wrong. Surprise, surprise.Monty Rainey[...]"	5.0	"Don't listen to the ""experts""."	2006-09-23	489	436	53

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1SCD2NYTIAQTY	Mouldy Pilgrim	"When I saw the shorts for ""Flyboys"", I had to wonder if it were another rehashed version of the abominablePearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition), about which I still have the occasional nightmare. I won't be having nightmares about ""Flyboys"".Set in the First World War, it follows the journey of a group of young Americans who decide, for various reasons of their own, to enlist with the French forces to fly against the Germans. They did this before the USA entered the war. Learning to fly canvas and wood planes, they soon find out the realities of air warfare and the skills of their enemies.The acting is fairly average and most of the dogfighting and aerial shots are CGI images. However, that is understandable considering there are not many of the aeroplanes left, and anyone who has built a replica would be naturally possessive and protective. That said, I thought the CGI had been well done, indeed, and was far superior to a lot that shows up in war movies. The quality was very good.For the historical inaccuracies that some have mentioned, you would have to be very knowledgable in the field of First World War aviation to pick them up, except the most obvious ones. For the average viewer, these concerns will not take away from the overall plot or enjoyment of the movie. The one point I thought was a bit rich was Rawlings landing his plane and running into No Man's Land to rescue a downed pilot. The fact that some of the best machine gunners in the world at that time could not hit him was a glaring oversight.The concession made to the performance of the aeroplanes themselves is also understandable in my own opinion. For the sheer spectacle of combat, I can see why they ""enhanced"" the performance of the planes themselves. The real thing would not have been able to do vertically climb as they did in the movie, (true), or do such snappy moves, (true), but that would have been less than exciting if the makers had stuck strictly to the reality.For sheer spectacle, this movie more than makes up for its short-comings. It is visually gripping and very much an action drama. Considering it is the first movie about First World War fliers in some decades that I know of, it was a refreshing and pleasant movie to see. I really enjoyed it."	4.0	Spectacular and Enjoyable	2007-07-20	4	4	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A14C6XSHIF0MH9	Movie fan from another galaxy	"This stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from 2001 ""Pearl Harbour"" starring Ben Affleck. The acting is wooden and forgettable, the action sequences are humorous at best, and the direction is...well, let's just say, director Tony Bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in ""Barb Wire"". The directing style seems to be...throw in as much loud music as possible, add a heaping helping of a lame love story, toss on some of the worst, most embarrassing lines imaginable, and let's not forget those all important CGI effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of WW1 flying action since the Three stooges.If you want to watch REAL WW1 flying action with REAL WW1 biplanes, check out ""The Blue Max"". That movie used real WW1 vintage aircraft, that actually have weight to them and do NOT perform impossible flying stunts that the Blue Angels do not even attempt using FA-18 jets.Pacing is terribly frantic, music is insufferable, character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent.Pass this one by, unless you're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive, wasteful, useless, hollywood blockbuster bomb."	1.0	Flyboys=Pearl Harbour...No redeeming value except as a clear illustration of how NOT to make a combat flying film	2007-04-23	18	13	5
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3NQ3KK6A16XJT	MovieMusic	"A significant part of this movie is a well told love story. Towards the end of the movie Lucienne is evacuated to England but makes a pact to meet Rawlings after the war in Paris. At this point their commitment to each other is unquestioned. So here comes the wonderful resolution to this beautiful relationship : at the end of the movie a screen graphic says, ""Rawlings went to Paris but never found Lucienne.""People usually don't just disappear. And if they do, they have relatives who can shed some light. So what this tells you is that this movie is not about relationships, it is about computer animated flying sequences that are often quite well done, apart from occasional reversals of the laws of physics and a few too many instances of planes flying through the camera.It is a special effects movie with composite characters and composite relationships included only for the benefit of flying sequences having a reason to exist."	1.0	A spoiler you might thank me for ...................	2013-05-02	0	0	0

Which is a shame, because all of the elements were there to make the best WWI aviation movie in history, and instead, they made this crud.  Who was the historical advisor on this one?  Paris Hilton maybe?  No, wait, she could've done better.Where to start?  Fokker triplanes at the end of 1916?  Nope, that was later.  Five thousand Fokker triplanes, all painted brilliant red, with crosses all over them, even on the upper surfaces of the lower wings?  Nope.  A zeppelin raid in broad daylight with a triplane escort?  Nope.  Close up views of the smallish looking Neuports that show the brakes on the backs of the wheels? That's plain stupid.  Brits, Frenchies, and Americans all operating off the same airfield and sharing airplanes no less?  Nope.  Enough time between missions for pilots to apparently take week long vacations through the countryside?  Nope and stupid.  A German aerodrome occupied apparently only by one pilot and one little guy to salute him?  Wierd and dopey.  One lion, not two?  What happened to ""Soda""?That's the short list, there's much, much more.  This movie's about as historically accurate as Pearl Harbor was a few years back, where Ben Afflack single-handedly won WWII.  They even have a wonderful CG'd version of the Aquitania bringing the Americans over to France, but dash it all, the Aquitania was serving as a hospital/troop ship at that time.Add to all this a very poor and pointless love story with an illiterate French woman.  What was the point of that?  Again, all the ingredients were here to make an outstanding movie, and these guys made something so mind-numbingly poor that any military history buff is going to be disgusted with the missed opportunity.  It's got some great visual effects, but so did Independence Day, and in the end, Independence Day was more believable than Flyboys.This movie is just painfully stupid.  Will there never be a movie capable of matching THE BLUE MAX as the best WWI flying movie ever made?  Save your money, buy THE BLUE MAX, and enjoy a realistic story with REAL airplanes doing REAL flying, and not a bunch of computer generated Fokkers moving like they're F-16s."	1.0	A Huge Opportunity Wasted...	2007-02-06	29	21	8

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	Since Top Gun, war movies about aerial warfare have always taken second seat to war movies about land battles, in terms of award nominations and box office takes.  This movie shares this fate.  It came out in 2006 and was probably the least hyped and least successful war movie of 2006, lagging far behind Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Annapolis, and others in the same genre.  But don't let this fool you, this was a good movie, fun to watch and engaging the entire way.  The movie begins by showing how the various Americans joined the war before their own country.  The movie then progresses to show their training, and troubles both in and out of the cockpit.  Finally comes the dogfights, of which there are several.  One dogfight occurs around a zeppelin, another occurs over a trench battlefield, and another occurs over fields and forests.  The dogfights themselves were very realistic, and the only miss of detail is that all the pilots landed looking just as good as when they took of, even though they sat in open air cockpits.  It seems hair gel was standard treatment for WWI pilots.For a war movie, it has all the generic subplots; the romance between a local girl and the group's brooding conscious, the doomed hero, the silent villian, the spoiled rich kid who does good, and the over eager chap who losses his nerve, only to gain it back at the end.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AYU9LBROYQBG6	"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat..."	"Flyboys is a 2006 American drama film set during World War I, starring James Franco, Martin Henderson, Jean Reno, Jennifer Decker, David Ellison, Abdul Salis, Philip Winchester and Tyler Labine. It was directed by Tony Bill, a pilot and aviation enthusiast.[1] Screenplay was written by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward with the screen story by Blake T. Evans.The film follows the enlistment, training and combat experiences of a group of young Americans who volunteer to become fighter pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, the 124th air squadron formed by the French in 1916. The squadron consisted entirely of American volunteers who wanted to fly and fight in World War I during the main years of the conflict, 1914-1917, before the United States later joined the war against the Central Powers.A group of young Americans go to France, for different personal reasons, and volunteer to fight in the French Air Service, L'A&eacute;ronautique militaire, during World War I prior to America's entrance into the war. One of the main characters, Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France. Dilettante Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) joins because of his overbearing father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), who had been accepted as an athlete in France, was motivated to ""pay back"" his adopted country. These American recruits were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno), while the veteran fighter ace Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), a fellow American, takes over as their mentor.During their training, the film mainly deals with the struggles each pilot has with the demanding flying; later, the focus shifts to the aerial dogfights that dominate the front line missions. Themes of camaraderie, racial prejudice, revenge and love are also explored. The film ends with an epilogue that relates each film character to the real-life Lafayette Escadrille figures on which the movie was based.[2] One charming touch in this film is that the hero is given a small bear, which he carries as a good luck charm. This is an obvious reference to the small bear carried as a good luck charm by a pilot in ""Wings,"" a silent film about the Lafayette Escadrille, which, in 1927, was the first film ever to win the Academy Award for best picture."	5.0	A MASTERPIECE!

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1ABK7KY667J4G	NonDePlume	I was so excited to see this movie and then so let down in seeing it. It is impossible to cover all of the inaccuracies not to mention anachronisms throughout the movie. At any moment during training I expected Franco to pull out a droid and start texting. And the lack of respect shown by the American trainees to the battle hardened French officer was just so out of character for men in that time period its ridiculous. Not only were men much more classy in their public behavior back then but they would never have disrespected an officer like that, particularly the French. They'd have all been doing their flying from the brig. .The yelling &#34;yahoo!&#34; from an airplane, and shouting to each other as they flew by, I mean, ...come on. You can't hear anything over the roar of those rotary engines and a hundred mph wind in your face. It was laughable. Never once did I get the feel of climbing into the cockpit first person, like you did in the Blue Max when Stachel first flies a combat patrol in the Pfalz. Even though the cockpit shots weren't as good as &#34;Hells Angels&#34; looking at the actors (which used real pilots for actors who were filmed actually flying their planes) the shots from inside the cockpits were still were from real cockpits so you got the experience of taking off in a WWI plane. And the scene of the German gunning down the young dumb pilot (why would you run in a straight line in front of an airplane, ....did he think he could out run it? Just run into the woods dummy) is just garbage. There is a famous story that many WWI movies took liberties with about a pilot saluting another pilot who's guns jammed, but the story is true. It was a German Ace, Ernst Udet who spared Georges Gunymeyer when Gunymeyers guns jammed by waving and flying off.  And it was the allies who broke the treaty against incendiary ammunition and started lighting up the fuel tanks of German planes with fiery bullets. The German pilots actually flew with chivalry and honor for the most part from all accounts, so to do something so cheap as that scene just makes you hate the movie even more.  That and the only German plane you get to see other than the Gotha are the Fokker Triplanes and they weren't even on the battlefield yet and when they were finally on the battlefield they weren't the only planes in the air as they made just over 200 of them that actually saw combat duty. Where were the Pfalz's, Halberstadts, and more importantly the Albatrosses?  I mean if you're going to paint it in CGI then you can make anything you want. They should have had SPADS, and they shouldn't have given them Nieuport 17s as they weren't out yet. If they were flying Nieuports it would have been 11's (with a single Lewis on the top wing). Stupdest WWI movie ever made. They should have called it &#34;Flyboyz&#34;.	1.0	"They should have called it ""Flyboyz""."	2014-03-19	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A360071F0EDGCM	NY film fan	I confess I was entertained by the movie -in those moments when I wasn't screaming at the TV. Some of the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that even for a work of fiction it was hard to swallow. At the beginning the movie states that 9 million would eventually die in WWI - soliders perhaps. That total is nowhere complete if you add in the civillian dead. A good number of which would have come from the area in which the characters were fighting. The Verdun front was a wasteland for miles - towns were obliterated from the shelling - the area around the fronts were ruined for not years but decades. No cheery farmhouse with well-fed children, no trees or plowed fields visible from the air, nothing but death and destruction for miles and miles. Trench warfare was not confined to a thin sliver. Though the front itself moved only yards the shelling and death reigned over an extended area. There are villages in the area that never returned and if you drive over the battlefield even now 90 years later as I did, you can still see the craters and hills caused by the shelling. The aviators were above the day to day merciless killing field but they were not untouched by it. My biggest problem with the film was the complete santization of WWI. The northern part of France and southern Belgium were devasted far more thoroughly than even Germany in WWII. It was truely hell on earth. Other reviewers have addresed the inaccuracies in the planes used - do not get me started on the mechanized land transportation. Tanks were only beginning to be developed and would not have been used as shown - also correct me if I am wrong but the Germans had already crossed the Meuse River much earlier in the War. At this point in time they would have been drive back - probably by Black Jack Pershing. The producers could have spent a bit more money on some historical research and less on their computer graphics. They did not get their money's worth there either. As it was, I could never tell who was who during the arial combat sequences. I would have sworn one fellow was dead only to have him reappear later in the movie. I did enjoy the camaraderie and would have like to see more of the unit as a whole.	2.0	Not bad if you ignore the facts.	2007-06-18	6	4	2

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't that great either. I agree that the fight scenes were very well done and exciting to watch, but other than that, I was very disappointed. I found the acting to be mediocre and the tone of the film was somewhat cheesy, I thought. I was expecting a serious war film in the category of 'Saving Private Ryan', but what I witnessed was more similar to Jerry Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbor.' It is more of a ""feel-good"" war movie, than a realistic one. Don't get me wrong, the film had it's moments, but it just wasn't what I expected.

Although based on actual events (in that this unit did, in fact exist, but any similarities end there) and a mediocre book, the story, as it is presented in the movie, is awful - the fight scenes are ludicrous, laughable, and utterly unrealistic - and the acting is... i'm getting sick just thinking about it.

All things considered, however, the final responsibility falls on the director and, were I his boss, I'd have him beaten and dumped in a river somewhere.

The German-American guy flips his plane when he crashes in no-man's land. Only he cannot get away from his hand because his hand is pinned underneath the plane. How in the hell did the hand get there in the first place? As one of our American heroes is uselessly jerking around, I am wondering why doesn't he just use his other hand to dig a hole and free his smashed hand? What is this jerking around stuff? Then James Franco appears in no-mans land to his friend's rescue. This scene just gets stranger and stranger by the second. Where did Franco land his plane? Wouldn't his airplane be wiped out by an artillery barrage? We see Franco running and dodging bullets and at this point, I am thinking a good artillery blast from the Germans ought to do the job here. Fire in the general area of James Franco. But that is not what happens because Hollywood is too cheap to have any artillery. Two French heroes risk their lives trying to save Franco and his friend. Franco arrives and tugs and jerks on his friend's hand and finally grabs an entrenching tool. I am thinking now this ridiculous scene begins to make sense, right? Dig the hand out, for crying out loud! But no. Instead Franco uses the entrenching tool as a lever but he cannot budge the plane so HE CHOPS HIS FRIEND'S HAND OFF! Without wrapping anything to stop the arterial spraying and the loss of blood he and his friend who must be undergoing extensive shock and screaming his head off escape to the French trench in one of the most amazing and ridiculous scenes I have ever seen!A little later in the film, as Franco races off to evacuate his girlfriend, Captain Jean Reno comes out to tell Franco that these aircraft are not for his personal use. What the hell does Reno think Franco has been using his aircraft for  this entire movie? Is hitting on a girl a professional use of the plane? The movie just continued to go down hill from here and I was watching the timer and waiting for this movie to end in mid-story.	2.0	Defies much common sense	2014-05-23	1	1	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A23XSB13V3ITBT	Rad63	"I rented the DVD and will be buying a copy (from Amazon of course). The reviews suggested this could be a stinker, but as I am interested in aviation history and like watching airplanes I decided to view the movie. Parts of the story are a bit corny but the story of the training was quite good. Although much of the flying was special effects, it carried with it a feeling of accuracy. Some of the heroes die and as mentioned in the movie WWI flyers had a horrible life expectancy. Part of the reason was the fact that the planes were flimsy and parachutes by and large were not used. To those who complained that real airplanes were not used, you only have to follow aviation and note the number of ""warbirds"" flown by enthusiasts that have crashed with quite a few fatalities - even when flown by experts -- and these are much safer World War II and post-war planes. Making a movie like this is not worth endangering flyers' lives  - cgi is good enough for me -- I do not feel cheated. It was a long movie but did not feel long. Great Zeppelin and bomber scenes were good watching. I really enjoyed FLYBOYS."	5.0	Good movie particularly  for aircraft buffs	2007-02-01	8	5	3

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A135X149L7VXAD	Rafael F. Jones	"I went into this movie with very few expectations. I was looking to showcase a new Blu-ray player on my 60"" Sony XBR, and as I am a big fan of most military movies, I thought I'd give it a shot.Boy, I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere. The acting was incredibly poor across the board - I'm usually a fan of Jean Reno, but lets face it - he has his genre (Ronin as an example), and this is most definitely not it. The script seemed almost amateur at times, and throughout the whole film I found myself wishing I could find a way to attach myself to atleast one of the characters so as to better enjoy it... alas, no such luck. There seemed to be very little character development, and what little there was, felt rushed. The romance was poorly executed, and as beautiful as Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is, I'm afraid it couldn't save me from wishing that I were somewhere else throughout the whole film.The film's one saving grace was on the technical side. The transfer was very good to excellent, with crisp, bright colors, and deep blacks throughout, and the audio - while not great by any respect, certainly wasnt terrible either. Unfortunately, most of the CGI was right about what you'd expect from a B-grade movie, and it was readily aparent in some scenes that the planes were... well, not actually planes.In short, unless you are a die-hard aviation buff, and are willing to overlook the film's many faults, I would suggest passing on this one - it might make for a decent rental but little more."	2.0	Great transfer.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AYHFPZJF9RYWG	RAHUL	I like war movies and heroism et. al., so I may be a little biased; besides this is a real story and not entirely fiction. This is good entertainment. Fast paced action movie with all the right components; love, humor, good aerial fights in their planes (Cessna type aircraft). In-fact when I watch war movies where the focus is on the air-force, I prefer to watch the dog fights in older planes, because its easier to see the tactics used in these smaller planes when there were less gadgets and it was the man behind the machine that was clearly evident. 4 stars, no doubt.

This is the type of movie that I WISH I could rate 5 stars and give a wonderful recomendation but am unable to because of the amount of negative content in this film. The charicters and story touch your heart and you grow to love them as you see this film, however I have not purchased this film and CAN NOT recomend it because there is alot of negative content 1. Profanity is pretty rampent in this film. 2. Salaciousness is in there a bit when the main charicter gets hurt in a plane injury he wakes up in a prositution house- Luciane (The girl of the film) asks him to take off his pants, and at first he doesnt even seem to understand that its because hes hurt and she is trying to take care of him. 3. there is also a bit of violence in this film which I would have been able to overlook (As it is a war film) if not for the other negativity. 4. the last of my complaints are two scenes one where the pressure the so called Christian of the film to drink alcohol and he gives in and the second scene is when Cassidy dies and the general guy reads a letter he wrote 'in case of death' where he had said that he would want to be barried behind a 'whore house' if not for the Christian guys offendedness at this...so I think my review pretty much explains why I could never recomend this movie, I would like to see more movies with the touchingness of this one come out with out so much aweful content.	2.0	A Sad Disapointment	2012-12-11	0	0	0

After 4000 anti-war films in the post-Vietnam period, Flyboys reminds us of a less complicated time where manly honor and comraderie were coveted.  The enemy is the enemy and we are the good guys. There is no navel gazing when you shoot down the Red Baron, just a salute and a manly grimace.I am told that soon pilots are history as the next generation of Flyboys will be robot drones.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AOPQ0KA1B7BFD	Ray Gray	How can you go wrong with a new BD that costs $8. I've actually seen this at a local outlet for even less. If you have any type of HDTV, a 5.1/7.1 surround sound system, and a love of aviation, you'll enjoy the movie.  The transfer is exceptional and the surround sound depth puts your system through its paces.Historical accuracy aside concerning the planes, the movie is more about the people in the squadron than the flying. I generally like to watch a movie first, then watch the special features.  Not with this one.  Because it is based upon true events, watch the special features first, especially the section that details the history of the squadron and the people in the Lafayette Escadrilles.  Reviewers have mentioned that the characters are folks you don't care about.  You will care more if you watch the historical section first and learn about the true characters written into the film.Flyboys is definitely a library addition for anyone who collects military movies.	5.0	Great BD transfer and sound - entertaining movie too	2012-07-29	2	2	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1T41HM2YKN5HF	R. D. Hoag	I'll probably buy this when it comes to DVD. Excellent feeling of the times.. sets are terrific as are most of the costumes, etc. Flight scenes are not historically accurate, but lots of fun and really exciting.. However, things like multiple red German DR1 planes, plane markings that didn't exist for the Escadrille N124 Lafayette, impossible plane maneuvers, are disappointing... but only for WWI aviation fans. Acting was great, especially the French girl, and the French Captain Thenault (only member using his real name). Pilots were actually required to join the French Foreign Legion first, but it's another minor point for the story (stories). Several stories going on and I enjoyed them all. Reviewers fault he film for using many military clich&eacute;s, but WWI and that period was a war of clich&eacute;s and I feel it only reinforces the navet&eacute; of the times. The music is probably the only part that is too dramatic, too often, sort of like Star Wars, but it isn't that objectionable till close to the end and for most scenes it adds the right feeling. Even my wife enjoyed this movie and got caught up in it!	5.0	Lots of fun and excitement, not great, but good and a keeper	2006-09-23	4	2	2

By the way, I did like Pearl Harbor. It just took time getting used to, but not with FLYBOYS!!!The music, the story, the excitement, the scenery. This is a beautiful movie and I am so upset I never got to see this on the big screen. Please do not make the mistake I did and listen to the critics.

I didn't realize that I had seen this before, years ago, but was delighted with watching it again. Wow! This movie feels real and the HD made the visual and sound effects believable. There are only so many ways that one can staff a pilots&#8217; ready room, but if you liked Piece of Cake or Battle of Britain, you'll love this too, and find it very fresh and electric. The set reminded me of the Lafayette Escadrille exhibit at the Smithsonian's Air & Space Museum&#8212;which had suddenly come alive. The central fact of a pilots' ready room in a desperate situation is the tension produced by the knowledge that one is watching a revolving cast of men who must suck it up and go out there and do their job at the almost-certain peril of their life. As a former Marine and lover of history, I find this movie an apt monument to the flyboy contingent who participated in this most concentrated, grisly, meat-grinding war, which is well-documented.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A245SULJZNLHLD	richievee	I must have seen a different movie than the one lambasted so harshly on this site. I think FLYBOYS is excellent throughout, with nary a false step along the way. Okay, I'll grant that some of the aerial CGI is unconvincing, but the great majority of it adds exciting action - - and who really cares if a physicist might find fault? Staging is brilliant, treating us to plenty of period detail, and the story is taut, with lots of intriguing characters about whom I truly care. I do not find FLYBOYS excessively clich&eacute;d. Indeed, the screenwriters (Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward) quite often back off from easy stereotypes. If anything, the fine cast UNDERacts, which is a refreshing change from other films in this genre. Particular praise goes to James Franco as Blaine Rawlings, Jean Reno as a believable Captain Georges Thenault, and Jennifer Decker as a sweet French girl named Lucienne. The love bypath within this film demonstrates how sensitive the writers are to avoiding the typical Hollywood gimmick of throwing in a boy-girl relationship that eventually overpowers the essential plot line (PEARL HARBOR, TITANIC). Here, the characters of Blaine and Lucienne are treated honestly, with the respect they deserve, and not flung into the sack after knowing each other for five minutes. I'm sorry that this film was not successful at the box office, for director Tony Bill and his massive crew do a fabulous job of storytelling, and I am proud and unashamed to add it among my favorite war movies of all time. Please ignore the pseudo-intellectual posturing of the professional and amateur critics, and give FLYBOYS a chance. It is wonderful from beginning to end.	5.0	An Exhilarating Triumph	2014-04-30	0	0	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1UJCZ4CQQXOYI	"Rick ""Rick"""	This collector's edition is worth every penny. I enjoyed the movie as well as all the additional features such as the educational programs about the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, WWI combat aircraft, making of the aerial combat scenes and many more. I further enjoyed replaying the movie with the full length commentary by the director and the producer turned on. I found it fascinating.  The DVD set includes the Flyboys WWI combat simulator but requires a more powerful computer than I have so I wasn't able to try that. Combat flight simulator fans with a good gaming computer should enjoy it. It had enough human interest for my wife to enjoy it and certainly enough spectacular action for me.

As someone who is a WW1 history buff, plays flight sims, and has seen all the other WW1 fighter movies; I found Flyboys to be entertaining and mostly accurate in it's history.It annoys me to see so many people ignorant of the facts posting reviews about things that are supposedly unrealistic in the movie, when in fact they actually did happen or could have easily happened.I guess they just assume that many aspects of the movie must be impossible because they are so unusual or seemingly outlandish to the viewer, but that's simply the result of their misconceptions and preconceived ideas.	5.0	This film delivers.	2007-11-02	2	1	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	APRNS6DB68LLV	"Rob Slaven ""slavenrm@gmail. com"""	"I picked this movie for two reasons.  Firstly, I have always loved biplanes and biplane warfare and, as usual, this title looked sad and lonely on Amazon Instant Watch and in need of a review.  So here we are.The only really positive thing I can find to say about this movie is that it happens to be about a fascinating period of history.  If you think about it flying around in a rickety wooden plane is a pretty daring thing to do even if people aren't shooting at you.  That and the inevitable thoughts of Snoopy and his Snoopwith Camel make WWI aviation a very attractive topic.No, the problem comes in right about the time the movie starts.  If there's a standard war movie cliche line or shot that is laying about to be redone this movie redoes it.  Often.  And badly.  You've got the wistful French girl looking to the sky as planes fly overhead.  You've got the cockpit to cockpit waves goodbye as one pilot's plane goes down in flames.  Everything that you've seen in every war movie before, you see here again.  I guess you can look at this as a good retrospective of other cheesy war films if you really wanted to stretch it.Also, a note on special effects.  Considering when this movie was made, the CGI in this sucker are pretty abominable.  Leave aside for a moment the completely bogus dogfights with dozens of fliers in undisturbed tight formation while anti-aircraft fire belches into the sky around them.  Leave aside the numerical failure as 20 planes go out, 5 planes come back and somehow only 3 pilots were lost.  As if that was not enough, the whole thing is littered with those special effects that make you think, ""Hmm.  They put that in just so it would look 3D in the theatre version of the film.""  It's a lot of visual drama just for the sake of visual drama.In summary, totally unwatchable and beyond my ability to tolerate for more than an hour.  I had such high hopes but sadly every single one of them was utterly disappointed by this film.  Bah.---As always I endeavor to make my reviews as helpful as possible. If I've accomplished that goal then I'm very glad! If I haven't or if there's something else you think I should be telling you then don't hesitate to leave me a comment so I can do better with the next review."	2.0	An interesting bit of history that is often forgotten summed in up a really, really cliche movie	2014-03-04	18	11	7
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1I0MKOZ67K9Q8	rocketfuel	I hadn't heard of this movie until I went searching through the list of free rentals on Amazon Prime.  There are some great movies available as part of prime membership, but after the first few dozen obvious choices, it takes more digging to find them.  The free movies are still a great feature and makes the membership fee (going up to $100 this year) more like a bargain than a major decision, at least for me.  This movie has the sets and production value of a major Hollywood feature.  The story is based on true events and the movie does a good job of transporting the viewer to World War I France.  The place where it could have been improved is in the acting, particularly the lead character.  The loner with an attitude is actually hard to pull off, because the tough attitude can make it difficult for the audience to connect and to like the main character (think Waterworld, but not that bad).  It could just be me, since brooding is not my favorite character trait.  Overall, the movie has a lot to recommend it otherwise (and the lead character does have some redeeming value too).	4.0	SURPRISINGLY WELL MADE	2014-03-13	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2PS9X0XVQQ173	Schubertfan	"I thought the dozens of all-red Dr.I triplanes (except for the real, real bad German, whose triplane is black, naturlich!) were a good way to ruin the movie without adding in the other ridiculous elements noted by all the other reviewers who gave the film 1 star.  But for me, the piece de resistance was that single-seat biplanes could function as Vietnam-era helicopters, as our hero uses one to hop  into a farmer's field (at night) to rescue his love interest and the children.  I thought that was a great addition to our collective knowledge of World War I.You know what would have been great?  Since they already had the CGI servers working overtime to make what is essentially an elaborate cartoon, they could have put in some scenes where the American pilots have to parachute into Rome and fight their way to freedom as gladiators in the company of Russell Crowe, perhaps also battling German tribesman screaming ""Zulu!"" over and over again.  They could have picked up some more pretty actors during the escape and hijacked the capacious U-571 and sailed it to England, where they would all fight in the Battle of Britain before being transferred to Hawaii in time for the Japanese sneak attack, which would itself be foiled by the arrival of a US nuclear carrier via a time portal.That would have made the movie perfect.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1XIIYJE83K2VF	Sim Fan	"For starters, the plot of Flyboys is predictable from start to finish.  Hot-shot American pilot joins French Escadrille, defies French veterans, romances local girl, becomes hero.  Although the plot is completely unoriginal, the movie loses all credibility as soon as the action starts.There are plenty of reviews that tell how flawed this movie is from a historical perspective, so I won't get into that.The special effects that some reviewers called ""spectacular"" were cheap, tacky, unrealistic, and downright laughable.  The most glaring example is during dogfights when the aircraft guns are fired.  The smoke from the guns was shown traveling ahead of the aircraft, all the way to the enemy aircraft in fact.  Smoke coming out of an aircraft flying at any speed would dissipate immediately to the rear.  Even if there were tracer rounds back then (which there weren't), they wouldn't emit thick black smoke.Some storyline points were simply ridiculous.When one of the pilots crash lands, the hero lands his plane in crossfire of a trench battle on rocky, cratered ground littered with jagged pieces of metal to save him.  This is ridiculous by itself.  Then when he finds his buddy's hand trapped under the plane, he amputates it with one swing of a lightweight field shovel instead of simply lifting the plane off his hand (which he easily could have done with a cloth-covered aircraft).The hero repeatedly borrows his plane from the squadron to visit the local girl, without even a reprimand from the squadron commander.  In one scene, German soldiers occupy the house with the woman and the children inside.  At least one soldier is standing guard outside.  The hero lands his plane a couple of hundred yards away, walks to the house, and rescues them, undetected by the Germans.  Then when he starts his engine to leave, every head turns, alert to the engine sound.  But of course they're too late to catch him.In one scene, just after the squadron lands from a dogfight, the hero decides to take off again by himself.  Seconds later he is seen singlehandedly shooting up a line of German fighter planes, neatly parked in a row at an undefended airfield.I'm a small plane pilot, so I could go on about cloth-covered planes with 80-horsepower engines doing vertical climbs and jet-fighter maneuvers.  But sadly, the realism was much worse in other ways.This movie was so badly done, I started fast forwarding half way through."	1.0	Most poorly-produced film I've seen in a decade	2007-11-24	8	6	2

The characters were based off of real people. Why not make it about the real people? That and the Fokker DR1 triplane was overused. I don't know if Germany had that many planes in the entire war let alone one squadron. The movie is a gloss over of ww1 aviation which should be the main theme. A love story gets lost in here as well. I am an aviation freak so I bought this movie but I doubt a lot of others will.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	James Franco (most popular as Harry Osborn in the Spiderman movie series) carries this movie with his portrayal of Blaine Rawlings...a soft-spoken cowboy that can play rough when he needs to and fly a single engine WWI fighter like there's no tomorrow.Tony Bill somehow directed this could-have-been-a-TV-movie-or-mini-series onto the big screen for an approximate $13 million box office take. After DVD sales I suppose the $$$ intake will be better than TV so what the heck do I know.But the acting and story execution are such that you'd think it was made for TV. The action scenes are really fun, but questionably believable as the aces chat with each other over their flying machines in mid air and hoot and holler like they're in a rodeo.The ground scenes are mostly tough too watch. One ground battle scene is so outrageously unbelievable that the credibility meter flat-lines for a few minutes there at that point in the movie. And then there's the underlying love story that is so poorly done and unnecessary that cutting it completely would not have taken away one iota of the true story of a group of the first WWI fighter pilots.This could easily have been a 90-minute movie, but Hollywood for whatever reason has decided not to release a film under the 120 minute mark anymore. In Flyboys you'll find yourself hooting and hollering for more dogfight action as the ground scenes roll on.Overall...I didn't not like the movie. I was entertained. But, given a second chance, I'd wait to see this where it was meant to be: on TV (or cable).P.S.--Franco's character Rawlings should have had a Green Goblin painted on the side of his plane instead of his ranch insignia...now that would have been cool.	3.0	The Blazing Angels of WWI	2007-04-27	6	4	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A270QGGSS6I46A	"S. Moore ""south tacoma way"""	I purchased this dvd after finding it got a very limited release at the cinemas here in australia (one session a day at major cimemas in it's first week of release here is not what I would call a good sign) and failed to see it on the big screen.My first thought watching it was that this is the sort of movie that you need to see on the big screen. It is something that I still plan on doing. Despite it's very limited cinema release here, I know of a few old cinema venues around town that show movies months after their initial runs have ended. I plan on visiting one to see Flyboys to see it how it should be seen, on the big screen.That all said, the first big dogfight scene of the movie had me screaming in frustration. A few other reviewers have talked about the historical accuracy of the film being refreshing. My question to that is how do they explain then seeing a whole squadron (or the equivilent of the time) of Fokker Triplanes diving in to attack?? Knowing that only a few ever made it to the front, and the ones that did make it there, never lasted long in service due to a slight problem of wings breaking off in flight??!! Yes, I am being perdantic, and we are talking hollywood here I know. But to go to all the detail with the amazing looking CGI, I would have liked them to go with a little bit of research and realism as well.The whole 'Black Falcon' character is just an insult to the original red baron, especially the scene of where an american flyer is gunned down on the ground (this is not a world war II movie chaps). But this, along with the typical and banal love story, is what left a bitter taste in my mouth about this film. It just follows the cliche`s so terribly with the plot and story. No insight to the characters, no developed empathy for them and what they must have gone through. Pretty pictures and awe-inspiring dogfight sequences for sure, but no substance.I guess it was my mistake expecting something like the blue max and das boot, which this film surely isn't. Disappointing, and a shame. I'll be seeing 'letters from iwo jima' on sunday, wishing that 'flyboys' could have had the same emotional impact. Chances lost.	3.0	Disappointing and cliched`	2007-03-09	6	4	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1V6V9A8BXC98E	S. Okubo	I have to say that after watching Flyboys a few times, I am pretty impressed with it. I am a WWI and WW2 enthusiast, and Flyboys is better than most have said here. Sure, there are some historical mistakes, but overall, the movie is great. There are a lot of historically correct scenes that really make this movie great. Try to overlook all the Fokker triplanes (a historical mistake in the movie) and look at the whole story. The writers and directors really portrayed the time period well. The innocence of the time period, the pain, the joy. It was all good. Try to overlook some of the mistakes that were made by the writers and look at the whole story. A few historical mistakes... sure, but overall, a very accurate movie of WWI air warfare in my humble opinion. I was quite impressed with the movie. Maybe not quite a happy ending, but so is life...	5.0	Almost Historically Accurate.. Don't Pass Up	2008-01-29	0	0	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2LM8Z4RDGGKN6	Sonetto	"I purchased the video on a whim, didn't expect to love it, but I do.  I like James Franco, but I thought it would probably be a guy's movie.  However it really drew me in with the excellent music, wonderful flying sequences and interesting story lines.  Good acting!  The color and the particular shade of the blue Escadrille uniforms are/is (can't decide) very pleasing to the eye.  Of course, the truth is that I looked at the producer's and director's commentary first to find out how they did their flying and other tricks.  I like to know what those making the film tried to do and whether or not they feel they reached their goals.I don't know how many women will care for it, but I hope they'll try it because not only is action emphasized in the movie, but feelings as well.  The characters were developed using the feats and experiences of several members of the Escadrille.  It is entertainment, yet everyone connected with the movie has taken care to be as historically accurate as possible.  Some reviewers have referred to the number of cliches in the film, but are events cliches if they have a basis in fact?  If ""cliche"" facts are not included, does that not take us even further from the truth?"	4.0	Didn't expect to love it, but I do	2007-10-14	1	1	0

The time is World War One and  young American volunteers who just want to learn to fly ... travel the well worn path from naive..to... grizzled war veterans or a grave. Naturally, there is a love story to help divert attention from the grizzly reality of the day to day death these young men face in War. &#34;War is Hell&#34; and this depiction does not try to dispel that famous quote from Civil War General Sherman.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3CWJQA3STCCDA	Stephen	"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A303AOOHDU1VZ2	Stephen Smith	This is a lavish, big-budget look at the LaFayette Escadrille - the American fighter pilots who volunteered for France before their country entered World War One. The locales, the sets, the costumes, the equipment, and, of course, the airplanes - what a pageant! There is an engaging mix of characters: the down-on-his-luck cowboy, the expatriate black prizefighter, the spoiled Harvard drop-out, the Bible-thumper, the wet-behind-the-ears youngster, the suspected spy, the cynical veteran ace, the French farmgirl, and the cruel and unscrupulous Black Falcon. The two young romantic leads are attractive enough, but let's face it - the real reason for seeing this movie is provided by the dogfights. And director Tony Bill does not disappoint: the sequences of aerial combat are as thrilling as any military action ever recreated on film. They are easy to follow because all the planes have very visible personal insigniae clearly identifying who's who. The only negative I have to say is that the musical soundtrack sounds like a rip-off of the Mel Gibson film The Patriot.	4.0	Exciting aerial sequences	2006-09-23	5	3	2

First off, the special effects, out of this world, it really does put you in the cockpit and you really feel what these pilots must have felt, that is it real, not some Top Gun kind of feeling like it's some video game but the real deal. Also, the storyline with James Franco and that French woman was done VERY well, I figured going in that that part would be a really sappy and corny, just a way to fill the in between plane fighting scenes but I really enjoyed those scenes, they were funny and very emotional. The interaction between the pilots and their own storylines was also very well written and exectued.

( One with honor, one without.)Only viewed as they went about their business of killing.This, I really appreciated.I used to work on biplanes and I really enjoyed all of the flying scenes.I never saw a plane do what it couldn't.And the decision to make each flying scene show that the Americans had learned more about how to survive a dogfight was a great touch, something i have never seen in a war movie before.The plot plan to aim the final fight between the young american and the seasoned german ace-hole was very well done.The cgi was, in my opinion, just fine. I watched the movie again with the commentary on and was surprised at many of the revelations about what was real and what wasn't.I do disagree with everyone in Hollywood who thinks that a war movie needs a love story to be successful.I don't care if the box office agrees with them.This is definitely the best WW1 war flick of this century.(Remember, I remember the last century.)"	4.0	expect less, enjoy more	2007-02-13	9	7	2

The movie springs from the true story of young Americans volunteering in the French Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps who wanted to fly and fight during the war years of 1914-1917 and before America entered the full fighting in 1918.  A lot of the true story was stretched to make a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  The French Nieuports planes and German Fokkers planes were colorful and interesting and the aerial dog fights and huge Zeppelin airships battles were great.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a war film with additional details on the pilots and others and their personal lives.  Great color and sound and scenery throughout.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A5VI7CEAK4CO	"T Curtis ""MrSquirreL"""	"Impressive is the realistic romance that was portrayed for that time in history with our hero the cowboy (James Franco) and the french girl (Jennifer Decker).  This reminded me of a book i read by Vera Brittain the ""Testament of Youth"" of how innocent and cavalier this generation was at that time. Her most intimate memory of a man she loved was the warmth of his hand she felt through her gloved hand was similar to the courtship in this movie.  For the sake of being a pilot and doing flight simulation with aircraft i'll never get to fly this is a time period movie i enjoyed as much since the film ""The Blue Max"" for the romance of flying has been a real treat to see the souls that pioneered in the Great War with aircraft that are agile as a ballerina but fragile as a butterfly when handled.  This being maneovers that involve piroettes because of the slower speeds compared to jets that generally use a 5 mile turning radius. Jet fighters that are built to handle at least 10 times the weight in horizontal or vertical turns the World War I fighter could easily rip apart it's canvas fabric or wooden structure is shown in the flying sequences. The french Nieuport is very pleasing to the eye as the fine figure for a woman.  The vertical tail looks as if the french flag was hung off the end with the corners edges rounded off just as also the german Fokker's horizontal tail is shaped like a falcon's is a treasure trove to visualize in this film. I greatly appreciation that the director took to explain and portray these men and flying machines during this era how they were both utilized. It is my regret that not many people saw this film in the theater to care and understand the spirit of adventure that parallels or own lives."	5.0	testament of youth	2007-03-08	5	3	2

This movie did not disappoint.  After seeing the trailer commercials for this movie, it definitely was on my ""must have"" list for home DVD's.  Not only am I satisfied that I purchased it for my home collection, I have also gifted it to a friend and a relative.  This movie has a cast of fairly unknown actors and does a fine job of recreating what squadron life must have been for Americans and non French citizens in WWI in the Lafayette Esquadrille.  The battle scenes are what most people are interested in that buy a movie of this type for and this movie does deliver with thrilling battle sequences.  Although there is a love interest with innocent romance in this film, it never gets in the way of the action.  The battle scene with the French Neuports battling the German Dirigible, escorted by German DRI fighters is riveting.  One of the veteran German fighter pilots is a real villain, but he finally gets what's coming to him in the end."	5.0	Flyboys	2007-03-15	6	4	2

I can never guess who gets it in horror movies, I've never won at Clue/Cluedo and I never find out who the bad guy is in spy movies until the very end.  All that being said, I knew after the first 30 minutes who was toast, who would be redeemed and the fates of every.single.character.  This is more than an issue of historical accuracy - rather, the were portrayed in such a way, that we knew there was no/all hope.  That's pretty tragic.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A25QJBK33C4O0R	"terpfan1980 ""Barry"""	Many people complaining about this film complain about either the CGI effects and apparent over-use or just plain horrible (in the minds of those reviewers) effects, or they complain about the fact that the film is riddled with one cliche after another. I would say the film is guilty as charged in those areas, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun movie to watch and enjoy.I love the early years of aviation, the old style dog fighting in bi-planes and the like, so I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to go see Flyboys on the big screen.  While not the greatest film, it was worth the price of admission and was filled with enough aircraft acrobatics to be great fun.Thankfully this disc comes with some interesting extras in the special features that help raise the value when considering a purchase.  Personal recommendation, watch for sales on this title and get a copy of this film at a bargain price.  While I find it fun and worth owning in my library, the MSRP is a bit on the higher side for this title, so you may wish to wait for a nice sale to grab your copy.	4.0	Cliche ridden? Yes.

This movie, Flyboys, was about perfect for our Saturday Night Viewing needs. The story line was very simple, there was a sweet little tragic love story easily comprehended by a 9 year old, and some walloping good special effects of bi-planes flying and shooting each other. The effects are what one should watch this movie for, as they are able to induce suspended disbelief in even the most jaded viewer. One is left with a sense of respect for the men who did fly these planes back when there were no parachutes. In fact, the Prince evinced renewed interest in his great grandfather who few a biplane in WWI for the British. So it wasn't a waste of time at all.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3991RUZ8ZCRZF	Thoche	I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the depiction of flight, dog fights and &#34;realism&#34;.  I put realism in quotes because I am not really sure how scientifically or historically realistic it was.  Even if they were able to talk to or read journals from people who were actually in this squadron. the &#34;realism&#34; could be clouded memories or interpretations from  sensationalized writings.  No matter, I want to believe it was realistic.  Little things like when they take off as a squadron they jump in their planes and all take off across a field  together, no formation flying, and their options if their plane was disabled going down and they were still alive - parachutes had not been invented.What I enjoyed so much were the flying sequences.  Amazing CGI mixed with the personal aspects of facial expressions shared between the pilots both friends and enemies.  Even though I did notice some things that defied structural mechanics and the physics of flight, I chocked it up to entertainment and gave them license to play with the natural laws.And yes there was a decent plot, heros, hazing, a little romance with a damsel and children in distress and a pet lion(?).Overall an enjoyable movie that I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a &#34;Star-Wars&#34; type of movie - good and evil fighting in 3 dimensional space with the aid of CGI - loosely based on history of how flying machines were brought into warfare.	5.0	Awesome visual experience!	2014-04-13	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2Q13PHEXGR48Q	T O'Brien	"Flyboys didn't last long in theaters upon its release, but don't let that scare you away, it's an above average WWI period drama.  During World War I, a group of American pilots joined the fighting in Europe before the United States entered the war in 1918.  Flying for the French, they were named the Lafayette Escadrille.  The movie follows five or six freshly arrived pilots, most notably James Franco as Texan Blaine Rawlings, as they train and learn how to fly and ultimately join the war as they take on German fighters, most notably the Black Falcon, a German pilot who doesn't follow the ""rules of war.""  All in all, this was a pretty good movie.  It's by no means a great movie, but it kept me entertained for the full 140 minute running time.  The added love story isn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but the movie didn't need that storyline.  It would have been better if the storyline focused primarily on the pilots and the dogfights, which are the high points of the movie.  Go see this movie for the dogfights, especially the zeppelin attack on Paris and the final showdown between Rawlings and the Black Falcon!One of the complaints of the movie was that it is too cliched, and this is partly true, but for me it felt like the actors did the best they could with what they have.  James Franco gets top billing as Texan Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher who joins the war after his ranch went under.  Along with flying with the Escadrille, he falls in love with a French girl, Lucien (French beauty Jennifer Decker), who can't speak English.  My favorite character is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), the veteran pilot who slowly opens up to the new pilots.  The rest of the young pilots who arrive with Rawlings include Phillip Winchester as William Jensen, the golden boy who knows he'll become a hero, Tyler Labine as Briggs Lowry, a young man from a rich family who is trying to prove himself to his father, Abdul Salis as Eugene Skinner, the lone African-American pilot in the group who must prove himself while also dealing with some racism, and David Ellison as Eddie Beagle, the struggling pilot who may or may not have a suspicious background.  Jean Reno is excellent in a small part as the captain of the squadron, Capt. Thenault, but it's too bad he couldn't have been used more.The soon to be released two-disc DVD, Jan. 30, 2007, will offer a boatload of special features which I'm definitely looking forward to watching.  There will be several making of featurettes, some history about the real Lafayette Escadrille, an audio commentary with director Tony Bill and producer Dean Devlin, deleted scenes, trailers, and a Flyboys Squadron DVD-rom game.  So for a movie with some excellent dogfights and aerial sequences, a pretty good ensemble cast, and a not so bad love story, look for the two-disc DVD of Flyboys in January!"	4.0	Pretty good WWI aerial drama	2006-12-26	59	52	7
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2CNLG7P0C42FU	Todd C. Burnette	"Eugene Bullard, the black flying ace, was not the first black air mail carrier.  He was the grandson of a slave and left his native Columbus, Georgia when he was only eight years old.  He made his way to France and made his way doing odd jobs.  Gene eventually became a boxer and was one France's finest before joining the Lafayette Escradrille.  He had a storied success with the French Foreign Legion before becomming a pilot.  Gene was decorated heavily for his bravery with the Legion and during and after WWI.  He later married and had three children ( one son did not survive ).  Gene was heavily involved with the French Resistance during the WWII and received many accolades from his adopted country.  When he and his two daughters returned to the U.S., he found work as a elevator operator ( not a airmail carrier ).  The U.S. refused to even allow him to fly with them during WWI.  When Gen. DeGaulle made a state visit to New York in the 1950s, Gene went to his hotel.  DeGaulle personally came downstairs to pay a visit to his old friend.  Over fifteen medals and certificates were given to this man ( from France ).

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3H1CE8T6GDVWV	Tool Connoisseur	How is it that Hollywood can take a naturally exciting real-life story, and ruin it?  Such it is with Flyboys.  Young American fighter pilots learning to fly and fighting for France in WWI before America joined the war - stuff of legends and a bottomless pit of real-life action adventure.  All you have to do is tell the story with some reasonable acting, fly a few dogfights and a movie practically makes itself, right?  After all, the movie is based on truth (inspired by...). But Hollywood has to push the Mission Implausible limits and add their own twists to the story that turn the average viewer with a brain into a head-shaking critic of their check on the realms of reality.  The only thing unpredictable about this movie was the extent of implausibility they sometimes went to.Case in point - and take note this is a spoiler for one chapter of the story but this sums up the comic-book nature they pushed with this movie:  A pilot gets shot down and crash-lands in the rugged and inhospitable small strip of no-man's land between the French and German sides who are actively shooting at each other.  The hero of the story flies down low to check out his wingman (somehow avoiding getting shot down by the German ground troops himself).  He sees the plane has flipped over and that his friend is trapped underneath.  Next thing you know, the hero has landed his own plane (somewhere?) and is running between the flying bullets to rescue his wingman.  Turns out the wingman's hand is trapped under the trailing edge of his plane's wing.  The suspended reality keeps getting deeper as the intrepid rescuer (even with the help of a heroic French soldier) can not move the fragile aircraft (the tail of which one could easily lift with one hand - trust me I know).  The hero, amid a hail of bullets, finds a trenching shovel and instead of breaking the fragile wood and fabric wing trapping his wingman's hand, he - well, you can probably guess the amazing bit of surgery he performs...  So you get the idea.To be fair, if that kind of reality suspension doesn't bother you in a movie that is not meant to be likened to The Matrix, then you might enjoy it.  The flight physics of the dogfights is actually depicted rather well (considering it's done by Hollywood) though it goes far beyond the performance capability of the planes at the time.  There is not much real flying going on and the use of computer generated graphics is rather evident.  I am an experienced fighter pilot and somewhat enjoyed the dogfights.  Too bad they couldn't follow history enough to use the correct planes for the timeframe of the war but that's typical for Hollywood (and allows you to keep track of the good guys and bad guys more easily).  The acting is not stellar but carries the story OK.  The required French-girl love interest is attractive and believable.This movie could have done quite well if only they had put a check on their typical Hollywood push to go over the edge in action and suspense, thereby losing credibility and the viewer in the process.	3.0	Disappointing Suspension of Reality	2007-03-20	10	8	2

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	Before the United States entered World War I, young Americans went to France to be fighter pilots, joining the Lafayette Escadrille. This fictional version follows a laconic Texas rancher, an eager Nebraska kid, a Black boxer already in France, and a New York swell, as they arrive green for training, get their baptism by fire when German planes ambush them on their first mission, and graduate to heroics. Rawlings, the Texan, falls in love with a young woman he meets at a bordello. Keeping their eyes on them are Captain Thenault and Cassidy, the resident ace, who keeps a pet lion. This is a great movie. The flight scene special effects were difficult to impossible to distinguish from the actual flying. The aerial combat was exciting, tense, and realistic with the attack on the zeppelin being the best scene of the movie. This movie does not shy away from the ugly aspects of combat. Very entertaining. I recommend it. A fun movie with good historical point.	5.0	Flyboys (Full Screen Edition)	2010-02-07	2	1	1
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"Flyboys is rather a disappointment even if you're not expecting much. The Lafayette Escadrille - a French squadron of American pilots who fought in the First World War before the USA entered the conflict - is a great subject for a film, but somehow keeps on falling short. William Wellman's semi-autobiographical Lafayette Escadrille was so brutally re-edited by the studio that he never made another film, yet Tony Bill's film feels like it could have done with a firmer hand somewhere down the line. Rather than a gritty, brutally realistic war movie it harks back to silent cinema and WW2 flagwavers, concentrating on often-cartoonish heroics by one-dimensional characters unmemorably played by a bland cast. With a charismatic star in the lead this might not have been an insurmountable problem, but with only Jean Reno as their commander providing any star quality the film is often as flat as the ill-advised digital photography that makes much of the film look like a Turner TV movie at times. Even on the small screen its lack of detail, depth and limited colour range are distractingly problematic. It doesn't make particularly good use of its 138-minute running time and there's surprisingly little sense of time or place either. The characters' attitudes are often more late than early-20th century while its attitude to accuracy is schizophrenic: it gets a lot of pertinent small details right while larger ones slip by unchecked if they look cool enough (if the film is to be believed, the German air force consisted almost entirely of red triplanes).As vanity projects go (the film was allegedly largely financed by co-star David Ellison's billionaire father), it's certainly not as disastrous as Gunbus/Sky Bandits, but like that forgotten box-office fiasco it suffers from trying to make an old-fashioned gung ho adventure set in the one war in which such comic book heroics have never seemed at home. Using the industrial killing fields of the first modern war as a backdrop for an action movie seems almost like setting The Great Escape in Auschwitz. But even ignoring that, it fails to work on its own terms as a simple adventure story. There's far too much unconvincing melodrama, be it James Franco carrying out an unlikely rescue of a pilot crashed in No Man's Land or an even more unlikely rescue of his sweetheart and her siblings from behind German lines. However, even these cannot prepare you for the absurdity of the way he finally takes on the dastardly homicidal Hun in the underwhelming finale: all that's missing is Franco saying ""Sayonara, sucker!"" It's not that such things couldn't or didn't happen as that the film fails to sell them in a more cynical age.But the biggest problem is the aerial scenes, primarily dependent on Cgi. You may not always be able to see the joins, but it's often curiously unconvincing as weightless planes defy the laws of aerodynamics for a cool shot, with the mayhem often cut short because computer-rendering time is so expensive. The camera may be able to get right in the thick of the action, but you never once feel like you're flying with the characters and it's never as impressive as the kind of footage the likes of Skeets Kelly and Johnny Jordan were able to get in the The Blue Max and Aces High, let alone earlier classics like Wings and The Dawn Patrol. And there's the problem that when you know it's just pixels rather than real people in real planes, all sense of danger and peril is gone. CGI may be easier and safer, but who says it SHOULD be easier? The choreography of the dogfights isn't that impressive either - for the first half of the film adequate seems to be the aim, with only a sequence where the pilots take on German planes strafing refugee columns really catching fire and living up to its potential. Even an attack on a Zeppelin seems more okay than inspired. Certainly there's nothing in the film to compare to the dazzling but brief Hell's Angels scenes in The Aviator. Adding to the general lack of inspiration is Trevor Rabin's score, which wears the film's temp track proudly on its sleeve - parts of it follow The Patriot so closely that you wonder why they didn't just give John Williams a screen credit of his own.It's watchable enough if you're in an undemanding mood, and Jennifer Decker makes an appealing leading lady, but it's hard to shake the feeling that the material would have worked better as a weekly TV series - though, if it were anything like this film, one that would probably be cancelled after a handful of episodes."	2.0	Distinctly Earthbound	2009-01-21	1	1	0

After watching the extras and listening to the producers/director addressing the historical debate, I felt better. They freely admit that they took artistic licence with certain things for the sake of entertainment, which is fair enough. Unlike the makers of The Red Baron, whose producer/director claim with amazing straigh-faces that their movie is historically accurate, which is totally false.The flight scenes from Flyboys were great, the characters were enjoyable and the aircraft were a joy to see in action. Once you get over the fact that the Germans are all flying red  Fokker triplanes, except of course, the EEEEEEVIL German, who naturally flies a black one, the combat scenes are worth the cost of the dvd alone. There is some genuine comedy in the movie, you can empathise with the characters and the photography was first rate.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"In ""Flyboys"" we enter the world of brave, daring fighter pilots during World War I. It is based on real events, namely ""the Lafayette Escadrille,"" the squadron formed largely by American volunteers who joined in the French Air Service before America entered the war. This is an intriguing episode that should be remembered, and ""Flyboys"" lives up to our expectations as far as its great aerial sequences are concerned.James Franco (""Spider-Man"") appears as Blaine Rawlings, Texan rancher who becomes one of the American volunteers after seeing a news reel in theater (and punching a banker off-screen). It's not a bad start, but still his character could have been more three dimensional with a better script and direction. Actually, he and other members of the Lafayette Escadrill are not given many chances to shine, especially on the ground.In fact, the back stories of the volunteers sometimes look clich&eacute;d and Blaine's sub-plot involving a French farm girl drags a bit. Jean Reno plays a French captain who has to train the new recruits patiently, but like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" somehow the director missed the opportunity to use Reno's unique persona effectively.Still, all these flaws would be forgotten once the film starts showing the dogfights, which, I think, are mostly done with CGIs, but still impressive and thrilling. The great flying sequences would bring us back to the day of good, old-fashioned action films."	3.0	Watch for the Thrills of Great Flying Sequences	2007-11-29	5	3	2

Not all German planes were red, not all German planes were Fokker Triplanes (only around 300 made) they had a short run because of manufacturing problems, wings would come apart in a dive. The real airplanes of that time could not do half of the aerobatics that they show in the movie, they also would self destruct from G forces. They were mainly wood and fabric. They had 2 lions (whiskey & soda) not just one. There was a black pilot, but he came in late in the war and only had 1 and possibly 2 confirmed kills. I am now waiting for the new movie ""The Red Baron"" that was made in Germany and will be released on May 10th in Europe. It at least looks very accurate compared to the garbage that they put into The Flyboys. The movie is fair, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it if I new of all the historical mistakes in it. The producers even state they changed a lot of facts so that the average person would find it entertaining and not get confused at who was the bad guys.

The film's action aerial shots are amazing. The authenticity of the WWI planes, gunfire, and interplay between pilots is beautifully captured.  Howard Hughes would have been impressed. Unfortunately the lead, James Franco gives a wooden performance as the squadron leader. The supporting cast of pilots all give credible performances, but the film doesn't gain acclaimed status because of the acting.  I never felt emotionally connected to the lead characters and the romantic storyline did nothing to enhance the drama the director so desperately wanted to achieve.  The most immprobable scene involves Franco's rescue of his French girlfriend. While a dozen or so German troops invade the girl's home, she slips away and hides nearby; that is believable.  What is preposterous is when Franco flies his plane to a nearby field without any of the German soldiers seeing or hearing it.  Of course Franco and the French girl escape under a hail of German gunfire.  The characterizations of the other pilots are well crafted.  The Black pilot who at first is not readily welcomed, the rich, cultured pilot who is seeking his father's approval, the religious pilot who accepts his duty, the unemotional ace, the suspected ""spy"", and the small town hero who doubts his courage all contribute to the on screen cammaraderie.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"Flyboys is the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, an elite group of flyers during WWI that US citizens were allowed to join before America had formally entered the war. Much like the French Foreign Legion, it was made up of men who, for the most part, were running away from something or were out for adventure. One man in particular from Texas, Blaine Rawlings - played engagingly by James Franco (James Dean, Spiderman) - is particularly laid back about the whole affair, until he finds himself in his first dogfight. Then reality sets in and he realizes why the average life expectancy for these flyers is three to six weeks.Director Tony Bill (The Sting - producer) gives his film a traditional epic look with gorgeous cinematography, sweeping locations and authentic details, while also using CGI technology to good effect in the flying sequences. This film far surpasses The Aviator, which did little more than prepare the way for this more masterful handling of early military aviation and the dogfight sequences in particular. There are also some exciting rescue missions that have us on the edge of our seats, as well as the downing of a zeppelin that has set out to bomb Paris.Besides the action in the air and on the ground, there is a sweet love story between Franco's character, Rawlings, and a French country girl named Laura, played winsomely by Ruth Bradley. There are also some well-developed character studies among the rest of the pilots:  a black boxer-turned-pilot, played by Abdul Salis; a Bible-reading Christian, played by Michael Jibson, who sings ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" as he goes in for a kill; a suspected spy, played by David Ellison; etc. Jean Reno does a terrific job as Captain Thenault, their instructor and commanding officer, as does Tyler Labine as head flyer Briggs, who keeps a lion as a pet.If there were one word I would use to describe the story and relationships in this film it would be ""grace."" There are a lot of screw-ups along the way, but there always seems to be an attitude of grace among the participants. This brings the men together as a family, and gives the film a very godly quality. WWI fighter pilots had a harrowing job to do. If their planes caught fire, they had only three options:  burn to death, jump and hope for the best (there were no parachutes) or kill themselves with a pistol. So, they were heroes of the first order. Giving the story plenty of grace helps to make it human and raise it above the typical action-adventure film.Though the film is rated PG-13 for war violence, it is handled with surprising good taste, and there is also a refreshing absence of sex and profanity, though there is a small amount of the latter. The DVD is almost absent of extra features, which is a shame. People who like reality, history, aviation and a good story will like this film. Those who want to escape reality into an artificial world of sensory overload, won't.Waitsel Smith"	5.0	TOP-NOTCH FILM, FULL OF ACTION AND GRACE	2007-03-17	7	5	2

The characters all tend to be stereotypes, but that doesn't detract too much. The limited sequences with real aircraft mainly serve to highlight the lack of realism in the CGI flying sequences. But then film makers have yet to produce realistic flying sequences with CGI. I'm just about convinced it can't be done.Take any movie with CGI air combat sequences and compare those sequences to ones in movies like ""The Battle of Britain"" and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and you'll realize just how pitiful CGI truly is. And CGI explosions (of anything) pale in comparison to movies where they really blow stuff up.As an ex-AF pilot and military aviation historian (who has also written a WW I historical novel about air combat, 'Once a Knight'), I can't help but cringe whenever I watch CGI aircraft scenes. This movie was no exception.Despite all of that, I did enjoy the movie. Overall, it was fun, and that's what movies are all about in the end.One caution: I bought this DVD without noticing that there are two versions -- a 1-disc and a 2-disc.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1E07LRME4MYDI	William Miller	Great flying scenes, tough war flick. WWI was so costly on human life, very personal and up close.  This film highlights that story in regards to flying.	4.0	Good war flick.	2014-03-29	0	0	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1HH53MJ15KATM	"William M. Klepper ""BK"""	Take a peek into the American men who went to France to become pilots and fight the German bid for world domination.  We follow one man, how he became an Ace, the man who helped him, and the leadership style used to motivate men to face death everyday from various means.  Of particular note is why each pilot was given a hammer and a pistol.  Both were to be used in a crisis moment and the movie explains how.I think this movie showed me how ordinary people became extraordinary people, not once, but several times over.  For that alone, I would recommend this movie  The beautiful aerial footage was awe inspiring, as if I were there to experience the first thrill of flying and the joy and peace it brings.  But, of course there is a war to fight, but in a Zen-like way, there is a harsh beauty in that too. If, by the time two crashed pilots are saved in a French whore house hasn't touched your heart, I give up.  You can't be reached.	5.0	No Guts, no glory	2014-04-18	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A25QAXF2KO32UM	WOODCARVER	I liked this movie not only because it delves into the lives of the characters rather than just showing them in war scenes and it showed a lot of scenes of biplanes and some triplanes in action during dog fights and how very fragile they were.	3.0	A somber statement of war.	2014-03-09	1	0	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2PZ78CXBAERZG	"Working Nights ""Working Dude"""	WWI action adventure. WWI never has gotten the attention it deserves. Based on a true story of American young men that set out for adventure in the new flying machines. Flying for the French Air Corp, the story soon turns to death defying and daring acts of bravery, a little romance is thrown in for good measure.. A very good story, with a very good cast of characters. Definitely worth watching.	4.0	An Entertaining History Buff's Movie	2014-04-02	0	0	0
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A2SDDZBGHJ9GH1	"Wray Rives ""Wray Rives, CPA CGMA"""	I enjoyed the movie. It is fairly quick paced.  Spoiler alert 1/2 the squadron get's killed in the first air battle, I don't know enough about WWI to know if that is realistic, but it gives you fewer characters to keep up with.	4.0	Enjoyable movie	2014-05-29	1	0	1

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A1DOEL69Z9KQTV	"Wynand Meyering ""reader"""	When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype.	1.0	Terrible - I walked out of this movie	2007-03-16	16	8	8

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A4YGJ2O899ACR	"Yellow 22 ""bob"""	I really enjoyed this movie, a true to life story. It's about a subject this generation knows little about...WW1. the film flowed and was very entertaining. the story line was true and not so over the top, as some movies go. It's a great movie to watch on the weekend, when the weather is bad and your staying home. You really can't go wrong with this movie in your collection. trust me, you will enjoy it...women will like it's story line also...it's not just about guys fighting in the sky.	4.0	good flick for all	2007-03-08	1	0	1
B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	AFCWXFKAV8GOL	Yogi C	Nostalgic story line, particularly because it's based on a true story!  Never boring and it's full of adventure and action.

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A3TROFT4NEU94C	Yooper	We liked the story and the cast, although a bit stereotypical and predictable. Photography of the French countryside was excellent. Special flying effects were not very well done. Lacked realism and tended toward the cartoonish, showing a poor understanding of the principles of flight. That's why I give it a 3 star rating. However, the actual airplanes used were gorgeous and the real flight shots superb. My wife would give it a 4 star rating. All of that said, was it worth the two hour plus investment of an evening? You bet.	3.0	3 star rated by pilot, 4 star by wife!	2014-04-02	0	0	0

B000KX0HIC	Flyboys [Blu-ray]	A28904UY7TKDRC	"Zgore ""zgore"""	Very good MOVIE. What I mean by that, is this is a very good throwback to what movies should be for this genre. Great visual effects and story.Is it 'old-fashioned' as some say, yes, but that is my point. Good versus bad, simple, heroic, and not ambiguous. I see it as a modern take on John Wayne's 'Flying Tigers!&#34;.If you like the genre, see it. If you like MASH, not for you!	4.0	Very good and solid MOVIE!	2014-03-30	0	0	0
