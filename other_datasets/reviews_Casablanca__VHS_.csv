I was very impressed by the restoration of this movie and the movie its self.  It's a very enjoyable movie to watch.  The special features were not too bad as well.  I think that anyone could sit down with a beer or a bag of popcorn or both and not walk away disappointed after watching Casablanca.	5.0	Beer or bag of popcorn or both...	2007-07-23	0	0	0

As long time fan of Casablanca with several versions of it in B&W; I always wanted to see the colorized version.  The movie was a new experience- not better or worse- just different in perspectiveI don't know if Color would have been used originally if affordable or common place - and am sure filming in B&W; would require some changes in camera use than Color.  I do know the story did not change nor did the quality of actors and for a new experience I enjoyed the Colorized version even on VHS	5.0	Fun and interesting watch	2013-10-09	0	0	0

Yes this is worth the upgrade just to see how classic B&W; films CAN look at home on your system. It is in mono and it is square and if that's a problem; you got a problem. The Day the Earth Stood Still BD and this in the same week. I'm feeling good about Blu-Ray.I have issues with the packaging, The lattice case should have been on heaver stock and the box holding the 'uninteresting passport & luggage tag' makes the whole thing twice its size! An irritating waste of space; but I have a solution. I'm going to shrink wrap some sand, label it 'Exclusive Moroccan Sand' and slide it into the offending box! Cigarette butts were suggested. There is a nice coffee table book & lobby cards inside; and the discs have lots of extras.24 hrs. and the lattice die cut Casablanca cover is already falling apart. Now it's an 'arts & craft' project; thank you. Warners' art department has been taken over by turnips from outer space.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AJAF1T6Q7XM94	A Customer	My favorite moment in Casablanca, and in a sense the moment that really gives meaning to the rest of the movie, is when the activist rouses the people in Rick's cafe to resist the Germans.  It's done very simply.  The  Germans in Rick's are singing.  The activist, the hero, inspires the rest  of the crowd to drown the Germans out with a rousing French national  anthem.  So we see how powerful he is, and why people must make sacrifices  on his behalf.  It's a pleasure to hear the German song drowned out by an  anthem of freedom.  Needless to say, Bogie is great in this movie, not just  another tough guy.  We've heard that alternate endings were shot, but there  can be no other ending.	5.0	A classic movie that fully deserves its reputation	2000-02-08	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The story is set in Casablanca after the fall of France. Refugees crowd the city, waiting to flee abroad. Rick, an American expatriate, runs a caf&eacute; (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a caf&eacute;? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing ""Wacht am Rhein"", a 19th century nationalist song. ""Watch on the Rhine"" was a stage play and a later film.Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilsa leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilsa?The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilsa's marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than ""Citizen Kane"" and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. 'Force majeure' trumps a piece of paper.[The book ""Round Up the Usual Suspects"" tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment.]"	4.0	Marshmallow Melodrama	2004-11-15	9	2	7
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	One of the most famous movies of all time, and one of the best, Casablanca is set during WWII, in neutral Morocco. Its action centers around Rick, a no-nonsense nightclub manager who was once attracted to Ilsa. When she reenters his life and requests his help, he must confront his &quot;I stick out my neck for nobody&quot; mentality and step up. Many famous phrases and scenes abound, this movie is written perfectly, its pacing, plot and humor (yes) should serve as an example to aspiring screenwriters. There should be a copy in every household, its effects on popular culture are far-reaching and long-lasting, and it is an unforgettable lesson on morals and self-discovery.

Curtiz's direction is flawless. The story is great. Max Steiner's score is great. There is almost nothing bad that can be said about this film.

This contains a documentary 'You Must Remember This' hosted by Lauren Bacall.

Pristine transfer of a restored black&white; film.  The film itself is a classic, as is ""Carrotblanca"" the LoonyToons send up with Bugs, Sylvester, Daffy and the rest of the animated crowd.Best of the extras are the Lauren Bacall narrated tribute and the backstory on how the movie was made. The TV version is an example of how to screw up something good (loved the GE steam iron ad, though).  The audio clips were a bit disappointing.I assume Warner has or will have this out in Blu-Ray; would be interesting to compare the two.  I imagine a good upscaling DVD player would make the regular DVD look better, but why settle for second rate, and mess with two DVDs instead of one, HD-DVD.A must have for any serious motion picture collection."	5.0	Casablanca - A Timeless Gem	2008-01-08	4	4	0

Armes	this is considered and regarded by many critics as the greatest movie of all time.i definitely consider it to be one of the greatest anyway. there are a few others i personally consider to be on the same level of greatness.Casablanca is, however, a legend. a classic romance story that has never been quite equaled. to disclose any of the plot for those of you who may not have seen it would be unjust and unfair at the least. i never liked stories of romance. i suppose most men don't, but when i decided to view this one, i was very intrigued and engrossed with the film. it is definitely one the very few love stories i ever developed any respect for. if you decide to purchase this one you won't feel cheated.as for the DVD, it's a great buy. it has the trailer, production notes, an introduction by Lauren Bacall and the excellent documentary on the making of the film hosted by Lauren Bacall. all those still living that were associated with the production of &quot;Casablanca&quot; were interviewed in it. all avid collectors of the classics must have this one in his or her DVD library.	5.0	definitely a legendary classic	2001-11-19	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A14OQQFGGN0D7S	Alexander A. Marceil	This classic film is more than just a love story- it's at once an allegory, morality tale, and propaganda film.  Most of all- it's propaganda for living.  It sends the message that the greatest battle we have to fight is with ourselves, and that inevitably- love conquers all.  If you watched this film as all you saw were grainy models, stoic acting, and car scenes obviously filmed in studio- you were looking too hard.  You should look at the film and see yourself staring back.  There is something for everyone in this film, which makes it good- but if you know anything about the world at the time this movie was made, it's a truly great work.  Watch as Renault, the corrupt Frenchman, battles against the Germans with snide comments and other asides- but just as he battles against the Huns- the Vichy and Free parts of his mind are struggling for his better inclinations.  Take another look through the lenses of the era, and you will understand why it swept the academy awards, won unanimous support of the censors, and the love of a war torn public.	5.0	Anyone who can't appreciate this film, shouldn't watch movies.	2007-02-02	1	1	0

Hear the title of this 1942 Best Picture winner and your memory will provide you with images of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Peter Lorre, and Claude Rains.  Or maybe you'll hear snatches of Max Steiner's unforgettable score, with its interpolation of Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By"" and the stirring strains of ""The Marsellaise.""Based on the stage play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, the movie tells a dramatic story of refugees fleeing from wartorn Europe and making a perilous trip to Casablanca in French Morocco. It is December 1941 and that French colony is under the control of ""unoccupied France.""  Ostensibly neutral in World War II, Vichy France is nevertheless a German vassal state, as the arrival of Major Strasser (Conrad Veldt) clearly demonstrates.Strasser's mission in Casablanca: to stop Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Henreid) from obtaining one of two exit visas stolen from two murdered German couriers and escaping from the Gestapo. Having tracked the defiant Laszlo after his escape from a Nazi concentration camp, Strasser is determined to capture the symbol of anti-Nazi resistance once and for all.Accompanying Laszlo is the beautiful Ilsa Lund (Bergman), a young Norweigan student whom he married in secret before he was captured by the Gestapo in 1940. Devoted to her husband and his great cause, Ilsa has been at his side since Laszlo's miraculous escape and sudden reappearance in Paris.Unbeknownst to Laszlo, however, his fate will now rest in the hands of American saloonkeeper Rick Blaine (Bogart).  In the months following Victor's escape from the concentration camp he was reported as ""presumed dead."" In loneliness and despair, the grieving Ilsa met and fell in love with Rick in Paris shortly before the German occupation began.  For a brief time the lovers were together, only to tragically part ways when news of Laszlo's return reached Ilsa.Now, in the eve of America's entry into World War II, Victor Laszlo's fate hangs on the conflicting emotions felt by both Rick and Ilsa, as well as the shifting loyalties of French police Capt. Louis Renault (Rains).The screenplay by Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch is a wonderful mixture of romance, intrigue, drama and comedy (the latter provided both by colorful characters and witty exchanges). Director Michael Curtiz and producer Hal B. Wallis made Casablanca as one of many movies produced in 1942, never knowing that it would become a classic of Hollywood's Golden Era."	5.0	Rounding Up the Usual Suspects	2003-09-11	39	30	9

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	&quot;Casablanca&quot; is one of those movies where you can't call yourself a filmlover without seeing it. It's a must in every sense of the word. Also on that list goes &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and I'm sure some of you can probably think of others.&quot;Casablanca&quot; is often called the greatest if not one of the greatest love stories of all-time. And maybe it is.&quot;Casablanca&quot; tells the story of Rick Blaine a hard as nails nightclub owner played by Bogart. He says he will never put his neck out of anyone. But, wait until the time comes. Blaine has left American well, it seems he was thrown out. He has made the best of it though. Blaine seems like the kind of guy who has a lot of stories to tell. He's a mysterious person.WW2 is on the horizon Germany may soon occupy France. Now is a time when underground movements are talking place. People are making an attempt to flee to America. And soon Rick will find himself caught in the middle of all of this.Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) is a known fugitive. He has escape the German army three times. He now with his wife have found themselves in Casablanca. But what Victor does now is that the German army is waiting for him.This is one part of the story. Rick Blaine a man who says he keeps to himself is soon place in a postition where he must make a choice. But, I suppose more people think of the movie as a love story between three people.Victor's wife is Ilsa Laszlo, a woman who spent some time in Paris with Rick. A love affair had started and soon she tells Rick they must part. And they have not seen each since. Until as fate would have it Victor and Ilsa come to Casablanca and into Rick's club.&quot;Casablanca&quot; has proven itself to be a great movie. I bet even if it wouldn't have won the &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar it would still be a movie filmgoers would love. There seems to be something universal in it's appeal. Something about the way the actors act. The emotion they project. And plus the screenplay is a knockout. This is without question one of the most quoted films. With lines like; &quot;We'll always have Paris.&quot; &quot;Here's looking at you kid.&quot; &amp; &quot;This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&quot;&quot;Casablanca&quot; was nominated for 8 Oscars when released. It managed to win 3.Bottom-line: One of the all-time classic Hollywood love stories. Also one of the greatest films of the 40's and one of the best American films of all-time!	5.0	&quot;As Time Goes By&quot; This Is Still A Classic	2003-06-22	8	3	5

Bogart manages to be all at once sinister and lovable, harsh and merciful.  You never know who's side he's playing on - and Rick Blaine (Bogart's character)doesn't even seem to know himself.

As modern audiences, we don't get the full impact of movie Nazi villains, because we know that they lose the war. When Casablanca was made, WE DID NOT KNOW THIS.It was released only a month or so after Pearl Harbor, when victory was NOT assured.The performances are insanely good. Subtle, rapid fire.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AL9P13WB6L9PQ	Amazon Customer	I'm not about to waste your time, or mine, reviewing the &quot;movie&quot;. If you've seen it, you KNOW it's one of the greatest movies of all time (many list it as Number 1). If you haven't seen it, then buy it.The real question for me, is it worth getting the DVD if you already have Casablanca on VHS?The answer, for me at least, is an unqualified yes. If you have a good crisp TV, with three comb filtering, such as a Sony Wega (I have a very good Sanyo), then there will be a much crisper and detailed picture. You can see it early on, particularly in the map of Europe and when Bogert signs a chit. Probably the BEST visual improvement of the VHS is the cloying and annoyingly overdone &quot;soft focus&quot; shots of Ingrid Bergman are not nearly so obvious or overdone in the DVD version. Why? I don't know, but perhaps the lack of crispness in the VHS causes the soft focus blur to be overly pronounced, like driving a car at night with an astigmatism which smears the headlights of oncoming cars.Additionally the dynamic range of the DVD is much more pronounced than the VHS and/or less compressed, so quietly spoken passages are much quieter and musical passages louder.(This may NOT be a good thing, however, for the hard of hearing.&lt;G&gt;)	5.0	Do you need the DVD version if you already have VHS?	2003-07-27	21	17	4

Yes dialouge, camera shots, acting, plot, all of the elements that make a great movie a great movie are tangled up inside of this film, but underneath all the Hollywood greatness, there lies a human greatness. A greatness for all the people like Rick &amp; Ilsa who had to sacrifice their personal lives for a greater cause. Like Rick says, &quot;It doesn't take much to see that the problems of 3 little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.&quot; These people like Rick &amp; Ilsa are the lost generation; the WW II generation, and 'Casablanca' eloquently caputures their significance and importance they had in history, for they are the true heros.  Rick and Ilsa are here to represent these heros. Yes there are the monuments for the soilders and victims of the war, but 'Casablanca' is the ultimate monument to these heros, the everyday people of the world who put their own lives on hold to help the greater cause. So just remember, as time goes by, the people--the heros--who faced this great challenge may not live forever, but their duty and honor will always live on immortally, through 'Casablanca'.	5.0	The Film for a Lost Generation...	2001-01-24	3	2	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1FKLSRSKUNNMT	Andrew Olmsted	Casablanca--generally regarded as one of the best movies of all time, and I'd say with good reason.  The love story set against the turmoil of World War II, combined with the larger theme of bringing the US into the war, make this a great movie on many levels.  Bogart's performance as Rick is terrific, and Bergman is a perfect foil for him as Ilsa.  Casablanca has been referenced so many times, it would be easy to dismiss it, but the movie is too powerful for that.  No matter how many times I watch it, the mixture of powerful performances and a great story keep my interest every time.The DVD version is well-worth it just for the picture quality of the DVD compared to video, but the extras here are only fair.  The only major extra is a documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall, and while it's fine, a movie this good deserves more.	4.0	A great movie, a good DVD	2001-11-28	2	2	0

I hadn't seen the film in many years, and I had to see it again to make up my own mind.I bought the DVD ... and looked at it just last week.  Hey, this is really a good film. The photography is excellent throughout. There are great, moody B&W; shots, and certain images, such as Ingrid Bergman in soft focus, her hat slanted low over her brow, have become iconic.  Bogart drinking away his sorrows while Dooley plays ""As Time Goes By"" is a scene filled with dark shadows and lover's angst.The acting is superb.  Bogart and Bergman weren't just stars.  They can express emotion with the movement of their eyes or the gesture of a hand. They are fun to watch.This was supposed to be just another studio film, or so the legend goes.  But it seems Michael Curtiz put more effort into this than one might expect.  It is impossible to find a false moment in this film.The last time I saw Casablanca, many years ago, the print was scratchy and dirty.  The DVD version is bright and crisp.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A13RYFCGR7AM7E	"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of..."	"To be honest, even writing a review for this is daunting; I'm certain I'll have no words of praise to equal those that have already posted here, and even if I could, I'm sure my best effort would fall short to describe everything I love about ""Casablanca"".Arguably (although not from me) the greatest film ever shot, ""Casablanca"" was a timely tale about war-torn people and shattered romance that came about when the world itself was war-torn, and most people weren't thinking very romantic thoughts. I won't rehash the plot here, I assume you either know it, have heard of it, or read it in another review; I'll instead offer my opinion of why this movie deserves every accolade it has received.It is a wonderfully crafted tale of three people bound by both love and cruel fate; world-weary Rick Blaine, standing firmly shielded by his cynicism, determined to spit in the eye of the fates that have plagued his life; The lovely and unfortunate Isla Lund, divided forever between a love that nurtures and a love that burns; and her husband, the noble and daring Victor Lazlo, a caring man who, through an irrevocable destiny, finds himself having to share his love for his wife with the love of freedom, as he has come to represent the hope and fighting spirit of the people of Europe.I don't care who you are, there is something in one (and quite likely each) of these characters that you can find that you will relate to.Add to this a wealth of supporting characters; the crafty Captain Louis Renault, the menacing Major Strasser, the salacious Lugarte, the slick Ferrari, faithful Sam...even Sasha the bartender stays in your memory.  Each actor in this unequalled ensemble brims with talent to produce characters that are fleshed-out and given life, so much so that even in the much too short a time you spend in front of the screen, you feel these are people you know; people you CARE about...this extends to even the secondary characters in the film (the heartfelt plea of the young Bulgarian girl for herself and her husband is TRULY inspired).The acting talents and abilites of the three main cast members, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Heinreid as they live through one of the most heart-rending love triangles ever commited to posterity are excellence cubed; every emotion, no matter how subtle, is conveyed as clear and resolute as the ring of fine, Waterford crystal.The multiple subplots, all engrossing and demanding an investment of your emotion, are woven together masterfully; the Epstein brothers simply outdid themselves in terms of story, made even more amazing by the fact that it was largely written on the fly.  The dialogue is witty and simply amazing; it's no wonder that this film has so many lines that are now in the common vernacular; indeed spoken now by people who have never even seen the film.There's something here for everyone:  you have action, romance, intrigue, suspense, comedy...you name it, it's in here somewhere...and ultimately it all blends seamlessly into a story of true love, courage in the face of all odds, and redemption.Thank heaven that they mastered this excellent transfer in its original format, and didn't butcher it to appeal to the ""widescreen"" audience; there weren't widescreen films then, and you see it here as it was meant to be seen.  The sound is crisp, from the gentle notes of ""As Time Goes By"" to the thunderous affirmation of courage from ""La Marseillaise"".  The extra disc includes two insightful documentaries hosted by Lauren Bacall, the wife of the late Bogart, and also the Warner Brothers cartoon tribute ""Carrot-blanca"", as well as an episode of the short-lived television series.  Most interesting to me was the radio broadcast, featuring the three main stars, and the commentary from the children of Bogie and Bergman...pure gold.If you are human, you'll take something with you from ""Casablanca"" that you'll be glad to have."	5.0	The Absolute Favorite Film of this film nut...	2010-09-14	1	1	0

After watching it i can certainly some evidence for it but i'm not sure if i would necessarily hold it in that high regard.I think a large part of my opinions of this movie come from the fact that it is an older movie and many movies have been influenced directly from it. Watching in today, much of the story, particularly the romance, seemed comical simply because i had seen it used so often. Admittedly, before i saw it i was expecting to not like it at all but luckily i did enjoy most of it. First and foremost i really appreciated the writing. The dialogue, especially between Rick and captain Renault, was both entertaining and intelligent. I found myself enjoying the political intrigue in the film much more than the romance.I was certainly impressed with this movie. Mostly because of the writing and setting. though I wouldn't call this the greatest film ive ever seen it does deserve most of the credit it receives.	4.0	Casablanca	2008-11-09	6	1	5

The acting is great (cast includes, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains) and it has an awesome story line, and to tell the truth, five years ago, I was not interested in movies such as CASABLANCA. I used to really dislike black and white movies, but then I really began to appreciate movies such as this, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Now I'd prefer a good ol' classic any day over dull sitcoms or reality shows.To summarize, this movie is based in Casablanca (in Africa) and this place serves as an ""in between"" point for many people in Europe trying to make their way to the U.S. In Casablanca, there is a popular nightclub/casino called Rick's Cafe. It is at this place where a lot a ""wheeling and dealing"" goes on between the people trying to leave Casablanca, and those who forge and work out the paperwork (a lot of money is spent too). It is also at this location where a certain woman walks back into a mans life.

(Events similar to what occurred with Fox's 1951 sci-fier,THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.)In the seven decades since a never mounted stageplay called ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" was adapted for the screen by the Epstein twins and Howard Koch, CASABLANCA has spawned two short-lived TV series, but wisely on the part of filmmakers, no motion picture rehashes. Here we have an ideal cast following a perfect script; a timeless love story that ends happily for no one that's set in a North African stopping point for refugees of a merciless war. Their German oppressors are here as well in these final days before the Allied invasion of North Africa.Former gun runner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns ""Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain"", a place that folks of all political persuasions and nationalities gravitate to. His loyal friend and piano artist&eacute; Sam (Dooley Wilson) performs every song but one, that is until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) wanders in, spots him at the keys and coos, ""Play 'As Time Goes By'."" When Rick storms over to chastise Sam for the song he never wants to hear, he and Ilsa are reunited. We soon learn of their affair in Paris and sudden parting while Germans marched in, Rick's hard feelings at Ilsa's disappearance that day, and the love which yet remains within him.All this amid the chaos of other lives, people scrambling for impossible to get papers of transit even as an ever-present enemy heightens their awareness of danger. The Italian Ugarte (Peter Lorre) gives Rick two of these priceless letters just before he's arrested by Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt police captain. Ugarte dies in custody, leaving an embittered Rick with the dilemma of giving the transit docs to Ilsa and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech Resistance refugee, or saving them for his own escape. Lazlo selflessly suggests that Rick use the papers to escort Ilsa to safety while he remains in Casablanca. Then Laszlo is arrested by Renault on a false charge...CASABLANCA is the one film that all Classic Era movie fans should own, and the one to be seen repeatedly. It never ages, defying time itself even ""as time goes by.""Also available on acollector's edition two-DVD set."	5.0	They'll always have Paris; we'll always have CASABLANCA	2010-04-04	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AE8RQHFMSLN0D	"Anthony Damato ""Law professor"""	If you suspend your disbelief, Casablanca is truly one of the best films ever made.  It succeeds because the most improbable thing that the Bogart character could do was to give the letters of transit to the most beautiful  woman of all time and her husband the resistance singer.  It's simply out  of character, don't you agree?  And yet, for a moment at the end, we  believe it!  And this is a tribute to the way the movie was constructed  from the very opening shot.  But if you look at it in its context of  1943, the suspension of disbelief was in fact rather prevalant.  I'm  talking about the war movies.  The war movies of that era showed  unbelievable self-lessness: soldiers throwing themselves on hand grenades,  etc.  How could &quot;war&quot; motivate people to do such things?  Well,  people were swept by the patriotism of the time--and it was an extremely  justifiable patriotism, given the evil of Hitler.  So, what I'm  saying (and I don't know if it's been said before) is that Casablanca is,  preeminently, a war film.  It's a film about doing the right thing, not in  combat, but in an occupied territory, with nasty Nazis around.  What  was the opening shot?  Well, it was exactly the opening shot of a war  movie!  We saw Casablanca on a map.  So we are set up to think in terms of  a war movie.  Could the idea of Casablanca ever work in a non-war  context?  Woody Allen's &quot;Play it Again, Sam,&quot; is of course a  mild--and affectionate--spoof of Casablanca.  Allen is &quot;our hero&quot;  at the end of the film.  We don't quite buy it, and &quot;Sam&quot; doesn't  quite come off.  It's an interesting movie, badly edited, but I cite it  because it reinforces my main point: that to understand Casablanca, you  have to have seen some of the war films that came out at the same time.	5.0	Suspend Your Disbelief	2000-07-18	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2EL3990HXOMZB	Antonio Robert	"The magic of ""Casablanca"" lies mostly in its romance. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman movie pairing remained their sole and maybe that's the reason why their unimpeachable chemistry became unique. Their fate as star-crossed lovers trapped in Casablanca went down as one of the most memorable. The scenes of their love in Paris woke up 'the sentimentalist' (as Mr. Renault would say) in me. Just look at Rick (Bogart) watching Ilsa (Bergman) in a Paris cafe, over glasses of champagne, the moment she does not look at him. And Bergman? She's one of the most beautiful and best actresses ever to grace the screen, to say the least (""Here's looking at you, kid."") And her foreign accent just added to her charm.The melodrama is surrounded by patriotic, anti-fascist and adventure tones and given the fact that the film was released when the World War Two was far from over, it's understood that it captivated viewers back then, as it still does now.There are many details in the movie that get it all just right. Whether it is the young Bulgarian couple, the Marseilleaise or other things you may not notice at first viewing but that justify the purchase of the DVD, as you can get back to your favourite scenes again and again, as I do. Besides, the DVD has a stunning picture quality.The bottom line: with ""Casablanca"" you get one of the most acclaimed Hollywood movies and two of its most beloved stars in a marvellous coupling. These assets are far outweighing the occassional slow pace and datedness of the movie. Yes, ""Casablanca"" may remain a film for ages."	5.0	Casablanca: Romance .... and All That (4.5 stars)	2003-12-26	3	3	0

Who can out-sauve Humphrey Bogart, or  fill a screen with more beauty than Ingrid Bergman? The short retrospective  is fair, and the 12 odd previews are not in the best shape but hopefully a  bone thrown to us as to what classic Bogie films are yet to come to DVD (or  at least we can hope).

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1PASRZ81DY9C	Austin Somlo	Viewed: 11/02, 11/03, 3/05, 4/06Rate: 104/06: Casablanca is one of the most honored films of all time and ranks one of the top two most romantic films ever made, rivaling with Gone with the Wind. Serious writing, brilliant acting, ravishing cinematography, and unpredictably thrilling story are throughout the picture. Everything that I desire in a film is all contained in Casablanca. When I think of Humphrey Bogart, I think of him as dark, mysterious Richard Blaine, a typical anti-hero who turns out to be a greater hero than imagined. Ingrid Bergman has never been more beautiful. Paul Henreid is just a classic...easily the best role of his career. Sixty-two years have passed by, there will always be Casablanca, and Casablanca will always have a place in my heart. From the start to the end, Casablanca is impeccably made because every aspect as possible in this film is streamed through without any flaw. It stands the test of time as the better alternative of Romeo and Juliet story. Precisely exquisite and rare, Casablanca is a masterpiece.	5.0	The Greatest and the Most Perfect Movie of All Time.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3Q7A9Y3S3BZO6	Axayacatl	So many others have done justice to this outstanding movie, I will focus on technical quality of this DVD. I do love this movie, I've seen it perhaps 15 times in as many years. And of course Casablanca is one of the most quotable movies ever!The DVD transfer of this B&amp;W classic is OUTSTANDING!! I watch this on my 2200 lumens front projection system. I have an enormous screen measuring 14.5' diagonal! I can easily see the quality of the digital transfer on every DVD, and I am astonished at the high quality of this transfer for Casablanca.The film noire aspect is perfectly captured in high resolution sharp detail (but not excessively so). You can see absolutely everything ... the patterns on ties, Ingrid's jewelry and beautiful hair, incredible detail on wardrobe and props, etc. If you are used to seeing Casablanca on VHS, then viewing this DVD on a nice home theater system will be like seeing the movie for the first time ... it is so rich in detail.The quality of the contrast calibration is great! Deep black, crisp white and an excellent transfer curve in between. All the cast look great. They really did an excellent job in transferring this classic film. I know I sound impressed, but I am not exaggerating in the least about the quality ... my home theater screen is huge and this film looks great, as good as anything you would ever see in a cinema. I am not easy to please, and this disc is so well done that this great film is a joy to watch, again and again and again.The dolby digital 2.0 mono audio transfer is excellent as well. It's hard to believe that this disc is of a film made 61 years ago.Very well done DVD. Enjoy!	5.0	Flawless classic cinema. DVD transfer A++	2003-05-11	8	6	2

Then one evening during Christmas break one of the Tv stations was showing an old movie after the news each night.

The film was spectacular and I was hooked.  Bogarts's independent, tough character was engaging and the setting In a foreign location piqued the traveller in me.

It is so good and so fun on so many levels that it should be with us as long as the technology exists to preserve it. There's a war going on; there's deceit; there's nationalistic flag-waving; there's heroism; and in the midst of all this, there's a love story. If ever there was a ""chick flick for guys,"" this is it. In addition to the war and romance, there is also sharp, sly dialogue that still amuses nearly 60 years later. Throw in some of the best talents of 1940s Hollywood and you've got that marvelous clich&eacute;, the ""classic."" If World War II were to somehow disappear from the history books, yet ""Casablanca"" remained behind, an audience could still watch, understand, and appreciate it.Who would like it? Good Lord, who wouldn't? Maybe a few Nazis; perhaps the Arab Anti-Defamation League; and the humor does occasionally angle toward the masculine viewpoint.

The story of political and romantic espionage is set against the backdrop of the wartime conflict between democracy and totalitarianism.With a rich and smoky atmosphere, anti-Nazi propaganda, Max Steiner's superb musical score, suspense, unforgettable characters and memorable lines of dialogue (e.g., ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" and the inaccurately-quoted ""Play it again, Sam""), it is one of the most popular, magical (and flawless) films of all time - focused on the themes of lost love, honor and duty, self-sacrifice and romance within a chaotic world. Woody Allen's Play It Again, Sam (1972) paid reverential homage to the film, as have the lesser films Cabo Blanco (1981) and Barb Wire (1996), and the animated Bugs Bunny short Carrotblanca (1995)."	5.0	A Classic, a Standard, a Complete Movie...	2005-03-27	3	3	0

Also, the trademark characters and the usual suspects.  But I recommend this movie due to the simple love story between Bogart and Bergman.  There is none better written for the screen, or portrayed.  Everyone can relate to their flawed romance, and it's why this movie is so universally appealing -- and heart-breaking.  When two people love each other, and can't seem to get together, then, find a way to mutally love each other in a new way, well, that is what life's about more often than not.

There she meets Rick Blaine, a vacationing American sick of fighting with the resistance and owner of a nightclub near the Atlantic Ocean in Casablanca, Morocco, a center of French influence in North Africa.  Ilsa and Rick fall in love.  When Nazi forces invade Paris, Ilsa and Rick agree to meet in a railroad station.  Rick arrives alone, concludes that Ilsa has deserted him and returns to his nightclub in Casablanca.  Rick is shocked when Ilsa enters his nightclub with her husband Victor.  Ilsa was the victim of false information about her husband's death and creates a love triangle by showing deep affection for both men.  Not realizing that Ilsa had bad information about her husband's death, Rick is angry at Ilsa for abandoning him earlier at the railroad station in Paris, thus weakening the love triangle.  Ilsa explains the bad information, restoring the triangle to full strength.  Rick acquires papers for two people to avoid European conflict and fly to America.  He plans to use them to take himself and Ilsa to America, leaving Victor behind in Morocco.  Rick and Ilsa meet at the airport in Casablanca along with Victor who wants to say goodbye.  The routine meeting at the airport becomes a memorable blockbuster turning point in the movie.  The three triangle actors are perfect in their roles. Isla's Scandinavian beauty and strong accent help to give the movie a foreign feel.  Victor impresses audiences with his tall, imposing, courageous posture and brilliant lines while Rick's tart, lemony voice clearly brands him as an American.  The nightclub ambiance is perfect for the movie, being loaded with Nazi officers, resistance sympathizers and slippery deal-makers and opportunists.	5.0	Director Michael Cortiz Uses Star Power of Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart In A Classic Wartime Love Triangle	2013-09-29	1	1	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3U84F6KD6ZB82	"Ben King ""12Oclock"""	I personally haven't seen Casablanca in HD as of yet. However, I am in total agreement with the previous review.  If you simply are watching movies for HD rather than the storyline or simply do not care for black and white films, you are missing the picture.  This movie was released during the war and overwhelmingly accepted at a time when blockbuster movies were not at the top of the list for our nation.  It has been revered as the best movie of all time by many and ranked #2 on AFI's top 100. Simply reviewing this film strictly for the set or grainy picture is not sufficient and is pretty much the same as if someone 50 years from now were to make the same remarks about an epic film of our day.  In closing I would like to say that even though I don't agree with the 3 stars, at least you watched the movie before you knocked it. My advice, watch it once more and appreciate it.	5.0	Truly not overrated	2007-02-27	15	3	12

The story moves at a frantic, but believable, pace.  Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age.  The unfortunate thing is that, in 2005, so much of the dialogue has so fully entered our cultural lexicon that the new viewer may be disappointed as to how cliche it sounds.  Yet, none of the lines like ""play it again Sam,"" ""...out of all of the gin joints"" and ""this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"" were ever heard before Casablanca's release. Sure, Bogey is stupendous as is Bergman but what about Claude Rains? He practically steals the title role away from Rick.  His character is incredibly complex and interesting.  It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally."	5.0	Legend!	2005-04-10	3	3	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A417ZAKGXT9IN	Betty June Moore	Because I've been reading Michael Walsh's novel As Time Goes By, I recently decided to watch Casablanca again on DVD. I was amazed to see how this 1943 Oscar-winning film remains powerful and moving 60 years after its release.Almost everybody knows its plot of of wartime intrigue and its doomed romantic triangle of bitter American saloonkeeper Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the beautiful Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and her idealistic husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). This trio is supported by a wonderful and varied cast of characters, including Police Prefect Louis Renault (Claude Rains), Rick's faithful friend and piano player Sam Waters (Arthur &quot;Dooley&quot; Wilson), the conniving Ugarte (Peter Lorre), the Russian bartender Sacha (Leonid Kinsky), and  the loveable maitre d' Carl (S. Z. Sakall).The heart of the movie revolves around the conflict created in Rick's heart by World War II. When his former flame Ilsa arrives in Casablanca, does he help her and her husband Victor escape to Lisbon, or does he allow German Major Strasser (Conrad Veldt) to capture the fugitive Czech resistance leader so Rick can take Ilsa to America himself? Or do his natural good instincts surface and get Rick to do the honorable thing?This movie has a little bit of everything: suspense, drama, comedy, an exotic setting, and lots of music, including renditions of &quot;It Had To Be You,&quot; &quot;The Very Thought Of You,&quot;  and a thrilling duel between Germans singing the &quot;Watch On The Rhine&quot; and the Allies belting out &quot;The Marsellaise.&quot;  Other songs heard in the film include &quot;Knock On Wood,&quot; and the unforgettable &quot;As Time Goes By.&quot;Another crucial element is the snappy and memorable dialog written by the Epstein twins and Hal B. Wallis for this movie:Rick: I came here for the waters.Louis: Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.Rick: Obviously, I was misinformed.Ilsa: (to Sam) Play it. Play &quot;As Time Goes By.&quot;Rick: (to Sam) Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.Louis: (pretending to be surprised) I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling in here!Casino Dealer: (handing Louis some money) Your winnings, sir.Louis: (takes the money) Thank you.Rick: (to Ilsa) Now, now...here's looking at you, kid.With all these ingredients, director Michael Curtiz and producer Jack Warner came up with a recipe for a movie that became a beloved classic, a status recognized when the Library of Congress named Casablanca as one of the most important American films.	5.0	The Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship....	2003-09-20	6	5	1

This film also has absolute honesty and absolute dishonesty, and everything in between, from people at the ends of their various ropes. It was made in 1942 (early WW2).

I have seen Casablanca many, many times and can state without question that this is absolutely worth viewing. It is crisp and clean with a depth far surpassing any other edition. The beautiful contrasts between light and shadow are visible like never before. I thoroughly enjoyed every visual aspect of the film. My only ""problem"" (and the reason for 4 stars) is the sound. I had to nearly max out the volume of the television to be able to hear the dialog. The first part of the film seemed much worse and improved as the movie progressed. Not sure if it's only my DVD but it was pretty annoying having to adjust the volume controls for the first 10-15 minutes.

Michael Curtiz directs an excellent ensemble cast that is dramatic, hilarious and visually stunning (usually in the same scene).  The acting, the writing and the pacing is excellent and puts the vast majority of Hollywood's output (before and after) to shame.As far as the new DVD is concerned Warner Brothers really pulled out all the stops.  Its packed with extras that you will actually want to see and hear (unlike most DVD's).  It is well designed and visually appealing.  The only dud is the premiere episode of &quot;Who Holds Tomorrow?&quot;, which is a small screen adaptation of the film that rightfully faded into obscurity.  But, it is worthy, if for nothing else, as a historical footnote.If you haven't seen this classic yet, trust me, you need to.

What waters? We're in the desert!"" -- Renault""I was misinformed."" -- RickAny film buff watching this screen classic today will certainly get a sense of having seen this formula over and over. Howard Hawks remade it in a fashion, and actually improved upon it by putting his distinct spin on it, in To Have and Have Not. While it often gets overpraised because it is a beloved favorite of critics, it also doesen't receive the credit due it. The four strongest performances here, namely Bogart, Rains, Lorre, and Joy Page, who rarely even gets a mention, didn't garner the Academy Award. It can be argued that any solid studio director from this period could have made a great film out of the terrific screenplay worked on by many but credited to Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein, and the fine cast assembled. But it is a film which is more than the sum of its parts, and the reason why it has been copied so often over the years.Bogart is Rick Blaine, doing okay running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca, in French Morocco. Everyone must go through Casablanca to get to Lisbon, and freedom from the turmoil brought about by Hitler's ever growing expansion. Rick runs his cafe and gambling house unencumbered by politics, looking out only for himself and a few close and loyal employees like Sam (Dooley Wilson) and Carl (S.Z. Sakall). Peter Lorre is marvelous as the criminal who worships Rick, and seeks his approval. It is really what happens to Ugarte (Lorre) which turns Rick against the Nazi's and for the French Resistance, though it won't become evident until the film is nearly over. It is perhaps, the most interesting relationship in the film, made more so since Lorre meets his end early on.Ugarte leaves Rick a letter of transit which can't even be questioned, when in pops Rick's reason for hiding out in Casablanca; Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Rick's bitter disillusionment with love all goes back to what happened in Paris, where Ilsa left him holding his heart in his hand. The montages were in part directed by Don Siegel, who would direct Mitchum and Greer in The Big Steal, and later become well known for Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood. Ilsa isn't alone, however, bringing with her her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He is the lead figure behind the movement to rid the French of the Third Reich. They would prefer he never make it to Lisbon. Caught in between is the pragmatic Captain Renault (Claude Rains). He gives a terrific performance, full of humor and larceny. It is never clear which side he is on. Ilsa wants her husband Victor to escape with his life but Rick isn't so ready to hand over those transit papers; not without some graveling and an explanation for the way he was burned by her.Perhaps Bergman was a good second choice for Ilsa after all. The viewer knows she's messed Rick up, and wants it to be righted, while at the same time sensing they don't belong together. Her casting and lack of chemistry with Bogart makes the ending easier to take for me. Before we get there, however, there are some terrific moments from Joy Page as a young wife fleeing Bulgaria and desperate to get she and her husband out of Casablanca. What Rick does to help her out, and get around her making a mistake with Renault, shows the effect Ugarte's killing by the Germans had on him. Rick is at heart a softhearted romantic, which is why he was cut so deeply by Ilsa's getting over on him in Paris. There was a reason, however, and once he knows what it is, he'll come to the same decision the viewer has.Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Direction (Michael Curtiz). Bogart would have won for Best Actor, Rains for Supporting Actor, and Joy Page for Best Supporting Actress in a different time and place. While this isn't the Noir masterpiece many describe it as, it is one amazingly smooth blend of genres which pleases everyone, and makes it one of the great films of all-time. Silent film fans might even catch a glimpse of star Monte Blue as an uncredited American. Bogart and Bergman fans can enjoy watching this over and over, as it is one of those films almost universally cherished by movie lovers."	5.0	"""Nobody ever loved me that much."" -- Bogart to Joy Page"	2010-04-02	2	1	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2CW9IQAPFEYLM	Bomojaz	Casablanca is simply the most enjoyable movie I've ever seen, bar none. The setting is Rick's Cafe in Casablanca at the beginning of WW II. Everyone here wants out of Casablanca, except Rick (Bogart), who has escaped here from Paris and the woman he's loved and who's jilted him. He is cynical, interested only in himself. Then one day Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), his lost love, shows up, in the company of husband vc xVicor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a great Resistance leader. They, too, want to escape to America, but the Nazis plan on stopping him. Through an accident Rick has the only means of getting them out: letters of transit that cannot be rescinded. It's Rick's conscience versus an old love wound; there is some doubt which will win (even when making the movie this doubt remained right up to the final days of shooting), and at what cost.Everything works perfectly in this movie--the cynicism, the idealism, the twists and turns toward the conclusion. Bogart is at his tough-guy-on-the-outside-softy-on-the-inside best; Bergman is lovely; Claude Rains as the police commissioner is witty and almost as cynical as Rick; Sidney Greenstreet is great in a minor role.

Ever since I first saw it decades ago it's been by favorite movie (though I don't think it's the greatest ever made). Every character, from the sinister Bogart to the beautiful and confused Ingrid Bergman, from the cynical Claude Rains to the ambitious Sidney Greenstreet, is superb. And of course there's Dooley Wilson playing that midget piano, ""Knocking on Wood"" and crooning ""As Time Goes By"" which was written long before the movie was ever thought about. There are some odd things in the movie, too - the way Bogart can't pronounce ""bourbon"" so that it makes sense and the plane taking off in the fog (in the desert!). Whether Bogart would get Bergman at the end was kept a mystery throughout the shooting, but of course he would have to give her up - this was 1942, she was married to Henreid, and what kind of heel would he be if he got the girl? He's got Nazis to fight, anyway. The movie is a Hollywood classic and one that I'll continue to watch over and over again."	5.0	Everyone goes to Ricks	2006-04-23	6	5	1

This movie has everything: War, love, murder, gambling, drinking, sniveling French people, brave Norwegians, Nazis, and crooked cops.Seriously, though...This is one of the few movies that I could not possibly imagine in color.  The black and white adds a quality that no color could reproduce; it adds a starkness to the city of Casablanca, while making the characters stand out and become larger than life.  The direction is exellent, and the acting is marvelous, displaying virtually none of the annoyingly stilted style of the time.  The scene that really stands out is the one where the Germans are singing ""Die Fatherland,"" and Laszlo begins ""La Marseilles.""  There are so many things working in this scene, but it captures the will of a people to resist tyranny, and also establishes the power of Laszlo to rally people to a cause, which really are the themes of the movie that work behind the love story.Bogart is excellent, Bergman is radiant, and every other character is much more than a simple role player. They all have their motivations, and are not necessarily good or bad, but are all working toward something, be it passage out of Casablanca, the elimination of political rivals, or simply the acquisition of money.  They all work in concert to create a wonderful, fascinating story.Simply one of the best movies ever."	5.0	As good as it gets	2003-03-03	2	2	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	"Ah, ""Casablanca.""  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse.  What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is ""Casablanca"" a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+"	4.0	It Took Me a While to Come Around to This One	2003-08-18	4	3	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	One of the greatest, and certainly one of the most quoted, films in cinema history, Casablanca brings all the essential elements to the big screen - adventure, romance, intrigue, suspense, and of course, evil Nazi bad guys (if you doubt this last one as an essential element, then reference the success of the Indiana Jones films). With a director and cast second to none, Casablanca makes a strong case for consideration as the best movie ever made - cementing its status as a must-see film.The story begins in a place called Rick's, a popular watering hole in Vichey controlled Morocco on the outskirts of Nazi dominated Europe. An important travel hub, Casablanca plays host to innumerable colorful characters with any number of varying agendas. Arms dealers, spies, and revolutionaries walk side-by-side through streets littered with pickpockets. But at Rick's, everyone seems to enjoy themselves. Owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) seems content with his life of serving customers and making money until she walks in - Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the love of his life.A couple of years earlier, as the Nazis moved into Paris, Rick and Ilsa fell in love. But in the act of fleeing the Nazi advance, Ilsa sent Rick a note at the train station informing him that she could not go with him. She offered no explanation. Now, she was appearing in his establishment with her husband - fugitive and Nazi resistance leader Victor Laszlo.As the hours unfold, and the Nazis search for Laszlo in an attempt to cut off his escape, Rick learns the whole story. When he met Ilsa in Paris she was married to Laszlo, but she thought he was dead - a victim of the Nazi regime. But before she could flee Paris with Rick, she learned that her husband had escaped a Nazi concentration camp. She stayed behind to care for him.Needing help to aid her husband's escape to the United States, Ilsa appeals to Rick. It is clear that they still love each other. But will Rick use his influence and connections to help himself and Ilsa or Victor Laszlo? Will his idealism prevail over his hard pragmatism? The Third Reich is closing in on Victor Laszlo and only Rick can save him...The DVD Report	5.0	As close to perfect as a film can get...	2005-04-19	2	2	0

And it's center channel mono only. But for 1942, it's about as good as you can expect.Another minor annoyance: There is no enhanced widescreen 16X9 version, only the 1.33:1 aspect, but switching to the Horizontal Fill position on my Panasonic flat screen fills the screen without measurable loss of content.However, these shortcomings do nothing to take away from the film's enduring attraction to audiences of all ages.It's well worth the investment."	4.0	Casablanca Lives On	2010-04-18	12	1	11

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	What is it that makes Casablanca just get better with time? Even though it was made as an obvious war-time morale booster at a time when America needed it, and these kinds of films were the most commonplace and most wanted kind of entertainment, this particular one turned out to be something very special. Bogart starred in several of these kinds of films, andHumphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)is full of them, yet I enjoy these films over and over. They are not just some dated WWII epics as so many films of that era come across today. So part of the attraction just has to be Bogart himself, the knowledge that nobody is that tough - yet Bogart pulls it off, and at the same time you can believe him capable of feeling the most intense romantic love possible. Or he can just use women and cast them aside - Bogie always keeps you guessing. Also, Casablanca is just about the most romantic film ever made. Finally, there are those wonderful supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and the scene-stealing Claude Rains who claims to be shocked that there is gambling going on at Rick's Cafe Americain as he pockets his winnings.If you don't already own Casablanca, I feel it's an essential classic movie purchase, even if you're not really a classic movie fan. However, the only thing changing here versus theCasablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)is the artwork and the documentary on Jack Warner. My personal opinion is that, for the value, that is the better buy. Thus I arrived at my rating as follows:The film = 5 starsThe value of this edition = 3 starsThis averages to four stars.Warner Home Video has slowed down its release of classic films new to DVD this year and retreated to the safer territory of reissuing some of its sure-sellers. I hope that this is just a temporary decision based on the bad economy and not the beginning of a trend.	4.0	I'm rating the movie and the value of this edition	2008-08-29	5	3	2

This captivating classic, so vividly played out and cinematically crafted, is a textbook example of the Hollywood studio system at its absolute best.The 70th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition restores the film's pictorial splendor, surpassing the previous version which used too much DNR. This time the film's inherent grain texture isn't smoothed away along with a measure of sharpness, but is evenly configurated resulting in perfect black and white image resolution that replicates 35mm film.CASABLANCA is offered both as a Blu-ray/DVD special combo package and as a single Blu-ray disc.  The big set comes with an array of bonus material, much of which was bumped over from the previous Blu-ray edition, including the commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer. There's also some photographic and printed memorabilia, and a few new documentaries on the making of the film, on its director, Michael Curtiz, another on the history of Warner Bros., and one on its chief mogul, Jack L. Warner. The single Blu-ray has all the video/audio extras except the two Warner documentaries, and doesn't include any memorabilia items.One of my all-time top favorites, CASABLANCA is a movie I enjoy playing again and again, and if that's true of you, then this upgrade is a must.	5.0	CASABLANCA NEVER LOOKED BETTER	2012-06-05	30	28	2

Shortly after that Warner Bros. opened the movie ""Casablanca"" in New York City. My Granny Vi was a massive Claude Rains fan, so she took me to see what became my favorite movie the day after it opened. Chances are the release print we saw that day had been inspected at the WB film lab since this was a roadshow. Almost certainly the projectionists had run it to check quality the previous morning. According to the schedule it had run 3 times for audiences before I saw that print, so it was in excellent shape. I was still a child actor in network radio then. In 1948 I started management training with another movie studio's Manhattan business office. So since then I have viewed a couple of thousand answer prints made from original negatives, just as a few weeks before Jack Warner had approved the answer print of the final release cut of ""Casablanca""So let me tell you, I have looked at a lot of copies of Casablanca over the years. I made a Betamax recording off the air way back and then a VHS off cable. When DVD came along I bought successive restorations. Even on TV seeing a 16mm print Casablanca is a marvelous movie. It is filled with the quotes fans remember and use in casual conversation. When somebody says, ""Round up the usual suspects"" we know what is meant.This restoration and high resolution transfer to BluRay has to look as perfect as Jack Warner's answer print. There is not a blemish to be found. Nobody tried to second guess the artistic choices made originally. The scenes intended to be in low key are crisp, with no disruption in the shadows. Exterior high key scenes do not blow-out the highlights. ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!""All the many talented folks who have lovingly preserved and restored Casablanca are to be congratulated. Now pardon me as I fire up a BluRay player and Barco digital projector so I can hear ""As Time Goes By"" once more the way it was intended to sound."	5.0	CASABLANCA 70th Anniversary Edition-BluRay	2012-05-12	3	3	0

I'm not sure of the size but it's actually pretty big, especially compared to the tiny ones that usually come with box sets.-A leather pouch with 4 casablanca coasters. The leather case is actually really well made. The stitching even looks expensive.- A bts book that is so nice it can sell on its own- Two disc of the movie. One is blu-ray and the other DVD. Then there is a special features disc.There was a lot of thought put into this box set for the fans and I am very pleased with it. The only negative I would say is that the box that holds all the items has gaps when closed. I wish the box set case was a little more stable in terms of the way it closes. Maybe a latch to be sure all the content stays in. So does the folding of the BR/DVD case. It does not fold together very well. That's not off putting enough for me to send back or anything.If you are a fan of Casablanca, this is set you need to get.	5.0	The quality of the box set is amazing.

Less grain, little to no burns and or scratches, sound much better. To be honest, I was hoping for the same clarity as the rereleased and cleaned up &quot;Sunset Blvd&quot;, but Casablanca is a much older film, so I will take what I can get.Extras - Haven't had a chance to listen to the commentaries tho the Ebert one scares me. The &quot;Bacall on Bogart&quot; featurette is cool and neat to see the few outtakes and deleted scenes. It is hard, however, to glean any new information about the actors and/or the making of the film after having read and/or seen all other documentaries and books (I have no idea of the validity, but &quot;Round up the Usual Suspects&quot; by Aljean Harmetz is an entertaining read)If you are a Casablanca fan and want the clearest copy of the film, then you need to add this to your collection. =)	5.0	Better than the first DVD	2003-08-06	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A388G7Q4E8VG38	"Charles H. Harpole ""Charly"""	"I do not want the 21th Century and all those under the age of 20 now to miss or misunderstand CASABLANCA.  The film exists on two levels... one is a love triangle beteeen Rick, Ilsie, and Victor, her husband.  She and Rick had a brief passionate love affair, with sex, yes, but when she learned Victor was still alive, she deserted Rick and returned to her freedom-fighting husband (anti Nazi).  But when she by accident meets Rick again, he first rejects her out of bitterness at being dumped, but then relents and both admit their continuing love for each other.  Rick has two open visas to escape oncoming Nazi occupation, and seems to plan to leave with her and cause the husband to remain behind, likely executed by the Nazis.  The drama of his hard, anti-marriage stance turns about when he puts she and her husband on the plane to fly to freedom and America.  He remains behind to, likely, take up active opposition to the Nazis while she and her husband fight from American shores.Although not shown directly, it is important to conclude that she and Rich did have one more passionate encounter when she came to ask for the visas.  The two clearly acknowledge their deep love then, and the implication for an adult audience is that they had one last sexual encounter, motivated by their remembered, rediscovered love.  However, Rick tells Victor that Victor is getting the visas because she went to bed with him.  Rick tells this lie to help Victor cope with her loving Rick still.  Victor takes this news stocially or perhaps knew of the lie.  Rick, in part, also tells her that she would later resent his stealing her for himself and her giving up ideals for her ""selfish"" love of Rick (troubles of three little people speech).  Her devotion to wifely duty and the higher calling of anti-Nazi-ism gets her on the plane, but the two are clearly giving up their one really loving and carnally passionate future with each other.Unlike simplistic treatment of love and sexuality in Hollywood films since about 1980, this film displays a complexity of emotions that are refreshingly realistic and adult.On the other level, this film portrays a basically heroic but bitter and selfish American (Rick) who, until he realizes that France and freedom are being crushed by Nazis, is -- like America of later 1930s-- coming finally to understand his/America's necessary entry into WW2.  As a powerful political film, Ilsie symbolizes innocent and fraigle France, and Rick clearly stands for all of America in the very early 1940s which is, at first, opposed to taking anyone's side but changes when fully aware of the evil of the Nazis.  Rick does kill a Nazi.  Thus, Rick's evolution and return to his previous freedom-fighting ways (America in WW1) is a clear call and justification of America's enry into WW2.Hollywood plots which have some overt political content, such as this one and, for example, COMING HOME or even ENEMY OF THE STATE, frequently posit the romantic love between a man and a woman to stand for the development of a political position.  In true Hollywood form, the man and woman are at first separated and stand for two political poles, but the politics are resolved by the loving union of the man and woman (gets/girl, loses/girl, gets/girl, or politics seem decent/politics are dirty/politics can be ok).  Frequently, this format sees the conversion toward ""politics can be ok"" when the girl yields sexually to the man.  It is an interesting and telling American format that makes palitable, via romance, a political position."	5.0	21st Century teens should know about this movie	2013-01-10	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AA6AJD8VKAMIC	Charles H. Martin	"Hands down, Casablanca is the best film I have ever seen. I have studied films from almost every genre, culture, and time period, and none of them have been as complete a package as this classic. Its influence on our culture cannot be denied; just look at the number of lines that anyone can recognize from the film, even if they've never seen it before (including the classic, ""Play it again, Sam,"" which no one actually says in the movie). It almost single-handedly formed the genre of the Hollywood romance as we know it today. But it's not a great movie because it's influential; it's influential because it's a great movie.At the heart of Casablanca is an amazing set of actors. Humphrey Bogart is the man everyone will recognize for his bitingly cynical hero Rick Blaine, and he plays it to perfection. The other actors in the film are just as powerful, playing their roles to perfection. Sam is a loyal friend and confidant of Rick's who tries to protect the stubborn barkeep. Ilsa is a confused and love-torn woman who honestly seems to love both her old lover Rick and her husband Victor Laslow. Claud Raines, arguably the best actor of the bunch, pitches in an excellent role as Louis, the smarmy captain of the police in Casablanca.Beyond the terrific performances in the film, the story itself is unique and tense. The setting of Casablanca adds a desperation to everyone's performance, and the love triangle between Ilsa, Rick, and Victor is ever-present, accentuated by the masterfully performed music, often a variation of the love song ""As Time Goes By."" The directing is top notch as the cameras focus on the desperation and tension in each actor's performance while at the same time breaking that tension with comedy at just the right moments. And of course, the ending is perfectly bittersweet, with Rick having to make the hardest decision and biggest sacrifice of his life.There have been many great films both before and after Casablanca. However, I have never seen another movie where I can't point out even one criticism or glaring flaw. Casablanca is truly unique, and in my mind is by far the best film of all time."	5.0	The Best Ever	2006-01-03	6	4	2

This is Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their best, and the supporting cast is full of well known actors of the time (Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson).Set in Casablanca during WW II, the plot focuses on the somewhat upscale ""Rick's Cafe Americaine"" where a healthy amount of black market deals are made, a lot of liquor is sold, and gambling is a losing proposition for most of the patrons. Casablanca was the hub for refugees trying to get passage to Portugal and the Americas and many of the documents required for transit had to be procured through questionable means. This is where the story takes off with the love triangle between Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid.We have been watching a lot of classic movies with our teens to show them where a lot of the quotes they hear come from, and Casablanca is very rich territory indeed: ""Play it, Sam"", ""Here's looking at you kid"", ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."", ""Round up the usual suspects"", ""We'll always have Paris""This movie has everything, including great acting, romance, action, good music, and exotic locations.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A423XLYS1Q1D6	"Christian Wheeler ""Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud..."	"One of the great movies of all time, a classic gem that is as entertaining today as it was in the 1940s. In Casablanca, Morocco, a haven for European expatriates fleeing Nazi rule, cafe owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) struggles to remain neutral. Into his life comes an old flame, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Lazslo (Paul Henreid), on the run from the Nazis (he's part of the French Resistance movement). Rick's neutrality is sorely tested as he is torn between his resurgent feelings for Ilsa and the need to see her and her husband escape the encroaching Nazis.Peerless, Oscar-winning direction, excellent dialogue, and outstanding performances highlight this legendary film. All of the leads are solid, with an especially good job by Bogart--he's cynical and detached one moment, subtly emotional the next. His pain often shows in his acerbic comments and devil-may-care attitude. But there's compassion somewhere in Rick's heart, and a desire to do the right thing. After all, he's fought for righteous causes before, yet seems reluctant to do so again. Why? Part of Rick's mystique is the fact that that question is never answered. His romance with Ilsa--both past and present--rings true; Ilsa and Rick ache for each other, yet they are torn between their romance and the necessity of her marital vows coupled with the need to keep Laszlo alive for the sake of the French Resistance. Ilsa still loves Rick, yet she's also very devoted to Laszlo. This set the standard for tragic romances loooong before ""Titanic.""The fine supporting performances include a slick, conniving turn by Peter Lorre and a wry one by Claude Raines as the corrupt (but curiously sympathetic) police chief Reynaud. The character interactions (especially the good rapport between Raines and Bogart) and motivations are convincing  and well-thought out. Even the music is wonderful; can Dooley Wilson sing, or what?This multiple Oscar winner (Direction, Picture, Screenplay; should have won more, in my opinion) has many wonderful highlights: Wilson singing ""As Time Goes By;"" Henreid leading the French National Anthem in front of a group of Nazis; the unexpected, heartbreaking, and memorable finale. Indeed, this film has become indelibly embedded in our popular culture; expressions such as ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" ""We'll always have Paris,"" and ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" are familiar parts of our culture. Fantastic in every way, nearly perfect; multiple viewing may be required to catch all of the subtleties of this extraordinary film. A classic!About the DVD: Why no varied formats, and why so few extras? Other than a documentary featuring Lauren Bacall, there's little else of note.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AENI3U0Z7UJBH	Christine Lee	"One of the best love stories of the twentieth century. This was originally just a low budget film produced by Warner Bros in the 1940's, and wasn't expected to do too well at the box office.This is the one film that Humphrey Bogart starred in with Ingrid Bergman, but together they light up the screen like no other screen couple has since. He is Rick Blane, he owns a nightspot in Casablanca called Rick's Cafe ( the original title of this movie was 'Everybody Comes To Rick's'). Rick spends most of his time running his saloon, or sitting in the dark drinking bourbon and dreaming of memories past. Into all of this comes Ilsa Lundt, a woman he fell in love with in Paris, but who mysteriously stood him up at the train station when they had planned to elope.Rick has never laid eyes on her since that day when his insides had been kicked out, but here she is again in the company of Victor Lazlo, a freedom fighter considered an enemy of the Nazis. And they have come to Casablanca seeking safe passage to America, and Rick may be the only one who can help. But will he let his feelings for Ilsa (feelings he has long denied having)interfere with what is best for the woman he loves?This is a standout classic not just for some of it's lines ""We'll always have Paris"", or Dooley Wilson's dulcet tones crooning 'As Time Goes By' just for the two star crossed love birds. But also for the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman who lights up the screen each time she walks on, or for the brooding Humphrey Bogart as he cries into his bourbon for his torn heart. This film will certainly prove that sometimes you just have to let love go, that sometimes even though it feels right, you just have to say ""We'll always have (fill in the blank)' A film not to be missed."	5.0	As time goes by	2002-08-24	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AVTATH1R5ILLT	Christopher Gooch	"I may be prejudiced by the fact that I absolutely hate romance.  Romantic comedy and musicals I can stand (to an extent, as I don't like An American in Paris).  But I hate pure romance.I came into the movie thinking it was something like Notorious, romantic suspense or something of that nature.  I was incredibly wrong.  It was pure romance, pure romance.Basically the plot is this: Rick (Humphrey Bogart), who runs a bar in Casablanca, where all the refugees go (during WWII), sees an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) again.  This recalls the days in Paris shortly before he left.  She comes and talks to him.  She says she's married to this guy (Paul Hendrid).  Rick had seen them together in his bar.  The guy is prominent on the Nazi blacklist and so the Gestapo, who just arrived, want to see to it that he stays in Casablanca.  There are some twists and the movie ends.Seen that way, it seems absurd that anyone could stretch this over the course of a movie an hour and forty minutes long.  Frankly it is.  Sure, I cut out all the mushy parts and the fancy lines (""Here's looking at you, kid!""), etc.Claude Rains and Peter Lorre are the best actors of the bunch.  Bergman is okay.  Hendrid sort of mutters his lines so it's hard to understand them.  I hate Bogart's voice-it's raw, high-pitched and sort of shrill.  That and he kind of slurs or has a lisp or something.  And his looks-his face looks like a hollowed out corps-haggard.  Probably he was on drugs or alcohol.The opening was horrible.  Unnecessary and left me wondering who the movie was going to be about.  I mean, I have no problem with establishing shots.  But never should the camera stop on a person and should those people have an honest to goodness line (not brushing over).  It makes you think the movie's gonna be about them.  But the opening to this movie does that constantly.People say this is the best movie that has ever been made.  I'll second that, with one minor modification, ""it's the worst movie that has ever been made"".  Fine, maybe not the worst.  But just plain stupid.  Not worth watching again.  No tension, no real suspense.  It's a good movie to see what WWII was like (this was made before it was over).  Other than that, it stinks on ice."	2.0	Straight romance, mushy and slow	2006-03-29	48	4	44

There's romance, espionage, mystery, and of course, the song.  The characters are well developed, flawed (in a very good way), and the story isn't spoon-fed to the viewer like most modern movies.  In fact, the film is but a snippet of a complete story, and the viewer is left to decide what happens to the protagonists and the leader of the rebellion.If you haven't seen this gem, stop what you're doing and watch it!	5.0	My Favorite Film of all Time	2013-04-21	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AQ6DPRI12F5JU	claude pacla	This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the &quot;tough guy with tender heart&quot;, helpless woman who &quot;suffers&quot; because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing.And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I guess most of the enthusiasm for this film comes from old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male.	2.0	This film has badly aged	2004-07-08	44	10	34

"One thing I always hated with certain people is that they label films ""undeniable classics"" and if you so much as question the film or say it's bad, you're automatically verbally assaulted by people saying how wrong you are and why they're classics. Casablanca I've found that there's lots of people who love the film and will defend it if need be, which is great because it'd be funny if someone wanted to defend let's say, From Justin to Kelly.Rick Blaine owns a bar in a town called Casablanca in the 1940's.  He doesn't really talk to people or share drinks and he barely pays attention to his girlfriend.  Casablanca is under French Vishy control and there's Nazis crawling all over. 2 couriers are killed and papers signed by Charles de Gaulle are stolen. In these papers, whoever signs their name is allowed safe passage out of Casablanca so naturally everyone wants them.All is fine until Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund have stopped in the bar. Victor is a kind of a hero fighting the Nazis. His wife however knows Rick personally. They were once lovers in Paris before German troops came in and they split up, leaving him heartbroken on the train platform. So naturally he's upset, like he says: ""of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the places of the world she had to walk into mine"". And so we're dealing with 2 characters who are conflicted and have to deal with their past and also who gets the papers, which Rick actually controls.A film I think becomes a classic when it almost seems to transcend it's medium, where it's quoted or referenced. Infamous lines in cinema like ""hasta la vista baby"", ""here's looking at you kid"", ""we all get a little mad sometimes"" and music themes like Jaws and Star Wars almost become part of pop culture. Casablanca has quite a few of these with the here's looking at you kid, of all the gin joints..., beautiful friendship and play it again Sam becoming well known quotes in cinema history.Not to mention it's a good film too. There's not a lot of actors/actresses who can tell you so much just by a look. There's a scene where Rick finds out that Ilsa is in his bar. You don't know their history yet just their looks tell you all you need to know. There's some missteps however. There's a scene where Paul Henreid(Laszlo) has a conversation with Rick(Bogart) near the end. Bogart has a long look and almost like assessing this guy and figuring him out. But Henreid just stares blankly almost like he's remembering the lines in his head and it's throughout the film too, he's almost wooden in a way.But, if you ever feel the need to just watch a good film, can't go wrong with this one."	5.0	It's striking how this still holds up	2005-03-21	3	1	2

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	First, let's go with the performances of some of the leadingcharacters, and let me start by stating that most of thecharacterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film,by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the threetop billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, IngridBergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband,the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtuallyall critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainlybecause the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But,from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the bestacting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because itis the most restrained and understated, however, it usually getsdismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionallystiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in powerprecisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural fora man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film,and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the politicalimplications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do mostblatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrainedperformance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare thatscene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned PathsOf Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front ofdrunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until shestarts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love.The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along withthe 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured bycarnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure andplacement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mereentertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated,without the character (in his physical being and internal composition)of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prosemelodrama.Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather onedimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. Hisattraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashbackscenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak ofhigher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No.That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances:Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it'snot a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only lookat contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford,Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales incontrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, notRick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that shewould have stayed with Rick, no matter.But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that itsimply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There isnothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically orperformance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the otherhighly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane,Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001: A Space Odyssey,Casablanca comes up short, way short.On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing(and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelveminutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for goodor ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them underyour belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in toits vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if,objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting.Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the mostdecisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrongfor several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies towardfilms or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has beenclaimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems.

What I will say is that anyone who loves this movie should rush to buy this beautifully restored version. If you've only ever seen Casablanca on TV or a video version made from a less than perfect print, then this will be a revelation - it's like seeing it the way it was in the theatres back in 1943. The sharpness of the images, the interplay of light and shadow, the radiance of the visuals, the clarity of the sound - it's all breathtaking. This is glorious black and white at its best. And if that isn't enough, there is a second disc of intriguing extras. The cartoon version is my favorite, especially Tweetie Bird doing Peter Lorre. A true classic treated the way it deserves.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"These special releases of classic films are fantastic DVD editions.  It's so nice to see these films in all their retouched glory - no more struggling through the grainy VHS transfers, no more distorted sound, etc.  The Casablanca DVD does not disappoint.  In addition to its fine physical reproduction, it is certainly one of the best films ever made.The story (for the few that don't know) - Ilsa and Rick are lovers in Paris at the time of the Nazi Occupation.  They make plans to flee to Morocco, but Ilsa stands Rick up and he has to leave without her.  A year or two later, she finally makes it to Casablanca with a man in tow - her husband Victor, who happens to be an anti-Nazi Czech leader.  This sets up intrigue between the French resistance trying to get Victor away from the Nazis, the Nazis who are trying to imprison him, and the black marketeers who buy and sell exit visas.  Throw in the Rick-Ilsa-Victor love triangle, corrupt Vichy officials, and a healthy dose of humour, and you have a movie that stands the test of time and is more enjoyable each successive viewing.The performances, story, etc. are fantastic.  If the special effects are laughable (and they are!), you don't even notice because you're drawn in and engaged in the story.  The ending is a masterful series of twists, but it never cheats and once you've seen it, it is extremely satisfying but not predictable.Unfortunately, younger viewers are bound to think that the entire film is cliched (as I did, the first time I saw it).  It has been so often imitated that it's unlikely you'll see this before some imitation.  This is especially true of the dialogue - young viewers may even laugh at the cliched lines, not knowing that it was in Casablanca that they all originated: ""the usual suspects,"" ""of all the gin joints...,"" ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"" etc.  Repeated viewings and the most rudimentary knowledge of cimematic history dispells this problem because the film is so much richer than just its most memorable quotes.This DVD edition has some nifty extras - about 3 hours of Lauren Bacall's reminiscences on hubby Bogart, interviews with film historians, archival footage, etc.  The two commentaries are interesting - one by film historian Rudy Behlmer and the other by critic Roger Ebert.  Ebert's commentary is probably more interesting in that he offers a number of personal opinions (for example, he observes that Henried and Bergman have no chemistry between them, and speculates that Claude Rains's character is meant to be homosexual).  They even found some cut scenes to include.  It's good value for the price, even if you only watch the extras once."	5.0	Play it, Sam	2004-09-24	5	2	3

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	ANIHXYXKPZL2H	"C. Roberts ""movie buff"""	"What is there that a reviewer can say about ""Casablanca"" which is new? Surely just about everyone has now seen this film and everybody knows the plot which is set during World War Two at a night club owned by American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in Casablanca frequented by many dubious characters of all nationalities. Just to complicate matters in walks Ilsa Lund Laszlo (Ingrid Bergman), his ex lover from years before who had abandoned him. She is now married to resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) on the run from the Germans. Bogart can help by supplying them with the vital transit papers they desperately need to escape to America but is he willing to do that when his policy has always been ""I stick my neck out for nobody""?One of the great Warner Bros. films of the forties - possibly the most productive decade in the history of Hollywood .... and how about all those ""classic lines""? It is very unlikely that any other movie contained as many quotable lines as can be found in ""Casablanca"".Here are just a few of my many favourite lines from the film:Humphrey Bogart: ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"".Ingrid Bergman: ""Play it Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'.""Bogart: ""You played it for her, you can play it for me .... if she can stand it, I can. Play it"".Bogart: ""Here's looking at you, kid"".Bogart: ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"".Claude Rains: ""Major Strasser has been shot. Round up all the usual suspects"".Bogart: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"".The film is worth seeing over and over again just to hear Bogart uttering those unforgettable lines in his inimitable style. And of course to enjoy that celebrated song by Dooley Wilson - ""As Time Goes By"". Incredibly it has been reported that Dooley Wilson was a singer but NOT a pianist so his playing was done by another musician.""Casablanca"" featured one of those all star casts that only come along once in a lifetime - Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, and Dooley Wilson. (It has been claimed that the first choice of leading players was to have been Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan but if this proposed casting  is correct and had gone ahead I doubt if the film would have received the cult following it has today!).""Casablanca"" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Curtiz) and Best Screenplay (Julius and Philip Epstein). It also had nominations for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Score. Humphrey Bogart didn't receive the award for Best Actor but he was recognised some years later when he won the Best Actor Award for ""The African Queen"". In my opinion he should also have won for his outstanding portrayal as Fred C. Dobbs in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) and again for ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954).BOOKS. There have been many many books written about Humphrey Bogart but I can confidently recommend ""BOGART"" by A.M.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A25CZCHLNH3OMO	Cuckoo Pine Nut	I first saw this movie over a year ago. I was at a friend's house, and she had some friends over. I got partway through, then she asked me to join her party. I served as a non-participating bystander until they all drank themselves to sleep around 1.30 or 2 in the morning - then I finished the movie. Despite the interruption, I thought it was a wonderful film.The second time and the third time and every time since, I see it and think, &quot;This is so fine. I don't think I ever understood it before.&quot; Because there are so many characters and they all have their complex personalities and situations.Ingrid Bergman is beautiful as always and wears some pretty interesting outfits. Look for the one with the appliqu&eacute;d hearts. At least they look appliqu&eacute;d. Humphrey Bogart bends away slightly from his &quot;tough guy&quot; personality and smiles in a few of the flashback scenes. Paul Henreid doesn't have a very big part, unfortunately, but he makes the most of what he is given. But in my opinion, it is really Claude Rains that steals the show here. He has all the good lines; he cuts a snappy figure in the French uniform; and he lends a charming humour to each scene he is in. Of course he is a womaniser (that just dawned on me the last time I saw it - yeah, I know, wake up), but... Anyway.The music is also very good, and to use my mother's words, the &quot;groovy globe&quot; at the beginning is - well - pretty groovy.Well, anyway, what I have to say, it's nothing new - I like this movie and I think it's one of the best Hollywood ever turned out.

There were true characters in the movie, not people playing themselves, which was very refreshing in the face of today's movie climate.There are so many plot points and mini twists and turns in the dialogue and character interaction that this is a movie one has to watch several times to get the full experience.Ingrid Bergman gives a very good and skillful performance, even better than Bogart. But the whole cast is very good, and this is just a classic movie for everyone to see, ecspecially if you think that profanity laden erotic murder makes for the best movie of all time.The different style makes it unattractive at first, but let that go and see the majesty that is Casablanca.	5.0	Pretty nice	2007-03-12	2	1	1

It's a single disk release.First of all... NO JAVA!!!This means the disk loads quickly and auto-resume works.I just compared this with the DVD release.Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition). The menus are better implemented and you have more choices in subtitles.The transfer is super sharp and crisp. They took full advantage of Blu-ray's capabilities. I was hesitant to buy this release as I already owned the DVD. I'm glad I did. The difference between the two is immediately obvious. Don't get me wrong, the DVD is a good release, it's just limited by DVD technology.Sometimes I'll have both the DVD and Blu-ray version of a movie. In some the special features are implemented better in the DVD. The Patriot is one where this is true. Also I'll often want fast loading or auto-resume.There are times I've regretted buying a Blu-ray version of a movie I own on DVD. In this case I see no reason to keep my DVD disk.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A315K47GRB024C	Daniel C. Markel	This review is for the two-disc 2003 Special Edition DVD by Warner Brothers.I've probably seen this movie six times in the last 25 years and it still never grows old.  This Special Edition DVD is heaven sent with all the extra features plus the outstanding image quality.The story is about an American named Rick (played by Humphrey Bogart) who owns a popular cafe/casino in Casablanca during World War II.  The significance of Casablanca, which is in Northern Africa, is that it is a popular place to come to for refugees who are fleeing from the Nazi occupied European countries and will hopefully find political asylum in America.  Crooked law enforcement officers have corrupted the town and now the Nazis have now just started arriving in Casablanca.  The central plot deals with a beautiful wife named Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Lazlow, who are both trying to leave Casablanca but need exit visas, which are nearly impossible to obtain.  Since the Nazis want Lazlow, he needs to leave Casablanca or possibly face prison or even death.  Most of the movie takes place in Rick's Cafe with many memorable lines and scenes.  The thing that sets this movie apart from all others is the tremendous ending.  It's truly the consummate love story and exemplifies what true love is.As for the DVD, the picture quality is perfect, if not stunning.  There is not a single sign of film deterioration or graininess during the entire movie except for some war newsreel scenes, which I assume they chose not to restore for the sake of authenticity.  (My personal feeling is that I wish they did restore the war footage). The contrast of the picture quality is outstanding and the black and white tones are tremendous.  The Special Edition version is well worth the extra money compared to the previously released versions.Movie: A+++DVD Quality: A	5.0	Hands down, the greatest movie ever made!	2005-07-19	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"Welcome to Casablanca, in French Morocco.  The year, 1942, with the Third Reich at its height in World War II.  But the multi-themed, multilayered movie of the same name, based on a Murray Burnett play originally titled ""Everybody Comes To Rick's,"" well, is the story of people searching for hope in a hopeless world, with mixes of intrigue, danger, the eternal triangle, the rebirth of one's soul emerging out of the chasm of cynicism, and fighting for a broader cause rather than looking out for number one.Amid the teeming masses of those who wait and wait and wait and wait to get their exit visa signed by French police prefect Louis Renault, a corrupt official with a charming air, many of them will go to Rick's Cafe Americain, where there's gambling, dodgy deals, and even an arrest that makes for an exciting evening.  The owner, Rick (Richard Blaine), is an American expatriot who is completely neutral about everything, which is an asset for both the Vichy French and the Nazis.  ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" he tells Renault, who replies ""A wise foreign policy.""  However, it's Ferrari, the rotund owner of the Blue Parrot who tells Rick that ""isolation is no longer a practical policy.""  Renault too shares Rick's isolationist view by telling Major Strasser, a visiting German officer, that he blows with the wind, and ""the prevailing wind is from Vichy.""  He's just a bureaucrat doing his job, with lots of perks.Enter, or in Rick's case, reenter, Ilsa Lund, with whom he had a whirlwind romance in Paris and with whom he was set to flee before the Gestapo got to him.  Alas, there came ""the wild finish-a guy on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out.""  Ilsa is here with her husband Victor Laszlo, a Czech resistance leader and key figure trying to unify opposition to the Third Reich.  Ilsa wants to explain about that last day, but seeing what Rick has become has left her disheartened with him.  And Renault is interested in keeping Laszlo in Casablanca, but also in getting some transit papers the black marketeer Ugatti passed on to Rick before his arrest.  Despite Rick's neutrality, he suspects ""that under that cynical shell, you're at heart a sentimentalist.""  that becomes true when Rick's old wounds are opened, seen all too poignantly when he places his hands in his head.Casablanca is also a place where ""human life is a commodity,"" where the worst elements of humanity cluster, trying to exploit those less fortunate. This is underscored by Ferrari, who swats flies at his place, demonstrating the value of human life in Casablanca.  Casablanca is also a place where the Nazis have outlawed miracles.  However, as things turn out, miracles do not come in the divine sense of the word.  Rather, it is people who become miracles by their actions and convictions of their heart.There are many other characters here apart from Ferrari.  There's the pickpocket, Carl, Rick's waiter and accountant, Sasha, the Russian barkeep, and a Bulgarian couple hoping for their chance at freedom.Although Ilsa's the one that's reawakened Rick's humanity, I'd argue that it's the young Bulgarian girl hoping to get out of Casablanca with her husband and approaches Rick who actually sets him on the road to losing his cynicism.  She asks him ""If someone loved you very much that your happiness was the only thing she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?...and he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart.  That would be all right, wouldn't it?""  That brings into mind the flashback seen, with Rick and Ilsa the epitomy of a couple in the throes of romance, and it's quite a shock to see why he's the cynic that he is.Parts of this movie have been used in other films.  Bogie's speech to Bergman at the ending of Casablanca has been cannibalized by Woody Allen in Play It Again Sam and in the Red Dwarf story Camille, in a very bizarre way.  But the most effective tribute has been the hit BBC series As Time Goes By, taken from the immortal song from Casablanca, with that as the theme song.All the characters and actors are wonderful, with Bogie at his best, Ingrid Bergman at her loveliest, Claude Rains at his most dapper as Renault, and Sydney Greenstreet pulling in another hammy role as Ferrari.  And this was one of Conrad Veidt's (Strasser) last roles, as he died of a heart attack a year later.  This would have been a totally different movie had Ronald Reagan, Dennis Morgan, and Anne Sheridan played Rick, Victor, and Ilsa.I've seen this many times and enjoyed it more everytime.  What do I do when I'm in the mood for this?  Yes, you guessed it...play it again."	5.0	You must remember this...	2003-11-15	2	1	1

Unlike many &#34;old movies&#34;, this story transcends its particulars to explore the painful and often wrenching conflict in the human heart between serving oneself and serving the greater good: the quintessential question that defines character.

'Isn't it amazing how it lasts ...?', she observed of the Bogey-Bergman film that had moved me so. Indeed.She grew up with movies and Hollywood. I did not. I'm just catching up with cultural slice of Americana. There's a reason why CASABLANCA routinely appears in the top ten on lists of the greatest films ever made. 'Amazing how it's lasted.Bogey is superb in his wit and cynicism. As a newcomer to his films, I can't discern whether this accrues to Bogart as actor or, alternatively, to Bogart as beneficiary of superb writers. One thing for sure, after this film I'll have opportunity to form an opinion on that. CASABLANCA will *not* be my last Bogey film.Bergman in soft focus nearly makes the cameraman tremble. In a day when a woman's beauty had to be portrayed by means other than having her remove her clothes, Bergman comes across as irresistible, compelling, a woman worthy of waiting at a train station when everyone except you knows she won't show. Perhaps even the kind of woman who could entice a man like Bogey's Rick to abandon his practiced and protective cynicism. A woman, even, worthing sticking his neck out for. Rick, it is observed more than once, sticks his neck out for no one. It is one of the film's ironic and pivotal lies, for in fact he does.The casting, as many reviewers have observed, is arguably perfect. There is not a slow movement in this film, remarkable in a motion picture with very little of what we would today call 'action'.CASABLANCA is one for the ages. It's astonishing, as the good woman might have said, how it lasts.	5.0	amazing how it lasts	2007-07-21	2	2	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	"""Casablanca"" is a great movie classic for many audiences to enjoy.  It deservingly won three Oscars in 1943, including Best Picture.  This was filmed and written beautifully.  This highly original plot has influenced many movies filmed after this, and it remains ahead of its time.  Despite its war theme, it digs deep into the romance and jelously elements.  The plot continues to build as Rick (played by Humphrey Bogart) feels more obligated to protect his ex-lover Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) and her husband from any Nazis in the area.  Many twists and turns arise, always keeping audiences interested.  The acting from all the performers is marvelous.  Bogart, previously known as the rough guy, wonderfully transforms himself into a more sensative guy for his Oscar nominated role.  Though a lot of roughness still lingers, the change is very noticable.  Bergman beautifully portrays her sense of danger and love in one of her best roles in her career.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform wonderfully.  ""Casablanca"" proves that it will remain a classic for many more years.  It is sure to please audience of all kinds.""Here's lookin' at you, kid."""	5.0	Great War Epic	2004-01-17	3	3	0

Personally, as far as it's place in the Bogart canon, I rank ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" above ""Casablanca"".  That's not to diminish the film but it just goes to show what an impressive body of work Bogart left behind.  There's more quotable dialogue here this side of Tarantino.  Snappy dialogue wouldn't work if you didn't have the right actors delivering it.  Aside from Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the supporting ensemble on hand here(Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, et al.) seemed to have been plucked from heaven.

He is placed in the position of choosing between doing what is best for himself or for the world at large.  I think everybody knows his decision since this film features the most famous good-bye scene of any movie.  After all these years, this film remains fresh.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	"What can be said of Casablanca that has not already been said?  This may be the most perfect movie ever.  Ingrid Bergman is luminous as Ilse.  She loved Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) when the two were in Paris (Rick didn't know at the time that Ilse was married) but when Hitler invaded, they had to escape quickly.  Ilse promised to meet Rick at the train station, but never showed.Years later, ""out of all the gin joints in the world, she walks into mine"" laments Rick.  He is still in love with her, but her husband must leave the country and needs papers that Rick may have.  Without the papers, he will die in Casablanca.In addition to Bogart and Bergman, Claude Rains is great as the policeman.  He brings several moments of levity to the film.  My favorite is when he shuts the bar down because he is ""shocked, shocked to discover that gambling is going on"", and in the next moment an employee hands him his winnings for the night.Of course, all the cliched lines are very famous from this film.  It should be noted that the line ""Play it again, Sam"" never was actually spoken by a character in the film.  However, lines like ""Round up the usual suspects"" and the film's closing line are so common that they have become part of everyday lexicon.  Incidentally, if you have never seen the film and don't know what the last line is, believe me, when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.I don't know if I could recommend a movie more.  One hour forty minutes has never gone by so quickly.  I have seen it at least a dozen times and I never tire of it.

I still experience that &quot;gee-whiz&quot; feeling when I see the best of these restorations, and this is without question one of the best.  It's as if I had been watching this movie through a dirty window for years, and WB came along and didn't bother to clean the window, but busted it out entirely.  The black and white is so clean and so crisp that it's possible to appreciate the line and shadow and pattern to a degree that could not be done before, unless one had the good fortune to see it sixty years ago.While the outtakes and deleted scenes are pretty esoteric (film scraps really rather than anything of genuine interest; too bad they didn't save their fluffs), the documentaries, one of which I'd seen before, are excellent and a great addition to the disk.  Having Bacall around is a plus, and a rarity.  Most of the people involved in these classic films just aren't around anymore, and finding someone to talk about them in anything other than an academic way is going to be increasingly difficult.A great movie and a great restoration.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AD8VTHD5HXN9T	D.D.	This DVD release is everything you could hope for. I do have an issue with Roger Ebert's commentary, though. Why would he consider as his &quot;favorite&quot; film one in which he relentlessly and cruelly derides one of the three leads? I think Paul Henreid is as wonderful as everyone else in &quot;Casablanca&quot;...his acting style is nowhere near the dated, stiff performance found in other films of this era. He is noble and urbane, and a necessary contrast to Bogart's deeply conflicted character. If there is a choice to be made, one has to perceive a difference between the two men. The business about &quot;reading off a cue card&quot; undermines the reasoning for selection as one of the best films of all time. (Rather, I have always found Bogart to be a great presence, but not an actor of significant range, and &quot;Casablanca&quot; stretches him just beyond his limits.) To say that Henreid and Bergman have no chemistry is to call into question the strength of the triangle, which I find to be very solid. If Victor was as flawed and &quot;lovable&quot; a character as Rick, would we care so much which one she wound up with? Henreid's stoic persona is expressed with great subtlety and finesse, and is a benchmark for screen elegance.	5.0	Add Me To The 5-Star List! But Why Pick On Henreid?	2003-08-30	2	2	0

Rick is noble, self-sacrificing and romantic.He has loved this woman for years.  He continues to love her even though, in Paris,  she stood him up without explanation when they were planning to run off together.  Years later when she walks into his bar, he still loves her.  Even after he finds out that she had been married before but failed to mention said fact throughout their affair in Paris, he still loves her. After he finds out that the reason she didn't meet him at the train station was because her, presumed dead, husband had turned up, he never asks her why she didn't send a short message explaining the circumstances.  He continues to love her even as she plans to abandon her war hero husband.  He loves her as she sit's idly by and let's the men in her life make her moral decisions for her.Rick is a great charcter but the Ingrid Bergman character is far too passive to be the stuff of legends.	3.0	One sided greatness.	2006-06-17	13	0	13

Its just plain old boring drama.Its a movie that is planned to make u laugh, cry, suffer, so everyone has to like this film. They will find something and like it. And that guarantees its commercial success. But face it: its a love story like everyone else. Worst of it all, everybody tried to copy it and we were awarded with a lot of movies like this. That`s hell.Look, american people ( not everyone, but many of you) think that they have the best cinema in the world. the ""foreign movie"" category at academy award proves it. It goes like saying ""we are the best, but you can apply to that consolation prize"". Sorry for being cruel, but have in mind that there are better movies and directors in this world. Dont watch casablanca: watch lolita.Dont buy star wars ( though this one I like): buy 2001 a space odyssey. Dont go to When harry met sally, watch Band of outsiders by Jean Luc Godard. I`m not saying american movies are bad: you have the great Woody allen, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick... I could go on and on. Juist have in mind that european films are also great (some are boring, some arent at all. just give them a try). Keep this in mind: did you believed anything that happened in casablanca? it too much acted. Watch JEan Luc Godard.

Even if you don't especially like this film for one reason or another, it is a must see. There are so many classic lines from it, which are used in other movies, TV shows, even by comedians (though the lines were not originally comic in nature), that you should know them. How many times have you heard ""Here's lookin' at you, kid"" ?  or ""Play it again, Sam"" ? (not the exact words Bogart used, but that is the way they have become popularized). All in all, this is a must see film. That said, in my humble opinion TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was a better Bogart movie, and it is also a classic, but CASABLANCA is right up there with the best of them!"	5.0	All time classic!	2011-12-16	0	0	0

There are a lot of contenders -- ""Seven Samurai,"" perhaps -- but it's hard to beat the magic of this grand Hollywood war-noir classic, with its snappy dialog, gauzy black-and-white cinematography and delicious acting.  Plus, it's a great propaganda flick and historical timepiece. Yup, pretty much my favorite.  One downside: I miss the days when you'd see movies like this in the theater and actually have a communal cultural experience with other human beings.  Still, now that I have it on DVD, I looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. We'll always have Bogie and Bacall.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AAT2JIIADQDUP	"DJ McGovern ""Derek McGovern"""	Not only is this film the greatest Hollywood movie ever made, it is also the most quotable. The credit should surely go the Epstein brothers, whose incomparably witty script included some of the greatest lines in English language cinema. Their stock in trade was classic chutzpah, and it is amazing how much of their dialogue has entered the popular vocabulary. (For copious examples, check out the Quotes &amp; Trivia on this page.)There is little I wish to add to the 200 (!) other reviews on this site, except to say that as a black and white photographer I was enthralled by the luminous quality in nearly every scene of this movie. Light and shadow have never been used more effectively, and greatly complement the sense of melodrama and romance.The word &quot;classic&quot; has been ridiculously overworked, but Casablanca deserves the highest accolades for its excellence in every aspect: its script, performances, cinemaphotography, direction, music..., in short, the movie is a staggering achievement.The image on the DVD is flawless, and I found the accompanying documentary very informative.	5.0	Extraordinary in every respect	2001-11-23	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2BR4WDIUJYI99	Domiano	"One could say that ""Casablanca at its core is about love and romance"", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But Casablanca is much more then an ordinary romantic fling. The lovers who met in Paris found things about each other that excited them and made them yearn for an even more intimate relationship; but ironically what they didn't know about each other set the stage for a far more profoundly consequential development one which neither of them would have initially chosen.The conclusion of Casablanca can be characterized but Rick words to Elsa, ""remember we will always have Paris""; for it the essence of what this extraordinary movie is about and that is that the passion and feelings that the two  lovers felt for each other paled in comparison to the profound cause that Elsa's husband was fighting for i.e., the defeat of the Nazi cancer that was sweeping across Europe, and that it was ultimately the extraordinary character of Rick, cynical, selfish  Rick, that moved him ever reluctantly and sadly to conclude that Elsa's husband needed her to continue his cause and that cause was more important and profound than an even a loving relationship between a man and a women.One could say that ""Casablanca at its core is about love and romance"", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But the core theme of Casablanca is much more than about an great romantic interlude; it about the character of man who was moved to give up the love of his life for a cause, that sadly he found far more worthy.You don't see that strength of character very often in so called ""real life"" and this is what separates Casablanca from other great movies and makes it perhaps the greatest in the history of cinema."	5.0	"The great ""Casablanca"""	2012-04-23	5	3	2

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM	Dom Miliano	"I laughed out loud when a younger co-worker told me he had never seen Casablanca - ""I don't like black and white movies"" was his reason. Instead of mocking him, I felt pity - as if a person had said he had never tasted chocolate ice cream. Yes, Casablance is that good a movie. The cast, cinematography, plot, script and acting are as close to perfect as you could imagine. Bogart's stunning portrayal of a bitter, cynical man with a broken heart should have won him an Oscar. When he describes his politics to a visiting Nazi honcho with the phrase, ""I'm a drunkard..."" it is both comedy and tragedy.To me, the mark of a memorable movie is if there are memorable, quotable lines and here, Casablanca leads the league. ""I'm shocked, shocked! that there's gambling going on here."" - ""We'll always have Paris."" - ""Here's looking at you kid,"" - and the phrase Bogart never said ""Play it again Sam.""  Actually, he said, ""You played it for her you can play it for me. If she can stand it, I can. Play it!"" Experts say this is probably the most popular movie in the world, an opinion I share. You need this DVD - find someone you love, cuddle on the sofa and let time go by.Proof that there is a higher power can be traced to the fact that B-movie icon, Ronald Ray-Gun was offered the part of Rick and he turned it down.  ""Who wants to play opposite an unknown Swedish actress?"" was his reason.

While many may label it as a romantic film, I think is something much more than that. Aside from the great performances of Bogart, Bergman, Henried, Reins and all the others, the film has a certain appeal that does not feel dated and makes you want to see it again and again.It's one of those films that must be in any collection because it belongs to that rare class of films that can be called Masterpieces.I've been wanting to buy Casablanca on DVD (I don't have a Blu-Ray player) but the ultimate collector's edition was very expensive as was the 2003 2-disc DVD (which is repackaged in the UCE with a documentary about Jack Warner). Then, Warner reissue that DVD in a  cheaper box and just cost $9,99!!! It was a bargain for a great film. This 2009 DVD is the same as the 2003. The picture is crisp, clear and perfect. No artifacts and only some minor (really minor) grain in some scenes. The audio is crisp without background noises. The extras are excellent with audiocomentaries, documentaries, and more. A must own edition for a must own film.If you don't own Casablanca yet, right now is the best time. This 2009 edition is perfect and really cheap.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A34CQFE2ZR3GCO	"Dr Lim Michael ""thetravellinggourmet"""	"Yes, ""Play it!"" is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic ""Casablanca"". No genuine movie buff can ever forget that song with those ultra-romantic lines, ""A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh."" Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic, intriguing anti-fascist adventurer with a facade of cynicism. In many ways he is better than James Bond. Immaculate in his white dinner jacket, he feels betrayed by the love of his life, Ilsa and harbours a deep seated grudge and resentment against her for not meeting him at the train station in Paris to flee from the Nazis. Rick is a hard man with a heart of pure 24 karat gold. It is a troubled time when the Nazi Wehrmacht invades Paris. Rick has to flee because he fought against Franco's Fascists in Spain and is on the Geheim Staats Polizei black list. It is better known as the Gestapo.  The story set against a Europe ablaze with the fiery flames of a terrible war, is of the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant and ethearel beauty is absolutely mesmerizing. The chemistry between the two sizzle like a fondue. My all time favourite scene is where Captain Renault, the corrupt French Prefect of Police asks Rick, ""Why did you come to Casablanca?"". Rick says nonchalantly, ""My health, I came here for the waters."" Stunned, Renault interjects, ""Waters, what waters? We're in the middle of the desert!"" Rick calmly drawls sardonically, ""I was misinformed."" Another classic scene is when Captain Renault closes Rick's Cafe Americain and says, ""I'm shocked, shocked to find there's illegal gambling here"". Rick's fat waiter comes along and gives Renault some money which he won at the gambling tables and says, ""Your winnings, Sir"". Such true to life corruption and satirism is hard to find in any movie nowadays. I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it. It inspires me every time. Another amusing thing is that many of the characters are named after cars, for example Ferrari and Renault. One intriguing question you must ask yourself is whether Rick committed adultery by making mad, passionate love to Ilsa the whole night long when she desperately tried all means to get the letters of transit for her husband. Did they or did they not. The Director never spells it out but leaves it to your imagination. Later, she schemes with Rick to leave Casablanca together and abandon her husband to the Nazis. However, Rick is too good a gentleman to break up their marraige. Instead he rescues them from the Germans. One round from his trusty blue nosed .45 calber Colt autoloader into the Nazi Major's black heart and it's curtains for him. Rick then walks off into the sunrise cooly with his good friend, Louis, saying those immortal lines, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Recently, I was in the Westin St. Francis San Francisco and as I was leaving the Compass Rose, my friend the resident pianist played my favourite song for me and it made my day.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1ST35PZRX4W0K	Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet	"Yes, ""Play it!"" is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic ""Casablanca"". No genuine movie buff can ever forget that song with those ultra-romantic lines, ""A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh."" Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic anti-fascist adventurer with a facade of cynicism. It is the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant beauty is absolutely mesmerizing. My favourite scene is where Captain Renault, the corrupt French Prefect of Police asks Rick, ""Why did you come to Casablanca?"". Rick says nonchalantly, ""My health, I came here for the waters."" Stunned, Renault interjects, ""Waters, what waters? We're in the middle of the desert!"" Rick calmly drawls sardonically, ""I was misinformed."" I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AQ549H93Y3WIT	dsteimle@plainfield.bypass.com	Watching Casablanca is like greeting an old friend. Sure, one has probably seen it many times and, definitely, one probably knows the dialogue by heart, but there is something that keeps you coming back.  Bogart is in top  form and the pairing with Ingrid Bergman is first rate. One has to wonder  if the world would have been a different place if Warner Bros. first choice  for the role, Ronald Reagan, had played Rick. Would Casablanca be the  classic it is today? Would Reagan have gone into politics? These are  questions that don't, and won't have answers. The story is one that holds  the attention and the supporting cast is one of the best, from Peter  Lorre's courier to Conrad Veidt as the German major and, in a class by  himself, Claude Rains as the politically astute Police Prefect. All in all,  Casablanca is a wonderful viewing experience for our time and for all time.	5.0	Casablanca's like an old friend	1999-02-19	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2TXR85WQLE32N	D. S. Thurlow	"""Casablanca"" is widely considered the classic romantic movie of all time.  Its themes of love and personal responsibility are timeless.  Its simple, straight-forward storyline has enthralled moviegoers for over half a century.In the French North Africa of 1942, Rick Blaine, a cynical Amercian expatriate with a shadowy past (played by Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular bar in the City of Casablanca.  Casablanca's administrators are under the thumb of the Nazi regime that occupied France in 1940.  On the run from the Nazis come a resistance leader named Victor (played by Paul Hanreid) and his wife Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman).  Ilsa is Rick's ex-lover from Paris, just before the war.  The two fugitives seek safe passage to America, a passage they can only obtain from Rick Blaine.The world-weary Rick is disinclined to stick his neck out to assist the two fugitives, but Ilsa pays him a nocturnal visit to renew old acquintances.  She finds to her surprise that she still loves Rick and he her.  She abandons herself to his judgement with respect to her future with him and the fate of her husband.  Rick is left to choose between the love of his life and the fate of a resistance leader who may be crucial to the defeat of the Nazis, a defeat not yet visible in the dark days of 1942.  His dilemma is at the heart of this movie's enduring appeal, as Rick must balance love with personal responsibility for a larger fate.The movie is populated with an excellent and well-sketched cast of supporting players: a corrupt French Police Chief with a heart of gold who is Rick's best friend in Casablanca; Sam the Piano Player, who renders the classic song ""As Time Goes by"" to a grieving Rick Blaine; Peter Lorre as an unlucky pickpocket, and Sidney Greenstreet as a seedy deal-maker.Among the classic moments in the movie are Victor leading the patrons of Rick's Bar in drowning out a group of obnoxious Nazi officers with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem; Rick ordering ""play it, Sam"" when Sam is reluctant to play Ilsa's favorite tune; and the goodbye scene at the airport, where Rick makes his dramatic choice and must live with the consequences.This movie is most highly recommended to anyone with an interest in a truly classic, and entertaining, movie."	5.0	Everyone Comes to Rick's	2007-03-17	1	1	0

Everyone has heard &quot;heres lookin at you  kid&quot; or this is the start of a beautiful friendship but if the viewer  only takes these phrases, that person has missed out on a lot more.

The sense of duty, of loyalty,  and of staying where you need to be, regardless of your own feelings, is  what makes this story stand out and shine. &quot;English Patient&quot; and  films with a similar plot can never match up to  this.&quot;Casablanca&quot; is a French city in the middle of the  Middle-Eastern desert, now overrun with Nazis. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick  Blaine, the cynical owner of Casablanca's best-known bar. The only person  who knows anything real about Rick is the piano player, Sam (known for the  immortal lines &quot;Sam, I thought I told you never to play...&quot; and  &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;) who was present in Paris long ago when  Rick's heart was broken.Years ago, Rick fell in love with a beautiful  woman named Ilse in Paris, who vanished when the Germans invaded. Now she's  back with her husband--Victor Laszlo, a patriot who works for the  underground. Rick is (not surprisingly) angry, even though he still loves  Ilse, and she still loves him.Bogart and Bergman exude excellent  chemistry--you can feel their pain and love. The cast is also blessed by  wonderful secondary characters, such as Sam, who seems to feel sorry for  Rick and Ilse; and Captain Louis Renault, a lovably amoral French official.  There's also a slimy little conman named Ugarte, and a slimy big  casino-owner named Renault, both of whom sell fake exit visas (these  characters, as well as Bogart, can be found in the &quot;Maltese  Falcon,&quot; so watch for them)Rick is a great man: He's hardened and  cynical, but as we watch, he helps people who have nothing for themselves,  and gives away his own happiness. The script also gives him many of the  wonderful lines: when little rat Ugarte asks, &quot;You despise me, don't  you?&quot;, Rick's only reply is, &quot;If I gave you any thought I  probably would.&quot;Though this is rated PG, most kids will be bored  silly by it--there's a lot of talking and angst and romance. Also, there's  one scene where a Bulgarian girl delicately hints at prostitution, but  anyone younger than their teens probably wouldn't pick it up (she only  refers to it as a &quot;bad thing&quot;).The sets are beautiful and  harsh, as harsh as Rick sees the world. The last scene is perhaps one of  the most famous in movie history. Like Audrey Hepburn's &quot;Roman  Holiday,&quot; the realistic and mature approach to difficult situations  are what make this story special. One of the best romances ever  filmed.&quot;Here's looking at you, kid.&quot;	5.0	A beautiful tale of love and self-sacrifice	2000-09-11	3	3	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"For the Warner Brothers wartime melodrama it was supposed to be, ""Casablanca"" feels so much more significant and multi-dimensional, a timeless movie that combines political espionage, romantic intrigue and a clever wit against the broader conflict between democracy and totalitarianism. This is illustrated most memorably by the dueling anthems scene where the German Nazi song ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" is drowned out by the French, who proudly and tearfully sing their anthem, ""La Marseillaise"". It's an unexpectedly powerful scene among so many wonderful moments, certainly enough to inspire Neil Simon to recycle it to comic effect in ""The Cheap Detective"", Peter Bogdanovich to send up another classic scene in ""What's Up, Doc?"" and Woody Allen to write ""Play It Again, Sam"" in tribute to the entire movie.Director Michael Curtiz had a strong track record of success before ""Casablanca"" (consider ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""), but this is clearly his career capper given the perfectly realized mix achieved of script, camerawork, music and cast. The screenplay written mostly by the Warners-bred Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, along with Howard Koch, was apparently done in haste well after filming began, but you certainly can't tell from the seamless structure, memorable dialogue and plethora of classic lines. Arthur Edeson's striking cinematography and the legendary Max Steiner's musical score also contribute significantly. But of course, one needs to recognize the chemistry between two amazing legends, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Bogart fully captures Rick's cynicism, sentimental interior and ever-hardening moral code in his individually charismatic fashion. Bergman is so glowingly beautiful and affecting as Ilsa that there is no question why Rick continues to pine over her. It is both a shame and something of a relief that they never co-starred with each other again, as there was next to no chance that they could ever top their teaming here.Warner Brothers regular Paul Henried plays Laszlo, the third corner of this romantic triangle with his continental manner grounded by his character's selfless patriotism. Surrounding them is the best of the Warner Brothers backlot of character actors: Sydney Greenstreet as rival proprietor Senor Ferrari, Peter Lorre as a slimy black market dealer, Conrad Veidt as Gestapo commander Major Strasser, S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall as the genial German headwaiter, and in particular, Claude Rains as the fey and amusingly corruptible chief-of-police Louis Renault. And of course, there is Dooley Wilson, who effectively plays piano-playing Sam and sings ""As Time Goes By"" with the perfect sense of nostalgic languor. It is pointless to go further into plot details as the story flows so flawlessly from Rick's Caf&eacute; Americain through a romantic haze of a flashback in Paris to its inevitable conclusion, which ironically was not so inevitable until the last minute. The ambiguity during filming probably added to the romantic tension since Bergman did not know with which leading man Ilsa was going to run off. Such is the stuff of Hollywood lore, and none, with the possible competition of ""Gone With the Wind"", seems to have as much of it as ""Casablanca"".The two-disc special edition package contains plenty of extras, some great, others disposable. The audio commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and film historian Rudy Behlmer are interesting for the individual perspectives both bring, though I kept wishing there was a survivor from the original production to provide authentic remembrances. On the second disc, the centerpiece is an 86-minute documentary (produced in 1988) recounting Bogart's career in surprising and often fascinating detail and hosted by a still striking-looking Lauren Bacall. There are some interesting bits like alternate takes of ""The Big Sleep"" and home movies taken during the filming of ""The African Queen"". There is another half-hour documentary, also interesting and again narrated off-screen by Bacall, on the actual making of ""Casablanca"".The extra disc also includes an abbreviated radio version of the movie from 1943 with the three stars, a fitfully funny Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon takeoff called ""Carrotblanca"", and a couple of intriguing deleted scenes from the actual movie, sadly without sound. The accompanying outtakes are hardly worth sitting through save for one priceless reaction shot of Bogart as he sits at the bar. There is yet a third documentary, not nearly as interesting as the other two but thankfully brief at seven minutes, which focuses solely on the scripted remembrances of Bogart and Bacall's son, Stephen, and Bergman's daughter, Pia Lindstrom. And certainly the most disposable extra is a rather worthless version of ""Casablanca"" taken from a TV series in the 1950's, which ends with an incongruous commercial for a GE iron. Regardless, this is a great package for a true classic and an essential addition to anyone's DVD collection."	5.0	Ageless Cinematic Masterpiece With Loads of Extras	2004-12-16	7	6	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A30NVSLEMRKEW1	"Eric ""OhioGuy"""	65 years after it first it theaters, CASABLANCA remains a perfect film, a timeless masterpiece, and one of the most beloved American cinematic treasures. There are only a handful of films from the 'golden era' that can still captivate any audience, even those with no interest in classic film, no less black & white films.Warner Brothers gave this crown jewel the deluxe treatment on regular DVD about 3 years ago, and it was impossible to conceive that even the glories of 1080p HD DVD could really make it look THAT much better...Well, it DOES. Several people I know use this CASABLANCA HD DVD as their 'demo disc' for their home theater. Despite B&W;, monaural sound, and a square aspect ratio, the clarity is unreal, and it only heightens the enjoyment of one of the greatest films ever made.Kudos to Warner for giving this to fans so early in the HD game. There is a terrible paucity of truly great films available in Hi Def right now, regardless of format. None of the other studios seem to recognize they have libraries, and relegate their releases to the recent flavor of the month (for the most part). Warner has been the top video label for years, and this is just another reason why. They really know what they're doing.All the exceptional special features created for the regular DVD have been carried over, and although they are standard definition, the upconversion makes them look better than ever.This is truly an ESSENTIAL part of any HD library.	5.0	HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, CASABLANCA...as NEVER BEFORE in HD DVD!	2007-04-21	59	49	10
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1L0HZI35HF8OF	Eric V. Moye	I was introduced to this movie in the greatest &quot;gut class&quot; in the history of American higher education.  It was screened in a class called &quot;World War II on Film&quot;, at S.M.U., and made my college education complete.  There is a reason it makes virtually every &quot;best&quot; film list.  There has never been a better movie.  Nothing can be done to improve upon it (except cutting the line where Ilsa describes Sam as &quot;The boy playing the piano&quot;).So much of this movie has become classic.  It may be because of the lines, like &quot;Here's looking at you kid&quot;, or &quot;This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.  Has there ever been a retort like Rick saying to Major Strasser &quot;There are parts of New York I would advise you not to invade&quot;?  Casablanca of full of these bon mots.It may be because of the music, like &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;.  I may love this country, but there is no anthem like &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and seeing and hearing this played in Rick's makes the little hair I have left stand on end.  It may be the most stirring affirmation of indominitable strength in a movie ever.  No wonder the Nazis sat down.It may be the classic moments.  Like the flashback to Rick and Ilsa dancing in La Belle Aurore.  Or Rick and Captain Renault having a chat about women becoming scarce, and how Rick should not cast them aside so cavalierly.  Or the hope of the Bulgarian couple who would risk all to have their children born free; him gambling badly and her willing to submit to Captain Renault.  Or Victor Lazlo leading the whole house in singing.Casablanca is a testimony to love, and hope, and nobility.  If I were Mr. T, I would say &quot;I pity the fool&quot; who is not touched by this movie.  Those woeful individuals have never had love, lost love and recaptured it.  Too bad for them. The rest of us lucky ones can relish these feelings as time goes by.	5.0	Time for more stars!	2000-04-20	3	1	2
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2SRZQU1SZG4RR	"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower"""	"a sigh is just a sigh, as time goes by ..."" is the song that summarizes this classic romantic film of the 1940s. The film has everything that makes a hit: a handsome leading man, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and a beautiful leading lady, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and exotic locations for filming, Paris and Casablanca. They meet and fall in love in Paris, just before the Nazi invasion. Ilsa is secretive about her past ... making her *even* more alluring and desirable ... She and Rick agree to meet at the railroad station and leave Paris due to the German occupation. Rick waits for her until the last minute but she does not show up ... He leaves without her.Ilsa and her husband, Viktor Laszlo end up in Casablanca at ""Rick's Cafe Americain"" where Ilsa sees Sam, the piano player from Paris. She asks him to play her favorite song, but he declines ... she asks again -- he succumbs. Rick enters and chides Sam, ""I told you never to play that song again,"" then he sees Ilsa ... He is introduced to her husband. That night after closing the cafe, Rick drinks himself into a stupor, remembering their days in Paris together. The Nazis visit the cafe and sing their national anthem, after which the French patriots stand up and sing their national song. The Chief of Police is forced to close the cafe as the plot thickens ... Rick is believed to possess secret documents that Ilsa and her husband need to leave Casablanca legally. Viktor is engaging in espionage against the Nazis and could be discovered at any time. Ilsa has an unexpected rendevous with Rick in the middle of the night, trying to extract the necessary documents from Rick ... In order to discover how it ends, to fully appreciate the intrigues, plot developments, wonderful acting, and mystique of the film ... one must view it.There are numerous phrases and statements that are well known which originated in this film, for example, ""Here's looking at you kid"", ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world, you had to come to this one"", and ""Line up the usual suspects"". This film is a classic due to the complex story line that unfolds within a love triangle. It contains mysteries that are gradually revealed, explaining the intertwining emotion of the characters and their behavior. Another interesting fact is, many of the characters hope is to emigrate to the USA, to start new lives ... This film will remain a classic for all time because so many unique elements come together to create an artistic masterpiece.

Bogart and his usual suspects - Lorre, Greenstreet, Raines - all grouped together for one of the most eloquent, powerful, stunning and important movies ever made. and while making it, the studio never looked at it as a big deal. Script pages were literally handed in to the actors on a daily basis. Bogart made less than Mickey Rooney that year. All kinds of strayed fabrics of fate conspired to make this film a bad one, and failed miserably.Bogart plays Rick, a hard-drinking bar and restaurant owner in Casablanca.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	This sensational new double-disc set  reinforces the WWII-era classic with four-plus hours of bonus materials. Some extras are new, others are simply recycled from previous &quot;Casablanca&quot; videos. Most of us won't care.Viewers can kick off their night in &quot;Casablanca&quot; with the Looney Toons spoof &quot;Carrotblanca.&quot; Or they can check out the odd but snappy 1955 TV spin-off, starring tough guy Charles McGraw. Or turn off the TV for the radio adaptation from 1943, with Bogart and Bergman reprising their roles as Rick and Ilsa.The star of the show is, of course, the show. The movie looks amazing at age 61, digitally scrubbed of almost all wear while somehow retaining a fair amount of contrast and original grain. The new transfer builds on the significant restoration work done for the 50th anniversary, returning to the original nitrate elements.The DVD's 2.0 mono is muscular, with crisp and clear dialogue. Max Steiner's versatile music sounds lovely, with plenty of oomph reserved for the dramatic exclamation marks. But keep that remote control close at hand: The DVDs' dynamic range gets to be a bit much, especially during the extras. Volume differences between several bonus features are downright jarring -- sloppy work from the audio people.Roger Ebert's commentary is the loudest track of them of all, appropriate given his enthusiasm level. He's a terrific guy to watch the film with. Who better to provide commentary on the populist masterpiece &quot;Casablanca&quot; than Ebert, the people's film reviewer?Ebert shoots down some of the myths about the film: Ronald Reagan was never seriously considered for the Bogart part; Bergman wasn't completely in the dark about which man her character would choose. Ebert notes the film's cheesy special effects and gaps in logic, saying they don't matter a bit -- and then goes on at length about the absurdity of the fabled &quot;letters of transit.&quot;The feature-length &quot;Bogart&quot; docu is outstanding, offering a wealth of clips from the tough guy's obscure early films. The cast of witnesses is outstanding: John Huston, Richard Brooks, Katharine Hepburn and Bergman all weigh in on their friend's art and legacy.The half-hour &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; is less successful, but still worth watching. Henry Mancini covers the vital role music plays in the film, with popular songs of the day providing sly commentary on the action. &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was almost cut from the film, but was saved at the last minute.	4.0	Round up the family and friends	2003-08-23	0	0	0

They had a stable of the greatest stars (Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Lorre, Greenstreet to mention a few) which produced countless movies in short order.In Summary; French Morocco during World War II love triangle night club owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) &amp; Victor (Paul Henreid) try to outwit &amp; escape the Nazi's with many twists &amp; turns involving an assortment of memorable characters you'll never forget.Casablanca was the greatest of Warner Brothers (Best Picture Oscar)1940's features.

It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that. This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time. Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, ""Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""	5.0	Casablanca (1942)	2013-06-01	0	0	0

The overall pacing of the film strikes a fine balance between character development and suspense, as it is not too long and does not lose its way, thanks to a total lack of extraneous subplots, which often hinders lesser films. Bogart's Rick is the most interesting character as he exhibits a number of traits and transformations that are paralleled in the real world, from his personal loss of a great love to apathy for a higher cause to a metamorphosis resulting in self-sacrifice that spurs others (in this case Louis) to respond in kind against evil. Throw in numerous memorable lines, some fine acting, lots of smoking and drinking that is appropriate for the circumstances rather than overdone, and some hated Nazis, and you have the makings of a timeless, atmospheric film.	5.0	They don't make 'em like this anymore	2003-12-08	4	3	1

Some have legitimate papers, and others do not.  Transit visas that allow departure on the night plane to Lisbon, Portugal, are highly prized and sell at a high price on the black market.  Rick's is a meeting place where people may conduct a little illicit business.There is an old expression, ""if you love someone, you let them go.""  Rick is faces that problem when the real love of his life is committed to another person.The motion picture has a boatload of stars from that era.  Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre play a couple of heavies, and had similar roles in other films with Humphrey Bogart who has the lead role as Rick.  Ingrid Bergman is the leading lady.

The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite. Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), he still puts in an excellent performance here.Unfortunately, this Blu-ray version is a mixed bag especially so for the sound quality which is only slightly better than the dvd release. The volume levels are very soft for some scenes so that you can scarcely hear the dialogue while for others the levels inexplicably increase.  Unlike the great work they did withThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] where they used DTS HD MA for the sound here they used just Dolby Digital which just didn't cut it and so overall is a disappointment and an opportunity lost in doing justice to a great film.After waiting so long for the Blu-Ray release it is an anti-climax that we get this mixed bag release with very good picture but poor sound quality albeit both are better than in the dvd release."	3.0	An Opportunity Lost for Sound Quality But Great Picture Quality on Blu-Ray!	2011-04-19	5	5	0

Not only Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilse, but also the ensemble group of minor characters. Who can forget oily-voiced Peter Lorre smuggling the letters of transit? Or rotund Sidney Greenstreet swatting flies at the Blue Parrot? My very favorite, however, is Claude Raines as Louis, the (lovably) corrupt Prefect of Police, whose heart is his ""least vulnerable spot,"" and whose lines, which include ""Round up the usual suspects!"" are among the best and the most humorous in the movie. His shock, as he stuffs his pockets with his winnings, that gambling is going on at Rick's place, has to be one of the classic moments in cinema.And, of course, one of the most brilliant scenes--my very favorite ""three-handkerchief-blubbering"" moment, in fact--is when Nazi Colonel Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his officers are standing around the piano, belting out ""Watch on the Rhine,"" and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) orders the band to play the ""Marseilleise""; although the two pieces of music blend perfectly at first, the ""Marseilleise"" triumphs in the end. Vive la France!!!I think that one of the secrets of this movie's greatness is that in addition to the outstanding actors, the writers and the director have combined the right mixture of romance, adventure, and patriotism with a huge dollop of humor.

The transfer on the blu-ray looks fantastic - it's considerably better than the dvd, and probably the best looking film I've seen seen from the period. Some of the shots that were a little fuzzy on previous dvd releases are now crystal clear on the blu-ray. The commentaries are also informative, but those were included on the newer dvd. My only complaint is that the blu-ray is only available in the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition."" A lot of the extra material other than the movie disc won't interest many people. I only cared about the blu-ray, but was forced to buy all the extra junk as well. Warner Bros. should release a version that just includes the movie, as well as this ultimate edition with all the additional materials. Prospective customers who want to experience Casablanca on blu-ray, or who have never seen the film before, may be turned off by the steep price for a single film.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3TZX9ULDBRGI6	Genivieve	Humphrey Bogart rates beside Cooper and Gable as a man with everything...class, looks, rough edges and a small percentage of sentimentality. I personally have always admired his style of acting, droll and aloof, yet attached and perceptive. This movie reinstates that title  that he held and still holds today. Bogart plays Rick, an American living  in a French occupied Morocco, who owns a popular cafe and has plenty of  connections with numerous people.  Ingrid Bergman plays the divine Ilsa,  who was once Rick's lover, married to Resistance leader, Victor Laszlo  played by Paul Henreid. She meets up with Rick again in Morocco, evoking  memories that Rick had rather forgotten. Rick beomes imbroiled with Victor  Laszlo and his plans to escape to America before he gets sent back to a  German concentration camp. Ilsa enlists the help of Rick, who has corrupt  ways with Nazis and the Resistance, and she realises that she still loves  him and wants to go to America with him. Bogart is every womans good  guy/bad guy... This movie wowed me when I first saw it. It still does now.	5.0	A Movie Buffs Dream	2000-01-04	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AZ9N13UBXQSN0	Glenn Hopp	I think the Roger Ebert commentary is very strong and extremely enjoyable. The big strength of his remarks is the consistent way he shows a closeness and intensity in viewing the film. And isn't that what a commentary on a familiar movie should do--point out things that make you feel that, however many times you've seen the movie, there are more cinematic riches to be gleaned? That's what Ebert does. Hearing the details he mentions and the larger purposes he ties to them really makes you want to watch all movies more attentively. He discusses Ingrid Bergman's facial expressiveness (often quoting Haskell Wexler, the cinematographer who co-taught the movie with Ebert in a film seminar), how her eyes &#34;paint&#34; the face of her male co-stars, searching the faces for support and responses. He points out intricate effects with lighting and shadow (on the back of Ingrid Bergman's head to give her a halo effect), and he relates these cinematic touches to the emotions and content of the film. He is refreshingly enthusiastic. Ebert is an ideal guide with whom to experience the movie.The Behlmer commentary, unlike Ebert's, is not very often (if at all) related to what is on the screen at a given moment. It is essentially the story of how the movie came to be (taken from the chapter on the film in Behlmer's book AMERICA'S FAVORITE FILMS). But all this historical information is interesting and balances the more interpretive, appreciative commentary that Roger Ebert provides. That commentary is better for those who want to savor what makes the movie powerful at the human level (Ebert's best comments may be about the power of movies to lift our spirits when characters act on their idealism) while this commentary informs us about casting choices, rewrites to the source material and the script, and so on. It is never boring, but Ebert's remarks truly renew one's enthusiasm for the film.	5.0	A review of the two commentaries: by Roger Ebert and by Rudy Behlmer	2014-06-15	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"This may be a black and white film from 1942, but its charm overcomes the limitations imposed on it by the technology of the day.  Casablanca is a war movie which features a unique and mysterious love triangle.  Rick (played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of Rick's Caf&eacute; in Casablanca, which is in the heart of unoccupied French territory in Africa and the last stop for defectors trying to escape the Nazis.  His old lover Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) makes a mysterious appearance with her husband Victor Laszlo who is a leader of the underground trying to escape.  Rick has always wondered why she strangely vanished out of his life in Paris, and it is this mystery that the film centers on.  Ultimately, someone must make an incredibly difficult choice, even if it goes against the deepest feeling of his heart.  There is more dialogue than action, but the dialogue sets up an ever-increasing amount of tension on several levels.Most movie critics would regard the suggestion that it is not the greatest Hollywood movie of all time as blasphemy.  But in truth the plot is not always convincing, the opening is somewhat complicated for first-time viewers, and the corruption and greed is presented in an overly positive light.  And the passionate dilemma that Ilsa faces in whether or not to choose her long-lost love above her husband was daring even for the forties.  Surely as a married woman the morals of the time would demand an automatic choice for her husband, rather than follow the immoral desires of passion.But how dare I suggest imperfection!  Casablanca is a clean movie, the acting is superb, the characterization beautifully portrayed, and above all it features a stunning plot with a thrilling climax.  It gained an Oscar for ""Best Picture 1942"" and many would not hesitate to give it an Oscar for ""Best Picture Ever.""  Many of its lines - ""here's looking at you kid"" and ""Play it again Sam"" - have become trademark expressions in the English language.  It may have reached greater heights in terms of popularity than perfection, but there's no question that this will continue to be a must see long into the future!"	4.0	A classic must see.	2002-03-06	7	3	4

The Blu-ray version is not noticeably better than the earlier versions.  For someone who has an earlier version, I seriously question whether it is worth spending the money on the Blu-ray version.  For someone who does not have an earlier version, it is a judgment call as to whether is worth getting the additional materials.	1.0	AGREE-NOTHING SPECIAL	2009-11-04	26	7	19

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"In the various special features included in this package, you'll hear the assertion (over and over again) that one of the reasons for CASABLANCA's greatness is that the actors themselves (as well as director Michael Curtiz) were filming pretty much on the fly, with no idea what tomorrow's shoot would entail or how the darn thing was going to end.  Makes sense, I suppose.  If the actors were as tentative and uncertain about the outcome as the characters they portrayed, it could only add to the authenticity, right?Well, of course, and I don't doubt the veracity of this story really, but when you think about it, COULD this story really have ended any other way?  Could Rick and Ilsa really have suddenly announce to Victor Laszlo that THEIR (Riok and Ilsa's) personal desires really did ""amount to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world.""  Would they ever have been so selfish and crass as to add, ""So you just board the plane, Vic old boy and vamoose on out to Lisbon.  After all, you've got your work, your cursed integrity and principles, and you sing a mean version of ""The Marseillaise,"" so take some satisfaction in your mission and leave us lovebirds alone.  We've always had Paris, and now we'll have Casablanca too."" In 1942? Not bloody likely.That point aside,  film scholars and critics have every reason to hail CASABLANCA as one of the all-time greats.  It does what the best movies always have done: tells a great story with wit, sophistication, a sense of intrigue, an expression nobility--and doesn't stint on the romance.  It's got it all, and even better, it's totally unpretentious.  Whether or not Bogart and Bergman knew where the story was headed, it's almost certainly true that they did not know how good a movie they were making.  Maybe Curtiz did: he was framing all those gorgeous shots after all, but I believe Bergman's film critic daughter Pia Lindstrom when she says her mother was absolutely baffled by fans' comments for years afterward that they just loved her CASABLANCA.  Though Bergman was never anything less than professional, it's reported that throughout the shooting, the actress was obsessing about her next big part in the more ""literary"" (and therefore more prestigious) FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS.  She never anticipated that Ilsa in CASABLANCA would become her signature role.And it's certainly one of Bogart's greatest too.  As the special feature on Bogie indicates, he was an actor thoroughly dedicated to his profession, and while his range may have been limited (or his casting options ""typed"") by this point in his career, audiences knew that he was much more than just a screen tough guy.  His Rick Blaine is indeed evert bit the romantic and the idealist that the cheerfully corrupt police captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) accuses him of being.  We scarcely need Renault to tell us that, however.  If ever there was a sensitive sould hiding under a mask of worldly cynicism it's got to be Rick--and if there was ever an actor capable of embodying those elements (and all the shades in between) it was Bogart.It's also interesting how much commentary there is in the features about how much an ensemble player Bogart really was.  It's hard to think of a more individualistic screen presence than Humphrey Bogart: yet it's also true that his best roles are in films with brilliant supporting players.  Aside from the aforementioned Bergman and Rains (who is perfect as the prefect),  there are great (co-)star turns by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (must have felt like old home week after MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt and the solid, stolid Paul Henreid as Victor Lazlo.The qualified ending is happy enough...for wartime.  Everybody gets to feel good about themselves in the end, as even Renault finds he's capable of something like nobility after all.  About the only people who lose out in the end are bad guy Nazi Major Strasser (Veidt)--and oh yeah, those ""USUAL SUSPECTS."""	5.0	Remembering This	2011-09-25	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	"This cinematic masterpiece won 3 Academy Awards in 1943: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The acting as is timeless as the movie itself. Screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make the perfect pair as star-crossed lovers Rick and Ilsa who meet again in war-torn unoccupied France. Paul Henreid is memorable as resistance fighter/leader Victor Laszlo. Claude Rains (""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"", etc.) is a cross between neutral and non-neutral as Louis Renault, prefect of police. Peter Lorre is subtly devious as the scheming Ugarte. Sydney Greenstreet (""The Maltese Falcon"", etc.) is an accessory as Rick's business rival Ferrari. Conrad Veidt oozes pure venom as the evil Major Strasser. The movie works very well, not only in terms of story, but the techniques that were used: flashbacks where almost all of it was music, close-ups of the characters in the right places, etc. Max Steiner (Oscar winner for ""Gone With The Wind"" four years earlier) composed the score for this bittersweet tale of love, intrigue and patriotism. The movie's only real special features are the original theatrical trailer, trailers for other classic movies starring Humphrey Bogart and a revealing documentary, ""You Must Remember This"" (the first line of ""As Time Goes By"", featured in the film), which offers an exclusive look at the making of this landmark movie, hosted by none other than Bogie's wife (from 1945, a year after they starred in ""To Have And Have Not"" until his untimely death in 1957) and legendary actress, Lauren Bacall. This movie also should've won Bogie the Oscar for Best Actor, Ms. Bergman Best Actress, Mr. Steiner Best Score and Best Song (""As Time Goes By""). One of the movie's final lines, ""Round Up The Usual Suspects"", was the inspiration for the mind-bending, Oscar-winning film ""The Usual Suspects."" (Look for my review of that twist-filled thriller later on). This film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a classic. Features the famous line ""Here's looking at you, kid"" and the timeless song ""As Time Goes By."" Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some violence."	5.0	"""As Time Goes By.""

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Powerful and classical drama set in Morocco where these casualities of life will face two ex lovers , but in crude and disturbing situations , she is now a married woman with a resistance hero , while he regents a night club . The ancient memories will emerge and the drama will take two opposite directions . The inner and hidden emotions that still feel one for each other and the duty , the loyalty and the patriotic sense who meet this disturbing triangle . But Ricky is a honor (strange word in the present times do not you?) man ; he decides to help them and give all the possible shelter he can even his feelings .So this conflict has a double face the inner emotions about an old love who did not grow up , and the outer related with the political surround who envolves all the city . The smart chase runs for Claude Rains ( in a scorching role ) and his persuasive moods  over Ricky , and the fear for being discovered make of that film a solid gem that has overcome its own time to become in a real masterpiece through the years .Bogart gives a perfect performance and Ingrid Bergman is extraordinary too . The dazzling direction of Michael Curtiz is another punch point . Dooley Wilson made of As time goes by , his personal hymn. Nobody can sing like him with so nosthalgical rapture and credibleness.Since the film experienced three changes in its ending , (and I  really choose the tragical in which Ricky loses ) , this movie reached the immortality status all through the eternity.	5.0	There will be always Paris!	2004-08-12	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A91K91GJRE6OU	Jake McKee	Well, after way too many years of having never seen Casablanca, I finally got on the ball. I am SO glad that I waited until I had it one DVD, however, because it added a great deal to the experience. One of the  richest and crisp transfers from black and white film to DVD that I have  seen so far. I was amazed at the quality! How they got a film that is so  old to look that good is beyond me!Even if you have seen this movie  before, see it again, but make sure it is the DVD version!	5.0	What quality!	2000-01-10	8	7	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AZTYHKV3MI0YL	"J. A Lewis ""brewman63"""	I don't know how I can expand on all of the praise that's already been given to the film, but I'll try. I've never seen the movie completely until a few weeks ago. I truly enjoyed it to the extent that it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite movies. It doesn't have a lot of action or suspense. What it does have is a great script, suberb acting by all and deservedly minimal direction. Honestly, I'm not a huge Bogart fan - I think he was way over-the-top in Maltese Falcon, but in Casablanca he is truly a gem to watch. I can feel for his pain and suffering as he relives old feelings. Ingrid Bergman is always a pleasure to watch and she shows why she was one of the best leading ladies in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is also good, even Peter Lorrie in a very small (but important) role. This movie tells a story that is still relevant today - it's all about the decisions you make in life. How some of them are not the best and if you're lucky, you may get a chance to redeem yourself later. Wether the story is set against the backdrop of World War II or today, it's still a story that has meaning to everyone. I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about. Boy did I ever &quot;get lucky&quot; with this one.	5.0	What more can be said?	2001-06-19	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1345VRK5MYG7	James L.	Casablanca is the kind of movie that people are talking about when they use the phrase &quot;classic movies&quot;.  What makes it so classic?  For starters, there is such a well constructed script, full of memorable  dialogue and scenes, which is all the more impressive given the chaos under  which it seems to have been written (I've read the writers didn't even know  how they were going to end it and that it changed on almost a daily basis).  Then there is Humphrey Bogart, the epitome of &quot;coolness&quot; as  Rick, the cynical, detached night club owner.  There's Claude Rains, witty,  charming, and sly as the chief of police, in a perfect performance.  There's a great supporting cast, including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter  Lorre.  There's a terrific musical score, as well as fine direction (in a  style that you wouldn't expect from Michael Curtiz).  If anyone considers  themselves a fan of movies, this film is required viewing.	5.0	What Else Can Be Said?	2000-01-29	7	6	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AOQ84V0SPVGGE	Jason_Els	Absolutely the best black and white transfer I have ever seen of a DVD. There are no drop outs, blips, hairs, tears, burns, noise, or anything that  shouldn't be on this film. Warner must have had a pristine original  negative sealed away for this DVD to look so good. The lighting is rich,  luminous, and the grays beautifully scaled lending excellent depth to the  picture. After seeing &quot;Casablanca&quot; on TV and video this DVD is a  revelation. The picture is presented in its original theatrical aspect  ratio of 1.33:1.The sound too is crisp and marvelously preserved. There  are no pops, blips, buzzes, drop outs, or volume changes. Instead we are  given a soundtrack, that while still monophonic, is the best yet heard. If  any complaint could be made of digital audio it's that the sound is too  forward and harsh for some ears though on the DVD it is only slightly so  and those of you with Cinema EQ on your home theater equipment won't have a  thing to complain about.Extras like the Lauren Bacall (Bogey's  widow)-hosted special, &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; and the original  trailer (in poor condition compared to the feature), are better than  average and the documentary includes interviews with people who were  involved with making &quot;Casablanca&quot;. The production notes are  actually interesting to read but then they would be given the twisted  production history of the film.All in all Warner has produced a  lovingly-crafted DVD edition of a movie loved by millions all over the  world and nothing about it disappoints.Time may go by, but  &quot;Casablanca&quot; has become digitally-fixed and now, finally,  physically ageless.	5.0	What a Transfer!	2000-09-01	17	14	3

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A30UTOXO99BSKG	Jay	This is one of the only movies that I will turn off before it's finished. Although I did have to watch the rest of it so I can say I watched Casablanca.This movie is horrible! It is so boring and unoriginal that I can't stand it. The only good thing about it is the cast. Bogie is the man of course and Ingrid Bergman makes the screen shine with her beauty and talent. But that's it.How is it boring? Because all they do is talk. The only moment I felt enthralled is where Rick flashbacked to Paris and the end. That's it. The rest is a bunch of talking and ordering the African-American around. Now I know it's old but it's not based on the Civil War. It's during World War II. A lot of people, including blacks, got killed so the studios could make this awfulness.How is it unoriginal? It's about a love triangle. You take away the locale and the nazis and that's all it is. Besides, there's absolutely no chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. They looked more uncomfortable than in love. A lot of professional reviewers praise it because they base it around World War II. Of course they did, the movie was made in 1943.According to the AFI this movie is #2 in the best movies of all time. It's right above The Godfather. Say it isn't so say it isn't so.Final words: If this movie is so great then could anybody tell me the director or the screenwriter?	1.0	Boring	2001-04-14	109	14	95

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2OP1HD9RGX5OW	"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name"""	My heart thrills as I watch this movie.  This for me is the romantic movie par excellant.  The hope for love, the dashed desires, the renewal of possibility...and the ending, the amazing ending, unexpected by even the actors, is true romance- not in just the idea of love between a man and a woman, but romance in a literary Woodsworthian way.  Ideals, and desires, and love are all one, in the decisions we must finally make in life.The sighs of delight in how events develop can not detract from it's stars, but there are negatives to the movie.  Primarily it's setting.  As a resident of Casablanca, I have to say it has nothing to do with Casablanca or Morocco.  Perhaps it's more appropriate to say it has everything to do with Casablanca- the Western name for the city, and nothing to do with Dar Baida- the native name of the city.  The movie's not even filmed here, but rather in Hollywood.  So you have a triparty attempt to control by the French Resistance, the Vichy government and the Nazis, and Rick, the American.  Occasionally some Moroccans are trotted out to remind us that this takes place in Morocco, but they are stereotypical caricatures.  The most telling scene in this respect is when the Nazi anthem is drowned out by the French anthem, and everyone feels there was a bit of justice done this night- all of the movie protagonists, and all the viewers.  But what is missing is a bit of the history of this time- how the French colonized Morocco, wrested control of the country from it's inhabitants, imposed their values and culture and stripped away the freedom from the Moroccans.  And how the Moroccans had to fight a bloody war of resistance to the French occupation after WWII to win their freedom.So we bear this in mind as we watch.  But then, accepting the lack of reality, it is a wonderful movie of romance, and I will happily dispense with reality for a brief bit of idealism any day.	5.0	Not Dar Baida, but Ya Gotta come to Rick's	2003-12-08	4	2	2
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2WJSVSBXEYEF	Jefferson T. Packer	I won't write even one word about the film itself; we all know how great it is.  But what I wasn't prepared for, was how astonishingly beautiful it is on DVD.  On my computer's 19&quot; monitor, it was as clear, crisp and  sharp as it would have been on the &quot;silver screen.&quot;  A TV really  doesn't do justice to a film like this.  Again and again my wife and I  found ourselves gasping at the perfection and beauty of the cinematography,  the lighting, the sets, the shots, the angles...  Even on a big-screen TV,  you only see a faint hint of this film's real beauty; but the DVD brings it  out in a way that only people who saw it in the theaters back in 1943 ever  got to see... until now.  Get a big monitor, a fast computer, and a good  sound system.  Then pop some popcorn, and be prepared to be stunned.	5.0	The Film is a Given - But the DVD Quality is Shocking!	2000-03-14	25	21	4

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1ZBR6613WAJT1	Jeff Friedman	Why can't this gem be remade?  It can't be remade because no international cast could ever be assembled which could approach the talent and grace of the original, ecletic ensemble: American Humprey Bogart,  Swedish Ingrid Bergman and John Qualen, Czeckoslovakian (I believe) Paul  Henreid, French Claude Rains, Marcel Dalio, Curt Bois, and the exquisite  Madeleine LeBeau, British Sidney Greenstreeet, German Conrad Veidt and S.Z.  Sakall, Hungarian Peter Lorre, Russian Leonid Kinskey, and Helmut Dantine  and Dan Seymour (wherever they were from?).  It can't be remade because  we're too far removed from it's World War II setting and we're much too  worldly and cynical to appreciate it's compelling naivete.  It can't be  remade because it was a moment in time. And time is the one thing we  haven't learned how to recapture. The movie was being written and rewritten  daily. There were at least half a dozen endings considered. Humphrey Bogart  was the THIRD choice for Rick (after Ronald Reagan and George Raft). Ingrid  Bergman was the FOURTH choice for Ilsa (after Hedy Lamarr, Ann Sheridan,  and Michelle Morgan). It was shot in a few days at the Culver City Warner  lot. They were trying to get a new song written for Rick and Ilsa's song  but finally settled on the old standard, &quot;As Time Goes By.&quot; Such  spontaneity can only occur once.  And what about the priceless lines  uttered by those unique characters? Not only the well-worn, &quot;Round up  the usual suspects; you played it for her, you can play it for me; this  could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship; but....  &quot;How  careless of you throwing away women like that; some day they may be  scarce.&quot;  &quot;This is the customary roundup of refugees,  liberals, and, of course, beautiful young girls for Captain Reneaud.&quot;  &quot;Naturally, there will be some incidental expenses.&quot;  &quot;I'm shocked, shocked to find out there is gambling going on  here&quot; (&quot;Your winnings, messieur&quot;).  &quot;Give Major  Strasser the best table, one next to the ladies.&quot; (&quot;I have  already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it  anyway&quot;).  &quot;If he gets a word in, it will be a major Italian  victory.&quot;  &quot;I don't mind a parasite; I do object to a cut  rate one.&quot;  &quot;What kind of a man is Captain  Reneaud?&quot;...&quot;Just like any other man, only more so.&quot;  These lines cannot be outdone. Redelivering them would not do them justice.  Altering them would be a sacrilege.  And how could the ambience of the  movie be duplicated in this high tech world of special effects? The very  simplicity and sincerety of the movie is out of place in this era where the  world has drawn so close (in a remake, would Ilsa's goodbye letter to Rick  be e-mailed or faxed?)  Not to mention: who in the world could play the  parts? Yes, I suppose that Rutger Hauer could make a credible Major  Strasser. But who could play Rick? Most Bogart roles are remade with  Harrison Ford. But isn't he just a bit too frivolous and  devil-may-care to  sell the part of a devastated, spurned lover whose anger and resentment  displays itself as cynicism and reclusiveness?  Richard Gere is one who  could probably do it, but then who would be Ilsa? - Julia Roberts?  Not  to mention the problem of finding the myriad of distinctive and timeless  character actors who populated the original set.  So how about this  time, JUST this one time, why don't we leave this treasure alone? Let's  just preserve it in its original, pristine form so that it can be  experienced to its fullest degree by future generations?  And who knows?  Maybe in some distant time, the world will return to the magnificent  naivete that wrought this masterpiece in the first place.	5.0	Just PLEASE: Don't Try to Remake It	1999-12-03	24	18	6

It's one of my top five favorite movies.  Why?  Dunno.  But there's a magic in there somewhere.  It's not the most exciting, action-filled, super-deep story and modern  performers can often act circles around these classic actors, but the quick  dialog, character interactions, and sense of humor in a time of impending  doom continues to draw me back.  Forget Ingrid Bergman's phoney-baloney  dramatics, Bogie's flashbacks and the manipulative but powerful scene in  the bar where the French and Germans start singing their national anthems  and just let yourself be pulled into their world and enjoy a very fine film  that somehow makes it all click.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	I promise somebody I would watch this before the year end and I was fortunate enough to see this early this afternoon. I was quite surprised when I first watched Casablanca to find that I practically could already quote the last ten minutes. So much of this film is engrained into our cultural consciousness from the countless spoofs and references that have come since then. And for good reason.In World War II, Casablanca is the place where displaced refugees find themselves in. Getting out is the hard part. A cynical American, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular gin joint there. Things are going good for him as he deigns to keep out of business that doesn't concern him. That all changes when a French underground leader, Victor Lazslo (Paul Henreid), comes to town with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). It seems that Rick and Ilsa have a past together, and with the Nazis looking for some transit papers Rick happens to have and also trying to detain Victor, Rick finds himself in a tough spot.After watching this I realized that's there's nothing staggeringly original or innovative about this film. It's how human the characters and the plights they find themselves in are, and the dry humor they throw out in the process. The conflict inside Rick whether to look after his best interests or help the woman he still loves is certainly compelling stuff, but that isn't all. There are so many memorable characters, from the ingratiating Captain Renault (played with relish by Claude Reins) to the weasely Ugarte (Peter Lorre). While the story isn't so much about Casablanca, a little bit of everything is worked in. Not the least of which being the sticky politics and smoldering national pride for Nazi occupied France. The romance is also ... well, the reason why this movie is so timeless. And then there's the script. Though there are numerous lines that are justifiably classic, the rest is a rare work of brilliance as well. The dark humor, the slow eroding of Rick's resolve, all result in classic scenes, one after another. It has it all.Bogart and Bergman, a rare pairing that results in one of cinema's greatest romances. What more is there to say? They take what could have been completely conventional roles and make them truly human. A great supporting cast rounds out the crowd; there are more than just two memorable performances given. This was a film done in the old Hollywood studio system by all the rules, yet it inexplicably raises itself above and beyond that. It is a remarkable motion picture masterpiece. If you haven't seen it yet, I whole-heartedly recommend it.	5.0	"""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""	2007-05-29	2	2	0

Casablanca, in my humble opinion, is that type of film that filmmakers should use as a template for what to do right.As an overview, the film seems rather simple. A niche plotline cast in an interesting setting. But like any good piece of art, there are levels to be uncovered. Subtle nuances that build a solid foundation for a beautiful story.The characters, acted wonderfully, are interesting in their own right, and each could have their own film about their lives. The location is the perfect catalyst, as is the geopolitical situation in which the characters find themselves. You find your heart broken and then mended more than once. There is, in its way, the perfect dance of melancholy and joy. More, the film knows when to end itself and it does so on the perfect note.The film is timeless, and whatever form you choose to view it, you will not be dissapointed.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AYT46RDGZUB55	J. George	This film deserves all of the accolades heaped upon it. Quick-paced, full of unexpected plot twists, visually very rich and varied, and peppered with humor in a very-underplayed &amp; successful manner.Enjoy it for the  intrigue, enjoy it as a WWII memoir, enjoy it for the humor, enjoy it for  the superb acting, enjoy it for the music, and enjoy it for the love story.  This is a film which somehow magically grows in its appeal as the viewer  grows in life's experiences. If you've never had the love affair of your  life fall through your fingers, then by all means, go do so. Then, when you  re-visit Casablanca afterwards, you'll find it speaks truthfully and  poignantly to the pains you might have from love affairs that ended too  soon.The themes are wonderfully resonant with the viewer...redemption  from past mistakes, knowing when to act and when to keep your peace, and  the sacrifice of the opportunity of a lifetime (the chance to resurrect the  love of your life) for a greater good -- joining the fight against  oppression-- ...damn, what an unparalled film!Not only is this a  must-see...it's a must-own!

What I like about this movie is that it derives it enduring charm through great story telling.The movie also reflects the period of time when the world was threatened by by a ruthless fascist nation ( nazi germany) and the struggle of a few people to stand up to the Nazis.  Think of what the world could have been like if the Nazis prevailed.  This movie captures the anxiety of this era .  Notwithstanding this movie is a classic love story set in war.

That said, I probably can't expound upon or illuminate further anything you've probably seen or heard about this film.But I wanted to take the time to comment upon the Blu-ray set.Many of the special features are holdovers from previous formats, but they are great for both first-time and repeat viewers.The box itself is a little cumbersome, but all it requires is some creative planning when it comes to organizing and displaying your movie collection.The video has never looked better. It's safe to say that detail is vastly improved from the DVD transfers. The image is cleaned up from damage and specks while maintaining the natural grain that should accompany the film. Watching it the first time on Blu-ray was like watching the movie for the first time. This is definitely the best the film has ever looked.I can't speak to the audio, as my set-up at home is not adequate.A pack like this or the 50th Anniversary Limited Collector's Edition of Lawrence of Arabia will definitely be the crown jewel of your collection. It's only icing on the cake that Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all-time!	5.0	A wonderful Blu-ray set	2013-05-23	0	0	0

I have since watched this masterpiece a few more times, as it grows deeper and more perfect with each viewing.I was most impressed with Ingrid Bergman. I heard that she didn't think this was her best performance, but I fell for it. Her lines were said naturally and her tears were even believable. My favorite, though, would have to be Dooley Wilson..Sam. He always managed to be in the middle of everything, and played a funny yet complicated role.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3QTP2CI1BDV0M	"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark"""	"Casablanca is perhaps the most classic classic movie of all time.  Even after more than 60 years it still entertains well.The dialog is excellent ... just a lot of wonderful lines.  My favorites are:Ugarte: You despise me don't you?Rick: If I ever gave you a thought, I probably would.Rick: I don't buy or sell human beings.Ferrari: That's a pity. It is Casablanca's leading commodity.Renault: (to Rick) I've often speculated on why you can't return to America ... I like to think you killed a man ... it's the romantic in me.Renault: What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?Rick: My health ... I came to Casablanca for the waters.Renault: The waters?  What waters?  We're in a desert.Rick: I was misinformed.Strasser: Can you see us (invading) New York?Rick: Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.Ferrari: As the leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca ... I'm an influencial and respected man.Rick: You can tell me now ... I'm reasonably sober.Rick: (to Ilsa) I wouldn't bring up Paris now if I were you ... it's bad salesmanship.Ilsa: (Threatens to shoot Rick)Rick: Go ahead and shoot.  You'll be doing me a favor.Ilsa: You have to do the thinking for both of us; for all of us.Rick: All right ... I will.Renault: Ricky, I'm going to miss you.  Apparently you are the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I do.Rick: Louie ... I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.But the acting here is top-notch.  Normally, a movie back then had top-shelf talent for 3, maybe 4 of the leading roles.  In Casablanca, quality actors are used 9 or 10 roles deep into the cast.The background music (provided by Max Steiner) is excellent. Often, after a movie has been around for many years, the music will seem stale or out of place ... but here it is as fresh and well-blended with the action as the day the movie was released.  There is, however, the nasty item on Mr. Steiner ... that, when he began his work to provide the background music (after the filming had been completed) he actually wanted to replace the song ""As Time Goes By"" in the film with a song he himself wrote ... to gain the royalties for he himself ... but, as Ingrid Bergman had already cut her hair (for her next film ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"") it was impossible to reshoot all the scenes in which ""As Time Goes By"" is played by Dooley Wilson ... and so he (Steiner) had to ... acquiesce.The spotlight is pretty bright on Bogie and Ingrid though ... especially after 60 years of close scrutiny.  Bogie does some excellent work here, and he carries the lead very well, but there are flaws in his performance, and they seem to stand out.  Ingrid's performance is solid, but there again, there are moments in her performance that I am sure she later wished she could have redone.Conrad Veidt is excellent as the bad guy ... just a great great job at being menacing.  Claude Rains perhaps had the most fun lines to speak, and he seems to have had fun saying them.  Sydney Greenstreet is very excellent as Ferrari, and Peter Lorre is good also.  S.Z. Sakall is delightful as the waiter Carl ... and is a very natural actor, I think.Paul Henreid (as Victor Lazlo) is OK.  I read that, before he agreed to do the movie, he negotiated his billing to be up with Bogie's and Ingrid's.  Did he deserve it?  I'm not sure.  Of all the film's performances, his seems to come across to the audience with the least effectiveness.  He doesn't strike us as a great leader of a movement or as a patriot on the run.  Nor does he seem to be the type of man that would inspire Ilsa's love.  And so, it's hard to root for him.  But maybe this helped the picture in a way ... in that it does allow us to root all the more for Rick and Ingrid to be together.  But it's hard to put Paul Henreid up in the same categorie (acting-wise) as Bogie and Ingrid.But, being the critic here, there are some unrealistic aspects to the plot I'd like to point out:- When Ugarte is arrested (and later interrogated) he definately would have told the Nazis that Rick had the exit visas ... especially after Rick refused to  ""... stick his neck out for anybody.""- The Nazis, upon learning that Victor Lazlo was at Rick's Cafe, would have immediately arrested him, then killed him.  Definitely.- And Lazlo would never have travelled under his real name, nor would he have allowed it to be spoken aloud in a crowded restaurant.- Rick's bravado toward the Nazis (mostly in the flash-back scene) would never be.  It would have been foolhardy not to acknowledge the very real (and scary) threat they posed.- And when Rick lets that honest young man win at gambling, so he and his wife could afford the bribe to Captain Renault, he (Rick) is lauded for it.  But, no thought is given to the (certain) hundreds of times Rick used the same trick to cheat honest people out of their money.Like I said ... just being the critic.But it is a very watchable movie ... with no dull moments at all.FOR THE 50th RE-ISSUE:The ""Making of ..."" addition to the 50th anniversary re-issue of Casablanca gives us some interesting tid-bits, but is a weak effort.They follow a standard format: Interview the guy who wrote the play, the lady who discovered the play, Ingrid's daughter, the lighting guy, have Bogie's wife narrate it, and so on ... but there's too much pap and not enough pith.... and no gossip!  We get absolutely zero gossip-type information.Overall it just does not satisfy.  With 50 years accumulation of film clips related to Casablanca (interviews, reflections, appearances, reviews, awards, etc.) ... which were completely ignored ... we are given a ""The Making of Casablanca"" that lacks the depth of research (and the height of quality) that this classic picture deserved."	5.0	Very Watchable Movie	2005-02-10	8	4	4
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"Casablanca is one of Hollywood's most beloved classic's. Even watching it now it's not hard to tell why it's a classic or why it won an acedemy award for best picture. It's perfect, has memorable dialogue, well done humor, well written characters with real emotion, pride and dignity, and an intriguining plot. It's also very romantic and shows that a movie could end satisfying without the hero getting the girl.The main character Rick Blaine (Humprey Bogart) changes a lot by the time the movie ends, he goes from being self-centered to doing the right thing and letting the on he loves get on a plane without him to possibly never see her again.Movies these days just aren't that smart, especially not any of the Romantic ones you get. You mostly always get guy gets girl, the end. If the guy doesn't get the girl you're not satisfied but here you are because Rick still has his dignity at least.Casablanca may be one the most romantic movies ever made it surprisingly has a bit of a march tone to it. It's mushy enough for women to enjoy with the excellent chemestry and dialogue that Humphray Bogart and Ingrid Bergman share.Bogart in a way is like John Wayne where he makes you want to be just like him. These days a character can't make a point without cursing and yelling but all Bogart has to do to look depressed or tough and make his point is just make a motionless expression.So Casablanca works for both sexes,  guys can relate to Bogart's Rick. Any women who fell in love but at the wrong time can relate to Bergman. Can't really think of any actor's that actually draw you in more  into their roles than Humphrey Bograt and Ingred Bergman do in this movie.Besides the acting being very good Michael Curtiz's direction is splendid. You actually feel as if you're there, with the big flashing lights pointing towards Rick's pub as people enter or walk out of it, also when a charcter is standing by the window you see that light flashing by. That light gives a presence that the Nazi's are there and that eventhough it's Rick's pub they pretty much have all the control over it. You feel the fear and emotion of the people in Rick's pub, they fear that they'll be taken by the Nazi's to one of their war camps.Curtiz's also makes you feel as if you're at the airport at the end saying good-bye right along with Rick as well.

There really is no sense in describing the details as everyone knows. I only have one issue and these days it seems so immaterial but the leading women is having an affair and is willing to forsake her marriage. It seems that our society has a problem that it did not have in the older days but folks are not committed to marriage, and when I watch these movies I think I understand why.	5.0	All time classic	2013-06-15	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A343CRJ1JDE6RP	"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion..."""	"At 55 years of age, you'd think a movie lover such as myself would have seen Casablanca... but I hadn't until I bought this disc in July of 2007. If you understand what makes a finely crafted film that you can watch repeatedly and still continue to find things out about it that you love, this is one you'll enjoy immensely.Start with the script - it is filled with tasty classic lines you'll really delight in hearing in the context of the film. ""Here's looking at you, Kid..."" for example. Part of what makes all of it work is the vocal treatment by the actors in their delivery. The cast seems very comfortable with the characters they each play, and so maybe that relaxed feel carries over to the degree of realism you sense when you watch it. Their dialogue does NOT seem scripted and that's hard to achieve on a consistent basis in a film. I suppose that's a big part of what's made Casablanca such a classic to all who have reviewed the work over the years.The acting is superb across the board regardless of how small the part. Ingrid Bergman is luminescent to put it mildly. Bogie is really a powerhouse in this one, and Paul Henreid as well as Claude Rains deliver the kind of intimately detailed performances that just make you smile while you watch. Peter Lorre has a smaller part but exquisitely crafted in its execution. He makes it easy for you to hate him, let's put it that way. Sydney Greenstreet gives a solid presentation as well to round out the core ensemble performances given here.The special features on this disc include a very nice introduction by Lauren Bacall, Bogart's widow. I watched it AFTER viewing the film as I wanted to get the same feel as audiences who originally viewed it in the theater, but I wish I had watched it first. Enlightening to say the least.Another little gem is a series of trailers for Bogie's other movies. Great slices of the period as far as movie promotion goes! They serve as great reminders of a simpler time in America.This particular film is a MUST HAVE for anyone's movie collection. I feel that repeated viewings year on year will only make you love it more than you did the first time. Not many films are able to do that.I can safely say that if you, too, love truly great movies and you decide to purchase this one, it will be the start of a beautiful friendship."	5.0	Excellent movie, excellent presentation and special features	2007-08-15	5	4	1

The image is brighter than on the old release and crystal sharp.  The audio is much cleaner and stronger.  If you've ever compared the difference between a VHS release of a film and its DVD counterpart, you know the improvement; here, I find there is at least as much difference between the two DVD releases as with typical VHS/DVD comparisons.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	A film by Michael CurtizThe American Film Institute ranked &#65533;Casablanca&#65533; as the second greatest movie of all time behind &#65533;Citizen Kane&#65533;.  I would tend to agree with &#65533;Casablanca&#65533; as the #2 movie of all time (I just disagree on #1).  This is a movie that is not only an excellent film, but also one which has entered the consciousness of a nation so much that many people only know that some lines are famous and that perhaps they came from &#65533;Casablanca&#65533;.  Lines like &#65533;Here&#65533;s looking at you, kid&#65533;, &#65533;All the gin joints in all the towns in the world and she has to walk into mine&#65533;, and &#65533;I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&#65533; are legendary.  So is the line that was not even said in the movie &#65533;play it again, Sam&#65533; (in this case there are a couple variations said in the movie, the closest being &#65533;play it once more, Sam&#65533;).  Besides the famous dialogue, though, this is simply a fine movie and is an example of excellence in filmmaking.The story is set in Casablanca, in French Morocco.  It is 1941 and the world is in the midst of World War II.  With such a grand background, this is a very simple story.  Much of the film take&#65533;s place at Rick&#65533;s, a caf&eacute; that lets its patrons forget for a moment that the war is going on.  The patrons can forget until the Nazis chase a runaway to Casablanca and execute him on the streets.  Another runaway is traced to Rick&#65533;s and while this could turn to a serious drama, it instead turns the film into a great romance and even a comedy with graceful touches.  The success of this depends entirely on the characters and the actors playing the parts.  Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of Rick&#65533;s, and he is completely (as far as we can tell) apolitical.  He is just looking out for himself and his caf&eacute; and he isn&#65533;t too worried about what happens to anyone else.  But Rick is smooth and likeable, so this does not bother us too much.  In walks Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), the very man the Nazis are looking for.  With Laszlo comes Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).  When Rick says the famous like about all the gins joints in all the towns in the world&#65533;he is talking about Ilsa.  To put it mildly, they have a past.To say more would spoil the joy in this movie, but I fear that I have not said enough and it is nearly impossible to capture the heart and grace of this movie in words written more than 60 years after it was first released.  I also have not mentioned Captain Renault (Claude Rains), one of the great characters in film history, even more so than Rick or Ilsa.  I truly believe that this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and that being the case I am not sure how to adequately describe this great film.  Suffice it to say that from the acting, to the script, to the actors, to the direction, and cinematography, I find it exceedingly difficult to find a flaw through this movie.  It is just as vibrant a picture as it was 60 years ago when it was Oscar&#65533;s Best Picture in 1942.	5.0	this truly is one of the greatest films of all time	2004-04-14	3	3	0

It has a bit of everything which can be a recipe for disaster but, in this case, it all comes together to work a miracle.It is not your regular war movie. It takes place at the opening of World War II and involves themes and current events from that war but the war is not the star. It is merely the reason that these people find themselves together in the North African town of Casablanca.It is not an action movie although there are a few shootouts, chases and the like. They are a needed part of the story. When the Nazis or their agents come to get you, you run and they shoot.It is not a comedy although some of the greatest comic lines in all of cinema are found in this gem. ""Round up the usual suspects!""It is not a musical although the music is an integral part of the film. It plays a minor but important part. ""As Time Goes By"" was a decade old when this film came out and was never a hit until this film. Now you cannot help but think of this film without thinking of that song.It is not a love story in the traditional sense. There is a romantic story. Two men love the same woman. She loves them both. The ending is a bit of a surprise and you want to cry for the loser all the while understanding why he gave her up.This film is all of these things and none of them. It merely is.It takes place in the North African town of Casablanca which has been flooded by refuges from the German onslaught. Bogart plays Rick, the owner of a saloon who does very well for himself. The town is controlled by Vichy French and the prefect of police is a lovable cad played by Claude Raines. Two refugees, one an escapee from a concentration camp, come to Rick's trying to procure an exit visa that will allow them to escape to safety. The Nazis don't want them to have it. One of the refugees is Ilse, played beautifully by Ingrid Bergman. She was Rick's lover in Paris until that city fell to the Germans. They were going to go away together and then she disappeared, only to turn up married to the other refugee, a famous critic of the Nazis, Tensions are high all around emotions are running even stronger. Someone has to lose.This DVD edition has plenty of special features for fans. There are some outtakes and deleted scenes from the original movie and plenty of interviews as well as commentaries.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AJ2MCPOPJA6EY	John Stratton	I can't give The 70th Anniversary Casablanca Blu-Ray set very good marks at all. My initial shipment of this item was great as long as I was watching the extra features. The trouble started when I went to watch the film; there was no audio broadcasting, during the playback. I quickly reported the item as defective and Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement had the same issue. I'm running  a Samsung BD-6500 blu-ray player with all of the most recent updates. I'm not sure where the problem actually lies in this issue; but as I have no problems on playback with any other blu-ray I watch, I'm afraid there is a fault in the Warner Bros. production line. Hopefully I just hit a small, confined issue with this blu-ray as I would love to eventually own it; but until I hear that the issue has been dealt with, I can't be bothered with spending money on it right now.Is anyone else having issues with the audio playback?	1.0	The movie is a solid 5*'s; The Deluxe Blu-Ray set gets 1* for complete lack of audio, during main feature playback	2012-05-02	21	8	13

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A22BPC7LRSGSYQ	Joker	For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this classic movie...I saw Casablanca for the first time about a month and a half ago when it was being shown at an old theater in my hometown for a reasonable $4.00 charge.  It was one of those creepy old theaters (built in 1928) where an organist plays before the movie starts and again during the half hour intermission halfway through the movie.  Seeing it in an old theater like this added to the overall experience of going through a time warp.  This classic movie from 1942 stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  I give this movie 4 stars.  I like Ingrid Bergman as an actress.  She was good in just about everything she did.  When it comes to Humphrey Bogart, he was good, but I think he's overrated.  He's always ranked the #1 leading man of all time in the history of movies.  I personally disagree with this, but that's just my opinion.  He should be ranked no higher than third.  In my opinion, the #1 leading man actor of all time is Cary Grant, with Jimmy Stewart coming in a strong second.Casablanca is certainly a classic and has some of the most memorable lines in movie history.  I don't think it's as good as some other classic movies from that era that are ranked lower, but you might disagree.I recommend Casablanca to all fans of classic movies.  It's worth seeing at least once.	4.0	Big time classic	2012-08-13	4	4	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2NL7ZCN7LZYQM	"Jonathan Dedward ""In your face like a can of ..."	"This is an absolutely timeless classic.  It does have its faults... as do many of the films from this era (racial issues abound in movies from this time period, i.e. a younger woman referring to an older black man as ""boy"") but don't think for a moment I don't love the story.  As someone who began life many decades after this film was created, I have to wonder which, if any, of our generation's movies will even come close to the classic feel or lasting appeal of ""Casablanca.""  Is anyone going to care about any of the current crop of movies 60 years from now?  Most of what I see being released currently just feels more and more superficial and disposable.  I'm also able to recognize that old films such as ""Casablanca"" do have a limited appeal nowadays.  One wouldn't necessarily call it action packed.  Comparatively speaking, most sets here are basic, special effects are non-existent, everything revolves around creating the relationships between the characters... the focus is on dialog, supporting pathos and ethos.  Most people my age wouldn't find this entertaining.  But please, watch this movie, and for a moment try to picture a classier, more idealistic world, separate from the continuous dumbing down of popular culture. I enjoy watching old movies, and this is among the best."	5.0	Superb	2007-05-02	1	1	0

The movie has wonderful acting, when Bogart enters the room and hears &quot;As Times Go By&quot; playing, he runs up to the piano and when he see Bogart you can see in his face that he's just had his guts ripped out and stuffed back in, that's acting.

A tense suspense film, a touching love story, a in between moments of great comedy.  Bogart was never cooler, tougher or more tender.  Bergman is luminous, achingly vulnerable, brave and more beautiful than ever.  The whole supporting cast is amazing, from the troika of Greenstreet, Lorre and Raines, to the amazing Warner Bros. rep company.  (Many of them actual refugees from Hitler's Europe.)

It's 64 years old and yet most of the dialogue is still quoted today, it's #2 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (just directly below ""Citizen Kane""), and is a true masterpiece of film.I typically don't watch films from this era, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman; This is not the most entertaining of several of my favorite movies that are on AFI's list below this film, nor is this the second most entertaining film ever made...But it is an important one; But that's not why I'm giving it 5 stars. The biggest thing I look for when reviewing a film in the quality of entertainment; I don't care how important the movie is, if it's kind of dull I won't rank it that high. This film is a beautiful and entertaining film; The cinematography/lighting is beautiful, the dialogue is beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the film is incredibly influential. Anyway; The movie is set against the backdrop of World War II in Casablanca and takes place mostly in a gambling/gin joint owned by Rick Blaine (Bogart), a distant kind of guy who ""doesn't stick his neck out for anybody"" and seems to find no enjoyment in life. He runs his gin joint and that's it. After some transfer papers are stolen (and are subsequently being looked for by the Germans) and are given to Rick, the man who gives them to him is arrested shortly after and Rick awaits the gentlemen who will pick them up. That man is Victor Laszlo, who is famous for having spent a year in a concentration camp and escaping; Also along with Laszlo is his beautiful wife Isla Lund (Bergman), who is tied to Rick's past. Back in 1942, the film won 3 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. How it lost (although I'm not sure if it was even nominated) Best Cinematography and Best Actor is beyond me. As I said, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart before but the man is an amazing actor. He has this way of speaking and a way of moving that really sucks you in. Some of the dialogue (although it is great) wouldn't work coming out of other actors mouths; Here, it's perfectly fine. ""Here's looking at you kid"" and ""I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" is classic movie dialogue that we will no doubt here for a much longer time. This isn't a movie the whole family can rent for a night of Saturday night entertainment; But for film buffs and classic film mongers, this is a film you can't miss.GRADE: A"	5.0	Casablanca	2006-08-14	6	5	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A31XRS8M2P68CB	J. Peaco	"One of the greatest movies of all time. It's impact on our culture has been tremendous. Just take a look at AFI's list of all time great films. It's number 2. Or the other lists like movies quotes or movie songs.The movie is first rate and gripping. No matter how many times I see it the film sweeps me up in its story. And I still laugh out loud in the scene at Rick's Cafe when Claude Rains blows his whistle and says ""I'm shocked shocked to find that there is gambling here."" A moment later he's handed his winnings. I could go on with other favorite moments: the flash back scenes in Paris, the desperate attempt by Victor to obtain the letters of transit while outsmarting the Nazis. Needless to say each scene in the movie is a gem.But I think the story had a deeper meaning. Like A Watch on the Rhine, Casablanca makes the case that America can no longer sit on the sidelines while all hell is breaking out in the rest of the world. And like Rick, America must make up its mind which side to support.Having said all that, it also is one damn good love story.As to the DVD itself, it is first rate. The restoration is incredible. If I didn't know the movie was over 60 years old, I'd swear it was done recently and the producers decided to film in black and white for effect. That's how good the quality of the film is. There are hours of extras: a couple of commentaries on the movie itself, two documentaries both narrated by Lauren Bacall, and best of all a radio broadcast with the three major stars reprising their roles.So instead of spending ten dollars a piece on going out to the movies and seeing a piece of junk, go to your local drug store get some microwave popcorn and snowcaps and pop in the Casablanca DVD and see and experience what a real movie should be. Trust me you won't be sorry."	5.0	You must remember this a classic is a classic is a classic	2005-07-22	4	4	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2ENIQZX6VJYUM	J. Robinson	"This is a 1942 movie that marks the high mark in the Bogart career of approximately 75 movies, many filmed at Warner Brothers in Hollywood. It received 3 Oscars, but Bogart did not get his own acting Oscar until African Queen about a decade later. Bogart made a name for himself in the 1930's as a gangster and in smaller supporting roles in Bette Davis movies. In 1941 he played Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon. This became his breakout movie along with High Sierra. The Falcon movie was directed by his buddy John Huston. After the Maltese Falcon, he graduated to more complex parts including love stories, far removed from the early gangster roles. His next movie was the bittersweet love story Casablanca and the multiple Oscars.Casablanca has all the extras and special effects, and in its day it was a big budget movie made factory style, completely on the lot at Warners. Casablanca is a wonderful and fascinating story of an American living in Casablanca during World War II running a nightclub. He is visited by his old girlfriend, Elsa, now married and played by Ingrid Berman. They are still in love, but of course Elsa is married.Bogart appears in virtually every scene, and the movie is carried almost completely by Bogart. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre are perfect for their supporting parts and they add a certain attraction and exotic flair, and depth and mystery to the movie. There is some continuity with the prior movie Maltese Falcon, where Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre had important roles in that movie as well. Here Greenstreet plays the black market travel document dealer Mr. Ferrari and Lorre is the document thief. After Bogart and Bergman, the French police chief Louis Renault played by Claude Rains is the dominant actor.The special effects, the fog, the music ""As Time Goes By"" played by Dooley Wilson are all beautifully done, and when Lazlo and his wife (Bergman) walk out to the plane through the night fog to escape to Lisbon and on to America with Rick's blessing (Bogart) one cannot help but shed a tear.Interestingly the writers did not like the movie, the writing was chaotic often being completed just a day before shooting - all piece work - and there are many technical errors such as a wine bottle with the top appearing and disappearing, and the rain suddenly vanishing from Bogart's rain coat. But it all comes together to make magic.Possibly the best movie ever made, and definitely in the top 10, and the best of the 1940s film noir era. Also, I recommend Double Indeminity, made a few years later, and another great film noir movie.

And the more you wonder why movies like this are so hard to find in the offerings of today. The dialogue is witty, crisp, and memorable. The performances are perfect. There is just enough symbolism and larger themes overarching the plot to put the story in it historical context, and yet it remains timeless.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2GB5CG77LGQRB	Jublistic	CasablancaScore: 89/100If you're heart is racing because you think Casablanca is going to be the best film ever made, slow down and keep on the tracks. Casablanca is far from the best film of all time, but it is one of the best romantic films ever made, an intriguing classic that grabs you within the first minute of the theme and doesn't let go.In World War II Casablanca, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), exiled American and former freedom fighter, runs the most popular night spot in town. The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Viedt) arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) does what he can to please him, including detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan....I think this film is a little overrated. It comes in many people's top 5 films of all time, sometimes deservedly, but for me, it probably wouldn't make my top 30. Sometimes the film just loses it's entertainment value and occasionally left me uninterested. But, that was only occasionally, and in my book, that means very little. The film strings itself together amazingly, bringing the characters together with a vivid spark. The three screenwriters do a brilliant job of showing off their marvellous skills, each have added their special part in Casablanca, and they all make it a memorable and intriguing idea, one of the most praised scripts ever put to film. The performances truly burn in memory, Humphrey Bogart is fascinating, this may very well be his best performance. He is remarkably moving as Rick Blaine, and makes the film's watchability boost to 100. Ingrid Bergman is stunning as well, she strides onto the screen with stunning beauty and power, and is a mezmerising romantic touch. You never know whether to love or hate each character, because each of them have a certain originality about them. This `love-them-or-hate-them' thought is a brilliantly done aspect of the film, and it sustains right to the very end, when we know the characters true self.Casablanca is a great explosion of a film, not to be missed. Without this movie, romance films may of never been so powerful. Thank you, Mr. Curtiz, you've bought true love to our screens.	5.0	A romantic amazement	2001-04-07	3	1	2

It holds many prestigious ranks among critics and movie goers. It was awarded the position of number 3 as the greatest movie of all time for the American Film Institute. It is on the top 250 on IMDB.com, it also won the academy award for best picture and probably on the favorite list of anyone who knows what a real movie is. It is the true benchmark film for all love stories with an all star cast. It's about lost love being rekindled in the time of World War II when the Nazi's controlled most of Europe. Rick a popular American night club owner who is not particulary on anyone's side. His former lover comes into his night club with a husband who is a freedom fighter escaping from the nazis. They need passage to get out Casablanca which is not an easy task because most people there are stuck and can't leave because it is hard and dangerous to get a plane to come to Casablanca for aid. Rick just happens to have special transit papers that cannot be recinded and now must decide to let the woman he loved slip through his fingers again or be with her forever.

With a great story and an all-star cast, including such famed actors as Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Heinreid, it isn't a surprise that viewers wouldn't want this romance to end.Casablanca tells the story of Victor Lazlo (Paul Heinreid), who is escaping the Nazis and trying to get to America with his wife,Ilsa.  They end up in Casablanca, a town in the country of Morrocco.  While there, they cross paths with Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American who owns the popular restaurant Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain.  However, Rick isn't too happy to see them...especially Ilsa, the ex-lover who broke his heart.  Rick is one who doesn't stick his neck out for anyone, but now he must make a difficult decision...should he stay with Ilsa, or help her escape with her husband?This magnificent love story is unlike any other.  It was rated by the American Film Institute as being the best romance movie of all time.  It is also one of my personal favorites, and a movie that I would highly recommend you see if you haven't.Casablanca also contains tons of memorable scenes and quotes that really make it a treasure, and cause the movie to be remembered forever.""Here's looking at you, kid."""	5.0	Easy to enter, harder to leave.	2005-11-13	3	3	0

Then back it up with a suspenseful and exciting script with one of the best supporting casts ever put together. Very special mention has to go out to Claude Rains as Louie. Louie is given many great lines but Raines makes them more special with his performance. ""Major Strasser has been shot.( Long pause- roll eyes -look about) Round up the usual subjects.""

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	Obviously there is a lot of hype about this old movie, calling it &quot;one of the greatest films ever made&quot; and all that. My opinion on the hype is this: there are plenty of films out there that have more psychological insight into its characters and explore deeper themes than CASABLANCA does. Despite the fact that it uses a wartime setting and has a cast of various nationalities, it merely uses these elements as a backdrop to a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama. The whole thing is basically safe old-style Hollywood entertainment, but that's really all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. (CASABLANCA is a film that would probably appeal more to older people who feel nostalgia for the &quot;golden age&quot; of Hollywood than to us progressive younger folk.) To call this film &quot;one of the best films of the cinema ever&quot; would be a gross overstatement of its quality, in my opinion. To me, CASABLANCA is hardly that, and I would not rate this high on my own personal list of the greatest films I've ever seen.The reason I give this movie five stars, though, is that, as old-style Hollywood entertainment, it is pretty glorious. Here is a romantic melodrama that actually had me interested in its characters and situations from roughly beginning to end. The screenwriters and director Michael Curtiz never make the central romantic tensions overblown in any way (something that GONE WITH THE WIND did, to its detriment I think). It all remains nicely down-to-earth, and the actors help make it convincing and fun to watch, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles. Bogart, especially, does a good job with bringing out the sides of his character Rick Blaine, a man who outwardly shows cynicism and indifference, but deep inside still has feelings for Ilsa Lund and really does want to help her and her husband escape the country. (His final sacrificial act at the end of CASABLANCA is one of the most sublime things Hollywood has ever dreamed up.) And of course no discussion of this movie could dare to skip over the now-classic dialogue of this movie, which remains nicely edgy and flavored. (I particularly liked Rick's response to the officer who asks about his nationality, as well as his &quot;I stick my head out for nobody&quot; philosophy.) All in all, here is a romantic movie that never gets soapy, and its honesty of feeling is something to be truly admired.CASABLANCA remains, to this day, an example of Hollywood entertainment at its skillful best. It doesn't have ambitions to be anything other than diverting, and on that level it succeeds magnificently. Just don't come into the movie expecting &quot;the greatest movie you'll ever see.&quot; Recommended.	5.0	Great Hollywood entertainment (if not much more than that)	2004-07-20	8	3	5

Rick isn't unknown to the Gestapo either, as he wasa a gun runner who fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco and the Germans.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A5JLEXPDQKVEQ	Kevin Garry	This movie bothers me for two reasons: first, it's not that good and second, it gets talked about as such a great film. It shouldn't have been that difficult to get the facts right, since they were current events at the time. Victor is &#34;trapped&#34; in Casablanca & the Nazis are reduced to Keystone Kops status. They want him dead but, what, are afraid the sychophantic police captain will, hmm, arrest them? Just plain silly. The Germans will honor a &#34;go anywhere you want&#34; card cuz it's signed by deGaulle? But what pisses me off is when Rick tells Ilsa, who has spent the entire film trying to get him to stop being so self-absorbed and self-pitying & see the bigger picture, to -- that's right: &#34;It doesn't take...&#34; I wanna scream &#34;Slap the S.O.B.! This is what you've just spent days trying to get HIM to understand!&#34; It's misogynistic & racist...need I go on?

In 2003, I snapped up the impressive 2-Disc Special Edition DVD.  In 2008, I couldn't resist going Blu-ray with the comprehensive Ultimate Collector's Edition.  I didn't think that a few years later, Warner would be trumpeting an even more advanced collection.  How many times are we expected to dip into the same well?  I mean, I know it's ""Casablanca"" but when is enough actually enough?  And to use their own terminology, when does ultimate really mean ultimate?  I'm not going to synopsize the film or offer a traditional review, I suspect if you're shopping this pricey new version that you are well aware of the merits of the film itself.  Instead, I will highlight what is included.  Is it worth the upgrade?  That's an individual answer, to be sure, but if you are an enthusiast who owns the Ultimate Collection or a casual viewer that already has the Blu-ray edition--the conclusion might indeed be ""no.""  If, however, you have yet to go Blu on this title or are a compulsive completist/collector--now may be as good a time as any to pony up the bucks for this limited edition set.Contents:  This box set will be a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with 3 discs, the third disc being dedicated to three feature length documentaries.  It is a numbered Limited Edition, only 50,000 will be made available.  The double wide display box contains several new collectibles including a 62 page production art book (with never before seen photos, communications, and archived documents about the film), a full size reproduction of the 1942 movie poster, and four drink coasters.  I love this silly collectible stuff, but what is it with coasters in these deluxe sets?Transfer:  Both the DVD and Blu-ray are boasting new 2012 4K transfers.  Arguably, this is the one aspect that might make me seriously recommend an upgrade.  For my money, though, the previous Blu-ray release is extremely satisfying and competent.  It is NOT a transfer that was begging for a polish.NEW Special Features: 2 Documentaries (about 45 minutes of content total):1) Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic2) Michael Curtiz: The Greatest Director You Never Heard OfFeature Length Documentaries On Third Disc (all previously released):1) You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story (2008)2) The Brothers Warner (2008)3) Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul (1993)OLD Special Features:  Items from the Ultimate Collection will all be carried over.

Enter the lovely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa, his love from pre-war Paris. She had disappeared without a word. It seems she had to leave suddenly because her husband, partisan fighter Paul Henreid, presumed dead, was alive and needed her. Rick never got over losing Ilsa, and now she comes to beg him for an exit visa for her husband.

I've seen both. CITIZEN KANE has an indefinable air of confidence in itself that makes it ""greater,"" but in terms of entertainment value, CITIZEN KANE is relegated to film school classes while CASABLANCA belongs to the viewer.CASABLANCA is so full of gifted dialogue that people who have never seen the film know it's lines . . . ""You must remember this,"" the opening line of the theme song, ""As Time Goes By,"" ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"" ""We'll always have Paris,"" ""Here's looking at you, Kid,"" ""Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine,"" and ""Round up the usual suspects"" are cultural markers. Even the scat dialogue, ""Play it again, Sam"" was the title of a Woody Allen homage to CASABLANCA; that line is never spoken in CASABLANCA itself. The nearest line is, ""Play it, Sam, for old times' sake.""So much of CASABLANCA is in the casting. Many of the extras and repetoire players were in fact refugees from Hitler's Europe. Humphrey Bogart is the lead, ruggedly, though not impossibly handsome, while his love interest, played by Ingrid Bergman,  has inspired me to sit my son down in front of the screen with the explanation, ""That's a GIRL."" Claude Rains plays the witty, amoral Captain Louis Renault with a gleam in his eye. Sidney Greenstreet, ""leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, an influential and respected man"" makes suggestions, ""why I do not know, since it cannot possibly profit me.""In the days CASABLANCA was made, lower-budget films were churned out weekly by the studios, in reliance on stock characters, a stable of contract character actors, and quick-drawn scripts. This film has a natural chemistry---not a scene unneeded, a line unnecessary---that lifted it above its origins.  There are other similar films of the period with essentially the same cast. None of them is CASABLANCA.If you've never seen CASABLANCA, SEE IT. You are missing one of life's great pleasures and treasures. For those of you who haven't, it is the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate living in Casablanca at the end of 1941. He owns Rick's Cafe Americain, a classy nightclub where the denizens of wartime Casablanca---Arabs, Frenchmen, Nazi soldiers, spies, smugglers, thieves, Resistance Fighters, war refugees, and the merely unanchored---congregate nightly in order to conduct what business they can.  Although once a supporter of humanitarian causes, Blaine is now hopelessly cynical, and sticks his neck out for nobody.This ""wise foreign policy"" begins to unravel, when the black marketeer, Signor Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is arrested in the cafe for murder. What no one but Rick knows is that Ugarte has obtained two laissez-passer from his victims, exit visas he is planning to sell ""for more money than you can possibly even imagine"" to the Freedom Fighter Viktor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife.The plot thickens when the Laszlos arrive. Ugarte has left the passes in Rick's possession, but Rick has no intention of selling them, once he discovers that Mrs. Laszlo is the love of his life, Ilsa Lund. Rick and Ilsa met and fell deeply in love in Paris. It had been their plan to flee ahead of the Germans and marry once in a safe haven, but Ilsa chose to leave Rick at the last moment without any explanation.Rick's cynicism hardens into pure jadedness. Although he is aware that Laszlo is a great leader of the anti-Nazi underground, and though he knows that Laszlo will probably be killed unless he is helped to escape, Rick refuses any entreaties from Laszlo. Only Ilsa's loving heart saves his spirit; and renewed, he sends Viktor and Ilsa safely on to America.CASABLANCA is a true romance. From Laszlo's line to the German Kommandant, ""You'll forgive me if I'm not gracious,"" to Ilsa's tearful explanation of her decision to leave Rick for his own safety, people simply never talked that way, nor acted that way in real life. They never stood on the airport tarmac in the fog saying noble things as they bid farewell forever. But there is something so glorious in the film that we wish we could be Rick and Ilsa. CASABLANCA is its audience, perfected."	5.0	"""Play it again, Sam."""	2011-01-01	5	3	2

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2Q07KQAAFWVL7	Kristoffer Infante	Interesting how a film this small (in length) can still have such a powerful effect on us today. Though most would say it is a sappy, corny film for today; it is, however, a very romantic and potent film that deals with separated love and the rekindling of one's feeling for another, despite the fact that one is married with another man whom she loves, and the other has moved on with his life.Directed by Hungarian director Michael Curtiz, a stock director of many Warner Bros. films, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Blaine and Ilsa Lund Laszlo, the lovers in question. With such powerful and mesmerizing chemistry, these two light up the screen as never before. Bergman shows such innocence and beauty to this role that you kind of wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar (she was, however, nominated that same year in 1943 for Best Actress in FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL, she lost to Jennifer Jones). Bogart, of course, brings the rugged charm and swagger of the American to the otherwise foreign country of Casablanca. (He was nominated for Best Actor that year for this role, but lost Paul Lukas.) Bogart and Bergman bring the tenderness to the film as well, when they flashed back to the time they met in Paris - dancing, drinking champagne, driving a convertible through France like lovers; all this just before Germany took over France. Then, they tried to escape together! Unbeknownst to Rick at the time, Ilsa was already married to another man, Czech freedom fighter and rebel leader Victor Laszlo, played with worldly charm by Paul Henreid. Ilsa leaves Rick for Victor, whom she thought was dead, and he takes off to Casablanca alone - well, not alone; he is accompanied by his black pianist and friend Sam, played by singer Dooley Wilson.Months pass by and Rick sets up shop in Casablanca, Moracco. His bar/restaurant/casino is called Rick's, the place to be! It is the oasis in the desert! Everyone comes to Rick's, including the dreaded Nazis! Led by Major Heinrich Strasser, played by Conrad Veidt, he is on the look out for Victor Laszlo and others who are among the cause against Nazi Germany. Assisting Strasser is Captain Louis &quot;Louie&quot; Renault, played with comedic charm and sexist undertones by British actor Claude Rains, who received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this role. You can tell that Rains is having fun with this role, smiling every so often that you can't help but like the guy, even though he's on the German's side.There are others thrown in the mix of things. Sydney Greenstreet plays the overweight and tricky Ferrari; Peter Lorre is the drowsy-eyed, sniveling Ugarte, who has the courier papers to get out of Casablanca. And S.Z. &quot;Cuddles&quot; Sakall plays Carl, the headwaiter at Rick's. (NOTE: Bogart, Greenstreet, Lorre, and Rains all co-starred together in 1941's THE MALTESE FALCON and other films for Warner Bros.)There are perhaps the most memorable lines in this film than any other. Such as: &quot;Here's lookin' at you, kid&quot;; &quot;I stick my neck out for nobody&quot;; &quot;Louie, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;; and &quot;Of all the gin joint and all the taverns and all the saloons in the world, she had to walk into mine,&quot; (the latter has been used, altered, and changed for the years by other copycats that I'm not sure how it goes anymore); and the big speech of &quot;you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.&quot; Laszlo himself isn't without good moments, as we see him instruct Rick's orchestra to play the French national anthem and drowning out the Germans as they see their country's anthem. (A truly inspiring moment that even inspired me with my film PRISONER OF WAR!) There's also the romantic ballad that Sam plays on his piano called &quot;As Time Goes By,&quot; the song that Rick and Ilsa remember as their love song. It stirs up old memories and rekindles the old flame again. And there's that wonderful score by Max Steiner, who also wrote the moving score to GONE WITH THE WIND.Later on, after we've established their past, Ilsa and Victor need Rick's help in getting them out of Casablanca. But love triumphs in the end, and Rick gives them the visa papers (Ugarte had them hidden in Sam's piano). It all comes to an end when they meet one last time at the plane terminal. The plane takes off and both Ilsa and Laszlo take off just as Strasser appears! Rick shoots him dead, and Louie tells the guards: &quot;Round up the usual suspects!&quot; And it all ends, Rick and Louie walk away in the foggy night as the film plays the French anthem once more before fading out this truly classic film.Winner of 3 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Hal B. Wallis, producer; Best Director - Michael Curtiz; and Best Adapted Screenplay (from the play) - Howard Koch and Philip &amp; Julius Epstein.They sure don't make movies like this anymore.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3GTF3Q8KJ265C	K. Williams	"Casablanca includes the perfect blend of mystery, romance, humor, and intrigue. More than once, tough moral decisions must be made amidst formidable consequences. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular nightclub in the corrupt town of Casablanca. Most guests come to Rick's place for entertainment and libations. Others are gambling for a better life at the roulette table or a special favor under the table. An unpleasant outcome to a past brush with romance enables Rick to make decisions not governed by typical human emotion. However, when his painful past (Ingred Bergman) shows up in desperate need of help, will emotion blur his judgment? Bogart's debonaire portrayal of the go-to man well compliments Bergman's emotionally tortured devotee of men with contravening agendas. Casablanca is a well-cast enjoyable classic.Movie quote: ""Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so."""	5.0	Perfectly scripted, casted, directed, and preserved (recommended)	2006-03-27	4	2	2

The first time the two of them see each other in the film, you can see the whole history of the relationship just in Bergman's face. And for a romance this movie has a real plot, revolving around the Nazi occupation of French-Africa. Bergman's husband played by Paul Henreid is actually the leader of the Czech-resistance who keeps escaping from the Nazis.The real story though is Bergman's and Bogart's. It is a classic story of love and sacrifice, but Bogart's classic tough guy attitude, and his chemistry with Bergman makes this film unforgettable.	5.0	Greatest Romance of all Time	2006-02-23	2	1	1

The French have just capitulated to the Germans and established the Vichy government, a puppet pro-German government, but not all French authorities in Casablanca are in agreement. Claude Rains plays the chief of police and shrewdly entertains the German occupiers, as he continues taking care of number one.Paul Henreid plays a French resistance leader running for his life and hopeful of obtaining exit visas in Casablanca for he and his wife (Ingrid Bergman). But they are not the only ones. Many of the emigres are in desperate need of more money to buy a seat to Lisbon and from there America. The turnover of desperate souls all meet, dine, and gamble at Rick's where they convey the challenge of not knowing how to get out.Casablanca is a love story about nationalism and of people. Rick is introduced as a hard boiled businessman without patriotism or caring. His fellow nightclub owner (of the Blue Parrot) is played by Sydney Greenstreet, also an unscrupulous dealer. And to make the trio complete Peter Lorre plays a daredevil murderer who recently killed two German soldiers to get hold of the diplomatic pouch that contained two blank exit visas.The second disc contains the usual features one might expect; ""a tribute to Casablanca"", ""Bacall on Bogart"" - a candid discussion from Lauren Bacall on the life and career of her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and newly discovered deleted scenes and outtakes.All in all, this set is the way to go.

The first disc contains two commentary tracks (one with Roger Ebert, one with historian Rudy Behlmer), a two-minute introduction by Lauren Bacall, and a gallery of trailers. The film transfer is also identical to the original release, but this film looks about as great as it possibly can on DVD.The second disc contains the one hour and twenty minute 1988 ""Bacall on Bogart"" documentary and a thirty-five minute making-of documentary ""You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca"". Next is a seven minute feature with Bogart's son and Bergman's daughter titled ""As Time Goes By: The Children Remember"", along with the eight minute 1995 cartoon spoof ""Carrotblanca"". A selection of deleted scenes and outtakes, totalling about seven minutes, are of particular interest here (though there is no sound for any of them), and a ""Production Research"" gallery. Of lesser interest is the premiere episode from the 1955 ""Casablanca"" TV series titled ""Who Holds Tomorrow?"", it's a noble failure and clocks in at about nineteen minutes.As far as special features go, the only thing the""Casablanca"" Ultimate Collector's Editionhas over this release is the hour-long 1993 documentary ""Jack Warner: The Last Mogul"" on a third disc. It's quite entertaining and informative, particularly for film buffs, but it's really the only reason to purchase the 'Ultimate' edition.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1E5UORKVDG6V	Len Hart	"I have been told that I am fascinated with a ""mediocre"" movie.  I'm talking about Casablanca, the 1942 classic starring Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine), Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa Lund), Paul Henreid,(Victor Laszlo), Claude Rains (Captain Louis Renault).Detractors may say what they will but Casablanca is a classic, a one of a kind gem, a happy collection of talent and circumstance that happens once in a life time.Casablanca has at least this much in common with Shakespeare: much of the dialog has become a part of the language. Phrases like: ""...here's lookin' at you, kid"" and ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" have become a part of our heritage while ""...round up the usual suspects"" inspired a movie of its own. Likewise, Casablanca'swit would make Oscar Wilde proud. For example: ""I don't mind a parasite; I object to a cut rate one."" Also --Rick tells Renault that he came to Casablanca for the waters. Renault objects that Casablanca is in the desert. ""I was misinformed"", Rick replies. The most famous quote of all is one that was never uttered in Casablanca: ""Play it again, Sam."" The actual exchange was:SAM: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.ILSA: (softly) Play it once, Sam, for old time's sakeSAM: I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.ILSA: Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By.""And that brings up the music. It is the music --as much as the improbable cosmopolitan atmosphere, the smart white jackets and bow ties, the Nazi threat --that conjures up our nostalgia for a past we never knew and perhaps never was. As Time Goes By is not the only standard made timeless by its use in Casablanca. Sam is playing and singing ""It Had to be You"" as we enter Rick's Cafe Americain for the first time.Still, critics will tell you Casablanca is a mediocre movie. Mostly notably, Humberto Eco [From: Signs of Life in the U.S.A.: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers, Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon, eds. (Boston: Bedford Books, 1994) pp.260- 264] wrote: "". It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects.""Now having told us that it is mediocre Eco goes on to tell us why it is great:""It opens in a place already magical in itself -- Morocco, the Exotic --  and begins with a hint of Arab music that fades into La Marseillaise. Then as we enter Rick's Place we hear Gershwin.  Africa, France, America.  At once a tangle of Eternal Archetypes comes into play. These are situations that have presided over stories throughout the ages. But usually to make a good story a single archetypal situation is enough.  More than enough. Unhappy Love, for example, or Flight. But Casablanca is not satisfied with that: It uses them all. The city is the setting for a Passage.... The passage from the waiting room to the Promised Land requires a Magic Key, the visa. ...But eventually we discover that the Key can be obtained only through a Gift -- the gift of the visa, but also the gift Rick makes of his Desire by sacrificing himself For this is also the story of a round of Desires, only two of which are satisfied: that of Victor Laszlo, the purest of heroes, and that of the Bulgarian couple. All those whose passions are impure fail.""Eco's language is familiar to anyone who's read Joseph Campbell. These ideas influenced a generation of film makers --most notably George Lucas and Steven Speilberg. Quite simply, Casablanca speaks to us with the same force and with the same authority as the Arthurian Legends of whom Winston Churchill wrote: ""If they are not true, they ought to be.""My own reasons for loving Casablanca are simpler but sufficient at least for me: I'm a sucker for ""As Time Goes By""; I wanna take on and defeat the Nazi Reich whenever I hear the La Marseillaise; I can't look at Ingrid Bergman without falling in love.What more do you want from mere celluloid?Critics will always be held at bay by films like Casablanca. Pointing up its mediocrity they merely prove its lasting greatness. Someday you'll understand that. Not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But soon and for the rest of your life!

"If you were to read my reviews you would see that I often comment that a classic movie or book isn't as great as it's cracked up to be.  For example, Citizen Kane is a mediocre movie, and 8 1/2 is nothing.  Shakespeare comedies are often little more than stupid, sorry re-runs of each other, with the same stupid tricks in them.  The Scarlet Letter by Hawthorne is silly garbage, as is the rest of Hawthorne's writing.  I'm an iconoclast.  I don't do it to be different.  I do it because I believe it.  I call them as I see them.Casablanca is in the running for the greatest movie ever made.  It is uplifting and emotional.  You can't ask for more.One of my favorite scenes is the one in Rick's when the Germans begin singing their song, and Laszlo decides not to take it.  He orders the band to play the Marseillaise, and the crowd at Rick's drowns out the Germans.The symbolism is obvious rather than subtle, but I like it that way.  I like the way the French police captain tosses a bottle of Vichy water into the trash and kicks it.  It's not a little ""in"" joke for the initiated.  It is as subtle as a rap in the head.  That's the way it should be.World War Two was the single most important event in human history.  You can't get emotional about other wars.  They are all controversial.  This one isn't.  This was the only war I know of that was really good vs evil.  Other wars are shades of gray against each other, with both good and evil on both sides.I'm sure you know the plot.  I just need to cast my vote and reward this wonderful movie with the highest rating."	5.0	A classic that lives up to its reputation	2005-12-09	4	2	2

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	This 1942 film is a classic, and rightly so.  Staring Humphrey Bogart,Ingrid Bergman and Paul Heinreid, it was originally just another oneof the more than 50 films turned out each year by each of the majorstudios that dominated Hollywood in those days.  It's releasecoincidentally coincided with the Nazi occupation of France, and itstheme and its timeless love story caught the public'simagination.Casablanca in French Morocco is under French rule andone of the places in the world where refuges can get safe passagevisas to go on to Lisbon and eventually to America and freedom.  It isseething with intrigue and corruption.  Humphrey Bogart is anex-patriot American citizen who runs Rick's Cafe, where much of thecommerce takes place.  Peter Lorre is a smuggler, Sidney Greenstreetis a black marketeer, and Martin Dooley is the piano player known asSam.When, one evening Ingrid Bergman comes in to the cafe on thearm of her husband, Paul Heinreid, and asks the piano player to&quot;play it Sam&quot;, he reluctantly plays &quot;As Time GoesBy.&quot; This melody which is played throughout the movie, is theglue that defines the romance.  There's electricity between thelovers.  There's intrigue and double dealing.  Something excitinghappens in each scene.  And the acting is so good that it brought meright into Casablanca.  The story is always clear.  The danger isalways there.  The tension sizzles.One particularly meaningfulscene was when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing anominous song to the &quot;Fatherland&quot;.  It makes everyone in theRick's cafe very uncomfortable.  That's when Paul Heinried instructsthe orchestra to play the French national anthem, the&quot;Marseilles&quot;. Everyone starts to sing.  The Nazis aresilenced.  The music takes over.  I found my eyes filled withtears.The video I rented included a &quot;made for TV program&quot;that featured interviews with some of the original writers andrecollections from people working on the set at the time.  There wasan interview with the man who did the music. He said that when hewrote that into the script he actually felt tears running down hisface.  It was the same powerful emotion that I felt too.The moviewas shot in black and white.  It was also shot in a studio inHollywood.  The airplane scene used a cardboard cutout of a plane andhired midgets dressed as mechanics.  Shot from a distance and througha fog it was realistic and served the same kind of purpose oftoday's video imaging and special effects.Of course all theprincipals are dead, but their celluloid images in a timeless classicfilm lingers on.	5.0	Intrigue, corruption, love and tension in every scene	2000-09-20	114	92	22
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AD2BIAIH78QI5	"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal"""	"Paul Henried's last line to Humphrey Bogart points out that the great ""Casablanca"", lauded today as a romance, was in fact more importantly a propaganda movie. From our vantage point now in July 2003, it's all too easy sometimes to forget that the war was really raging when this movie was made, and that it was by no means certain that America would triumph ultimately against the forces of Nazi Germany. That reich had managed to conquer most of Europe--only England was able to fend off Hitler's machine. So that when Conrad Veidt's Nazi General Strasser asks Bogart's Rick how he'll feel when the Nazis walk into London, Rick's ""I'll tell you when you get there"" is a hopeful boast that England will continue to hold out. I try to enter into the mind of the times when I watch ""Casablanca"" to appreciate how the film was helping to allay the fears of its original audience. How awful to have lived during a time when the entire world was at war. Paul Henried's character in 1942 speaks in the future tense--""we'll win""; thank God we look back now and use the past--""we won"".Of course, the romance of Rick and Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) is what everyone else is talking about. Probably this is a little anomalous, too, in the usual Hollywood movie--here it's the guy who got jilted, the guy who's crying into his whiskey, the guy who says hurtful, hurt-filled things. And the guy who must turn away love when it's his again. So Rick is a tragic hero for whom things aren't really turning out right. But he does grow in the movie. He learns that he must go on in his own development--before, he had sworn the piano player Sam never to play ""As Time Goes By"" again, but he has to get past those kind of self-imposed taboos, not only listening to the song again but taking an interest in humanity again.Bergman's Ilse is a more complicated character. She's torn between two men, her husband and her old lover. Other reviewers have said that ""Casablanca"" is a perfect film, but there is something that's a little off, and that's the relationship between Ilse and her husband, Resistance leader Victor Lazlo, played by Paul Henried. When they have scenes alone, he speaks of his love for her and she vows to stay by his side. It sounds like they've been through a lot together and are truly attached. However, their love is never shown as a romantic love; when he leaves her to go to a meeting of the Resistance in Casablanca, he kisses her on the cheek. Another time he kisses again, also on the cheek. Only Rick kisses her on the mouth passionately. I suppose this will make her look less like a two-timer to the audience, but it's a little too unrealistic to think that a husband will not kiss his beloved wife with any kind of ardor. I think this undercuts her dilemma of having to figure out which man to leave and which to cleave to. She should be truly romantically involved with both men, not merely ""married"" to Henried, but shown to be in an intimate relationship with him.  Paul Henried is very likeable as Victor, but his character this way is constructed to be a hero without sufficient human roots. His greatest love capacity seems to be an altruistic one.  Ilse's attraction to Rick is that with him, she's paramount while with Victor she places second to his love for the cause. In effect, what happens to Ilse is that she winds up being second with Rick too as he rekindles an interest in the cause himself. It would be interesting to explore what that would mean to her, that the war is robbing her of a fulfilling romantic love with both men. She could either become embittered or she could be ennobled herself, accepting that there is something bigger than herself that must take precedence. Rick ""tells"" her this at the airport, but it would be more effective if she knew it within herself as well. The film has her leave with her husband, but how will she really respond?These are plot considerations--what about everything else? Well, the acting in ""Casablanca"" is first rate all the way. I've always believed Warner Bros to have had the superior stable to MGM, and this movie proves that point admirably. It stands with ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" as having the best ensemble performance in Hollywood. Of course, appearing in both movies is one of my very favorite actors, Claude Rains. I just saw the movie last night on a pier in NYC, and his scenes consistently drew the most laughs and applause. In a way, he really runs away with the picture and was cheated out of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It's the role of a lifetime, and he does all he can with it. Peter Lorre is wonderful in his early scenes with Bogart as the smarmy insecure Ugarte; he manages to convey his wish to impress Bogart with a lot of economy. Sidney Greenstreet is on target as the sensuous Fat Man. Smaller roles such as the wait staff and bar patrons are all well-executed. And Ingrid Bergman is simply luminous as Ilse. That scene in the Paris bar, when she brushes her hand against Bogart's cheek is pure movie magic--star quality all the way.Like just about everybody, I love ""Casablanca"" as one of Hollywood's very best achievements; I'm on their side, too, cheering all the way."	5.0	"""Welcome back to our side--this time I know we'll win"""	2003-07-12	21	17	4

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1NI16O7HWFXQI	Lion	Almost everyone has heard of &#34;Cassablanca.&#34;  Released in 1942, World War II was more than just the news of the day, and it was a timely backdrop for this story.  More a love story than a war story, the two blend together perfectly.This is more a drama than an action flick.  You're not going to see bombs, damned torpedoes (full speed ahead!), or Schwarzenegger shooting fifty people while he kicks two others.  What you will get is a thoughtful, caring story about two people whose lives and loves were changed by events outside their control.  You'll see characters that are somewhat realistic people trying to survive (or even profit) from a war.  You'll see friendships solidify.Most of us won't have the cathartic release that those watching in the theater in 1942, looking for a release from war fears and war life.  I think we can still appreciate that aspect of the film, though.  It's definitely worth seeing.	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2014-03-22	0	0	0

Casablanca is by far one of my favorite movies and I love it more the more I watch it. However, I just purchased it (for the second time in about a week) from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, fulfilled by Amamzon. Both times I received it, there was a terrible gash on the back of the case that went all the way into the hard plastic of the case, a problem that had been ""coincidentally"" covered by extra stickers on the wrapping. The first time I got the movie, I was appalled and, while I only paid $7.something for it, I wasn't going to accept a hideous case. I sent it back and gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered it again for relatively the same price...and ultimately the same result. I just received the case about an hour ago and I can tell you that I am FURIOUS with this company. My assumption is that someone took a knife to the back of the case and cut it all to hell by accident and therefore resolved to cover up their mistake. Well I'm not going to pay for this atrocity. I am sending it back ASAP and getting my money back. I am NEVER ordering from this company again. I'll take my chances buying Casablanca elsewhere, even if that does mean I have to pay more money. For such an amazing movie, it deserves to be encased in a practically perfect case. I'll reserve judgement on other companies on Amazon selling this movie. As for those who don't care about the case of a movie, feel free to order from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, just be prepared for a mangled case. I honestly hate to write a review so terrible in relation to this movie. But I paid good money expecting a pristine, undamaged case and I received a pathetically covered up gash instead. Twice. Take my advice please, don't waste your money on this company, it may be cheap, but believe me, it looks cheaper.****UPDATE!*** I decided to give it one more try considering it was from a different company and it was coming by a different shipper. Same exact damage! What fresh hell is this? Absolutely dumbfounded. In fact, the damage is WORSE from this one! I got this one from what I believe is PONOS and fulfilled through Amazon. I now have reason to believe that the common link is Amazon, and therefore, I believe all cases fulfilled through Amazon are damaged, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, but considering this is the 3rd time this has happened, I feel it is only fair to update my review and now go after Goliath itself! DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON WHATSOEVER. I don't care if it's from a different selling company, amazon fulfills it. Save your money and go out to your local Walmart or Target, chances are they'll have it in the 5 dollar bin so it's a better buy elsewhere.

I've got this on DVD and every once in a while I pop it in to spend an evening remembering why it is so incredibly special. The characters in it are as fresh now as when I first saw it, and their struggles are just as meaningful. You watch Rick go from a wry lover to a jaded man who tries to pretend nothing matters any more. Ilsa is torn between loyalty to the man who taught her to be a woman and her passionate love for Rick, who makes her feel like one. Every character has strong motivations, and is acted superbly.The black and white might be a drawback in other movies, but here the use of shadows is amazing. The textures and depths come alive under the masterful hands of the cinematographer.The DVD has a 'making of' which goes into a lot of the background and techniques, and also explains why the dialogue is so amazing. At least three sets of people worked on it, each adding in their own talents to make the romance real, the conversations an intellectual chess game, and the tensions high.  They wrote it as they went, altering the dialogue to match the characters, so they were almost developed 'live' as the movie progressed.In the end, I think what appeals to me the most is that Rick made a tough decision to do what he thought was 'right' instead of what would be best for him personally. He had to send his love off with another man, knowing that it was the best thing he could do. Ilsa had to choose between two men that she loved for very different reasons. It's an amazing film about responsibility and maturity in difficult conditions, and one I will gladly watch over and over again.	5.0	A Timeless Classic	2001-03-08	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AYZLXLVMJGTJV	L. J Nary	This movie is about World War 2 and how people were trying to get to the Americas by way of Lisbon thru Casablanca, the free French territory. This is a place where everybody tends to gather and has the atmosphere of excitement and familiarity. Rick owns this cafe with its separate gaming quarters. Humphrey plays this character, he owns his space with wit and flat affect, which seems common in his acting. He has been duped in love and is reserved and withholds emotion towards people in general. He finds out that a man who is quite respected in speaking out against the Nazis is coming to his establishment. What surprises him is who this man brings with him. It is the old flame who he loved and crumbled his defenses with her elegance and style. This is played by Bergman, Ilsa. She is married to the famous speaker and writer and Rick is taken aback. They are trying to escape to America. The things I liked about this film are the plush feel to the Cafe and the black and white eloquence of how it was filmed. The bazaar and exciting culture glimpsed with the set of Morroco. The dialog which is known by many, Heres Looking at you Kid and Play it again Sam. The words and how they are said. Bergman reminds me of Nicole Kidman. She is so feminine and respectable to me. I like the way she talks and how she comes across on film. The ending is different than the norm and you wonder if Ilsa was acting somewhat with Rick to save her husband. It seems like it wasn't acting she just was so strong in not running back to Rick on the last scene of their parting. He doesn't reflect his pain on her departure which is too bad, I think his emotional self could have been displayed a little more in this ending shot of his leaving with the constable, even though his character is quite guarded with armor. I liked the drives that Rick and Ilsa took in France, their leisure and intimate togetherness in cafes. Roulette is fun. This is in his small casino. Champagne and caviar, which is eaten on toast points and luscious bubbly swilled. An elegant film all in all.	4.0	Wit and Eloquence	2010-08-06	2	2	0

Danger (when this was made there was a real chance the Nazis would take over the world). An exotic setting.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A29D83NKRLFA34	Luke McCall	"I'm of three minds on the subject of the greatest love story. It's either this remarkable film in which Rick (Bogart) sends Ilsa (Bergman) off for the greater cause, Gone With The Wind in which Scarlett O'Hara doesn't realize she loves Rhett until its too late, or Titanic in which Rose DeWitt Bukator carries the memory of Jack Dawson in her heart throughout a titanic lifetime. It's tough... so, I don't think I'll even try.I will say that Casablanca means so much to so many people, to even write a review, I feel like I'm walking on pins and needles. The dialogue is still some of the best written ever. You've got the most timeless lines; ""Here's lookin' at you, kid"" or ""Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she walks into mine"" or ""We'll always have Paris"". But, visually, it's not quite as inspired, stunning or meaningful as its big-budget counterparts. Is that a good or a bad thing? Tough to say.I think the three films outdo one another in certain areas. Where Casablanca fails in terms of its visuals, Gone With The Wind and Titanic succeed with flying colors. No pun intended. Where Gone With The Wind may get tiresome after the first three hours, Casablanca and Titanic succeed so much better in terms of pace. Where Titanic fails with dialogue is where Casablanca and Gone With The Wind succeed gloriously. It's a beautiful triangle of great romance, great action, and great drama if you ask me.After so many years, Casablanca still looks great. Die-hard fans should love all of the new extras in this set.For being one of the three legs in a tripod of love set against apocolyptic backdrops in which the lovers are tested, forced to separate, and ultimately give their audiences a greater view of the world... (let me catch my breath)... Casablanca may be the one leg that supports the other two best."	5.0	Still as great today as it was then	2007-03-04	0	0	0

Most important behind the scene information was the director, film crews and most actors in this movie were actually affected by the Nazi.  They were fleeding for their live and later got to be in this movie, so you can see the high moral spirit in this movie.  It not just a romance movie about love between two people.  It is a movie about social responsibilities, and greater love for the country, people and principle they fought for.  It is a great movie to see and learn and understand.  Though it was black and white movie, but the cinemaphotography was the best of its time.  Ingrid Bergman superb beauty and cherisma just made tough guy even like Humphrey Bogart melted.

I feel strongly Richard made the right choice for Isla, as it is in her best interest to stay with her husband even if another suitor catches her eye and is the love of her life.  Frankly, love is overrated and unnecessary.  Life is much better when it is stable and there is not much in the way of emotion.  I recommend all women watch this film if only to remind themselves the importance of duty, tradition, values, and family honor.

The picture quality of this new digital transfer is downright stunning and easily surpasses all previous DVD releases. The sharpness and the rich contrast reveal the plasticity and the expressive quality of the image in an unsuspected dimension. To take but that example, the studied close-up shots of Ingrid Bergman's face are simply breathtaking. The sound is mastered perhaps a little low, but with the volume turned up sufficiently, proves clear and flawless.The extras alone would already be worth the investment. There are two interesting, complementary commentaries by film historian Rudy Behlmer and critic Roger Ebert. Especially Ebert's narration will learn you a lot about what you actually see on the screen. (Watch for the midgets around the plane in the closing scene). There is a fine documentary on Humphrey Bogart presented by Lauren Bacall and on disc 2 Stephen, son of Humphrey Bogart and Pia Lindstr&ouml;m, daughter of Ingrid Bergman evoke how their parents experienced Casablanca. In ""You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca"" one gets a complete view of the production. Finally, there are trailers, biographical sketches, scoring stage sessions, and even (silent) outtakes and additional scenes.In short, Casablanca gets what it deserves and this DVD set should figure in every serious movie collection."	5.0	The definitive Casablanca	2003-12-16	5	5	0

I will try to sum it all up in one question however.Casablanca is about a fundamental choice some people have to make at some crucial point in their lives. What is more  important: find love or fight for freedom?Rick, the eternal cynic who did not stick his neck out for anyone, chose to fight freedom. I am not sure what I would have done. Perhaps I would have chosen love. Maybe I am a wimp, or maybe I take freedom too much for granted, as I never had to fight a war to have it.	5.0	what do you do if you must choose between freedom and love?	2013-03-19	0	0	0

For those who attention spans are are too short or who think of the Matrix as &quot;Deep&quot; - I recommend &quot;Casablanca&quot; - the perfect movie.  Star-crossed lovers have never been more heartbreakingly portrayed than Bogart and Bergman.  The supporting cast and the script are perfect.  The photography is transferred with museum-quality perfection to this DVD.  The movie as it currently exists is so perfect - it is almost inconceivable to consider that up to the end of shooting they toyed with a different ending.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; may have a reputation of being called &quot;The Greatest Movie&quot; more often than &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it is technically brilliant - but the characters of Casablanca visit my dreams often and vividly, and I never dream of Charles Foster Kane and his screen partners.Bogart is perfectly tough and tender-hearted.  Ingrid Bergman is perfectly beautiful and torn between her noble husband and the man she loved earlier in Paris.This movie is, in short - perfect.  I'll not give another film a higher recommendation unless something higher comes along.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3M4BURS1OLYMI	Matt Hargett	The video presentation is pretty great, I have to say. There is an unacceptable flaw that makes the only reasonable recommendation to skip purchasing this bluray: Dolby Digital 1.0 audio.There have been several releases of classic movies from Warner Brothers, most notably westerns, that contain a dump of the audio track from previous edition DVDs. The most infuriating aspect of this laziness is that a lossless track *must* exist as the basis for the Dolby Digital lossy track! If that track already exists, why not just put it on the disc as LPCM 1.0? Laziness is the only reason I can possibly think of, as it surely isn't endearing any discerning consumers toward Warner Brothers' catalog releases.Warner Brothers came out of the gate very strong, especially with titles from New Line cinema, but now seem to have gone quite sour. Between the extremely poor audio quality on this disc, and the low video bitrates/quality on the Fight Club special edition due to the lack of two discs, I'm avoiding Warner Brothers catalog releases unless I read many reviews that state otherwise.I suggest everyone else avoid the same irritation by making sure there is a lossless track on any blurays you buy, or at least avoiding the dreaded Dolby Digital. If you're looking for classic films that are given a proper treatment, I recommend Criterion and Studio Canal.I sincerely hope that WB offers a trade-in program like Sony had done for The Fifth Element. It is a crying shame that this classic film has an inferior release compared to other great films of the same era from other studios.	2.0	returned it due to poor audio quality	2010-03-01	46	29	17
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Casablanca is one of the most essential films you should watch and own in your DVD collection. Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more. It's also a story about people suffering in the most desperate of times during World War II when The Nazis were occupying many countries and even had a presence in North Africa where this film takes place. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent. In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.When the action starts, we see the French Moroccan town of Casablanca where refugees from Nazi Europe come in the hopes of getting a high priced, black market exit visa to Lisbon--and from there, America. An expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca where they serve up the drinks and the local Vichy government official Captain Renault (Claude Rains) turns a blind eye to the illegal gambling there--just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette! At the same time we also learn that two German couriers have been killed--and the two exit visas they had have been stolen by an unknown thief. The Nazis are fast on the hunt for this man, whom they believe to be a big resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo has been a tough enemy of the Nazis; he even escaped from a concentration camp!One night Victor and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enter Rick's caf&eacute; hoping to buy those two precious exit visas from a character simply named Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed--but not before he slips the exit visas to Rick for some ""temporary safekeeping."" Eventually the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) confronts Victor and his wife Ilsa in his office with Captain Renault; but Strasser will only let them out of Casablanca if Victor rats on other leaders of the resistance movement.Meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating--and this aspect of the story gets pretty hot, too. It seems that just before the German occupation of France, Rick and Victor's wife Ilsa had a brief love affair. At the time, Ilsa thought that Victor was dead and so she didn't think she was cheating on him. However, Rick gets a huge shock. Just when Rick and his sidekick Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) are about to leave Paris for safer ground along with Ilsa, Sam hands Rick a note from Ilsa telling him they can never see each other again and she doesn't even say why. But now that Rick sees Ilsa is married to Victor, Rick finally knows why Ilsa dumped him. But wow, he is upset and angry anyway! He still loves Ilsa; and she loves both him and Victor in her heart of hearts.Although it may seem that I've already written too much, I already left out some juicy details to the plot to keep you interested up to this point. And, of course, this is all very heavy stuff--how will it all turn out? Will Victor be trapped by Major Strasser and the other Nazis and be unable to leave Casablanca? Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick? What ever does happen to those exit visas that Ugarte gave to Rick--does Rick hold onto them or will he sell them to the highest bidder and get out of Casablanca himself? Watch and find out!The single DVD version of this movie doesn't have too many extras; but you will get a half-hour documentary entitled ""You Must Remember This"" which is both hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. We do get outtakes but they are included in this documentary.  In addition, I believe that if you buy the two DVD edition of this film, you get a much longer (almost 90 minute) documentary about Humphrey Bogart's career also hosted by Lauren Bacall. The two DVD edition has commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer.Casablanca is a ""must-have"" movie with outstanding attention to detail; the story is practically guaranteed to have quite an effect on you. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well."	5.0	a great film with so much memorable dialog	2009-03-23	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1CFIU3IBUH24U	"Matthew Menjou ""Mattyboy"""	Casablanca is probably the best happy accident in the history of film (The Third Man in a close second). This film should have been forgettable, but thanks to a wonderful cast, Curtiz's direction, and a script that has given popular culture some of the most enduring quotes of all time, Casablanca is a massive success. Bogart plays Rick Blaine, the cynical club owner in Casablanca who experiences the unthinkable when the only woman he ever loved (the beautiful Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa) comes back into his life, though not in the manner he had hopes; she is married to Victor Laszlo, a resistance fighter against Hitler's Third Reich. What follows is a touching love triangle that climaxes in perhaps the most perfect 10 minutes in the history of movies. This one is not to be missed.	5.0	Perfection	2006-08-24	8	7	1

It has great character development which will draw you into the story and help you experience the desperation of escaping the Nazi occupied Europe in 1942.  Bogart gives a excellent performance as an American bar owner in Casablanca who's past comes back to haunt him as he unwillingly becomes involved in a freedom fighter's escape from the Nazi's.  Bergman also gives a strong performance as Bogart's former flame.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A31GSII2N6W1RR	"""maxiicat"""	"As time goes by, moviegoers all over the world will always remember Casablanca as one of the few ""perfect"" movies ever to be created.  Every detail in this rousing, yet melancholy story of love against the backdrop of WWII is mastered, from the stunning performances of the cast to the witty, oft-quoted dialogue.  The mystery, danger, and allure of Casablanca is expressed beautifully through the sets of Rick's Cafe Amer, the Blue Parrot, and the famous misty airstrip in which Rick and Ilsa say their final farewells.  And, blending all these magical elements together, is the perfect bittersweet song that takes Rick and Ilsa back to their star-crossed love affair in Paris: As Time Goes By.Everyone knows the story.  The legendary Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical American club owner who has an especially dark past:  banned from the United States, blacklisted by the Nazis, and settling in Casablanca after having his heart broken by the only woman he ever loved.  This woman, the beautiful, conflicted Ilsa Lazlo, played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman, has come to Casablanca with the most wanted man on the Nazi's Gas 'Em Quick list, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid, playing Lazlo so well, you have to pity the poor guy).  They're trying to escape to America, but the French Precinct, Captain Louis Reynaud (the incredible Claude Raines), won't give them Visas.  Ironically, the only man who can help Lazlo now happens to be the same man Ilsa loved and betrayed in Paris.  Bitterly facing the prospect of having Ilsa all to himself or losing her forever, Rick makes a gentleman's decision that leads to the most beautifully written farewell in motion picture history.The enduring popularity of Casablanca can be attributed to the love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Lazlo.  It can be attributed to the sheer magic of an entire city of people desperately trying to get away from the Nazis in a time of chaos.  Personally, I believe this movie survives from generation to generation because Rick himself represents the American people on a whole.  His 'don't tread on me' attitude and reluctance to leap into the turmoil of war appeals to us and illustrates the attitude of Uncle Sam.  Although we've seen Casablanca time and time again, there are always those who tear up at Rick's noble sacrifice.  Then there are those who scowl and mutter that Ilsa should have ditched her stiff-collared husband for her one true love, the tough-guy-with-a-good-heart, Rick.  Perhaps this endless debate is another reason for Casablanca's enduring popularity.Casablanca was a once-in-a-lifetime movie.  Because of the cast, the script, and As Time Goes By, to remake this movie would be as insulting as to attempt to remake The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, or even Dr. Strangelove.  Not that there is a need to update Rick and Ilsa'a story.  Casablanca is a worldwide appeal to every generation, and will be one of the few films to persevere, as time goes by."	5.0	You must remember this...	2003-04-29	4	4	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AVX9DLI7CW7GF	M. Farley	This review is for the 2009 DVD release.  I won't touch on the film itself.  If you've seen it, you know how great it is; if you haven't seen it, it's more than worth the cost of the DVD.The only noticeable issues with the transfer are small things that I would attribute to the master being decades old.  Nothing that takes away from the film at all, and still much better than some of the imperfections you see watching a movie in the theaters near the end of its run.The only hangup I have is with the aspect ratio which is why this release gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Casablanca was shot in 1.375:1 (sometimes abbreviated to 1.37:1).  'Widescreen' in movies didn't come around until about 10 years later.  This release is in 1.33:1, which is your standard 4:3 non-widescreen TV ratio.  Because of the cropping you lose about 2-3% of the image (depending on how it was cropped).  Granted, you'd be hard-pressed to notice a big difference without watching them side by side, but I would think they could have done a little better with a new release.  The Blu-ray release is advertised to be in the full 1.37:1 ratio.With the exception of the cropping, it's a good copy and I'm mostly happy with it.	4.0	Almost the full theatrical aspect ratio.	2012-08-04	0	0	0

With all the revisions in the script, how I wish they'd given a reason, other than beauty, for either Rick or Victor Lazlo to want anything to do with this woman.I have an hypothesis:  Rick didn't want Ilsa at all.  He knew she was eye candy.  Rick never wanted a hanger-on, and he dumped her, but chose to reinforce his own freedom by having a fantasy ""true love.""  Rats!  She shows up in Casablanca.  Rick is a gentleman caught in the act of self-deception.  Why dash Ilsa's own delusions about herself?  Treat her nice.  Make sure she leaves with Lazlo.And Victor?  Who knows why he kept Ilsa along for the ride.  Then again, for some odd reason he has celebrity status in the resistance.  He can't go anywhere without someone recognizing him.  One wonders if he didn't take out ads.  Victor seems caught between being an underground resistance fighter, and wanting to be resistance royalty.  As royalty, he would need a queen.  That would be Ilsa.  Couldn't ilsa have a job?  How did she ""help"" her celebrity husband's resistance work except that they made a nice picture.  I'd bet that Lazlo was miserable when he realized that he was stuck with Ilsa.  (He should have run to the plane).  Wait.  I've got it.  He needed Ilsa's adoration.Note that when Lazlo moves to counter the German presence with ""La Marseillaise,"" Ilsa just sits there, all swooney-eyed.  She doesn't love Lazlo - she worships him.  Wouldn't you stand up and sing?  Or stand up?If they'd both let Ilsa go, what would have become of her.  Not being able to come up with an answer to that question is exactly why I'll never be able to accept the alleged romance in 'Casablanca', or Ilsa's strong presence.  Again, Neil Simon got it right at the ending of 'The Cheap Detective'. It was the only rational solution to an 'Ilsa'.Rick and Louie having adventures forever.

This film is a wonder of cinema and well deserves the first class treatment on this DVD issue.Thought by many to be the best film or at least the most popular film of all time it is indeed a wonderful movie replete with danger, intrigue and romance.I will not go through the history of the making of the film but rather leave the discovery of that up to you. There are two wonderful documentaries on this DVD, which will unfurl the fascinating history of Casablanca.Bogart in this film made his mark as a screen icon with his multifaceted portrayal of Rick. His craggy face and world-weary eyes fill the screen with full star wattage. He is the commanding center around which all the other characters revolve. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role. But there were a few other contenders. Thank god or at least Jack Warner that they went with Boggy in the process made him a star.Ingrid Bergman is compelling and beautiful in her anti Hollywood 40's glamour.  She is so natural in the role of Ilsa that she draws you into the world of the film with her tender and desperate performance. When the camera holds her lovely face in full frame, is there a more beautiful face in the entire world?Dooley Wilson as Sam the piano player takes a thankless sidekick and fills him with humanity and warmth. And of course as time goes by, he play's it again.The delicious Claude Raines sparkles with wit and chicanery in his role as the chief of Police Renault. It is pure joy to watch this, one of Hollywood's greatest character actors in his best-remembered role.The cast is rounded out by a who's who of the Warner Brother's A-1 character actors; Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre top this list.The biggest star of the film is the script by the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip. It is tight, razor sharp and witty. The script of any film is its foundation. Without the writers you have nothing. With Casablanca you get a perfect film script.The direction by veteran Michael Curtiz is among his best work. The music by Max Steiner is top-notch example of film music from the golden age. The rousing songs are by M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl, ""Knock On Wood"". The films most famous song is of course by the incomparable Herman Humpfled.Don't go to Casablanca with out dropping by Rick's.

It has many of the most memorable lines ever said on screen and it has influenced everything that came later. It is a story of a cynical antihero who must sacrifice for what's right and the message was aimed directly at the American public who were then engaged in total war. This movie is a true classic movie but that doesn't mean it's boring; after all it has Bogart and other greats in it like CLaude Rains, Ingrid Bergman, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  Of course the line 'play it again sam"" was never actually said in this movie but this movie has been played into the hearts of anyone who enjoys classic romance films.  The print on blu ray looks spotless! It's a example of what needs to be done before a older movie is put on blu ray. It actually looks almost as good as a masterprint here; with NO LINES, spots, and other defects. This looks alot better than what the critirean collection did with 'The third man"" another black and white landmark movie. Although I would recommend buying that one if you can get a cheap copy.  The blu ray also has many other features including a tv version of the movie from the 1950's. Plus A story of Bogart who came from a uppermiddleclass family and was a brilliant actor by any standards.  Anyways This movie is one of the eternal romance movies of all and it's wartime themes of sacrifice and desperation still appeal to the average person struggling to do the right thing in a tough world.

He seemed to like the film enough until the famous Le Marsailles scene where Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo rallies the Rick's Cafe Americain crowd (and drowns out the Germans) with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem. At that point my friend sneered with disgust that the scene was ludicrous because the French are a bunch of defeatist cowards who would never show such blatant resistance. I tried to explain to him both the historical context and the importance of the scene to the film. He wouldn't have it -- his mind was made up. Disgusted, I switched off the VCR and told him that if he couldn't accept that scene, he might as well not watch the rest of the movie. I haven't seen this friend in over ten years, so I don't know if he ever saw the whole film and/or broadened his Bill O'Reilly perception of the French. I certainly hope so.What's amazing to me is that several other people I've met have questioned the purpose of that scene minus the anti-France diatribe. Some of them see the scene as wartime jingoism. Some of them like the scene but still think it's unnecessary. One girl in my college film class even said that the scene's purpose was solely to ""give Paul Henreid more to do."" Mind boggling, to say the least.Up until the Le Marsailles scene, we think we know the characters and their motivations: Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine is a world-wearly cynic who was left embittered by his Ilsa Lund's perceived abandonment -- his past as a gun runner to the Republican forces in Spain seems to be a part of him that is dead and buried; Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa Lund is the woman who has callously deserted our hero for Victor Laszlo, though it is clear she is still in love with Rick; Henreid's Victor Laszlo is a cold and distant person who puts everything, including Ilsa, second to his work; Claude Rains' Louis Renault is an amoral bureaucrat whose own pleasures are his only motivation.The Les Marsailles scene, however, puts everything into perspective, giving the characters depth as well as foreshadowing what they will do later in the film. The Germans, led by Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser, are singing German military songs when Laszlo commandeers Rick's band and leads them, the patrons and the staff in a chorus of Les Marsailles that drowns out the Germans. Rick doesn't have to order his band to accompany Laszlo in his rendition of Les Marsailles, but he unhesitatingly gives his permission, hinting that his long dormant idealism is still alive and well. It sets up his memorable sacrifice at the end of the film when he gives up the love of his life for the greater good.The audience, likewise, gains a much greater understanding of Ilsa from that scene. Up until that time, the audience is tempted to wonder why she would leave Rick for this activist who puts his cause above everything, including her. She may still love Rick, but when she gazes at Laszlo during the scene, it's clear that not only does she love him as well, she also believes in his cause and admires the passion and fervor he brings to his work and beliefs. Suddenly, the audience realizes why it's not so easy for Ilsa to simply go back to Rick and why the decision is so difficult for her.Laszlo suddenly becomes worthy of competing with Rick for Ilsa's affections. As much as we root for Rick, we also realize during this scene that Laszlo is a true hero who, unlike Rick, has never lost his passion and idealism despite the horrors he has been put through and witnessed. For the first time, the audience begins to wonder if Ilsa should really choose Rick over Laszlo. Later, when Rick initially denies the letters of transit to Ilsa so she and Laszlo can escape, the audience's sympathies have turned 180 degrees from the beginning of the film. We begin to see Rick as somewhat selfish for letting his own desires get in the way of the cause. When he comes to his senses and not only gives Ilsa and Laszlo the letters, but gives up Ilsa as well, we know that it's the right decision.Louis' later conversion to the side of right and virtue isn't as blatantly foreshadowed in the Les Marsailles scene. However, when the Germans are singing their military songs, he does register pronounced disgust with what he is hearing. He half-heartedly fights Major Strasser's later order to shut down Rick's, saying lamely that ""everyone is having such a good time."" However, he has made clear with his earlier expression of disgust that he detests the Germans and goes along with their orders out of convenience and not idealogical agreement.Without the Les Marsailles scene, Rick goes from cynic to idealist without any explanation, Ilsa's indecision is inexplicable, Laszlo seems unworthly to take Ilsa from Rick and Louis goes from appeaser to resistor without any warning. The story just wouldn't work without it. The scene switches the focus of the story from lost love to supporting the greater good. It's emotion rivals that of the final airport scene and is absolutely critical to Casablanca. It's so important to the story that I think that the film wouldn't have become the classic it is without it.In 1981, Harry Reasoner produced an excellent segment for 60 Minutes on Casablanca. He pointed out that when Casablanca was released, the Germans did occupy France as well as large parts of Africa, including Casablanca. This wasn't a period piece about events from a long time ago and the emotions portrayed in the Les Marsailles scene were very fresh and very current at the time Casablanca was being filmed. Not only is it absolutely critical to the plot, but it is also a snapshot of the feelings and passions of that time as it was happening. I hope that those who dismiss the scene can go back and, with some deepened perspective, can understand both why the Les Marsailles scene is so important to Casablanca's greatness and what it tells us about what 1942 America's beliefs and feelings were. It might give renewed perspective on our own conflict in Iraq. At the very least, I hope it convinces my friend that the French aren't really so bad after all."	5.0	A classic summed up in one scene	2008-02-15	17	17	0

Bogart choosing  &quot;The needs of the many over the desires of the few&quot; defined the  spirit of the day.  The reality of WW11 adding to the suspense makes this  the finest Hollywood motion picture of all time.  It almost makes me long  to have been alive during that period when our nation was more  humbled,  unified, and perhaps more truly American then at any time before or since.	5.0	Casablanca...Simply The Best	2000-03-09	5	5	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AFFP5R0FJXJIK	Michael  Ziegler	Finally we have a serious 2 disc set with interesting material gathered for the true fan of this classic movie. This is the most perfectly cut movie ever made. Every scene is memorable and no film is wasted. If the film has a weakness, it is that too many drinks are served to characters who never drink them!Included in the special DVD are musical cuts of &quot;Sam&quot; working on tunes to be used in the movie and also a few that were not included. There is an interesting commentary by Roger Ebert but incredibly he blunders during the &quot;Flashback&quot; as he can't correlate Ilsa's husband being discovered in a railroad car still alive with her strange behavior toward Rick in &quot;Le Belle Aurore&quot;! Either he has not been around women enough to recognize the symptoms or it went over his head. (I am not sure which)He is too engrossed with Ilsa when she appears again in Casablanca and requests Sam to play &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; and the facial expression that Rick displays upon laying his eyes on her again. (He mentions this at least twice and perhaps a third time) We also get a good dose of the children of the stars and Lauren (bogey's real wife,well at least the last one)Bacall gives us a nice introduction. The art on the DVD's are great! Also exposed at last is that the advance info of Ron Reagan for the role was FICTION. The deleted scenes are a disappointment. There is no commentary and only two of the same scene are shown. Namely, the prison set-up of Lazlo with Rick agreeing on the money for the highly sought papers. Good for advocates of this movie and if you have the time to delve into the special Disc it will be an interesting experience.	4.0	Casablanca 2 Disc Special really is!	2003-09-27	2	1	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1P5JUWGU30Z49	Michelle	A film is not designated a classic without that film having passed not only the test of peers within the film's time of origin, but it must also be a film which resonates with each coming generation. No film is more timeless in this manner than Casablanca.From the opening titles, you realize that this film is exceptional. Combining the artistic talents of Bogey, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Haydn, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, etc., Casablanca is a movie by which all other movies are measured, yet fall short of in the final analysis.	5.0	The Epitome of a Cinematic Masterpiece	2014-03-24	0	0	0

The only plot item I find difficult to believe is Ingrid Bergman's character falling for someone else so soon after hearing that her husband has been killed.  Other than this the movie is great.  The Blu-ray transfer is fantastic - it probably looks better on a modern video system than it did in most theaters when first shown in the 1940s.

I found it excellent. The movie is crisp and clear, the only graininess was the stock war footage used and there is nothing to be done about that. I had no issues with the sound quality, none of the low volume issues others have brought up. My only nitpick is at certain times in the movie the characters have what I describe as ""stars in their eyes"" where the lighting used reflects heavily in the eyes of the actor or actress. I noticed it in the Blu-ray for the first time. I can't say if this effect has shown up in other formats, but I did not notice it before viewing the Blu-ray. I bought this to replace a ""borrowed"" DVD that never got returned, I think it's a decent upgrade from the regular DVD but not essential if you already own it. There are plenty of good extras on this version, enough to keep almost any avid fan of the movie satisfied."	5.0	Very good transfer, crisp and clear	2011-02-10	2	2	0

Today, a little older and wiser, the tale of intrigue, love lost and regained and the absolute uncertainty of war seem more current and real than ever.  I also realized the fast pace of this film is remarkable and seems very modern.  Somebody was very efficient in the &#34;cutting room&#34; and must have had &#34;Less is More&#34; above the work table.For the first time since this was originally cast and filmed, there could be a modern adaptation and it would work.  The casting, however, might be a problem since &#34;fluff and puff&#34; or action (more brawn, less brains) actors seem to be in the mainstream.  I like action movies like all the rest and probably have contributed in a small way to this deficiency.	5.0	Classic story with a very modern feel	2013-09-14	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A185RNNKCBI2HW	MovieMan12	Casablanca is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made. Up there with The Godfather, this movie has stood the test of time for nearly 75 years. The acting is perfect, the story is perfect, the movie is all around perfect. If you are showing a child the magic of black and white movies, start with Casablanca. It's a classic.As for the 2003 2-disc DVD release, it's definitely the DVD release to stick with (considering all of the double-dips Warner Bros. has been putting out lately). The transfer is great, as is the audio, especially considering this disc is over a decade old. There's also a commentary by Roger Ebert and an introduction by Lauren Bacall. On disc two, there's two documentaries- You Must Remember This, hosted by Bacall (other than her marriage to Bogart, I have no idea why she's all over this release) and Bacall on Bogart, a 1980's documentary on Bogart's life hosted by, once again, Lauren Bacall. Then there's &#34;The Children Remember,&#34; which features Bogart's son and Bergman's daughters talking about their parents. As for added bonuses, we have &#34;Who Holds Tomorrow?&#34; a 1955 T.V. adaption of Casablanca that was featured on &#34;Warner Bros. Presents.&#34; It's not good, but there are some old '50s ads included, which make it worth it. With that is &#34;Carrotblanca,&#34; a 1995 Looney Tunes homage that is even worse than the T.V. adaption, but it's inclusion is nevertheless interesting. Finally, there's a &#34;Screen Guild Players Radio Production&#34; whit the original stars.

Most think this film to be one of the best, myself included.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were both major stars when this film was made but this film took them to an even higher level of stardom.Casablanca is a French province and therefore only under occupational German forces.  This is the place where those trying to escape the war have fled.Rick (Bogie) is the owner of the shady caf&eacute; (and casino).  He fled Paris when the Germans arrived.  He was split away from his love Ilsa (Bergman).  One night in his casino, Ilsa appears.  At first Rick thinks that his love has returned.  Then he finds out that she is married and to the Nazi's most wanted man, Victor Lazlo.  Rick has two authentic travel visas.  The question is are they for Rick and Ilsa or Ilsa and Victor.This is one of the great war movies, one of the great romance movies, one of the a films.This film has two DVD releases: this one and a special edition with additional featurettes.  The question is for each buyer is do you want to spend the extra money for extra featurettes.DVD EXTRAS:Documentary - You Must Remember This - Hosted by Mrs. Bogart (Lauren Bacall) - ExcellentIntroduction by Lauren Bacall - Again excellent	5.0	Bogie and Bergman and Raines, Greenstreet, Lorre....	2005-12-16	6	5	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	If you're one of those people who loves Casablanca unconditionally then what are you doing reading reviews? Go watch it again and continue your beautiful friendship with the film. There is an air of nostalgia that  surrounds people who grew up with the film that obscures the fact that it  is indeed a very silly piece of melodrama peppered with some priceless  moments.One thing in Casablanca that hasn't aged, and I guess will  never age is Humphrey Bogart's brilliant performance as Rick. He is the  owner of Rick's Cafe Amercain, where just about everybody comes. He hides  his idealism under a thick and delicious coat of cynicism, when he says  &quot;I don't stick my neck out for nobody&quot;, you know at that point  that he would and will. But his tough armour is broken, as it is always in  the movies, by a long lost love who walks into his bar early on in the  film, her name is Ilsa played by the lovely Ingrid Bergman. They were  lovers once in Paris, but that was before she learnt that her husband was  alive. Now accompaning her husband Laszlo(Paul Henreid) who is in  Casablanca as an underground leader of the French resistance to the Nazis.  Complicated events unfold after that setup, but I wouldn't want to spoil it  for the few who haven't seen it.Casablanca has a labyrinthine plot  involving the battle between the Nazis and the French resistance in North  Africa, but you never take any of this seriously, never for a moment  believe its melodramatic twists and certainly never believe that those  backlots look anything like Morocco. The political realism of the film is  ludicrous, specifically the ending which I can't reveal as that would be a  spoiler. If the film works, it is because of those treasured individual  moments, Sam(Dooley Wilson) playing &quot;As time goes by&quot;, the aching  looks of love between Rick and Ilsa, the colorful local and the one and  only Humphrey Bogart.You constantly hear professional critics such as  Leonard Maltin above refering to Casablanca as one of the greatest films  ever made, and they may genuinely believe that. The truth is that after  Anthony Minghella's THE ENGLISH PATIENT and Peter Weir's GALLIPOLI,  Casablanca looks very thin indeed. The fact of the matter is no  professional critic would ever be able to get away with criticising  Casablanca. I think it would be safer to read amatuer critics when you're  checking on the &quot;classics&quot;, they have a lot less to lose.Classics such as CITIZEN KANE, THE THIRD MAN, and THE MALTESE FALCON are  genuinely great films that have stood the test of time. Turn out the  lights, forget the reviews and these films would still be stunning.  Casablanca is not in the same league as those titles.I'd hate to give  the impression that Casablanca is a bad film, it is merely a light weight  one that lives on its gentle charm. Its also a film that will join my  Blasphemy files (overrated films that no one dares to criticise) along with  such titles as Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton and Steven Spielberg's Close  Encounter of The Third Kind. But enough sin for now.	3.0	A Blasphemous Review	2000-05-24	35	12	23

And a working 110v outlet.Not much else to say here that hasn't already been said before.  This movie is just tops for romantics.  It is so basic and pure in its portrayal of heroism, friendship, loyalty, love.  That's the movie.The packaging was fine, and Amazon delivered it as promised and on time.  This review is for the VHS version, of course.  The tape is in good shape and the recording quality is good.

I gave it 4 because I was slightly disappointed in the video quality, especially when others are raving about it.  Don't get me wrong, the video quality is very good, generally speaking very sharp.  I watched this and then The Maltese Falcon bluray back to back, and I must admit that The Maltese Falcon's video quality is sharper and clearer.  The let down in Casablanca, as some others have noted, is in the close-ups of Ingrid Bergman.  The video quality goes from sharp to soft in a second.  On a smaller TV, you would probably never notice.  It could be from filters used, make-up, etc.. that is just the way they used to film it.  However, the contrast between sharp and soft is really noticeable on a hd big screen television.  On standard film way back when, I'm sure the video projection at the theatre was just all soft.  They weren't into Hi def in the 1940's!  I will compare the Bluray  to my regular dvd later and see how much better the Bluray is.  Still, it didn't really take much away from the movie itself.  This is one of my favorites.	4.0	Blu ray 70th anniversary	2013-07-21	0	0	0

I was never before interested in viewing this film, but am now glad that I did.  It's helped to open my eyes to the world of the black and white classic movie.The awards for best director (Michael Curtiz), best actor (Humphrey Bogart),and best supporting actor (Claude Rains) were all well deserved.  Ingrid Bergman also did a fabulous job in the part of Bogart's ex-lover.  And who could forget Dooley Wilson's part as Sam, the piano player always willing to provide atmosphere where it was needed most.I find it to be interesting that this movie would take a controversial situation, such as the German occupancy of France, and apply it to a movie based on a love triangle, while still managing to keep the entire thing believable.  I wonder if this might not be the beginning of the day time soap opera.Memorable scenes filled with memorable lines, like ""Here's looking at you, kid."" Help to make this movie.  While the music, aside from that played by Sam, helped to not only provide the emotional atmosphere for the movie, but it also tied together important pieces that might have otherwise been left astray.I found this movie to be well done.  It was believable, but with a twist.

It was supposed to be another movie of the week at Warner Bros.  It was a film meant to accompany the bigger budgeted movies of the time.  The writers of the film said in interviews that they were still writing and rewriting the script during the two week movie shoot.  What came out is a great story about finding love in troubling times; a film about the human condition; a film about finding something once lost.	5.0	A Golden Age Classic	2014-03-03	0	0	0

I must say that this is a shame.  Casablanca is a love story for the ages.  And  quotable, too!!!  Name me one movie with more quotable lines (and  &quot;Jack, I'm flying&quot; doesn't count).  Humphrey Bogart dominates the  film as Rick, but you can't forget Ingrid Bergman's fantastic performance  as Ilsa, the girl Rick never truly gave up.  An underrated job is given by  Paul Henreid, the essential third corner to the love triangle.

Questioning the dictum could eventuate in imprisonment, torture and death.OK, that's ancient history.The worship at the altar of the not-so-silver/noble screen...is this our new belief system? Religion? Our Restored Testament? Consider, on Amazon's comment sections, the bilious invective...the verbal inquisitions; virtual glossectomies, orchiectomies, and lobotomies decreed for heresy.This was filmed rather extemporaneously, on a limited budget, and it shows. The people who made this knew it was kitsch.There is nothing original in the final script. There is no drama, suspense, or character engaging enough to engage. If this antique egesta is golden, ancient coprolite should be priceless.Stone-faced-no-affect Bogart? Could he play Hamlet? King Lear? Indiana Jones? Same guy, same expression in Sabrina, Big Sleep, Barefoot Contessa, Maltese Falcon, etc...He is AFI's #1 actor? With that recognition, he should smile once in a while. This is not a personal attack, as the man was wounded in WWI and attempted to enlist in WWII. A patriot deserving respect.Bergman...again, always Bergman. Could she play Lady Macbeth? Perhaps. Tomb Raider's Lara Croft, even with CGI (that is a low blow)?Neither Bogart nor Bergman, according to a new bio of Bergman, wanted to do the movie after reading the screenplay. Sharing a bottle of hooch, or shared second-hand smoke is as close to 'chemistry' as Bogart/Bergman get. Nothing happening in the test tube. Immiscible, cold compounds.Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid were always good playing themselves.

Rick (Humphrey Bogart)  the owner of a fashionable bar, is shocked when his former lover Ilsa  (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her husband Victor Lazlo, the leader of a  Resistance movement.  Victor is being pursued by the Germans who have a  strong influence over the French authorities in Morrocco and who will be  happy to see him stopped.  Will Ilsa escape with Victor or will she leave  him for Rick...?When they bought the rights to the play (Everyone comes  to Rick's), Warner Brothers couldn't possibly have known how successful  'Casablanca' would be.  It has just the right mix of mystery, intrigue,  romance and humour with a few memorable songs thrown in for good measure.  Watch out too for the references to concentration camps which is suprising  when you consider that it was filmed in 1942.As well as the movie  itself, on the DVD you get a documentary about its production hosted by  Bogart's real-life partner, Lauren Bacall.This is a must-see movie...	5.0	A great DVD of a great movie	1999-07-29	24	19	5

There's the white-horse hero (&#34;I try&#34; he says), the sad tension surrounding everyone at Ric's Cafe American in Casablanca, many trying to find some slender reed of hope for escaping to a safe country during the worst war in history.  Smarmy Peter Lorre's predictable early demise.There's the vulture (gluttonous Syndey Greenstreet) perched to swoop up Ric's cafe for a song, and trying to hire his employees away. Faithful piano player Sam, Ric's only friend.  No actor is more interesting than Humphrey - flawed, paradoxical, cynical, tough, but still in love with Ingrid's character years after they parted in Paris, he leaving with his broken heart showing all over his face. It's a study of people in survival mode, which can bring out their worst instincts. Well-edited and easy to follow. Appropriate music to set the mood - including the passionate singing of &#34;The Marsailles&#34;, a seminal moment.	5.0	Casablanca Can't be Beat	2014-02-08	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A373QDETMY8F4I	"Noran L. Moffett ""Noran"""	Each holiday, I try to treat myself to a classic movie from the past that I have not seen for a long time. I chose to watch Casablanca from an order of the 70th Anniversary edition that I just had not taken time to watch. Having a daughter in college minoring in History and taking French prompted me to focus on this extraordinary movie that triangulates, greed, love, patriotism, history and culture within the framework of a brilliant script and extraordinary acting within a World War II setting and historical correlation.The opportunity to consider the meaning of Casablanca at this age of my life caused me to reexamine the characters beyond the memorable lines in the movie toward the thematic conclusion of transcending selfishness over a profound purpose for humanity. If I had written this review of the movie as a student, then I would have been trying to explain the mood, setting, character, effect, timing and other required features of a movie critique. However, as a father of a daughter and educator, my lens are colored by time and hopes that human good will prevail for the human race through STEAM education (Science-Technology-Engineering-Arts-Math).  At this time, I  am writing this review for my daughter because I want her and those of her emerging generation and educators of the next generation to try and see the acting in Casablanca as a platform to understand the measure of human beings trying to live through the conditions that can be metaphorically displayed in all human relationships and organizations that cause us to live through the woes of  physical, psychological or intellectual warfare. From an educational perspective, I posit that Casablanca exudes the need to correlate the movie's great acting, content, context and time in history with the idea of honor and real patriotism. For me, the role Humphrey Bogart profoundly portrayed in Casablanca demonstrated, particularly in the final scene at the airport runway (I believe there is value in starting the movie at the end and then watching the movie from its beginning with the essential question: Why did he do that?), the moment when all men and women must choose the greater good over the selfish desires of the heart.I believe that Humphrey Bogart, as some professional critics and movie junkies might suggest, was an actor's-ACTOR! However, I believe that Rick, the character in Casablanca portrayed by the legendary Mr. Bogart, gives us a chance to witness honor, valor, virtue and a deeper moral consciousness shielded by the pain of perceived or profound betrayal, than we often find in our contemporary era of &#34;get mind&#34; or &#34;destroy others to advance my personal or political or social cause!&#34;I ask my daughter and youth to watch Casablanca through the lens of the significant points made about Rick and the choices he made at the end, according to the script writer's interweaving in the lines espoused about him from his dossier, described by the characters portrayed by the German Officer and French police officer where they referenced his past to include his actions in 1935 ( i.e. research the history of  how &#34;Italy began its World War II offensive when Benito Mussolini ordered his troops into Abyssinia in October 1935,&#34; cited from http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/buildup-to-world-war-25.htm), 1936 (i.e The Civil War in Spain) political and human rights efforts.The classic lines in the movie, namely &#34;here's looking at you kid,&#34; can be a metaphor for all of us who struggle with making the decision to give up our desires for the notion of the greater good for our youth to believe that we stand for something greater than ourselves (they are looking at us!). Sometimes, we give into the needs of those who are knowingly using our heart to advance their cause and can use our love, loyalty, core values or response to a person to seek our aid, support, skills or assets at our personal expense or beliefs. At this stage and age of life, viewing Casablanca evokes the centrifugal feature of head with heart or head reshaping or refining the essence of what causes the heart to beat. The French police Captain suspected that Rick was a sentimentalist under the neutral trappings of the salon-night club entrepreneur.For educators, each time the nature of our work causes us to believe that we need to accept mistreatment as professionals to advance educational opportunity, we can truly look at the products of our educational efforts and really say: &#34;take these lessons and use them to advance civilization.&#34; From the educational lens of this review of Casablanca revisited, I believe that Bogart's character learned a lesson and taught us a lesson in the movie as the character, Rick, sent the  passion from his life away in the role of the woman he loved (Ingrid Bergman's character) who had stampeded over his heart with the man that, seemingly held her head through purpose, over her heart safely toward freedom. Hence, for educators, especially those teachers of children, Bogart's classic line is a metaphor for our work each day we teach: &#34;Here's looking at you kid!&#34; I suggest the metaphorical lesson of the movie's conclusion and its central characters' desires versus their perceived values during World War II (i.e. note the character and values displayed in the role portrayed Claude Rains throughout the movie and his closing lines to Bogart at the very end of the the movie) teaches us the perplexing value of giving up the carnal desires of the heart for a greater purpose. Somehow, I believe that the human race is still trying to struggle with the notion of truth through the lens of true purpose versus true love of selfish ambition, &#34;as time goes by,&#34;  even as we live 72 years later!	5.0	A Father's Educational Review of Casablanca for his Daughter & the Millienial Generation	2014-07-04	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	ADC1NLQIUM0IC	NotSoCasualObserver	One of the top 10 movies of all time.  Released on the cusp of our entering WWII, it captures what must have been the feelings of so many Americans as they watched the Nazis bulldoze Europe.  Bogart is at the top of his game; Bergman portrays the smart, beautiful and torn lover of two men with great sensitivity, Claude Rains is impeccably French, and the Nazi colonel could not be a better scoundrel.  So many memorable lines.  The &#34;Marsellaise&#34; scene still gives me goosebumps, and I've seen this movie too many times to count.  Perhaps it's because I'm a baby boomer and WWII was the defining event in my parents' lives, but I never get tired of seeing this classic.	5.0	Movies Don't Get Better Than This	2013-11-19	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A14SOHUCCL0606	Nowhere Man	Seriously though... &quot;Casablanca&quot; is virtually critic-proof: so stirring and entertaining that even its myriad implausibilities (you'll never see a swankier set of war refugees in your life) add somehow to its charm.  I've seen the film dozens of times - mostly on rainy nights with a glass of Chablis trembling in one hand - and I've never stopped marveling at how Curtiz and his team transcended all the hide-bound elements of the studio system without even trying.  If they had been trying - like in &quot;Passage to Marseilles&quot; - the film would've been a disaster.The special sublimity of the film comes from, I think, the fact that it shouldn't work, really - based on a second-rate (and never produced) play, the movie combines broad comic farce mixed with romantic melodrama stirred up with wartime jinogism.  Yet the screenplay and efficient direction distills out the limitations of each of these elements -the comedy never becomes silly or strained, the romance never weepy, and the sloganeering never obnoxious - and produces an happy and effervescent concotion.Enough about the film - what about this new DVD release? Well, the outtakes aren't especially relevatory (two cut scenes - both inconsequental; a couple of extended shots); the second disk extra are ok (two Bacall documentaries - one on Casablanca which was on the previous disk, another older feature outlining Bogart's film career); and, in descending order of interest, the 1943 Lux Radio program, a mediocre Bugs Bunny take-off, and a thoroughly soporific mid-1950's attempt to make it into a t.v. show (although Marcel Dalio shows a bit of panache in the Renauld role).If you don't already own the film on DVD, get this version. The transfer is excellent and the commentaries are better than average (plus you get a soundtrack extra featuring Dooley Wilson doing several takes of the songs).  After watching the film and all the assorted supplements, you'll get a strong sense of why &quot;Casablanca&quot; was so unique - and why neither Curtiz nor anyone else ever managed to pull off such a coup de theatre again.	5.0	Can't Wait for the Sequel!!	2003-09-02	0	0	0

So I'll make this short and to the point.PROS:1.  Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid and that darn French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) star.  That's two stars right there.2.  Some of the best writing Hollywood (we called it Hollywood in those days instead of Harletwood) ever produced.  That's a star.3.  Some of the best music ever mastered for a movie--the world still remembers it a zillion years later.  That's another star.4.  When you consider the idea is actually a simple love triangle during World War Two how could it have attained such greatness...well of course anyone who has ever seen it already knows, it was the writing, directing, acting, and music.  Oh yes, Peter Lorre stars in it and several others you will reconize such as Sydney Greenstreet.  I could go on and on about this movie, take it apart and tell about how great the writing, and acting are, but have you seen how many reviews this thing has?  Besides, you all don't need this country boy to tell you about THIS movie.  Moving along, that's a star right there, a really low end idea that came out 'great'.  Proof once again, if you got the idea, writing, your actors can act, and your director can director, (and a fine song or two) nothing else really matters.CONS:1.  There are no CONS: in this movie, I can suggest no updating, no changing of script, idea, directing, acting or anything to make it better.  It's such a good thing Hollywood had a long list of actors to choose from--I don't think they could have pulled it off without them...I'm watching it again as I write this, that darn French Captain kind-a grows on you, and to think HE turns out to be a sentimentalist to!I will add one last thing, Casablanca is not a popcorn movie like I usually watch (the old Science Fiction and monster movies).  It can not be watched like a regular popcorn movie.  No.  It's script, acting, directing goes too far for such trival things as simple entertainment.  You must listen to each word, study their body language, watch their eyes as you watch the movie.  And just remember...this movie was filmed and I believe shown as Casablance was ""actually"" being invaded by the darkest shadow this world had faced in its' ten thousand years of recorded history...and they almost won.If I weren't a Christian I would have said you need a shot of gin and a cigarrette...but I am, and most snack foods just don't do credit to this movie.  You decide.So there it is, rated as the second greatest movie ever made, and not one s--t, not one cuss or swear word, not one exploding head and almost no special effects.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AUDSM2CTLLW1Q	Patrick L. Randall	"After having watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time, it has become quite clear to me why the period from the 1940's through the 1950's was considered Hollywood's 'Golden Era'.  I suspect that is was still the relative newness of the medium that enabled movies of this period to be of such high quality, a quality lacking in almost all of today's films.  During that period, gratuitous sex and violence were not permissible and there were no special effects to distract the audience from a poor story.  As a result, the way directors were able to engross the audiences in their films was by telling compelling stories and developing their characters with great depth and care.  These movies also involved some of quickest, sharpest, wittiest dialogue ever committed to the big screen.  The only director today who shows any understanding of the importance of clever and intelligent dialogue is Quentin Tarantino, but he makes overly violent movies and only makes about one film every 5 years.""Casablanca"" may be the pantheon of the 'Golden Era'.  It is easily one of the most quoted movies in cinematic history and it has some the most memorable scenes.  For anyone who has not actually seen the movie, the plot centers on French Morocco during World War II in the city of Casablanca.  The fear of the German war machine drives people to Casablanca to seek any form of passage to the United States.  Business is fertile for men possessing the exit visas to get people across the Atlantic.  Much of the business takes place at Rick's Cafe Americain, run by a jaded Rick Blaine (played masterfully by the legendary Humphrey Bogart).  He was idealistic in his younger days, but now is a cynic and only helps people when it benefits him.  His world gets turned upside down when the former love of his life Isla (played by the luminous Ingrid Bergman) enters the Cafe with her husband, the revolutionary leader Victor Lazlo, looking for passage to the States.  It evokes one of the greatest lines in cinematic history and sets in motion series of events involving intrigue, passion, and suspense.The wordplay between Bogart's Rick and any one of the other characters is true treat to behold.  It is sharp and witty and seems so perfectly timed.  The only other movie I have ever seen that comes close to this level of dialogue is the old Cary Grant film ""His Girl Friday"".  Rick's enigmatic moods always leave the viewer wondering what path he'll choose.  Will it be the one of selfish interest or the one of greater good?  The viewer never knows until the very end.  Bergman's Ilsa is one of the most beautiful female characters in the history of film.  Bergman's beauty would be just as captivating today as it was back in the 1940's.  The passion of lost love between Ilsa and Rick is largely unspoken, but it's very palpable.  Unlike today's films, which feel the need show too much, ""Casablanca"" uses subtlety to convey the emotion and passion.""Casablanca"" is considered a violent movie without ever being too violent.  The threat of the German 'Gestapo' hanging over every action and every scene creates a tension, a fear, and a suspense that few movies can match.There is not one single wasted motion, scene, or character in this film.  There is purpose in everything that happens.  Characters from the shifty street vendor all the way to the shady Captain Renault have purpose and meaning.  ""Casablanca"" has been termed by some to be the 'perfect film'.  That's a lofty claim as some of the movies that were thought to be great in their time, now prove to be dated and almost a parody of themselves (""2001"" and ""The Graduate"") are classic examples.  ""Casablanca"", however, earns that praise and proves to be a timeless classic that is as moving today as it was in 1942."	5.0	Classic example of Hollywood's Golden Era	2003-06-18	12	10	2
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3I4EX7TBWUT1U	"""patrick_mcknight"""	"To me, ""Casablanca"" is one of the most perfect examples of films from Hollywood's golden age.  It's the kind of black and white, studio-bound film that they don't make anymore.  It's also got Humphrey Bogart, one of Hollywood's greatest stars in one of his signature roles.""Casablanca"" is the story of a cynical cafe owner named Rick Blaine, who sticks his head out for no one. Rick used to be a notorious anti-fascist who fought against Franco in Spain and ran guns against Mussolini in Ethiopia. However, after being abandoned by the girl that he was in love with,  ... Rick ceased to care about causes and instead settled in Casablanca.....""Casablanca"" was made as war propaganda to convince an isolationist America to join the battle against fascism.  But thanks to sharp writing, directing, and acting it transcends this and becomes a universal story about the need to get off our behinds and combat evil.  Many of the lines have gone down in history, so that even people who have never seen this film recognize the quotes.Among the memorable quotes:""Here's looking at you kid.""""Of all the ginjoints in all the world,...""""I'm no good at being noble,...""""Here's looking at you kid.""""Play it, Sam.""""Louis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""I'm sure fans will be able to think of plenty more.Bogart represented a different kind of hero.  Unlike the almost sickeningly idealistic Victor Laszlo, Bogart's character is quite willing to turn a blind eye to the world's problems.  Which makes his ultimate act of self-sacrifice so noble, because it is so unexpected. ...  We find ourselves amazed by the cynical Rick's ability for goodness.The ending of ""Casablanca"" has got to be one of the greatest, and most satisfying endings ever in a Hollywood film.  It is the ending perhaps more than anything that makes ""Casablanca"" so much better than the average Hollywood film from that era.""Casablanca"" is a must for any lover of old films.

Though some of the plot is &#34;told&#34; and a few of the connections clunky and obvious, I would say &#34;I love it&#34; (5 stars). Maybe 4.5, but definitely above &#34;I like it&#34; (4 stars).Casablanca was released as America was increasing its commitments in, and ultimately entering, WWII. The patriotism of the film is well-placed, well-played, well-done.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A27XXU7Z9P8X13	Paul Martin	"If I were suddenly transported back to 1940's America I'm sure Casablanca would strike many resonating issues with me. But as the situation exists I am too young to have even a memory of fifty years ago. Even so I can  clearly see that Director Michael Curtiz found many ways to tie the  originally B track movie into hearts of and eventually the culture of  Americans. It was probably difficult to find Americans that were not  somehow personally involved in the greater European war efforts. I would  think it was easy for the public to identify with the American vs. Nazi  propaganda and I'm sure most Americans sympathized with travelers that had  to journey through the hazardous gateway town of Casablanca.  Most of  the film revolves around Rick Blane's(Humphrey Bogart) night club. Rick is  mostly detached from the troubles surrounding him saying many times ""I  stick my neck out for no one."" But his faade is pierced when his forgotten  love Ilsa Lund Laszlo(Ingrid Bergman) visits his club accompanied by her  husband, Victor Laszlo(Paul Henreid) an American propaganda leader.  I  was amazed at the impact Casablanca has visibly had on our society.  For  example Bogart inserted many lines into our culture such as ""Here's looking  at you, kid,"" and ""play it again Sam."" I was interested to learn where  these lines were first made widely public. I suppose it's these elements  that sink into society and make a film like this a classic. I had a  difficult time following the film for about the first half hour and then  things started making more sense. I would give a higher score if the  opening had set the stage a little better. I also feel like the movie is  not targeted at my general demographic characteristics but it does a good  job of letting us look into the attitudes that were prevalent in the  1940's. An extra point goes to Curtiz for using a juggler in the opening  scenes long enough to enjoy and get recognized in the Juggling Information  Service's Juggling in Movies list. (I checked) So, Casablanca ends up with  a final score of 3 stars-a good classic movie but not on the top of the  stack."	3.0	Casablanca - Good but not the top of the stack.	2000-07-11	28	14	14

A dramatic, moody tale of romance, intrigue, danger, and despair.  Your heart is tugged by Bogart and Bergman, and even the ever-dramatic Peter Lorre makes a memorable scene or two.  What made this movie so much more interesting was not just the subject matter, but when it was released.  At the very dawn of America's involvement in World War II, it was a rousing, if not slightly propagandist film, a film of defiance against tyranny, and a show of selfless love beyond even romance.	5.0	Simply the greatest film of all time.	2013-01-29	0	0	0

We see his character become more entangled in issues like love, politics, and ethics. Isle's character is also very interesting, but I don't like that at the end of the movie she lets her complex female character be controlled by Rick's masculine character. It gives women the wrong message.

No one can find a thing to criticize. Superb casting (Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, etc.), an old love affair rekindled, the threat of Nazi takeover, it's all here. Bogart plays Rick, the ironic and apolitical Casablanca club owner. He and Bergman met and loved earlier, and now she turns up with her husband, who wants help escaping from the country. The plot thickens and gets murkier and deeper - and Bogart plays the rou&eacute;, honorable in the end. One of his best roles.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW	Penguin Egg	There are not that many romantic movies that men love, but this is the great exception. The reasons are not difficult to find. 'Casablanca' is a gripping thriller that never lets the pace flag. Ingrid Bergman is a doll. Humphrey Bogart is a man's man in a way that someone more obviously handsome, like Clark Gable, could never be.The film has class and style that is sadly missing nowadays. Bogart looks good. Bergman looks beautiful and elegant. Even Claude Raines looks dapper, with his cap tipped nonchantly to one side. The script is clever and sharp with umpteen memorable lines. Throw in Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, and you have the recipe for a perfect film.In 'Casablanca' the protagonists live out their moral dilemmas before us with a conviction that is rare in the cinema. Bogart looks genuinely pained when Bergman walks in. When Bergman has to choose between Bogart and Paul Henreid, you really believe her heart is about to break in two. This is acting at its best. Even Henreid manages to look noble and heroic as a wartime resistance leader without looking insufferable. Couple that with a script that not only involves us emotionally in their tangled moral dilemmas, but also resolves these dilemmas beautifully, and you have a recipe for a classic movie.The director Michael Curtiz deserves credit for skilfully bringing everything together. Frame by frame, this film's brilliance is a tribute to his professionalism.	5.0	The great romantic movie of the 20th Century	2002-04-26	5	4	1

This movie should be a required piece of literature, for college sophomores and above. everytime I watch it, it makes me cry, and to put myself in Rick's place. Only one out of 12-15 viewings, can I summon the internal courage to let Ilse leave with her husband. I know the the ethical arguments, favor letting her leave with her husband, but my romantic instincts are to keep her. If she has the love necessary to leave Laslo, she will eventually do it anyway. I have made arguments for and against her loving Rick, but I think that love is stronger than the one she elucidates for Laslo.I have done some ancillary reading and none of people involved in the making, thought the movie was any good.Time has certainly proven Bogie, and the other principles wrong in their judgement of the picture.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A37B3O457INKEA	Peter Kenney	"CASABLANCA is the favorite movie of many fans for good reasons. They can really be summed up in the numerous Academy Awards and Academy Award nominations given to the film. The combination of superior direction, acting, cinematography and a superb screenplay doesn't come together in one package too often.Bogart, Bergman and Paul Henreid work together beautifully. The supporting cast is incredibly deep in talent. S.Z. Sakal, Madeleine LeBeau and Leonid Kinsky are tough to beat. Is it possible that this is only Dooley Wilson's first film? Added to this mix is the veteran star quality of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.Few movies leave us with so many memorable lines such as ""We'll always have Paris"" or ""Round up the usual suspects"" or ""Here's looking at you - kid."" In this respect CASABLANCA is reminiscent of THE MALTESE FALCON and GONE WITH THE WIND.For the record the Academy Awards were for best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay (Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch).The Academy Award nominations were for best actor (Humphrey Bogart), best supporting actor (Claude Rains) and best cinematography (Arthur Edeson)."	5.0	So Many Awards and So Many Memorable Lines	2002-08-31	21	14	7

Of course, it's got some great lines like 'Here's looking at you kid' (I use that one all the time) and 'Play it again, Sam.' The World War Two subplot also kind gets you, like some kind of turf war between rival gangs, the Nazis and the French. But what gives me the jip is the fact that Humphy lets that sweet kid go off on a plane trip into the fog with some dorky freedom fighter. Not me, brother. I'd rather peach that palooka to the Gestapo and grab the moll for myself, Paris or no Paris. The way I figure it is there'll always be plenty of wars going on somewhere.

The story has that compelling feeling that nothing extra is in the film. One aspect I noticed with this most recent viewing is the interesting subtleties. For example, the love develops between the two leads, Bogart and Bergman, takes place in Paris without them truly knowing each other. Meanwhile, Paul Henreid loves Ingrid Bergman but not, apparently, vice versa. The word ""love"" can mean many things, and several of them are explored here. The film is full of the messiness of every day life and real relationships and world politics, with ambiguity and yet ultimately a sense that something has been accomplished, that some clarity has appeared."	4.0	Here's looking at you, kid	2013-05-01	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	"Casablanca is one of the most beloved films in movie history.  It is a timeless classic that has crossed over from mere entertainment into pure Americana.  Lines like ""here's looking at you kid"" and ""play it again Sam"" are part of our lexicon and ""As Time Goes By"" is practically as famous as the movie itself.  Humphrey Bogart is dashing as club owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman is luminous as his former paramour Ilsa Lund who comes back into his life with her husband Victor Laslzo played by Paul Henreid.  This sets up a love triangle that famously concludes on the airstrip.  Director Michael Curtiz won the 1943 Best Director Oscar for his work and the film won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as writers Julius J. Epstein, Philip G.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AE2INNGC07X54	PrettyStuzz	"Casablanca is one of the few great movies that is made by, for, and about its own generation, in this instance the generation that came of age between the two World Wars and who can fairly call World War Two its defining moment. The movie was made when the United States had first entered the war, before the Allies could claim any major victory in Europe or the Pacific; so Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) two comments about there being no knowable outcome to his and Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) ""plot"" refer also to the war's outcome and to the movie's outcome. The movie indeed comprises a rather broad array of levels, some profound, some superficial, some cinematic, some dramatic, some thematic, and a host of others, all in one or another way about the human condition.The best essay I know of about Casablanca is by Tim Dirks at filmsite.org, who retells the entire film while including his wonderful insights.I've seen Casablanca at least a dozen times over five decades and in all the usual ways: on pre-cable TV with countless commercial breaks; several times on the big screen at repertory movie houses; several times on Turner Classic Movies, including the colorized version (Ingrid's teeth are a kind of blue); on S-VHS and DVD; and via Amazon's Instant Video service in HD (beautiful). Each time the movie is breathtaking, always achieving an unachievable perfection, and still always presenting something I hadn't noticed or realized before. (The many mistakes in film continuity -- like window blinds changing between shots -- are all trivial or less than trivial if there is such a thing.)Do you realize that the four-syllable title has only one vowel, and that the 'a' gets all the different English pronunciations we give to that vowel, including the schwa?Do you realize that nearly every -- or invariably every -- scene involves or includes some degree of deception, from minor (as when the fabric vendor offers cloth to Ilsa) to most significant? I mean, I still can't point to anything definitive in the movie that proves that Victor and Ilsa are in fact married. Why, a case could be made that the movie is all about deception and nothing else, and you wouldn't be shocked to discover it as such.Do you realize that while Rick reveals his deepest contempt in the movie for the Bulgarian newlywed for what she intends to do for getting out of Casablanca and to freedom, he actively assists Ilsa in the exact same behavior, even as a participant himself? (I love the repeated shots of Ilsa next to the mirror, when loyal Carl the waiter sees her in Rick's office, and we see both sides of her character, or whatever, but we know the shot is very significant.)Do you realize that Rick tells Captain Renault (Claude Rains),""I came to Casablanca for the waters"", and after Renault corrects him about their being in the desert, he says ""I was misinformed""; while the last shot of the movie shows the two of them sloshing through ankle-deep water even though there was no rainfall?The script, the set designing, the lighting, the costumes, the background music, the cinematography, the editing, the direction, the casting, and the acting are all impossibly perfect."	5.0	Rank Propaganda, Unequalled Masterpiece	2014-04-29	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	The turn of the century produced a lot of lists including &quot;Best Movies&quot;.  I noted that &quot;Casablanca&quot; ranked right up there with the best American movies of all-time.  Many would argue that it is the BEST movie of all time.  I certainly have in in my top-ten because it is one of those classics where everything came together just right.  The acting is superb and there is a great chemistry between the main characters.  The story-line was exciting, believable, and emotional.  The audience is drawn into the emotion and no one but the hardest boiled eggs among us gets away without a heart-warming or heart-breaking reaction.  The directing is great, the music is memorable, the supporting actors terrific...what else am I missing?  It has it all.For some the message may be diluted somewhat by time but most of us know from hindsight that this movie takes places in a time of upheaval.  Lives are at stake.  The casino setting is an excellent metaphor for the twists of fate that have affected so many in this corner of the world.  Into this crossroads of humanity come two former lovers who meet unexpectedly.  Their lives have changed since they parted but their love was strong.  What will happen now that they meet again?  This mixture of romance and adventure makes &quot;Casablanca&quot; a movie for everyone.The greatness of &quot;Casablanca&quot; might be best appreciated by speculating on what if the movie HAD been made with Ronald Reagan instead of Humphrey Bogart.  That was supposedly the person the studio initially had in mind for the role of Rick.  Opinions vary on Reagan as President but as an actor he was strictly &quot;B movie&quot; quality.  Make that change or any other of a number of possible changes in the acting, the script, the directing etc. and you would end up with a lesser movie.  That is why &quot;Casablanca&quot; is so loved even after all these years.  It works so well because everything came together just right.  If you have not seen this movie, you must do so.  I recommend that you watch it with your spouse or significant other.  You'll probably always remember the night that you did.	5.0	Most Enjoyable American Movie of All Time	2003-09-22	0	0	0

Bogart in his most celebrated role as the suave and charismatic Rick, along with the beautiful  Ingrid Bergman. One of the films that makes Hollywood great! Highly  reccomended to anyone and everyone. The DVD version, however, is well  packaged and presented. With trailers from a variety of classic films,  along with a half hour documentary on the making of Casablanca hosted by  Lauren Bacall. A good transfer with quality sound, well worth the price.  Whether VHS or DVD, you will get your moneys worth with this timeless  classic that will begin a beautiful friendship.	5.0	Of All the Gin Joints in the World You Had to Walk Into Mine	1999-12-15	26	21	5
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2HJB9J5O5CLPB	R. A Rubin	I watch this one once a year.  I can't help but notice recently that it is basically a propaganda film in behalf of the American war effort during WW2.  In less capable hands than the legendary Epstein brothers the script could have deteriorated into a jingoistic John Wayne, kill the Germans, flick.  Instead, it gives us some of the snappiest dialogue of American Cinema and the most romantic love story.Bogart's Rick is an American icon.  The tough guy with a broken heart bleeds whiskey.  Ingrid Bergman has hurt him.  She scoots when her husband Laslo, the resistance hero is found to be alive.  Rick retreats to a bistro in Casablanca, last stop for Europe's refuges.  Claude Rains plays the flip flopping Frenchy commandant.  Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorie, and a host of Hollywood character actors populate the back lot of Hollywood Morocco.  Every one of them gives the performance of their life.  It's almost like they knew this movie would be very special.Will Ingrid get on that plane with hero Laslo or a hero of love, Bogey?  This is a tough one for the women in the audience.  Convention says she should go with her husband.  He's a brave and kind man.  Or should she stay with capable, tough, unbelievably romantic Bogey?Round up the usual suspects and play it again, Sam.	5.0	She Had To Walk Into Mine	2004-09-21	2	2	0

I didn't know Free French from Vichy French.  If you are not versed in WW II history, the movie would be confusing.  As an old guy, I like it.  For younger folks, maybe irrelevant and confusing.

I don't know...but when you take into account the &#34;limitations&#34; of film and acting back in the golden age of Hollywood it's easy to see why this film is one of the top five on most critics' lists.  Bogart plays Rick quite welll, showing the change in the characters' ideals and motives.  There's so much going on in each scene, from the lost couple that is continuously hit with hurdles in their plight to leave Casablanca to the nuanced performances from Bogart and Bergman.  There's not much I could fing wrong with the movie and I tried as I watched it.Now...as for the edition, the three discs you get (blu-ray, blu-ray Special Effects, and dvd) are worth getting.  I don't know that the poster or coasters are necessary.  I did love the &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; booklet.  The four stars are for the movie, not much else.

But the clarity of picture and sound are worth the hefty price, especially for collectors or people who want to know lots of minute detail about the history of the movie.My choice is always for the quality of the film and sound, which is why I am going with Blu-ray; but I'm not expecting miracles, just a very high quality, satisfying upgrade of this wonderful movie.Bogie and Becall...clearly worth the price!

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A243C9B0DV2YTX	Rebecca L. Morgan	When I was 14 years along in life &amp; love, before my perilous journey through both began, my mother decided that I was adult enough to appreciate &quot;staying up late&quot; to learn the joys of real &amp; great  movie-making &amp; the icons of the acting profession. Of course, back in  &quot;those days&quot;, you could only find a masterpiece of cinema from  the Golden age on in the wee hours...but you could always find them, and  more than one station played them. Now, we are subjected to infomercials  instead of a classic black/white 1940's war film for the sake of revenue.  As a young child, I often rebelled at suggestions from my Mother concerning  reading material- she had quite a library of this 'n that..but being  stubborn, I didn't want to make what I thought would be a wasted effort to  get involved in one of these boredom-laden tomes. They had dull-sounding  titles- The Prophet-K. Gibran, Andersonville (a civil war POW camp),  Bartlett's Book Of Quotations, Anything Can Happen-G. Papishvily, Gone with  The Wind-M. Mitchell, to name a few. To my embarrassment to this very day,  I must admit I did not get around to reading GwTW until I was 81/2 (1961  June) simply because of a hurricane that blew close enough to scare me from  leaving the house for two days. I nearly drove my Mother mad, she would  only suggest &quot;find something to read&quot;...at my whining  &quot;there's nothing to do&quot; So- I went to the bookshelf &amp; looked-  at this HUGE book- dirty, old &amp; somewhat odiferous after actually  opening the thing- the one Mother had been trying to sell me on for what  seemed like forever. Okay. I 'll try..Truly bored!  Never having forgiven  Mother for not threatening me w/ some really imaginative form of torture,  (involving insects, maybe..) for not making me, at least, read the first 10  pages of this most wonderful of classical stories, (Actually, I think I was  hooked on the first page) I am ready to admit that afterward when my Mother  said I should listen &amp; learn about classic books &amp; movies made in  the late 30's-mid-40's, I did just that with a vengeance. I have, forever,  loved planes, my favorite plane is the B-17- More than that, the 3.5 years  we spent fighting &amp; 2.5+ flying those B-17s over Germany &amp; other  wartime enemy territory, should be made a course of it's own in grade  school- 6th grade, perhaps. The country was never at its best as it was for  those 3.5 years. The early war brought our country to its knees for a  moment in 1941-1942, but you would never have known by the people. The  country joined the cause of freedom w/ Europe- the British were bombed out  of their homes night after night, the French had been defeated and had  given over to the enemy. All the low countries were also under the grip of  fear, along w/ most of Scandinavia.  To see the movie casablanca is to  experience &amp; learn along w/ just enjoying. It is impossible to come out  of that movie for the first time, &amp; not want to KNOW MORE! I have a 25  yr old friend who had not a clue about rationing in WWII. I have met her  Mother &amp; Dad- they SEEM normal..how could they have let their daughter  miss out on the history of not only our country, but of her own family and  its role during that most wonderful of American eras? An excellent way to  do that would be to make them watch Bogie as he walks into Rick's w/ that  white dinner jacket &amp; an attitude we'll never forget..Who can't  remember all the famous lines,  and if we're honest, who can't help saying  them along w/ Rick &amp; Ilse..&quot;Here's looking..Hill of  Beans&quot;..and all the rest inbetween. It is easy for us all to say we  are patriotic, just watch Paul Heinreid have enough courage to lead the  cafe in the most moving movie song I have ever seen- the Marseilles-against  the Nazi officers who try  unsuccessfully  to drown out the French anthem  w/ their own. By the end of that emotionally charged scene, you can not  help but be curious- maybe because today we cannot imagine ourselves  becoming involved in a war of that scope. Todays wars last a day or so-  there w/ never be another Pearl Harbor- Yes, we may well be attacked  somewhere in the world &amp; lose thousands of soldiers in a nuclear or  perhaps biological attack, but I know I would never see 75% of Americas'  male population run, not walk, to the nearest recruiting center to join  whatever he could -that's how it was in Dec. of '41.  Casablanca was a  fairy tale but it wasn't- a beautiful love story that just happens to be  set in one of the most exciting &amp; atrocious times ever in our history.  For those of you who have not experienced this classic, there is, as usual,  a twist at the end that sums up the state of mind of  America and left no  doubt as to who would come out on top in the end. Remembering also, this  movie was released very near the bombing of Pearl Harbor so it struck a  chord in the country.  Who can explain why a movie that was written  day-by-day &amp; w/ actors who had no idea where the story was going, would  turn out to be so successful then? How about now? Why?  Story, Actors,  Acting, Patriotism, Realism, Emotion, Sex, Violence, Music, great  editing....  It would be far more interesting than you might think to  watch a teenager, or younger preferably, watch this movie w/ you &amp; see  the child become as enthralled w/ the times &amp; the movie as you have  been. More doors open up for the whole family to learn about each other if  we just start somewhere. Yeah, they're black &amp; white, but just give 'em  a try- you just might learn something!	5.0	&quot;When I grew up I wanted to be Ingrid Bergman..&quot;	1999-12-17	3	1	2
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1D44YT0P8Q8XL	Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue*	"""The lure of 'Casablanca' lies in its romance, intrigue and mystery. But those are common ingredients for many movies. What makes it a landmark film and a touchstone for so many is largely because of its romance....It's no wonder 'Casablanca' remains a favorite of audiences around the world."" ~ Narrative by Lauren Bacall ~Stephen Bogart, son of Humphrey Bogart, described ""Casablanca"" as ""one of those timeless beauties that last forever."" He is absolutely right about it--his words mirror some of my thoughts about this classic of a film. After sixty-seven years, the 1943 Academy Awards ""Best Picture"" is still attracting myriads of viewers, young and old alike. Michael Curtiz did an excellent directorial job that ultimately earned him the ""Best Director"" award while brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, and Howard Koch won the ""Best Screenplay."" Even though Bogart did not win the ""Best Actor"" in which he was nominated for, I admire his acting. I believe he was one of the most credible actors of all-time who can do justice to any role that he portrayed. He was such a great actor with intriguing yet magnetic personality. Paul Henreid's role as Victor Laszlo, a Resistance leader, was also remarkably depicted. I admire his character that shows his patriotism and not to mention his kind understanding and undying love for his wife albeit her infidelity.Although I've seen the film several times in the past, I still enjoy it from start to finish whenever I feel like watching it again--just like I did two nights ago before turning in to bed. I still feel the very same emotions with each viewing. (This Two-Disc Special Edition is my second purchase of ""Casablanca"" DVDs, the first one was One-Disc Edition--ASIN 6305736650).While the storyline is not exactly the best love story ever written because of its unexpected twist in the ending, it is absolutely one of the best films ever produced and one of my top five favorite classic films of all-time. The portrayal of the main characters, Rick and Ilsa, are impressively acted out to perfection--the dashing debonair Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, a caf&eacute; owner who ""sticks his neck out for nobody"" but is willing to kill if someone crosses him; and the stunningly beautiful Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, a once-lonely-wife who cheated on her husband in Paris while the latter was at the concentration camp. Theirs is a one-of-a-kind, poignant love story. She is very much married and yet she fell madly in love and had an affair with another man who told her on the second time they parted, ""We'll always have Paris.""Many years passed after they were separated from each other, both were surprised when they crossed paths again only to discover that they still have strong feelings for each other. That chance meeting rekindled the smoldering embers that never die in their hearts. ""They have a date with fate in Casablanca."" Even though Ilsa broke Rick's heart, he loved her so much that he once described her, ""She isn't just any woman."" And that feeling was mutual and was very much reciprocated by Ilsa.Ilsa: ""I don't know what's right any longer. You have to think for both of us, for all of us.""Rick: ""All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.""Ilsa: ""I wish I didn't love you so much.""Another thing that made ""Casablanca"" appealing is the beautiful soundtrack courtesy of Max Steiner who wrote the music score. He was described as ""the favorite composer of Warner Brothers and was famous for writing stunning scores, he's always on the cutting edge for all his scores."" He was also nominated for ""Best Musical Scoring."" He should have won the award, his choice of music is impeccable--all the greatest songs from 1930s and early 1940s. Henry Mancini, an outstanding composer/film scorer/arranger/conductor, once said that ""As Time Goes By"" is ""masterful and it is tied to the film so tightly."" That is so true, no one thinks of ""Casablanca"" without a reference to Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By."" The movie and the song are like ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" or ""Dunn and Bradstreet"" or even ""Ben and Jerry's.""Remember the following memorable scenes? These are the scenes that moved me the most, To me, they are the emotional highlights of the film. There is a sentimental and nostalgic touch in the way the song was rendered by Sam (Dooley Wilson).Ilsa: ""Some of the old songs, Sam.""Sam: ""Yes, Ma'am.""----------------------Ilsa: ""Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.""Sam: ""I don't know what you mean, Ms. Ilsa.""Ilsa: ""Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By.""Sam:  ""I can't remember, Ms. Ilsa, I'm a little rusty on it.""Ilsa: ""I'll hum it for you.... (starts humming)(Sam starts playing)Ilsa: ""Sing it, Sam.""Sam: (Singing)""You must remember thisA kiss is just a kissA sigh is just a sighThe fundamental things applyAs time goes byAnd when two lovers wooThey still say 'I love you'On that you can relyNo matter what the future bringsAs time goes by""Then comes Rick with a stern face saying, ""Sam, I thought I told you never to play it!""And later Ilsa told Rick, ""Say goodnight to Sam for me. There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam. To which Rick replied, ""He hasn't played it in a long time.""And much later that night while Rick was drinking alone, Sam came in. Rick asked him to join him for a drink but he did not oblige, instead he started playing the piano. There is that obvious pain and regret in Rick's face. Anyone who has loved and lost can feel for him and can empathize with him.Rick: ""Sam!""Sam: ""Yes, boss?""Rick: ""It's December 1941 in Casablanca. What time is it in New York?Sam: ""Aah, my watch stopped.""Rick: ""I'd better sleep in New York. I'd better sleep all over America. Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine....."" ""What's that you're playing?""Sam: ""Oh, just a little something on my own.""Rick: ""Oh, stop it! You know what I want to hear.""Sam: ""No, I don't!""Rick: ""You played it for her. You play it for me.""Sam: ""Oh, I don't think I can remember.""Rick: ""If you can't stand it, I can! Play it!""Sam: ""Yes, boss.""As Sam was poignantly and expressively playing the tune of ""As Time Goes By,"" Rick drifts into another place and another time.Suffice it to say that this Two-Disc Special Edition is worthy to any ""Casablanca"" fan and it is also an ideal gift item as well. The first disc contains an introduction by no less than the wife of Bogart, Lauren Bacall; the movie itself and some special features. The second disc includes ""The Children Remember"" featuring Stephen Bogart and Pia Lindstrom; deleted scenes and additional scenes; outtakes and scoring stage sessions; and other interesting features such as how they came up with the movie title, and a premiere episode from the 1955 Casablanca TV series called ""Who Holds Tomorrow?""""Casablanca"" is truly a timeless beauty and definitely a keeper!"	5.0	"What Makes ""Casablanca"" A Timeless Beauty?"	2009-08-20	0	0	0

When I do,  I look to the classics and Casablanca fits the bill with spades.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A159U1WJOR4UIK	Reviewer	Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and As time Goes by. I think that the previous sentence sums it up quite nicely. Casablanca is a timeless classic. One of my favorite films and masterpiece. This is a film made for the great annals of film history. I really cannot praise this film any more than I already have. It is part drama, part romance both shaken and stirred, in the perfect combination, served on the rocks. I won't say anymore, except this: If you see only one more film in your entire life, see this one and call it at that.	5.0	Timeless Classic	2014-05-21	1	1	0

I myself only just saw it for the first time and a second time just a few hours prior to writing this review.If you are on the fence about getting this film on blu ray, don't be pick it up you won't regret doing so.	5.0	Great Blu Ray for a classic film	2012-05-27	17	15	2
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A24H81O6USLTST	"Revolutionary Satirist ""%7*()"""	"Okay, first off, I love Bogey, He is one of my favorite actors. And I wasn't born until 1987 so yeah I have awesome taste in film. I even watch ones with subtitles. In fact I don't bother watching movies unless they are in Black and White or have subtitles.So my reason for giving it two stars? Obviously there is nothing wrong with the actual movie. But this says it is a two disc Special edition. If it is so special, then why didn't mine come with a cool gray fedora or a flask of bourbon? How am I suppose to watch this wonderful ""Special"" edition without bourbon? It's typical hollywood fat cats creating all kinds of ""special"" ""alternative"" ""directors'"" ""extended"" editions just so they can sell more copies of the movie. I mean seriously what the heck is wrong with them? Do they not realize that many people rebel against that by downloading through bit-torrents? Next time a production company tries and makes a ""Special"" edition of a movie with bogey and they don't include a flask or colt revolver, they are simply wasting their and especially the fans' time."	2.0	Love the Movie!

In my estimation (and I am a huge movie fan, both old and new), this is the perfect result of what hard work and dedication will bring to the screen.  I have seen this well over forty times in my life and I hope to see this at least a few times more before they call me to that great balcony in the sky (and if you get showered with popcorn from above, that me!).

To be clear I just picked up the new Ultimate 70th anniversary box set ahead of release date...and the review that follows is for this edition to help others like myself who may have one or all of the previous editions decide if in this economic crunch dipping into the wallet again is worth it. I rushed to write this figuring at $44 on Amazon.com the price is low now and I'm trying to help those ""on the fence"" as it were.The movie itself needs no review... its in most peoples top 10 list of all time classics and the volumes of extra features and commentaries are for the most part re-purposed from earlier releases (and spelled out elsewhere so I will not be redundant in listing them) but that isn't always the case with re-issues and I know as I have many duplicate movies because a newer version doesn't contain the featurette or commentary from an inferior previous edition print quality wise... so Kudos to WB for making all previous editions expendable from that standpoint...so... WHAT is different, and is it worth your money?the two featurettes that ARE new ..I appreciate a lot. Michael Curtiz is without a doubt one of the greatest directors ever with an early run of classics with Errol Flynn (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Robin Hood, The Charge of the light Brigade and more) to Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy , Mildred Pierce and even White Christmas just for starters in his resume and it great to have something on him finally. To answer the 64k dollar question YES...the image quality on the new blu-ray is noticeably improved and I'm not even a guy with a massively expensive home theater system and I was blown away by the rich blacks and overall just the brilliant and staggeringly beautiful black and white film I was enjoying..seemingly for the first time at moments.I picked mine up for a bit over 50 bucks and consider it a deal.If you don't really care about Michael Curtiz or a better picture...the old Blu Ray set or even single blu ray disc will be fine for many... but if you are a film fan and a fan of glorious Black & White with lovely play between shadows and light....don't miss it!UPDATE!!  I just found a single disc version of this as an exclusive at Target for only $14.99!!!  Its the same first disc as this set with the two new documentaries...a bunch of the older ones AND the newly upgraded video for a fraction of the price ...so if you don't want the book and the box and the extra DVD ....THIS IS A DEAL.

This parallels the struggle within Rick Blaine. The colorful cast combined with a great story line and superb lighting make this the finest love story of the 20th century.  The choice of B&amp;W strengthens the imagery we all have of the people and places in Casablanca. The only weakness would be the special effects of the take offs and landings of the airplanes. This is one of those movies that has something for everyone; romance comedy action drama and suspense. I would rate this tied for the best movie of all time with Citizen Kane, and Absolutely the best romance movie of all time.	5.0	CASABLANCA	2000-10-29	3	1	2

Casablanca, more than almost any movie, has earned the right to live on and on and deserves to be called a classic.  It has one of the finest casts ever assembled for any movie from the starring roles of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman to the supporting players such as Peter Lorre, Syndey Greenstreet, and the incomparable Claude Rains.  If watched for the first time, the dialogue will seem famaliar as most of it exists in such a quotable form even outside the film.  But just let that dialogue carry you away and you too will always have Paris.  It is a joy to watch every time and a must for any video collection.

Though there never was a Rick's Cafe Americain in Morocco, there is a Rick's cafe in Casablanca today. They feature the movie and &#34;a fellow named Sam&#34; playing the piano.	5.0	A must Buy	2014-02-22	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	Despite its fame, despite the fact that we all seem to know too much about this film, CASABLANCA still shocks by its enormous ability to entertain.  I have now seen this about seven or eight times, but, if anything, I enjoy it more upon repeated viewings rather than less.The movie remains enjoyable for a host of reasons.  The cast is as good an any in the history of film, not just the leads, but a host of minor characters.  The actor who plays the croupier, for instance, was Marcel Dalio, who only three years earlier, in France before being forced to leave, starred in Jean Renoir's great classic THE RULES OF THE GAME.  In fact, knowing that many of the cast members had been forced to flee Europe because of the spread of Fascism, including those portraying Nazis, gives the movie especial power.  There are a good fifteen or sixteen memorable characters, giving this film an unusual depth.  Nonetheless, the film is carried not by the supporting characters, but by the tremendous performances by the leads, most notably Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains (interestingly, the latter two would later appear in one of Hitchcock's greatest films, NOTORIOUS).  Even the rather wooden Paul Henreid does a decent if less than stellar job.  Contrary to popular rumor, no one was ever considered for the lead role other than Humphrey Bogart.  Conrad Veidt, whom we all love to hate as the detestable Major Stasser, was, in fact, a bitter opponent of Hitler and the Nazis, and was well known for his opposition to everything that was happening in Germany in the thirties.I am a complete sucker for movies where all the dialog consists of impossibly witty repartee, and this one ranks near the top.  Even if the central plot weren't excellent, this movie would be a classic because of the awesome talk, especially any conversation featuring Bogart and Claude Rains.  For instance:Renault (Rains):  What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca? Rick (Bogart):  My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.  Renault:  The waters?  What waters?  We're in the desert. Rick:  I was misinformed.There are dozens of superb moments in the film similar to this.  Although the script was famously a complete mess, with the writers literally working on it as they were filming, nearly every line is a masterpiece.  Great plot overall, great dialog, and great scenes.  It may have been a mess at the time, but the result is sheer genius.But at the heart of the film is the story of a great love, in which two people set aside their great love for one another, the love of a lifetime, for causes bigger than themselves.  The film is the ultimate paean to self-sacrifice.  Best of all, it is a phenomenal film, and rightfully celebrated as one of the greatest ever made.	5.0	One of the most enjoyable movies ever made	2003-03-12	9	8	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"Only Citizen Kane was ranked higher when the American Film Institute announced its list of ""America's Greatest Movies."" (The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia complete the top five.) My own opinion is that AFI ranked Casablanca higher than it deserves. Nonetheless, the film remains immensely popular among critics and film historians as well as so-called movie buffs. It received an Academy Award as best film in 1943, as did Michael Curtiz for directing it. Bogart and Bergman are joined by an especially strong supporting cast (notably Greenstreet, Henreid, Lorre, Rains, and Veidt). There really isn't much to the plot but the dialogue is first-rate. (Philip Epstein, Julius Epstein, and Howard W. Koch shared an Oscar for best screenplay.) It is tempting to over-analyze this film by, for example, devoting excessive attention to American versus European sensibilities during World War II, the conflict between what Rick and Ilsa want to do with what they think they ought to do, etc.Obviously, the war in progress outside of Rick's cafe cannot be denied although he makes every effort to insulate himself and his clientele from it. There is no shortage of social and political issues and yet, in my opinion, the significance of the film -- and its enduring appeal -- is explained by the development of the relationship between Rick and Ilsa. The final resolution is necessarily somewhat ambiguous, I think, precisely because the relationship between two people in war time faces quite different challenges, obligations, and implications than it would otherwise. Ultimately, having recently seen this film again in a special edition, accompanied by an abundance of supplementary features (e.g.  Roger Ebert's commentary, Lauren Bacall's Introduction, and about ten minutes of additional scenes and out takes), I think the film now has a special symbolic significance which could not have been evident when it was released in 1942. More specifically, it somehow dramatizes what so many of us also struggle with when seeking a balance of obligations to ourselves and to others as well as to certain values which sustain the human race, especially during crises which threaten its survival. Perhaps I make too much of this film but these are among the reasons why it continues to hold special meaning for me."	5.0	Even After So Much Time Has Gone By	2003-07-08	41	26	15

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AGZVS6M8XJGN6	"Roberto Frangie ""Robert"""	"Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" opens on maps while a narrator gives a detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Casablanca in the French Morocco, as a refugee route from wartime Europe...The Nazi envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser puts it: 'Human life is cheap in Casablanca."" Of course because a man may be executed in its crowded market before Marshal P&eacute;tain's portrait or where a charming girl may guarantee an exit visa by spending her night with the Prefect of Police...Rick's Caf&eacute; is the point of intersection, the espionage center, the background for Allied offensive, the focal point as refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe seek to gain exit visas to Lisboa... It is a remarkable place full of adventurers, international traders, informers, spies, opportunist Vichy Police, German officers, all rounded out by a superb black singer-pianist Dooley Wilson, the excellent Sam, Rick's only trusted friend...The interesting club so well organized, leads to an open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, in which the games and fights are between arrogant Nazis, patriotic French, idealists, murderers, pickpockets and gamblers around a roulette wheel, where a ball could rest on Rick's command against the settled number 22...""Casablanca"" is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns... The action, the fight, the war takes place inside Rick's walls rather than outside...But who is this Rick? What is his magical power? His secret weapon? Rick is the anti-fascist with hard feelings, the former soldier of fortune who has grown tired of smuggling and fighting, and is now content to sit out the war in his own neutral territory... Even loyalty to a friend doesn't move him as he refuses to help Ugarte, a desperately frightened little courier who is fleeing from the police...Emphatically, Rick says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers... She is married to an underground leader and she desperately needs those papers Rick conveniently now has in his possession... The cynical Rick's facade of neutrality begins to weaken as he recalls the bittersweet memories of his past love affair, memories triggered repeatedly when the strains of ""As Time Goes By"" come from Sam, his piano-playing confidante...But ""Casablanca"" basic message is a declaration of self-sacrifice... War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' It goes without saying that Bogart is incomparable when he seems most like himself... His way with a line makes ""Casablanca"" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray. You were blue.'Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles... With his customary skill, Claude Rains plays Major Renault, a prefect of police who is like Bogart in many ways... He, too, claims neutrality, but is definitely against the Nazis... He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a ""sentimentalist"" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines... When he makes a small bet and is encouraged to make a bigger one, he remarks that he is only a ""poor corrupt official.""Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love-affair, the quality of being romantic, the traditional woman enclosed by two rivals, symbol of a besieged Europe...Paul Henreid is Victor Laszlo, the anti-Nazi resistance leader, seeking in Morocco the two letters of transit signed by General De Gaulle...Sidney Greenstreet is the black marketeer on good terms with Rick, the rival owner of the 'Blue Parrot,' the acceptable face of corruption...Peter Lorre is Ugarte, the racketeer, the dealer of anything illegal, the killer, driven into a corner by the Vichy police, who has given Rick two letter of transit...Conrad Veidt is the very essence of German rigidity, unfeeling, unconcerned about life, but firmly believing in the foolish ideology of his Nazi compatriots...""Casablanca"" covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence; the blissful days in Paris; Ilsa's emotional words to Rick in occupied Paris; the champagne toast; Ilsa's request to Sam; the poetry of the magic words and the beautiful voice of Dooley Wilson; Captain Renault's words in the airport; and the farewell...The magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy... To his cynicism, his own code of ethics, his hatred of the phoniness in all human behavior, he now added the softening traits of tenderness and compassion and a feeling of heroic commitment to a cause... They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival...One can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place... Its photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly... Bogart's and Bergman's love scenes create a genuinely romantic aura, capturing a sensitivity between the two stars one would not have believed possible...""Casablanca"" is a masterpiece of entertainment, an outstanding motion picture which brought Bogart his first Academy Award nomination (he lost to Paul Lukas for ""Watch On the Rhine"") and won Awards for Best Picture of the Year, Best Director and Best Screenplay..."	5.0	Cinema par Excellence!	2006-12-22	2	2	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	From 1939 through 1941, many Europeans were wondering what ... was taking America so long to join the fight against Hitler. Keeping in mind that Rick Blaine(Bogart) is an American who refuses to get involved in other people's affairs, even with life and death on the line, CASABLANCA can easily be interpreted as a criticism of America's callous indifference to the horrors going on across the ocean. The film makers had acknowledged this as a catalyst for making this movie. And on that level, CASABLANCA is an enormous success.But films rarely make it on just their political or social messages. What makes CASABLANCA the classic it is, is the incredible balance of top-notch acting, impeccable writing, and flawless pacing by the director. As one previous reviewer mentioned, the military intrigues and dangers are heightened by the tensions of the love story. Rick's love for Ilsa (part nostalgia, part real) is what finally gets him involved, but given his previous associations with all levels of Casablanca's society, he must be careful where this love leads him. This movie is a thriller and a sentimental love story, neither of which is overblown or corny. Bogey, Bergman, Jordan, Lorre all turn in performances which will be remembered for so long as films are shown.Lastly, the serious nature of the plot finds relief in several moments of humor. As a New Yorker, this is my favorite bit of repartee:Major Strasser (To Rick): Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?Rick: It's not particularly my beloved Paris.Heinz: Can you imagine us in London?Rick: When you get there, ask me!Major Strasser: How about New York?Rick: Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.What a wonderful film!	5.0	We will always have Casablanca	2004-03-22	3	3	0

The love story is not believable, Bogart is emotionless and delivers like he memorized the lines. Bergman does a credible job, except I don't buy her character being in love with Rick. Sure she had fun with him in Paris, but I didn't feel the love. That's the big deal about the movie, right? The effects were cheesy (maybe due to the High-Definition, they really show models as models) aircraft & buildings look like toys, the rear-projection car scenes are obviously not in a car.I had never actually watched this movie all the way through before. I have always seen clips and parts, but not the whole movie in toto. With all the hype and buildup I really had expected a better movie. The HD-DVD is great, with marvelous quality and clear sound.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2RH7ARWQSUVQV	"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God"""	"It seems I have received a number of negative reviews on my interpretation of this film which is somewhat baffling to me.  In fact I think 'Casablanca' is an excellent film but think its quality--and the quality is indeed superb--is largely a product of editing rather than initial planning.  Surely the actors didn't think that they were involved in anything 'special'.  They thought it was just another studio film being cranked out like tanks or aircraft during WWII.This film was, I believe, released in 1945. Therefore, it is, in some ways, a fairly standard propaganda flick [and there were hundreds of them during the War] saved by the presence of Ingrid Bergman, in all her youthful beauty, and the brooding 'Rick' [Humphrey Bogart].  Bergman's beauty is a thing to behold and Bogart's agony is correspondingly miserable.Rick's 'Club Americain' is in Vichy-French controlled Casa Blanca.  It is also a hot bed for intrigue and desperate people trying to escape Nazi occupied Europe. Rick, who is a successful restrauteur, has settled into an alcoholic haze following his baffling abandonment by the haunting Bergman in Paris a couple of years earlier.  Much to Rick's chagrin and surprise, Bergman shows up unexpectedly--along with her husband--in his North African night club.  Rick immediately sinks into a desperate, alcohol enhanced grief as he waits for Bergman to return and explain herself.  Rick's despair is truly a thing to behold and is why Bogart deserves to be rated as one of the truly great actors.Paul Henreid, as Bergman's cuckolded husband, is just too noble for words and the Nazis are appropriately unidimensional and evil.  The cynical Vichy French Inspector is indeed perfect as a man who ultimately finds where his loyalties...and soul...lies.  ""Arrest the usual suspects,"" he orders, as Bogart, walking away with him in the fog tells him, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""

Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, the self-professed cynical American proprietor of &#34;Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain&#34; in Vichy-controlled Casablanca, Morocco during World War II. The worldwide conflict is portrayed occasionally directly, but more often seen in the actions and attitudes of the characters. Everything changes for Rick when his ex-lover, Ilsa Lund (played stupendously by Ingrid Bergman), walks back into his life. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and if you haven't seen it you definitely should.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AEGR40GALMDJ4	Ryne Williams	As time goes by, Casablanca is a film that will never die.  It is my favorite film of all time.  Everything about this film is wonderful.  The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinamatography all whisk you away to another era.  The film has everything a moviegoer wants.  It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were the only ones I think that could play these roles right.  They were a match made in heaven.  They are probably a better on screen couple than Vivian Leigh and Clark gable.  This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.	5.0	&quot;Here's Looking at You Kid&quot;	2004-05-05	4	3	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	"The first time I saw Casablanca, I didn't understand why everyone loved it. I tend to look at the relationship aspect of films, and in my eyes, the romance between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) was lacking. On the set, no one knew whether Ilsa was supposed to truly love Rick or not which caused Bergman to play the part ambiguously.However, I finally realized that the relationship was strong because of Rick's love for Ilsa. It didn't depend on mutual affection at all. With this revelation, I was able to see the film for what it was: a masterpiece.Rick own's Rick's Cafe, a seedy bar in Casablanca during WWII. Casablanca is still free from Nazi control, though Nazi leaders swarm the streets. This makes it a place filled with refugees hoping to escape to America. Of these refugees is a leader against the Nazi's, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He brings his wife to Rick's, the beautiful Ilsa. It throws Rick into a tailspin; the two have a lot of history and he's been brooding over her since she left him. From there, he begins to act rather uncharacteristically.No one can deny the cleverness of the script; AFI recognized many of the lines in it's 100 Years 100 Quotes... list. Also recognized in an AFI list is the theme song ""As Time Goes By."" Thanks to Casablanca, it has become a standard. This is no surprise because it is a beautiful song, and Dooley Wilson's vocals make it very charming. Max Steiner's score is wonderful as well.Overall, this film has a little bit of everything, but blends each seemlessly. There is history, intruige, romance, great dialogue, and excellent music. If that were not enough, on this edition of the VHS is a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall."	5.0	A Bit of Everything	2007-03-20	2	2	0

This movie marks a  very specific point in time for both the period of the movie, and the  target audience.  A war movie, made in the middle of the war it portrays,  obvious good guys, obvious bad guys, and in the middle all the rest of us.  We all know Casablanca is doomed.  We know the history.  And because of  that we enjoy the small, silly, triumphs of individuals.  We cheer the  partiots, we smile at the corruption, we love Rick, and we wish it could  have somehow turned out differently.  At the same time we know it holds  true.  People do separate in war.  Some things are more important than  ourselves, and at the end we can wonder just what that relationship that is  starting could possibly be like.To paraphrase - Of all the movies in all  the world why did I pick this? ...

Certainly ""Casablanca"" is a solid movie with a wonderful theme, a movie so very appropriate for its time.  Humphrey Bogart, an icon in his day lingering in that regard for many to this very day, plays a strong-willed though broken-herted tough guy.  A tough guy - what a surprise!  I always found his acting stiff, and he is no different in ""Casablanca.""  Claude Raines, as Louie the Chief of Gendarmes, despite his stated lust for women, behaves and sounds as though he lusts for Rick, the Bogart character.  ""Putting one over on the Nazis,"" I suspect, is what catapulted this film into the favor of its original critics and audiences.  Still it is a strong movie with all the pieces of the puzzle fitting neatly together at the conclusion, but with the feeling that if the puzzle isn't glued, it could easily fall apart.  I've seen ""Casablanca"" a few times, so obviously I like it.  I just don't place it up there with the greatest films ever."	4.0	Second Greatest Movie Ever?	2011-01-03	4	1	3

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1K94LXX833JTT	Sanpete	"Possibly the most popular film around, 1942's Casablanca pairs two iconic actors, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, in a story of lost love and reluctant heroism.  Warner Brothers put out an excellent2-disc Special Editionin 2003.  (That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)  This new 2-disc Ultimate Collector's Blu-ray Edition includes the features from the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.  This is the only Blu-ray edition.  Here are the announced new features, the ones not included in the 2003 set.  All but the first are memorabilia.-- Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full-length biographical documentary (104 minutes)-- 48-page photo book-- 10 roughly 5x7"" cards with color reproductions of poster art and such-- 3 reproductions of archival correspondence (a memo from producer Hal Wallis changing the title to Casablanca, a memo from Wallis to studio head Jack Warner urging the casting of Bogart over George Raft, and a letter from the publicity head instructing the publicist to shift Bogart's image from tough to romantic lead)-- reproduction of Victor Laszlo's letter of transit-- passport holder with Casablanca logo-- luggage tag with Casablanca logo-- mail-in offer for 27x40"" movie poster-- all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser-cut Moroccan designThe documentary, which comprises the second disc, is also available separately on standard DVD (here).  It was written, directed and produced by a grandson of Warner, and is said (by Variety) to be somewhat sentimental but not to overlook Warner's defects.  It isn't about Casablanca in particular.There are more than enough extras in the 2-disc standard DVD edition for most people.  I'll list them below.  The video and sound quality of that set are very good, about as good as could be for a 1942 film on standard DVD.  The movie was released in 1080p HD in 2006, and it was acclaimed as looking even better, sharper, smoother, with more detail.  The 1080p Blu-ray should look the same as the HD.  Whether it's enough better to matter to you is an individual thing.The movie is set in 1941 Casablanca, Morocco, controlled by the Nazi-collaborating Vichy French government.  Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  ""I stick my neck out for nobody,"" he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  Even the music works beyond what was expected, making ""As Time Goes By"" unforgettable.  All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.Here's the list of the features included from the 2003 Special Edition:-- Introduction by Bogart's wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall (2 minutes)-- Audio commentaries. . . . . by Roger Ebert. . . . . by film historian/author Rudy Behlmer-- Documentaries and featurette. . . . .

An admission: I've never liked &quot;Casablanca.&quot; I'm a huge fan of old movies, but there are better romances out there, and these stars made better films. Still, it's withstood the test of time gone by (excuse the pun), so it's hardly surprising Warner released a special edition.What is surprising is my new appreciation for the film. It looks and sounds wonderful, and features a highly comprehensive package, including two solid commentaries by Rudy Behlmer and Roger Ebert.Disc 2 is splendid, with over ten minutes of deleted footage and alternate takes (sadly, the sound is lost), not to mention studio memos, press materials, photographs, etc. Other highlights include a radio production featuring the stars in their original roles, and two fascinating documentaries: one on the film, the other on the life of Humphrey Bogart.Truthfully, I was blown away by this new release of &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Every serious DVD collector needs it on their shelf.	5.0	A Beautiful Friendship: Classic Film and Super DVD	2004-02-16	3	2	1

"You cannot go wrong with Casablanca!The story is well-known:  The beginning of World War II, many immigrated to North Africa and points on the African coast, in advance of the German push into France.  From Casablanca, one could, with the right persuasion, hop to Lisbon (Portugal, of course) and from there, escape to America.The film defies definition.  It's not a drama, yet there are dramatic scenes.  It is not truly a love story, yet there are elements of that.  It's not a statement about immigration, yet many wish to escape.An escapee of a concentration camp and freedom fighter, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) finds his way into Casablanca, hoping to get a plane out and back to the USA and help the Americans (this part of the story was vague).  He brings with him his wife, Ilsa, played adoringly and smartly by Ingrid Bergman.Ilsa walks into Rick's Cafe Americane and who does she see -- the guy who she had a fling with and dumped in Paris -- and Rick (Bogart) is not over it!Intrigue:  Black marketeer and competitor, played devilishly by Sydney Greenstreet (Maltese Falcon), wants Rick's for himself.  He also wants what Rick has -- letters of passage to America, which he could sell for a handsome profit.Rick is torn -- he does not want to get involved with the Nazis that have invaded his bar; he does not want to help Laslo, and most of all he wants to forget Ilsa -- and can't understand why she abandoned him in Paris -- he didn't know she was married -- oops!Peter Lorre (also with The Maltese Falcon) plays a slimy gangster who bumped off a couple of German couriers and passes their letters of transit to Rick -- who keeps them for himself!Many famous lines and music have come from this one film:  Play it Sam (no one ever said ""Play it again Sam"" as is rumored); ""This could be the start of a beautiful friendship""; ""Here's looking at you, kid;"" and ""We'll always have Paris.""The DVD set is great.  Not only is the gorgeous black & white cleaned up and theater quality, but the second disk has film critics and film historians in the commentary, including our pal Roger Ebert, who calls this the second greatest film he's ever watched (the first is Citizen Kane).Lauren Bacall, Bogart's son, Ingrid Bergman's daughter, everyone has a say.

In quintessential roles, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are former lovers reunited in wartorn Casablanca... Rick's place is a rendezvous for every crook and refugee in Casablanca: Bogey is the cynical cafe owner who lives by his own moral code and sticks his neck out for &quot;no one&quot;.  Bergman, as the beautiful wife of Resistance leader Paul Henried, finds herself torn between two lovers when she reenters Bogey's life...The film's GREAT success lies in the inimitable pairing of its two stars, a thoroughly romantic story line, terrific humour and numerous moments of genuine suspence.  Of course, that great ending helps, too!  Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.  Nearly stealing the picture is Claude Rains as a &quot;poor, corrupt officer&quot; who as a Nazi puppet soon discovers &quot;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.	5.0	VICHY MOROCCO, 1941...	2002-07-09	4	4	0

Set in December 1941, when the Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow, the Japanese were expanding in the Pacific, and the Nazi death squads were busy murdering millions of Jews, this film explores the nightmare and uncertain world of the refugees, conspirators, and secret agents who struggled to find their way at the margins of a Europe torn by war. ""Casablanca"" is set in Morocco, under the politically and morally compromised regime of the Vichy French, at a time when the Nazis were winning the war and the possibilities of resistance seemed increasingly bleak.It is the question of resistance that the film directly addresses, through as brilliant a cast of characters as one will ever find, assembled through the old studio contract system, but no less gifted for that. Humphrey Bogart, as the deeply hurt and cynical leftist, once a committed activist who has left politics aside to pursue his own private life; Paul Heinreid, as the idealistic, committed and daring organizer and champion of anti-Nazi resistance, trying to stay at least one-step ahead of the pursuing Gestapo; Peter Lorre, the shady operator who has committed a crime that may prove to save lives (suggesting the inversion of values that develops in the murky context of war); Claude Rains, the cynical playboy official, who is corrupt and yet decent in the face of a much greater evil; Sydney Greenstreet, who plays the crooked gangster/businessman as well as anybody ever did; Conrad Veidt, who brings the sinister Major Strasser to a menacing life that shadows the entire film, even after his death; and Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, who in this film is absolutely glowing, as beautiful a woman as ever appeared on screen.The film was produced in 1942, nothing special for Warner Brothers, just another ""crank-it-out"" anti-Nazi flick. And yet the script (improvised as they went along), the cast, and the theme of the film, create a kind of film magic that has never been matched. And when Dooley Wilson as ""Sam"" plays ""As Time Goes By,"" he is doing more than just playing the melody that will always be associated with this film. He is providing a kind of musical theme for issues that will always be with us: the struggle between private interest and personal desires versus public responsibility in a time of moral and political crisis; the meaning of morality in a world threatened by radical evil and the need to construct an ethical behavior that is realistic and yet effective; and the importance of love, courage, and obligation to others in a world where the impulse to crawl into one's own private space can be overpowering.The film also illustrates a too often forgotten dimension of the Second World War; the plight of millions of refugees, stateless, homeless, facing deportation, concentration camps or death squads. How many refugees, trapped and with no place to go, were eventually rounded up for transport to the death chambers at Auschwitz II-Birkenau! When this film was made, those death chambers were in full and active operation, as Nazi Einsatzgruppen carried out their murderous work in eastern Europe. When Humphrey Bogart buries his head in his hands in despair, waiting for the woman he loves, we are reminded of the larger darkness of the world in which his frustrated private love burns. His redemption, and the redemption of the world for which he has spent much of his life fighting, begins when he moves beyond his private agonies to return to the fight for a world worth living in. And let it be clear, the end of the movie ""Casablanca"" is not the end of this story. As the plane ascends into the fog-bound sky for Lisbon, the fight is just beginning, and we, sitting in the theater, are reminded that the struggle for a better world is something that is still going on. Rick's fight is our fight: the fight for social justice, for a decent and humane society, for a world in which FDR's Four Freedoms are more than just a slogan, for a better future in which reckless militarism, racism, oppression are defeated, and people rally to fight for human freedom.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1NWZTZBL0T8JJ	Scott Vela	"I originally saw this movie on TV for the first time over a year ago and I was so drawn to it. This is one of the Few B&W; movies that I do own now. I just cant get over the power of this film. I feel allot of present day films dont have this kind of magic that makes it jump off the screen. The characters are real by the performances of the actors, the direction and the writing is solid. Thier are so many sources that have drawn from this movie. You just cant help but appreciate the source material. Its very rare everything just works.This is a classic that should never have been remade because its impossible. From the short clips from the documentary it was rather transparent that most of those were just bad imitations .The Film has a wonderful mix of Humor, Drama and Romance even most guys can even appreciate. Its not mushy ...which is a relief.  And it all works togethor. A sense of history involved with refugees leaving Nazi Occupied France which most films about that era shy away from. Casablanca has had more tributes done to it than they have mentioned.This is one of the first movies I've seen Humphrey Bogart in and I cant see anyone else in the part. I've enjoyed him in ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"". Two of his Co stars from the Maltese Falcon both have roles in the film Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. The chemistry works not just with these characters and their relationship with Rick. Ricks relationship with Capt. Renault I find the basis for allot of things I've seen before but this came first. And I can appreciate that.Even if its redone again it just will not work. The actors bring something to that performance that makes the film unique. It cannot be repeated. The overall feel of the film cannot be recaptured.  This film is a big example why classic films should not be remade.My only complaints have been that the sound quality on the DVD is OK . Its not bad but I had to turn my TV all the way up to get that Stereo Theatre feeling. I'm a wide screen freak and the film is in Pan and Scan. I don't know if it was my player or just the movie over the sound quality. The Documentary is really a joy to watch though."	4.0	Play it again Sam!	2006-07-08	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"Many have tried to remake or duplicate Casablanca.  None have succeeded.  It's not hard to understand why either.  How can you remake one of, if not arguably, the best motion picture film of all time?  The answer is simple: you can't.One of the enigmas that makes this film such an incredible feat, is that throughout most of its production, the story wasn't finished.  They had no idea how it was going to end.  Does Ilsa stay with Rick?  Does she go with Lazlo?  And yet, they obviously found a way to tie the whole story together.I simply cannot think of anyone else to play the part of Rick Blaine, or Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa,  or Claude Rains as Capt. Renault.Eveyone knows the story of Rick Blaine, an embittered saloon keeper who never understood why the love of his life, Ilsa Lund, left him high and dry in Paris just before the German invasion.  He's found his entire idealistic world has been turned upside down.  He claims to care about no one and nothing.  ""I stick my neck out for nobody!""  We quickly find out that those feelings of love and fighting for justice have never left, but have simply been buried beneath anger and feelings of mistrust.  Is this ever more apparent during one of the film's most touching scenes, when Rick saves the virtue of the young Bulgarian wife who feels their only chance at leaving Casablanca may be for her to sleep with Capt. Renault in order to secure a visa.  Rick's entire staff goes nuts at this beautiful gesture, which Rick dismisses as a simple gesture to love.It really is fun to watch this film for the first time to see how Rick helps Ilsa and Lazlo.  At first, we are led to believe that he's planning to be selfish and take Ilsa back.Humphrey Bogart is nothing short of magnificent.  He embodies one of the most memorable characters in film history.  We see him in the white coat and black bow tie, running his club with a simple coolness.  Bogart made the trenchcoat and hat a signature outfit as well, not only in Casablanca, but in such films as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.  He is one of my favorite actors of all time, and Casablanca is probably my favorite role, although it's very difficult to decide which is best out of all of his great portrayals.  Entertainment Weekly had him listed as the best actor of all time and the most entertaining.  It's difficult to argue against this.Ingrid Bergman.  MGM made the right move in negotiating for Ingrid, as she was under contract with David O Selznick.  No one else could have played the part of Ilsa.  Bergman is my favorite actress of all time.  She brings such passion and ease to her roles, and yet she plays Ilsa with a calm, cool sense until she realizes she can no longer deny her feelings for Rick.  She loves Lazlo too, which is obvious, but for different reasons.  Lazlo represents the figure battling for justice and a restoration of a broken world back to what it was.  He inspires Ilsa.  However, nobody has brought out a passion or resevoir of feelings from her than Rick.  We know that Lazlo is often occupied, as what he's fighting for is bigger than himself or even Ilsa.  Rick was once like Lazlo, but Rick devotes his feelings to Ilsa, something that she's never known before.  And ironcially, it is Rick who commits the most selfless act, the most loving act in the end.Claude Rains is one of my favorite character actors.  He's simply wonderful.  He can play any part you put in front of him.  He plays Captain Renault with charm and a man who tries in vain to be neutral, but it is obvious he isn't.  Just look at Renault during his talk with Major Strasser.  As Strasser points out that occupied French territories are ""honey-combed with traitors."" You catch a glimpse of Renault who is not happy with that remark.  You also catch a glimpse of this during the film's most powerful moment: when Lazlo asks Rick's band to play the Les Marseillaise to drown out Strasser and the Germans as they sing the anthem of the Third Reich. That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.  It still gives me goose bumps when it is played in the film.Casablanca is simply timeless.  This is, as Lauren Bacall states during the documentary feature, the true definition of a classic.  AFI rated Casablanca as the second best film of all time.  I, personally, put it at the top.  It is more compelling than Citizen Kane, in my opinion.  Everyone remembers Rick and you often find yourself visiting Rick's Cafe Americain over and over with repeated viewings, because you simply never get tired of watching Casablanca.  At least, I don't."	5.0	As Time Goes By, there is only ever ONE Casablanca!	2006-05-05	4	4	0

I first saw the movie many years ago when I knew about its legend, and as with many other movies I did not 'get it' all at first shot. Still there was something about it, a feeling, a certain aura which made it memorable.No doubt a central part of this is Bogart, the reluctant patriot, the American exile tough - guy who does the right thing in the end. The famous ""Play it Again Sam"" his pain and restraint in his love for the Bergmann character are a convincing version of the old Western hero in his silence. The stunningly beautiful Bergman does not have to much but just whisper a few words. They will ' always have Paris'. The minor players Claude Rains, Peter Lorre , and the 'As Time Goes by "" pianist seem just right.This movie made in the midst of the Second World War wins our hearts also because it a patriotic one. The great scene in which Rains contadicts the boisterous Nazis, and orders the singing of the 'Marsellaise ' is in itself a classic.And of course that final scene the flying away of Bergman and Henreid, while Bogey is left with his French police - officer friend , who orders the 'rounding up of the usual suspects' rescues the Bogart- Bergman farewell from bathos, and makes for a strangely upbeat ending.A great film- one of the greatest."	5.0	""" You must remember this"""	2006-05-04	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2K4RNOAD5J3WB	sid1gen	&quot;Casablanca&quot; is one of those films that is not good just in spite of its many defects, but almost because of them. The many qualities it shows push it still further ahead of most films, and it has remained not only a classic, but and enduringly popular one. The acting is excellent, the black and white cinematography is magnificent, and the direction is inspired. When one finds out how this film was really produced, how many rewrites there were, how ignorant everybody was about the ending, it appears incredible that such a film should flow so beautifully. And flow it does on the strength of a peculiar love-story that relies on terribly faulty history to get to us.Rick (Bogart) is a romantic hero with a chance to help those whose causes he has defended his entire life. He is a bitter and reluctant hero, though: being on the side of the losers in Spain, and then being dumped by Bergman in Paris just as the Germans were marching in, have done a good job of turning him into a cynic. Enter Bergman once again into his life, waltzing into his cafe in French-administered Morocco during WWII. This is a romantic story and a romantic view at the world at a time when the world was facing a true hour of darkness. In hindsight, this is all about losers and losing, and it has touched most of us because we can identify with not getting all that we want, with losing big, with great dreams and harsh realities, with big hopes and small results, and, in spite of everything, we can look at Rick and say &quot;Yes, I wish I could be like him, even if it meant losing, again, as he does.&quot; The problems with the film are historic: letters of transit signed by General DeGaulle, who was a sworn enemy of Vichy France and the Nazis, were not going to be respected by the colaborationist French or their German overlords. When Peter Lorre's character explains the wonderful nature of these two letters, it is clear that incredible confusion guided much of &quot;Casablanca&quot; along. When Bogart walks with Claude Rains at the end in what could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, Rains mentions a French garrison in Brazzaville that they can join, but such garrison was actually pro-Vichy. Errors like these can sink a movie that pretends to be factual, but &quot;Casablanca&quot; aimed from the beginning at being a fictionalized account of the struggle at a time when victory for the Allies was uncertain at best.Bogart loses, but wins. Claude Rains (the police inspector) wins his dignity and a friend. Bergman has her husband, loses Bogart, and goes on. Czechoslovakia will get rid of the Nazis only thanks to the Soviets, and it will take it four decades to get rid of its &quot;liberators&quot; and to recover its democracy. France will lose its empire. Germany will lose the war.There are no happy endings in &quot;Casablanca.&quot; The love story is there but the lovers rise far above their &quot;hill of beans&quot; and become truly noble, particularly Rick, the cynic who still hopes. The only true happy ending is that the Allies did win, but at the time of production that was very much in doubt. Such a memorable film produced memorable lines, like &quot;Round up the usual suspects,&quot; &quot;Vultures, vultures everywhere,&quot; &quot;I stick my neck out for nobody,&quot; &quot;Here it's looking at you, kid,&quot; etc., although Rick never says &quot;Play it again, Sam.&quot; The players are there, as well, in other related films: Bogart in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; against a Vichy police inspector, played by the same actor whose role was to be the doorman to Rick's Cafe in &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Paul Henreid (Lazslo) plays a nazi in &quot;Night Train to Munich,&quot; and Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains will face each other again in &quot;Notorious.&quot;As in literature, classic films are those pieces of art that seemingly without effort weave in the right moments with the mistakes, the faultless details with the obvious errors. Classics are human; they have to be. Like us, their mistakes only help them get closer to the people they were created for. &quot;Casablanca&quot; has many errors. The whole is and feels almost perfect. My third favorite film truly gets better every time I watch it.	5.0	It just gets better every time.	2001-03-04	0	0	0

Many aspects of this film remain astonishing: casting and acting, screenplay (based on a stage play), directing, black & white cinematography, almost everything about it.I find only one real fault in &#34;Casablanca.&#34;  Characterization of the Nazi partisans is too stark, almost melodramatic.  Not too much for war-time, perhaps, but a little over-the-top in our cynical era.

A lot of the lines were so ludicrous that I found myself cracking up, much to the displeasure of my friends.  I personally think that it is overrated, and had it been made today it would be shot down as a stupid romance that only girls go to see and then weep over.  I don't think that it would recieve all the critical acclaim that it does.  Of course, the reason it recieved such critical acclaim could be because it was one of the first of it's kind and whatnot.

So I guess I'll just repeat what everyone else has already said: it's one of the greatest films of all time (second, I'd say, after ""Citizen Kane""), it has truly superb acting by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, Claud Rains, and Peter Lorre, it has a great love story, and some of the best cinematography ever.This DVD looks sharp as sharp can be, with a brilliant new transfer that has hardly any scratches and looks far superior to fuzzy old videos and TV broadcasts. On the special features front, there's a documentary that's from an old video (with the exception of a newly added epilogue about ""Casablanca"" sequels, parodies, and imitations). There's a new introduction by Laurel Bacall (which is actually tacked on at the beginning of the documentary), as well as trailers for ""Casablanca,"" ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""Key Largo,"" and a million other Bogart films."	5.0	Just Plain Great	2003-03-11	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A14ABGEOVOTDX1	SmallestStep	"**may contain spoliers**I think the main draw and popularity of the film Casablanca is its memorable ""feel."" The atmosphere that the film creates in memorable for some reason. Though in times of conflict, there is a certain warmness in Rick's nightclub that draws you in, and has been imitated in films and real life afterwards (there is a replica of Rick's Cafe Americain in Cancun, Mexico). The actors in the film pulled off a film that most others would not be able to. Would Casablanca be the popular cult film that it is today if Ronald Reagan had played Rick? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart WAS and still is Rick, and no other actor could have played the role better.Dialogue is another key part of Casablanca. It's quoted quite often (and sometimes misquoted); one who hasn't even seen the film probably knows some of its lines. Some of the lines can almost be seen as ""downright cheesy,"" such as ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"" yet the work in the context of the movie and from the actors (especially Bogart) that deliver them.Humphrey Bogart is a classic cult film icon because he's charming, suave, astute, very self confident, and believable. Seeing this film for the second time, I could compare him to my own cult hero Bruce Campbell. Both actors show a sort of arrogant confidence, even in the most troubling times. Both actors have cheesy, yet memorable lines that are delivered so dead-pan that one cannot help to think, ""Wow."" Where an actor in a mainstream film would be laughed at for a line such as Bruce Campbell's, ""Gimme some sugar, baby,"" or Bogart's, ""Here's looking at you kid,"" cult heroes are praised and cheered. Bogart's got a dry sense of humor. He doesn't just blurt out ridiculous things, or fall down doing slapstick. He is sly in his comments, where you aren't sure if you should laugh at the humorous thing he just said.The mainstream audience might look directly at the love story between Rick and Ilsa. Yet cult fans know that there is much more than that to make a great film. Everything ties the movie together, from the dialogue and actions to the music. Each interacts with one another to put together a single piece that stands on its own.Casablanca has remained a popular cult film for the above reasons. Though slow at times, it is a memorable film, with memorable characters and dialogue. At times sappy, the film delivers an almost-believable love story, that most actors could not make work. Yet with the actors we have, the film works as a whole, mainly based upon Bogart and Bergman's ability to ""pull off"" their parts."	5.0	Casablanca	2005-10-18	4	3	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AXQPANMD6DG13	S. Mark Comstock	I got to see this with someone who was seeing it for the first time, and it was like seeing it for the first time myself. Some say it was extraordinary for its time, but I think it is just extraordinary.It wasn't a mindless pursuit of acting reality, including slobbering stars and gutter-mouthed characters. No flying cars or exploding buildings. Just elegant men and women striving to do the right things in a difficult time, with some shady characters and villains for balance. And humor that did not include sexual innuendo, one-upmanship, or someone getting kicked in the crotch.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A35EJQMDP4IH4N	S. Milazzo	"I went on Amazon.com the other day looking for the movie ""Casablanca"".  I thought it would be interesting to take a look first at the lowest rated reviews for the movie.  I mean, I thought ""Who could possibly give it 1-star and why?""  I was at first miffed to see several 1-star reviews stating that the movie was painfully boring and some even stated that they had to fast forward through it to get to the more ""exciting"" parts.  But then on second thought, I'm not surprised at all.First let me say first that ""Casablanca"" is without doubt one of the great classics in American film making.  It's a movie that has stood the test of time and one that I can watch any day of the week and know I'm going to enjoy it all over again.  It is without question one of the top 20 Hollywood movies of the 20th century.  But for some folks, it fails to please.You see the ""problem"" with Casablanca is it lacks all of the features that makes today's modern movies ""great"".  Let me elaborate.  Perhaps it would have been better to have Bogie swear like a trooper throughout the movie, because, I mean, that's how people really talk isn't it?  And folks want realism.  Or perhaps if the director had only included a torrid bedroom scene between Bogie and Bergman with frontal nudity to kinda' spice things up a bit.  That sure would have made it ""exciting"". Or perhaps they should have actually shown Capt. Renault (Claude Raines) having his way with a few of the local women in order to get their exit visas out of Casablanca.  I mean to just loosely imply it is to miss out on a great bit of moviemaking.  Or instead of just showing some feeble scuffle between the Peter Lorre character and the local police before he's arrested, why not have them chase him though the streets of Casablanca in some break-neck car chase scene, only to have his car catapult through the air and be killed in a deafening explosion and fireball.  That surely would have made the movie 5-stars! And finally, at the end of the film, instead of having Bogie just shoot Major Strasser in some bloodless, antiseptic scene, they could have spiced it up a bit with lots of blood and splatter!!My point in all of this sarcasm is that unlike today's films, ""Casablanca"" couldn't have shown any of those things nor did it need to.  It relied on great acting, tight direction and a plot that actually made you think.  And it did that extremely well.  Unfortunately for some folks today to have to sit through two hours of actual meaningful dialogue without the ubiquitous chase scene, nudity, profanity and violence is too much for them to bear.  That's boorrring, they say.  In conclusion, I say ""Casablanca"" is one of greatest movies put on film for all the right reasons.  It is a movie that Hollywood would never make today.  Sadly, I think they have forgotten how."	5.0	"Why ""Casablanca"" seems boring to some reviewers . . ."	2005-02-02	10	8	2

While there are a few cheesy special effects in the first 5 minutes of the film, from then on this is special. It's funny, patriotic,  suspenseful, and original. Bogart is the actor every action hero tries to  be; Bergman is the woman every man wishes he could win. It's a guy's guy  movie, and the ultimate chick flick, and a great comedy. And if you find  yourself with a tear when Bogie says &quot;We'll always have Paris&quot; --  welcome to Casablanca.	5.0	If You Don't Like &quot;Old&quot; Movies . . .	2000-01-02	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A16QJ649N8PRV	S. Peek	Although I have often heard about 'Casablanca', I had never seen it.  It is a shame that I had never seen it before.  It is a real gem.Made in 1942, it is set in French unoccupied Morocco.  It features Humphrey Bogart as nightclub owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.  Rick had not seen Ilsa since the day of the Nazi invasion of Paris when they were separated.  She shows up in his club with her husband Victor Lazlo who is an underground leader.  He had been imprisoned by the Germans and Rick had not known she was married.It is an unusual love triangle.  Rick has portrayed himself as apolitical.  He has to decide whether to assist the cause or pursue his love.Although I am not usually one who enjoys romance type movies, this one is very good.  I enjoyed it.

An amazing movies that won't stop to amaze many people around the world, this is why Hollywood was the capital of the movies.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A190I0ZJ9Q0CHI	"SRenan ""Sheldon Renan"""	"Casablanca remains one of the best American films of the forties. It reflects its Warner Brothers film noir heritage (a casbah shot on a backlot in Burbank) but elevates it into new territory. It's been over 70 years now, and everybody (still) goes to Rick's Place.This is Humphrey Bogart at his best -- playing a one-time gun-runner with a night club in neutral Casablanca as the fascists turn the lights off in Europe. Bogart cycles between cynicism and idealism when former-lover Ingrid Bergman arrives with a new lover, a resistance hero trying to escape to fight on in the free world.I've seen it before, of course. But this time I streamed it from Amazon Instant Video to an iPad Air with Retina screen held in my hands. A first for me. I was surprised at how crisp and clear this version of Casablanca looked. I saw many details I'd missed on the big screen. It appears that Casablanca, as is the custom in the movie business, has ""had a little work done"" -- some expert digital restoration.Script-writing guru Robert McKee always used Casablanca to show his students how movies should be written. And designed. And directed.Bottom line, a surprisingly good viewing experience."	5.0	Great Restored Version of Bogart Classic	2014-01-30	0	0	0

The quality of the film transfer on this edition is excellent and a real pleasure to watch. The shadows, shading and the attention to detail of the enhancement from the previous versions, is stunning.2. This movie has more memorable scenes than probably your own wedding ceremony. Also, this is probably the most quotable movie ever made and one of the greatest.3. The sound is pretty even throughout, there's no drop-out's or places where it comes across to thin.4. The extras on disc 2 are interesting and enough to give first-time viewers a better understanding.5. A really fantastic film for any age, first-timers or repeat offenders. I watch this movie every Sunday, and have done so for about the last 10 years. We look forward to it over here and never tire of it.6. Humphrey Bogart is absolutely magnificent and unforgettable as Richard 'Rick' Blaine, but Claude Rains does have all the best lines.The Bad:1. Roger Ebert's commentary on this is dry, dull and sounds as if he's reading from an essay, rather than speaking about the film candidly as it progresses. I can read this same information on the internet or in a multitude of books, with greater insight. I would've preferred a commentary track from Lauren Bacall over this anytime.2. This sound is only offered in PCM 2.0 and could've been presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 had they wished to invest the time and money. Maybe they will remaster it on the Blu-Ray version when it's released.3. Ingrid Bergman's line ""Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him ..."" still bothers a lot of people, and even driven some away, which is too bad. It's a shame that during a period of great inhumanity, a little more humanity couldn't have been more equally distributed.

It is an excellent example of what Hollywood and America was at that time of rugged, individual men that did anything for the women that they loved even if it meant sacrificing their fantasies and desires.  I can also see why Bogart is considered the no. 1 man actor in American cinema.  He exemplifies American culture, confidence, and bravado that most men back then and now wish they could have that kind of persona.  It is only a shame that one knows that such films will probably never be made again.  One there are no such male actors that are 1/4 the man of Bogart and all the modern actresses cannot match Ingred Bergman's natural beauty and most of them are tramps as well.  Not to mention the sets, music and singing.  Quite an amazing film.  I heavily encourage everyone to watch this film	5.0	Masterpiece	2013-08-21	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2VP7JOT3K7PFM	"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie"""	"+++++This movie is based on a play entitled ""Everybody Comes to Rick's.""This movie starts with the following narration:""With the coming of the second world war many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas.  Lisbon became the great embarkation point.  But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.  And so a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.  Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran.  Then by train or auto or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.  Here the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.  And from Lisbon to the New World.  But the others wait in Casablanca: and wait and wait and wait...""The story that can be described as a ""romantic thriller"" begins from here and takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France.  Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) wander into Rick's caf&eacute; in Casablanca.  The two are on the run from the Nazis and have come to Rick's to obtain exit visas or letters of transit.  But the German-controlled local government, headed by a ""poor, corrupt official"" Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the exit visas he came for, then escape.  Ilsa doesn't know that the ""saloon-keeper"" who runs the cafe is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the one true love of her life whose heart she broke.  When the two meet again sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back.  So when Ilsa offers herself in exchange for Laszlo's safe transport out of the country, the bitter Rick must decide what's more important: his own happiness or the lives that hang in the balance.This movie is famous, among other things, for the song ""As Time Goes By"" played by Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) and first encountered by the lovers Ilsa and Rick.  Ilsa when she enters Rick's caf&eacute; asks Sam the following:""Play it once, Sam...Play it Sam.  Play `As Time Goes By'...Sing it Sam.  (The line ""Play it again, Sam"" never appears in the movie.)  Here are some of the lyrics:""You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.  And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you, on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, as time goes by.""The dialogue uttered by all the actors, especially by Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.  Here are four of my favorite Bogey lines:(1) ""Here's looking at you, kid.""(2) ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""(3) ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""(4) Rick is asked by an official what his nationality is.  Rick's reply: ""I'm a drunkard.""The acting is phenomenal especially by Bogart and Bergman.  Special mention should also go to Clause Rains as the Captain.The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene.Finally, this DVD (the one by Warner Studios, released in June 2005) is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has three extras: (1) a documentary hosted by Bogart's widow Lauren Bacall (35 min) (2) original theatrical trailer (3) other theatrical trailers of famous Bogart movies.  I found all these extras interesting.In conclusion, this movie has it all: good background music, great dialogue, an interesting story, good acting, and interesting cinematography.  Be sure to see it and discover why it was voted by the American Film Institute the second best movie of all time and why it won three Academy Awards (including Best Picture)!!!(1942;  105 min;  black and white;  36 scenes;  full screen)+++++"	5.0	Have you ever been in a cafe like this one??	2005-08-23	1	0	1

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	The first thing that you notice when you watch Casablanca for the first time is the dialogue. This movie has more classic lines than just about any other ever made -- 'Round up the usual suspects', for example. Add to that great actors, starting with Bogart, who really makes this movie. His character is magnetic, compelling, bold and yet tender. Fabulous. Claude Rains as the chief inspector brings humor, wit and a sly intelligence to the role. Watching Bergman is watching the prototype for movie heroines of the golden age... The story itself, from 1942, was ahead of its time, talking about concentration camps in a way that seems almost cliche now but was the first script of its kind then. The bad guys -- hey, they're Nazis! You don't get better bad guys than that. As for the DVD, it's a really, really good print that looks great, with improved sound and an extended making of featurette that was originally made for VHS. Bottom line: This should be in everybody's movie collection.	5.0	A perfect movie...looks great on DVD.	2001-08-25	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1O07QCN2GZYHF	Steve S.	"First, I'm not reviewing the movie, which in and of itself is worth 10 stars.  Yes, it follows ""Citizen Kane"" as the second-best movie of all time.  But it's probably the best overall and most enjoyable movie ever made.  So enough about what we already know...Second, with a couple of exceptions, I'm not really reviewing the quality, quantity, or variety of extras in this special edition as a reason to purchase or not to purchase this movie.  It's got some cool souvenirs, extras, etc.  Some of the extras I watched appear to have been re-mastered vs. the 2008/2009 edition they were in.  In that edition, the extras look as though they were poorly upscaled from the DVD version.  The extras on this edition seem to be of better quality, and the menus are a bit more refined.What I am reviewing is the quality of this transfer vs. the 2008/2009 Blu-Ray edition of the movie.  Sadly, I think the 2008/2009 edition is superior, both for the video and the audio.  Let me start by saying I watched all versions on an HDTV and on a newer 1920x1080 Dell laptop with the appropriate player software.  For the heck of it, I also took an HD recording off TCM, as well as a TCM standard DVD because I could not really believe what I was seeing, or rather, not seeing, with this edition.  The problem with this edition is that the contrast/gamma is off.  Way off, at least on my monitors, relative to the 2008/2009 edition Blu-Ray and DVD, and the TCM HD airing.  While the other versions seem to have no problem with grays, this edition contains too much black.  I had to create a custom setting on my monitor to expand the gamma.  When I went back to other shows, they were far too bright and washed out, so I don't think it's in my monitor or laptop.  And yes, I can watch the TCM edition on my laptop via SageTV.  This leads me to believe one of two things is going on - either ""Casablanca"" has been transferred incorrectly all along, and this edition finally got it right, or this edition has a problem with its transfer.  I think it's the latter.  The gamma is just plain too low.  Things are either too black, lost in the shadows, or too white.  The good news is, relative to the 2008/2009 Blu Ray edition, the resolution appears even higher and more detailed.  The grain of the film is so apparent it almost hurts your eyes, in a good way.  Needless to say, either edition beats the TCM HD airing in that department, as one would expect with the lower bitrate of satellite TV.  Obviously, they also beat the standard DVD, but not by as much as one might think.  I take issue with the contrast/gamma so much because of the important use of shadow, both with the characters' faces and costumes, and with the backgrounds, to convey emotional states and atmosphere.  It's not solely because the detailing on someone's top or sleeve gets lost due poor contrast/gamma, although that is almost as bad.The other issue is the audio.  It's not that I expect surround; I never did from any edition.  The problem is that the movie starts out loud and then gets softer.  It's the same with dialogue normalization engaged or disengaged in my players/monitors.  I was hoping that since the movie was in mono, and not being listened to with the expectation of a surround-sound festival, that I could correct the steadily-dropping level by using normalization and not destroy dynamic range that was never there to begin with.  Unfortunately, that did not help either.  Again, neither the 2008/2009 blu Ray or TCM DVD editions, or the TCM HD airing suffered from this, so I don't think it's my systems' fault.Am I saying not to buy this movie?  No, I am not.  Casablanca is hands-down my favorite movie.  But at $45 for this edition, I think one should be prepared for what one might or might not get.  Maybe it's my monitor and laptop.  I doubt it's both, especially with three other versions to compare it to.  If you think I may be right, rent the last release and watch them both and decide for yourself.As to the extras, the ones I have watched so far look as though they have been at least re-scanned in HD, even if their aspect ratios are not right when showing clips of the movie within them.  I also recommend listening to Ebert's commentary at least one time while viewing the movie.  He makes some great points about the composition of the movie itself and offers some compelling arguments against the popular ""Casablanca"" urban legends such as Bergman's alleged confusion about not knowing the eventual outcome of her character (aside from the order of the shooting, as an actress she had to know all along that her character could never go off with Bogart's character since her character was married and the film censors of the time would never have allowed her character to leave her husband for another single man in the movie).  Details such as those might cause you to look further into the fascinating story of how this movie came to be so highly regarded, when in reality no one at the time expected it to be anythig more than one of the 50 or so movies Warner Brothers would make that year.****Update****Just for the heck of it, I purchased a used HD DVD copy as well. My above criticisms against this 70th. Edition would also stand as compared to the HD-DVD transfer.  It also has much better contrast/gamma, but I still have to give a slight edge to the 70th. Edition for the detail.  As I stated earlier, the resolution of the 70th. Edition is so good at revealing the grain of the film that it almost hurts to look at it."	4.0	The movie is as great as ever; the transfer, not so much...	2012-04-13	3	3	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AYKM1B74OLEVC	Story Charts	CASABLANCA is a great film because of the weaving together of the three plots at climax that gives Rick's final action simultaneous meaning on the personal, interpersonal and social levels. At climax, Rick chooses to give up the chance to be with Ilsa by coming to terms with the civic and patriotic responsibilities in a world in upheaval. The film would have been good enough if it ended with that. But with one more twist it reaches greatness by completing Ricks' internal journey from bystander to patriot. Rick has tricked Renault into freeing Victor Laslo, but Renault places a last minute call to Strasser, putting Ilsa and Victor's escape into final jeopardy. Rick shots Strasser to complete the two sub-plots: Victor and Ilsa are guaranteed to escape and Rick has sealed his fate as a patriot. These two sub-plots reach a positive climax as the main love story between Rick and Ilsa plummets to its classic anti-climax. He sacrifices the chance to be with Ilsa to become a true patriot of the world. We are touched by the great story because of what has been won by Rick's noble sacrifice.My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca	5.0	True love leads to living responsibly	2013-07-19	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1SFVU4XSGW9JX	Susan Gornik	"Sweaty palms and an ever-present awkward silence interrupted by erratic and unintelligible squeals of two shy and squeaky voices.  There is nothing more anticipated or more feared than the first date. Dinner and movie and, if both survive, maybe a second date.  The one component of such a date is the movie choice - nothing too scary and nothing too obscene, but something just right: the perfect love story.  Although many times deemed as a ""chic flic,"" a love story can make or break a date and, consequently, a relationship.  Casablanca is one of the greatest love stories of all time; it has all the elements of not only a quality film, but the extra details needed for a love story.  The story line and setting of Casablanca are the bases for the timeless quality of the film.  The setting of the movie has a great impact on its viewers, if the film is set in a foreign country there is an added aura of mystery and danger.  The fact that story takes place in Paris and mainly Casablanca adds to the romanticism of the movie.  Paris, ""the city of lights,"" is considered to be a very romantic city and Casablanca is a very exotic location.  Those watching the film gain an added sense of wonder and excitement with foreign location, instead of the familiar sites of their homeland.  The time frame of the movie also adds to its fame.  Casablanca takes place during World War II and one major character, Victor Laslow, is in danger of being caught by the German army.  In the beginning of the story Rick, the main character, has to leave Paris because of the German threat.  The constant presence of army officials adds an element of danger to the film, therefore making every action of the characters even more meaningful because they are risking their lives for the sake of someone they love.  The time frame also adds to the viewer's identification with the movie.  Most everyone is familiar, especially at the time when the film was released, with the war. The thought of World War II affects people in different ways and bring back certain memories of loved ones lost to the war. The film was probably more embraced by its viewers than it would have been if the war had not been mentioned.  Adding to the aspect of danger is the element of drama, which gives the filmmaker the ability to play with the emotions of the audience.  This drama can be seen in the lines of the characters, such as: ""we'll always have Paris"" and ""Here's looking at you kid.""  These phrases not only add to the drama, but have become universal and add to the lasting popularity and remembrance of the film.  The major characteristic of the film that is responsible for this drama is the lighting.  The filmmakers were both limited and fortunate that the movie was filmed in black and white.  They were limited because they could not use the color of the settings or costumes to impact the movie in any way.  But they were fortunate because they were able to use the black and white to their advantage.  Casablanca is one of the most visually powerful movies there is.  The lighting on the set is so precise that, at first, it is not even noticed.  The movie contains unforgettable scenes that leave a lasting impression on the viewer.  Casablanca is a well-made film that transcends age, gender, and social and cultural barriers.  It is a classic that still brings us to tears every time we watch it. What makes this such a great love story is the ending.  The guy does not get the girl.  He goes through hell to save her and then tricks her into leaving the country with her husband.  He makes the ultimate sacrifice and watches his only true love fly away with another man. If the film had turned out any other way it would not have been such a success.  The story encompasses the kind of love that everyone wants to feel for someone - when you love someone enough to let them go."	5.0	A Review of Casablanca	2001-05-02	2	1	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AO7IMC7XOJIC8	"SUSAN HEIDARIFAR ""Classic Movie Fan (Behindth..."	"I just LOVE this movie, ""CASABLANCA"", for so many reasons. For one, there is an excellent cast. Another thing are the classic ""lines"" - which are memorable, and so perfectly timed. (There are so many of them,  one has to see it a few times to catch them all.) For those  who think of it as a ""chick flick"" - it is not. The romantic part is just what all movies are expected to have: romantic, comedy, what is going to happen (i.e. boy meets girl, loses girl, then gets girl USUALLY), and then there is a great cast.This movie was not expected by neither the actors, studio, or others to enjoy the success it got and still has. But, it has stood the test of time as well as taking home the BP OSCAR. The two-disc edition is for those who love outtakes, etc., but all I need is the movie and I cannot see it enough. I don't get bored with it, and still - after at least 40 viewings - find new things which crop up I haven't caught before.After the number of actors who turned the part(s) down - it worked perfectly the way it was.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2SA52AJUQZFIA	Susan Lewis	This classic movie is more that a love story, more that a political statement.  Casablanca is arguably one of the finest pieces of film ever constructed.  The use of Hitchcockian lighting sets a mood so stirring that  the viewer is drawn into the story without the awareness of the passage.  The sacrifices of love, the loss of human dignity which invariably  accompanies war  and a man's rediscovery of his lost humanity are all  intregral subplots in this stirring tale of love.

I'm not going to waste your time discussing the film, because the film speaks for itself. However, I will tell you all about this spectacular DVD release.For the past several years, Warner Bros. has been releasing spectacular multi-disc Special Editions of their classic films. Usually in 2-Disc sets, although occasionally, they go farther, such as the 4-Disc sets of Gone With The Wind and Ben-Hur, as well as the 2- and 3-Disc sets of The Wizard of Oz and the recent 3-Disc set of The Maltese Falcon. With hours of spectacular bonus features and digitally restored and remastered transfers, Warner Bros. is easily beating out most film companies in terms of consistently spectacular DVD releases, rivaled only by Criterion. (And most Warner Bros. DVDs won't cost you an arm and a leg like Criterion.)That having been said, 2003's 2-Disc Special Edition of Casablanca is spectacular. The film itself has been nicely cleaned up and is presented in glorious black and white, with its soundtrack cleaned up and presented in all it's original mono glory. Disc 1 includes the film as well as the original 1943 theatrical trailer and its 50th Anniversary reissue trailer. Trailers are always a welcome inclusion, as it allows a peek at how films were promoted through the years.Disc 2 contains some excellent bonus materials, as well. One glance and you might think it's really light. A gallery, some audio stuff, a couple of documentaries, a cartoon, and a TV show. But it's quality over quantity, and that's what matters. The ""You Must Remember This"" documentary will be familiar to pretty much anyone who owns a video of the movie from 1993 and later. This particular revision will most definitely be familiar to anyone who owns the 1998 Special Edition VHS. However, its inclusion was a natural choice, and the documentary is excellent. Although not very long, it's not fluffy at all.The best bonus by far is the feature-length documentary, Bacall On Bogart. Narrated by his wife, actress Lauren Bacall, the documentary delves into Bogey's life and his remarkable career, as well as his marriage to Bacall. Produced in 1988 for WNET television, and likely broadcast on PBS and similar stations, this documentary is informative, entertaining, and its inclusion on here warrants praise to Warner Bros.Also a welcome inclusion, and one that had it NOT been included would make one go ''Er, what?'' is the 1995 cartoon parody tribute, Carrotblanca, starring Bugs Bunny as Rick. The cartoon is wacky and zany like your typical Looney Tunes cartoon, but does not disrespect Casablanca at all. It's a clever parody and tribute to a classic movie.Also included are audio extras, such as scoring outtakes and a 1943 radio performance featuring Bogey, Bergman, and Paul Henried, the 1955 TV episode ''Who Holds Tomorrow'' from the TV series of Casablanca, deleted scenes and outtakes, a documentary ''The Children Remember'' which I have not viewed yet, and some other various bonus materials. All are welcome inclusions here.It's been four years since this DVD was released - a century when you consider how DVD continues to grow and change and expand as a medium - yet this DVD outshines many of the DVD releases we see today. Warner Bros. may have started out releasing lukewarn DVD presentations of their classic movies, but they have since set the bar higher and higher for DVD releases. Casablanca's 2003 2-Disc Special Edition stands up to even the best of the ""Special Edition"" DVDs film studios crank out in 2007 and outshines most of them. And Warner Bros. continues to release more spectacular Special Editions every year. Praise to Warner Bros."	5.0	A perfect film gets a perfect DVD treatment.	2007-03-11	9	8	1

She was simply magnificent in Gaslight, Spellbound, Anastasia, Notorious, and Cactus Flower.On the other hand I've never understood the mass appeal of Humphrey Bogart??? Although I loved the movies Key Largo(Edward G. Robinson stole the show as Johnny Rocco!), To Have and Have not, and They Drive by Night , they were just great films with or without Bogie! Eventhough Humphrey Bogart was a major movie star, his voice and mannerisms were so distinct that it always seemed like he was just playing the same one- dimensional character in every film.	3.0	THIS MOVIE IS SO OVERRATED ALONG WITH HUMPHREY BOGART AS WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2006-12-05	24	3	21

Two lovers torn apart by a twist of fate years ago in Paris are reunited in Casablanca.  Their meeting is a mess of bad timing, life-altering secrets, and unmistakable passion.  Can they be united forever?  Can love conquer all?  Casablanca is a backdrop where these questions are tested while the lives of many hang in the balance.  A superb performance by both Bogart and Bergman, this classic will last through the ages as one of the best love stories the world has ever known.	5.0	Casablanca	2009-11-17	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AY4DG8NV64EZJ	"""thebadgercarlton"""	Man alive, I hate not giving Casablanca five stars. It's among my favourite films. You can't beat dialogue like that! The characters are superp, the sets and costumes are superb, Bogie is wonderful, and Bergman rips my heart out everytime she walks into Rick's Cafe Americain dressed in that gorgeous white travelling suit... And then when she starts crying!!I can't say enough good about the movie itself, and I won't try. It's already been said, by others more eloquent than myself. But I will dare to critique the DVD, nonetheless. But only the DVD...Full screen format??? Come on, is it that hard to put it in it's original cinematic widescreen glory??? And what about extras? An entertaining documentary hosted by Laruen Bacall is a step in the right direction, but this is CASABLANCA, MAN! What about commentary? What about photo galleries? What about featurettes, and production jazz? Put some effort into it, for Pete's sake; it's only #2 on the AFI 100, and one of the finest films ever made!! I don't want to see trailers for Key Largo, I want to see another (longer) interview with Bergman's daughter. While you're at it, Warner Brothers, give some thought to Gone With the Wind. That's even worse. All it has is a trailer, and some ridiculous trivia questions. GONE WITH THE WIND!! I hope you're planning some kind of Special Edition Anniversary Collection with hours of extras.Casablanca is timeless, it really is. You must buy this DVD, if only to remember the days when movies were acutally beautiful stories, not special effects extravaganzas spiced with plenty of gratuitous sex and violence. But save some pennies, because it can only be a matter of time before WB realizes it's atrocious error, and re-realeases Bogie-Bergman-Henried with the attention they deserve.	4.0	Warner Brothers, you can do better than this for CASABLANCA!	2001-09-18	38	26	12

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A20TJ5P97W5MS1	The Inquisitor	Who are you really, and what were you before? What did you do and what did you think, huh?Casablanca. 1942. Defines old school classic. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. This movie has a plot that appears to be simple but could possibly be more complicated then life itself.The great Humphrey Bogart plays Rick. Rick owns a bar in Morocco during World War II called Rick's Cafe. This bar & casino is frequented by shady characters from all over Europe. Most of these individuals are looking for one of three things: a drink, freedom, or love. One random night it all changes when Rick's old squeeze walks in and brings all the familiar feelings with her. The only problem is that this ain't no ordinary girl. She is beautiful and she is directly connected to the resistance. Love or liberty? This film asks the big questions in a fun way. It is still going strong today and you certainty don't need special effects to see why. You can practically smell the booze and feel the heartache. Watch it then, watch it now, and watch it tomorrow: Casablanca is as cool as they come.Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #97	2012-04-08	3	2	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1ANTDDYXURA73	The Majestic 'Squatch	I've owned Casablanca on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. This is, without a doubt, the best that this film has ever looked. The blacks are dark and deep, the cigarette smoke threatens to roll right off the screen, Bogie and Bergman have never looked better. I won't insult your intelligence (or your taste) by reviewing the film itself. It's a timeless classic and everyone should experience it at least once. I know some of you are nodding your heads in agreement.The set itself is sturdy and robust. It includes a wonderful book, a set of coasters (that a drop of condensation will never touch in my home), and a series of small reproductions of the film's posters. All of it is informative and compelling. The entire set is an example of quality materials and manufacturing. The real question is, why isn't it in your cart?	5.0	A Transfer Befitting a Classic	2013-04-19	0	0	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	"Just as ""Gone With The Wind"" raised the costume drama to new heights, ""Casablanca"" defined the Hollywood romance, with a touch of film noir thrown in.  What's remarkable is that all the contributors to this film did solid work before and after this, but for some reason they only gelled like this once, here.  Or, as Rick might say, ""All the productions of all the movies for all the studios in the world, and they walked into this one.""  Casablanca has become more than a movie.  It's an icon for 1940s Hollywood.  Or rather, it's full of icons: the trenchcoats, the fedoras, the fog and cigarette smoke, the starry-eyed closeups in half-shadow, the exotic locals and transport planes that whisk our heroes to safety.  Many films since have tried to duplicate the mood of this movie, but none has really succeeded quite the same way.Somehow the role was perfect for Bogart: famous for playing gangsters (he once said he worked his way up from third gangster to second gangster to first gangster), here is is playing a character who is in even more danger, and I think that's largely reponsible for the film's success.  For as a gangster the danger was self-evident; here, as a cafe owner, Bogie had to juggle corrupt police chiefs, cheating gamblers, angry Nazis and fleeing refugees, all while remaining calm, keeping his business open, and, as he so famously puts it, sticking his neck out for no one.  It's not an easy task, but Bogart's Rick makes it look easy; that's the key to his charm and allure.  There's much pleasantness on the surface in Rick's cafe, but there's always intrigue boiling just underneath.  It probably mirrored how a lot of Americans felt during the time.Ingrid Bergman is...well, I hate to use the cliche, but she *is* luminous.  She manages to suggest so much with a glance, a shrug, and both she and Bogart have long pasts that are wisely not dealt with in detail.  (Thirty years later, the creators of ""Chinatown"" did a similar wise thing with the J.J. Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray characters, leaving much of their past as pieces in a puzzle.)  We can fill in the blanks, which just makes the characters more alluring and appealing.The supporting cast hits all the right notes, with special kudos to Claude Rains for what might be the best acting job in the film.  (Ebert says this in his commentary, and I agree.)  I'm constinually struck by how short Peter Lorre's part is.  I find his lack of screen time a little unbalanced, frankly.Some people call Casablanca the ""perfect"" movie, whatever that means.  That's a sentimental pronouncement--the film has its share of flaws.  There are some ridiculous plot holes--why would Nazis who put Victor Laszlo in a concentration camp allow him to roam freely in Casablanca once he escaped?; why would letters of transit--mere pieces of paper--stop Nazis from allowing wanted people to flee?  Ebert says we shouldn't dwell on these questions, and maybe we shouldn't, but the fact remains that the whole situation is improbable in the extreme.  The virtuals of the film are such that we don't worry too much about these details however: we just enjoy being invited into Rick's Cafe, and as long as we are in its cozy and fascinating interiors we will forgive certain transgressions of logic.  And the ending is about self-sacrafice in a way that will be lost on much of the younger generation, who oftentimes just see it as a sappy love story.This DVD release is excellent, with a superb print (hardly a nick or speck of dust), bountiful supplements and interesting commentaries.  Ebert's enthusiasm for the film bubbles over, and he dispells many of the myths that have cropped up regarding Casablanca over the years.  The documentary on Bogart's life and career is interesting, especially when the films he produced with his own company are discussed--many of these should be more highly regarded than they are.  People today remember Bogie as the great commercial Hollywood icon, but few realize he was also one of the first ""indie"" producers, and just like many of today's independent filmmakers he tasted frustration as less-commercial projects floundered.  An interesting bit of trivia: he developed and starred in a now relatively-obscure film about a mobile army surgical hospital in Korea in the early 1950s.  The title he wanted for this film--a title vetoed by the studio because it was too odd and obscure-- was MASH.The Warner Brother's cartoon, ""Carrotblanca,"" is the lowpoint of the extras.  Warner Bros. made thousands of inspired cartoons during its heyday, but this isn't one of them.  On the whole, though, this DVD set has enough extras to satiate even the biggest Casablanca fan or Bogart buff.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL	Themis-Athena	"Aaaahhh ... Bogey. AFI's No. 1 film star of the 20th century. Hollywood's original noir anti-hero, epitome of the handsome, cynical and oh-so lonesome wolf (with ""Casablanca""'s Rick Blaine alone, one of the Top 5 guys on the AFI's list of greatest 20th century film heroes); looking unbeatably cool in white dinner jacket or trenchcoat and fedora alike, a glass of whiskey in his hand and a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. Endowed with a legendary aura several times larger than his real life stature, and still admired by scores of women wishing they had been born 50+ years earlier, preferably somewhere in California and to parents connected with the movie business, so as to have at least a marginal chance of meeting him.Triple-Oscar-winning ""Casablanca,"" directed by Michael Curtiz, was and still is without question Bogart's greatest career-defining moment, the movie on which his legendary status is grounded more than on any other of his multiple successes. The film's story is based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's,"" renamed by Warner Brothers in order to tag onto the success of the studio's 1938 hit ""Algiers"" (starring Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr). Building on the success of 1941's ""The Maltese Falcon"" and further expanding Bogart's increasingly complex on-screen personality, it added a romantic quality which had heretofore been missing; eventually making this the AFI's Top 20th century love story (even before the No. 2 ""Gone With the Wind""), while second only to ""Citizen Kane"" on the AFI's overall list of Top 100 20th century movies; with a unique, inimitable blend of drama, passion, humor, exotic North African atmosphere, patriotism, unforgettable score (courtesy of Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By,"" Max Steiner and Louis Kaufman's violin) and an all-star cast, consisting besides Bogart of Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa), Paul Henreid (Victor Laszlo), Claude Rains (Captain Renault), Dooley Wilson (who, a drummer by trade, had to fake his piano playing as Rick's friend Sam), Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser), Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) and Peter Lorre (Ugarte). And the movie's countless famous one-liners have long attained legendary status in their own right ...Looking at this movie's and its stars' almost mythical fame, it is difficult to imagine that, produced at the height of the studio system era, it was originally just one of the roughly 50 movies released over the course of one year. But mass production didn't equal low quality; on the contrary, the great care given to all production values, from script-writing to camera work, editing, score and the stars' presentation in the movies themselves and in their trailers, was at least partly responsible for its lasting success. In fact, the screenplay for ""Casablanca"" was constantly rewritten even throughout the filming process, to the point that particularly Ingrid Bergman was extremely worried because she was unsure whether at the end she (Ilsa) would leave Casablanca with Henreid's Victor Laszlo or stay there with Humphrey Bogart (Rick).Little needs to be said about the movie's story. After the onset of WWII, Casablanca has become a point of refuge for Jews and other desperate souls from all corners of Europe, fleeing the old world with the hope of building a new life in America. Unofficial center of Casablanca's society is Rick's ""Caf&eacute; Americain,"" where gamblers, refugees, French police, Nazi troops, thieves, swindlers and soldiers of fortune come together on a nightly basis, to make connections, conduct their shady business, or simply forget the uncertainty of their fate for a few precious hours. And presiding over this mixed and colorful society is Rick Blaine, expatriate American without any hope of returning to the United States himself (for reasons never fully explained), officially not interested in politics but only the flourishing of his business, but soft-hearted underneath the hard shell of his cynicism. From Rick's perspective, everything is going just swell and the way it is meant to be: he is reasonably well-respected, has a good working relationship with Captain Renault, the local representative of the Vichy government (based on mutual respect as much as on the fact that Renault is a guaranteed winner at Rick's gambling tables and, by way of reciprocation, turns a blind eye to whatever less-than-squeaky-clean transactions Rick may be tolerating in his caf&eacute;, always ready to have his police round up ""the usual suspects"" instead of the truly guilty party of a crime if that person's continued freedom promises to be more profitable); and although aware of Rick's not quite so apolitical past, the Germans are leaving him alone as well, as long as he stays out of politics now. Until ... well, until famous underground resistance leader and recent concentration camp-escapee Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa walk into Rick's caf&eacute;, into his place ""of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world"" - and with one blow, administered to the melancholy tunes of ""As Time Goes By,"" the carefully maintained equilibrium of his little world comes crashing down around him.The movie's two-disc special edition is unquestionably superior to the prior single-disc DVD; featuring not only an improved video transfer but also, and notably, a new introduction by Lauren Bacall, additional documentaries (""Bacall on Bogart"" and ""The Children Remember"" with Stephen Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's daughters Pia Lindstrom and Isabella Rosselini) besides the excellent ""You Must Remember This"" already included on the one-disc edition, newly-discovered deleted scenes, treasures from the production history, commentary tracks with Roger Ebert and historian Rudy Behlmer, as well as several audio documents and fun stuff like web links and the ""Looney Tunes"" homage ""Carrotblanca.""Not only to Bogart and Bergman fans all over the world, ""Casablanca"" is film history's all-time crowning achievement, a ""must"" in every movie lover's collection, and one of the few films that truly deserve the title ""classic.""

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	"The Movie Man ""tenebre89"""	"""Casablanca"" is a motion picture classic beloved by millions.  Warner Home Video has honored this wartime romantic drama with an elaborate box set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its theatrical release.World War II is raging and the Nazis are occupying North Africa, but Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is sitting out the war in Casablanca as proprietor of the most popular nightclub in town.  The cynical Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit permitting their carriers to leave the country.  To placate Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), local police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) detains Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is accompanied by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love.  Old flames are rekindled and Rick plans use the letters of transit to leave Casablanca with Ilsa.The film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked:  Michael Curtiz's direction; a fresh and clever script; colorful characters; the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman; a first-class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson); a haunting song, ""As Time Goes By,"" that runs through the film as Rick and Ilsa's love theme; and the immediacy of a war whose outcome was still undetermined.Humphrey Bogart, who had previously played gangsters, took on his first romantic lead in ""Casablanca.""  George Raft had unsuccessfully angled for the role of Rick.  Ingrid Bergman, under contract at the time to David O. Selznick, was borrowed by Jack Warner to co-star with Bogart.  Composer Max Steiner was against using ""As Time Goes By"" and Warner finally agreed to let him write an original song for the movie, but by then Bergman had cut her hair for another movie and couldn't re-shoot the scenes in which the song was heard.  Sam, Rick's singer-pianist, who performs the song, was nearly made a female, with Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald considered for the role.  Dooley Wilson, the eventual Sam, was a drummer and faked playing the piano.No movie has more memorable dialogue.  ""Here's looking at you, kid"" was voted as the Number 5 most famous movie quote by the American Film Institute.  Other lines that live in memory include ""We'll always have Paris,"" ""Round up the usual suspects,"" ""The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world,"" and ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""  But Bogie never spoke the line ""Play it again Sam.""  That was the title of Woody Allen's 1972 homage to ""Casablanca.""  Rather, Rick says to Sam, who had performed the song at Ilsa's request, ""You played it for her.  You can play it for me.""The 3-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition box set contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, reproduction of the original 1942 French film poster, 60-page production art book, and collectible drink coaster set.  Among the 14 hours of bonus material are two new documentaries: ""Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic"" and a look at the career of director Michael Curtiz; full-length documentaries on the history of Warner Brothers Studio and its founders; outtakes; a vintage cartoon; two radio broadcasts; several short subjects; audio commentary by Roger Ebert; and an introduction by Lauren Bacall."	5.0	"We'll Always Have ""Casablanca"""	2008-11-26	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2Q13PHEXGR48Q	T O'Brien	Casablanca is one of those movies that everyone can find something to like about it.  Even 70 years later, this movie is still one of the most popular movies ever made.  Set in the city of Casablanca in unoccupied French territory, the story is full of intrigue, a triangle love story, great characters, and too many one-liners to even mention.  In Casablanca, people are desperately trying to get travel visas out of the city so they can get to America as the war draws closer.  Two German couriers carrying visas are murdered making everyone wonder where the documents are.  From here we are introduced to Rick, a bar owner who apparently has no allegiance except to himself.  One night, the love of his life walks in to his bar setting the whole story in motion.  This is a fabulous movie that can be watched over and over again.  It has all the elements of a great movie and should not be missed.Humphrey Bogart was never better than his role as Rick, the bartender who looks out only for himself.  Simply put, this is one of the coolest characters in movie history.  Ingrid Bergman is great as Ilsa, a woman who has a romantic link to Rick in the past.  Bogie and Bergman are great together throughout making their relationship truly believable.  Paul Henried stars as Victor Lazslo, Ilsa's husband and leader of the resistance movement.  Claude Rains gives an excellent performance as Captain Renault, a French officer who plays both the Allies and the Germans.  The film also stars Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt.  The two-disc special edition should not be missed by fans of the movie.  There are too many extras to even mention, but they are all worthwhile.  Movie fans everywhere will love this classic movie.  Do not miss!	5.0	One of the greats	2003-10-03	27	21	6
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all time. Why? The superior acting performances by the extensive cast is unlike anything I've ever seen before. There are so many actors with key roles in this movie, and all of them deliver, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. They have a magical chemistry between them that is believable and appealing. Ingrid Bergman has incredible presence on screen, and is beautiful. Something that I found rather funny while watching this movie is the number of times the word, 'Casablanca' is said; it seems like a ton. This DVD has some special features, with a brief commentary by Lauren Bacall, a trailer, and the making of the film. Something worth noting: Upon inserting the DVD, the movie starts playing, without any menu appearing. One must press their menu button on their DVD remote in order to bring up the menu; otherwise, the menu will appear after the movie. I found this a little strange. The picture quality is excellent for an old film, while the sound quality is adequate. Casablanca is recommended viewing as a film depicting romance, war, and self-conflict.	5.0	Bergman/Bogart The Right Chemistry	2014-05-14	0	0	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"""Casablanca"" - oh, ""Casablanca.""  What could one possibly say about ""Casablanca"" that has not been said a million times by a million people or more?  Let me ask this: have you seen ""Casablanca""?  If you have not, my friend, this writing cannot convey the strength with which I recommend that you purchase - not rent, purchase - this film immediately.  And if, for some reason, you should ask me why, I will tell you that ""Casablanca"" belongs in every person's cinematic library, because it is quite possibly the finest film ever released.The word ""classic"" applies to no film, NO FILM, not ""Citizen Kane,"" not ""The Godfather,"" none of these, so much as it applies to ""Casablanca.""  Every last scene is classic.  Every line is classic.  Everything about it is classic, not because it's an old film, but because it IS film.  ""Casablanca"" is the very embodiment of why movies are made, and it has all the elements of impeccable filmmaking.  You have a situation with which the audience can sympathize: a man's world is turned upside down when his long-lost love walks into his saloon.  The man is a classic example of the ""tragic hero"" who was so popular in 1940s and 50s cinema, particularly film noir: on the outside, he's a cynical, cold, wisecracking individual, but inside he's a kindhearted, courageous human being who can't help but do what's right.  That's why, when we discover that the object of his desire has a new man and loves him, we know that she should go off and live happily ever after with him, but we still root for her to wind up with our tragic hero.And no one plays the tragic hero like Humphrey Bogart.  One year earlier he'd delivered a knockout performance as just such a character in John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and two years later he'd play an identical character in Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"" with future wife Lauren Bacall, but no one'll argue that Bogey never surpassed his performance as Rick in ""Casablanca.""  There's something about Humphrey Bogart that remains unexplained to this day, something that made him so powerful a leading man.  Perhaps it was his effortless cool, or total confidence, or his sour tongue, or maybe just that twinkle in his eyes.  Whatever it was, there has never been a leading man quite so charismatic as Bogart in ""Casablanca.""But a leading man is nothing without a leading lady, and so we have Ingrid Bergman, one of the screen's most dazzling beauties.  She was at her most dazzling in ""Casablanca,"" another tragic character whose actions are as heartbreaking to the audience as they are to Rick, but in the end they're understandable and we sympathize.  Despite their charm, so many classic leading ladies just let the drama flow in their performances.  But not Bergman.  She put every fiber of her being into her performance, and she breathes so much humanity into the character of Ilse that we can't help but forgive her and sympathize.Equally important is the supporting cast.  It's amazing how vibrant each of the characters are, no matter how small or large their roles.  Claude Rains' character is particularly interesting: he walks the line between the good guys and the bad guys throughout the picture, sometimes swaying to one side and sometimes to the other, but we're never quite sure who's side he's on until the climax.  Rick's employees are just as charming as their boss, among them pianist Sam, played by Dooly Wilson, goodhearted waiter Carl (S.Z. Sakall), and wirey bartender Sascha (Leonid Kinskey).  Sydney Greenstreet, who also appeared with Bogart in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" plays Rick's rival, Ferrari, described by Rick as ""a fat hypocrite.""  Conrad Veidt is the real villain of the picture, Nazi Major Strasser, and last but not least, Peter Lorre is the thug who sets the wheels in motion.So much of ""Casablanca""'s appeal lies in its story and characters.  The story is timeless, romantic, and, of course, dramatic.  The setting is a character unto itself, a mangy hellhole stuck somewhere in the middle of the war, which so far has remained safe from enemy troops, but the promise of occupation grows stronger each day.  The grimness of the war is a powerful backdrop for Rick and Ilsa's love, the shining light through all the darkness.  In Darren Aronofsky's recent film ""The Fountain,"" a character philosophizes, ""Every shadow is threatened by the morning light.""  That philosophy was cemented in ""Casablanca,"" where good triumphs evil, and it will always triumph so long as people are willing to fight.  The film says that there is goodness in us all; some are destined to see this, and others are not.  In one scene, Rick asks a hero of the resistance, ""Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?  I mean what you're fighting for.""The resistance fighter replies, ""You might as well question why we breathe.  If we stop breathing, we'll die.  If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.""Of course, Bogey cracks, ""Well, what of it?  It'll be out of its misery.""But the resistance man, the movie's ""stalwart hero,"" knows better.  ""You know how you sound, Mr. Blaine?"" he asks.  ""Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.""Heart is something this film has no shortage of - that and humanity.  ""Casablanca"" is as 'human' as film as ever there was.  And though lifelike characters have become a staple of modern dramatic cinema, so many characters in older films felt like just that: characters in a movie, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing for those films.  But the characters in ""Casablanca"" have a remarkably deep, realistic feel to them.  They each have a story to tell, a life of their own, human feelings, human desires.  Most importantly, they each have the urge to do good in the end, no matter their position in the world.The actual techniques employed in the film are resistant to any criticism whatsoever.  The songs composed for the movie, greats like ""It Had to Be You"" and, in particular, the (ironically) timeless ""As Time Goes By,"" add so much emotion to the film.  The flashback sequence was possibly the first to ever figure prominently in a major motion picture, and it's one of the most strong and memorable scenes in the movie.  The editing is flawless - tight, concise, steady-paced, exactly what it should be.  Finally, the photography is beautiful.  Every shot is like a painting, a moment to be treasured forever and ever were it not instantly replaced by the next wonderful frame.In all these many, many years since the release of ""Casablanca,"" it hasn't lost any of its power; in fact, as time goes by, the movie may actually become more powerful.  Certainly, no film has ever been more powerful than this, and none have ever been so bittersweetly perfect.  This is the crown jewel of artistic achievement.  This is why we have movies.  This is film.  This is life.  Whether it's the greatest film in history will always be the subject of much debate, but no sane person will deny that ""Casablanca"" is among the absolute finest masterworks of cinema.  ""We'll always have Paris,"" Rick tells Ilsa in one of the film's signature scenes.  Until the end of time, cinema lovers will always have and treasure ""Casablanca."""	5.0	The very embodiment of why moves are made	2007-07-17	4	4	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A35ZB6IEOAOVZF	Tracy T. Kornfeld	Casablanca has always been one of my favorite movies. I can only guess at the number of times that I've watched it. The greatest thrill was when you could actually see it projected on the big screen. I've worn out a couple of versions of the DVD. When they announced the 70th anniversary blu-ray box set, I figured that I had to have it, if for anything else, to see how the 1080p in its original format came out. I have to admit, the boxed goodies alone are worth the price. I think the book about Casablanca as well as the drawings is an incredible addition. The coasters are kind of fun, too. However, I was very impressed with the quality of the movie. The blacks are very black and the shadows are spectacular. So I give an A+ to seeing the movie as if it was fresh out of film box. The audio is terrific. The extras are some carry overs from the last release, but they have added quite a bit about the legacy of the Warner Brothers themselves. For film buffs or film historians or even those that like trivia, it is hours of jewels.I've seen some very bad conversions to blu-ray of classic movies. I'm thrilled to say that they were extra careful on improving the film quality without any give backs. This is truly the way that that the film was meant to be seen. With all of the junk out there that comes with four DVD's and the ability to transfer it to your smartphone, etc., this gives you the biggest bang for  your buck without a lot of the extras that you don't need to justify the higher price.So, to sum up - and excellent transfer in blu-ray, one of the best I've seen in b/w. The sound quality is also wonderful. The DVD extras, while the commentaries were available on previous issues, the added hours of extras about Warner Brothers [narrated by Clint Eastwood] is terrific. The book also serves as an excellent reference. If you're a Casablanca fan like I am, this edition is a must for your library.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A243HY69GIAHFI	tropic_of_criticism	For me, the intriguing story of _Casablanca_ is not the story of Rick and Ilsa trapped between the reality of their present and the memory of their past.No, the truly interesting  story of _Casablanca_ is that which is  revealed in the DVD's supplementary documentary, _You Must Remember This_.  The creation of this true work of art in an environment dedicated to the  mass production of films gives hope to every artist who's had to perform  commercially.  Indeed, one almost comes away from a behind-the-scenes  exploration of _Casablanca_ with an actual appreciation of the way in which  deadlines and pressure can help the artist make a better product._You  Must Remember This_ is thus useful for its display of  the whole  &quot;studio system&quot; era in Hollywood.  It gives a good glimpse into  that time and could serve as a useful jumping-off point to anyone seriously  studying the subject.Likewise, the way in which the film's producers and  director led the project is a fascinating exploration of management  science.  The film became legendary, I think, because the people at the top  allowed great flexibility for those they led, and weren't afraid to play  around with ideas offered even on the studio floor.  I think MBA candidates  would do well to look at the way this film was put together for  enlightenment.Still, I can't resist talking about the film itself.  For  me _Casablanca_ is the legend I return to in my own mind whenever there are  romantic crises in my life.  I think that part of the reason that this  movie has survived is because it offers a unique perspective on romantic  disappointment.  Instead of concluding with scorn or hatred of partners  who've left one hanging, it says that people can have noble reasons for  causing pain.  It also says that ultimately pain is eased when one achieves  understanding of the other person.  I'm not sure that any major American  film gives such a positive spin to heartbreak as this one.It's  thus not at all hard for me to recommend the DVD version of this product,  for the excellent  supplementary documentary alone, and the movie itself,  for the surprising values it discovers in the heart of a morally ambiguous  Morocco.	5.0	Study at Rick's School of Management and Behavioral Science	2000-04-18	5	4	1

I never understood why. Of course, I hadn't seen the film either. Nevertheless, I couldn't understand why there was so much ado about a black and white movie that was a love story set in a bar. It didn't make any sense to me.  Now that I am a bit older and have actually seen the film, I understand what all the fuss was about.CASABLANCA is an American classic. It has a great plot, interesting characters, and wonderful dialogue.  Yes, it is in black and white, it is a love story, and it does take place in a bar.  But all of those things that I thought were so lame when I was a kid, are now the things that make the movie so dear. I hated black and white movies when I was a kid. Now I enjoy them and seeing a film of that age with such a great story makes it even that much more enduring. When I was a kid, I couldn't relate to Bogart's character at all. Now, I can empathize with his struggles. As for the boring bar that I thought was so lame; I now know as Rick's and see how important it is to the film, drawing together all the wonderful elements and characters of the story into one setting.All in all, a superb movie that deserves to be called an American classic.	5.0	&quot;An American Classic&quot;	2000-12-26	1	1	0

I won't waste time outlineing the  story, I'm sure you've all heard it before. Humphery Bogart and Ingrid  Bergman are superb as Rick and Ilsa, and set the standard for how acting  should be done. Tragically, acting quality has diminished over the years.  &quot;Casablanca&quot; is a terrific movie with a perfect blend of witty  sarcasm, saddness and patriotism.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A7GSGC0G8R6PW	Tyler Tanner	The story is great, the script is quick and snappy and the chemistry is one of a kind. What is amazing about this movie is that after 60 years, even with most of it's famous lines having entered our modern vernacular, it hasn't lost its edge. Upon viewing again last night with a friend who has not seen it, I realized that this is essential viewing for those who want an introduction to &quot;Classic&quot; Hollywood.The film makes the transition nicely in DVD format. While it does not have a lot of the bells and whistles that usually accompany a popular film, it really doesent need to. The movie is strong enough to stand alone without a commentary by a surving cast member or a &quot;film scholar.&quot; It has a short and sweet documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall and a bevvy of trailers for other films starring Bogey. That feature I actually found helpful since I myself am always looking to increase my knowledge of classic film. This is an excellent purchase and one you will not see once and leave on your shelf to collect dust. You find yourself coming back to this one again and again.	5.0	It's still got it	2003-04-01	3	3	0
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AY6A8KPYCE6B0	Tyson	Perhaps not in all of cinema's history has there been a movie with such brilliant writing, scoring, acting, and numbers of emotional close ups.Casablanca is a legend of nearly 70 years, but thanks to Blu Ray technology it doesn't have to feel that way.  Watching this classic in 1080p is truly an experience, and I have to praise Warner for providing us with the absolutely best possible transfer this film has ever seen.  There's not a trace of grain or flicker or anything you'd expect from a film this old, and the result is stunning.  If you've seen the movie before, it's time to relive with this remarkable new technology.  If you've somehow missed it on TCM, get cultured and experience one of the greatest films in our history in a way no generation has ever been able to do.  Blu Ray.  It not only improves the viewing experience, but it invites the viewer right into the moment.  With clarity as perfect as this, you forget you're even watching a film and instead feel as though you've tapped into the memories of the characters portrayed.I don't feel the need to mention the movie's plot, as most I'm guessing have either already seen it before or can find that out elsewhere, so I want to end this review with what you are probably most wondering about anyway.  Is the Blu Ray transfer worth buying this for?  If I haven't made it clear enough already, YES.  I've seen some poor Blu Rays transfers, but this is not one of them.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best I've seen.  The extras, though I haven't experienced them yet, look interesting, including an audio commentary by movie critic Roger Ebert.  All in all I'd say that this release is definitely worth getting even if Casablanca isn't your favorite movie of all time.

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1RHVEZJA30HGW	"Veronica Lake ""Missy"""	"Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!"	5.0	A Classic in the History of Movie-making: We'll Always Have Casablanca!	2005-10-11	3	3	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"I'm guessing Casablanca is the most referenced film in history. There is good reason for this, as you can cut the mystique surrounding it with a knife. It has one of the finest scripts, among other things. The story behind the writing of Casablanca is legendary. Without getting into the details, writers Julius and Philip Epstein, along with Howard Koc, would finish a scene and rush it over to the set in time to be shot; then they'd write the next one. No one knew how the story would end. As it turned out, it ended up one of the classiest and most iconic of all classic films.In Casablanca, isolated from war-torn Europe, political alliances and hatreds are bubbling, but no one can do anything about them, as it is a neutral country. In the midst of this hotbed, enigmatic Rick (Humphrey Bogart) owns the swankiest nightclub in town,  the Cafe Americane. It is a place to meet, drink and gamble, and to listen to Sam's piano playing; but it's also a place to plot how to obtain one of the rare exit visas to leave Casablanca and fly to the New World.One night, breathtakingly beautiful Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her stoic husband, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid), show up in Rick's. Laslo is an international hero, fighting for the  resistance against the Third Reich. They have come to Casablanca because he is being hunted by the Nazis, and Casablanca is about the only place to catch a flight out of occupied Europe.Flashback: the story is a love triangle, but it is innocent enough. Rick and Ilsa were in love in pre-war, romantic Paris. The lovers made plans to leave Paris before the Germans marched in, but on the night they were supposed to leave, Ilsa's husband, whom she had thought was dead, resurfaced; so, she left Rick standing in the train station in the rain with no explanation.Now in Casablanca, Victor and Ilsa need exit visas like everyone else, but the Germans are determined not to let them leave. It is rumored that Rick has letters of transit, which are even better, stolen off two dead German couriers. But no one knows where Rick's loyalties lie. Ilsa uses her old relationship with Rick to try and get them - not so much for herself as for Victor. But Rick is still nursing his wounds from Paris.At the same time, Ilsa is torn between her old love for Rick and her continued love for Victor. Rick reveals that he is still in love with her; but makes a great show of not believing in causes or heroes. Is that really the way he is? Everything hinges on what Rick will do. Everyone thinks they know him, but no one is sure. As the tension mounts, his character is the key to everyone's future.Casablanca is full of interesting and wonderful characters, played by some of the best character actors at the time. Claude Rains is the debonair but corrupt prefect of police and Rick's friend, Captain Renault. Conrad Veidt plays the despicable Nazi Major Strasser. Sydney Greenstreet is his usual mercenary and rotund self as Rick's business competition, Signor Ferrari. Peter Lorre is the pitifully underhanded Ugarte. S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall is the wonderfully sentimental waiter Carl. Madeleine LeBeau plays the singer Yvonne. Dooley Wilson is Rick's man and pianist, the memorable Sam. The list goes on and on.The ambiance of Casablanca, and of Rick's Cafe Americane in particular, is part of the wonder of the film. Warner Bros. created a world that, even though it was threatening and war-torn, continues to mesmerize audiences. We can't get enough of Rick's or the interesting characters who frequent it. As they say in the film, ""Everyone comes to Rick's."" We also can't seem to get enough of that classic 1940's style: the dinner jackets, the evening dresses - even the uniforms. The 40's were the apex of sartorial style.There are so many memorable quotes from Casablanca that you could almost reproduce the script en mass recalling them.Casablanca won three Oscars: Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture (Hal Wallis) and Best Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson), Best Film Editing (Owen Marks) and Best Music Score (Max Steiner).Waitsel Smith"	5.0	ONE OF BEST WRITTEN AND CLASSIEST OF THE CLASSICS	2007-07-05	1	1	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Everybody ends up at Rick's. In this case, that's a good thing as Casablanca has been remastered and stocked with an additional disc of extras for this 60th anniversary edition. As far as DVDs go, this ain't just another gin joint. This deluxe edition of Casablanca mirrors The Right Stuff and the recently released The Adventures of Robin Hood as an example of how to do right by a classic film. Directed by Michael Curtiz from a marvelous screenplay written by Julius &amp; Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, Casablanca has transcended the era it was made in. The definition of a classic is exactly that; a film that transcends time and manages to exert its influence beyond the year it was made and viewed.This is the second incarnation of Casablanca. Originally released just a couple years ago as a single disc DVD, the film has been reborn as a deluxe two disc dual layer baby with the stunning complexion of a model and the sharpness of a MENSA member. There aren't a lot of films worthy of such a recent reissue and expansion but this classic film deserves it in spades.Set during World War Two Humphrey Bogart plays Rick the owner of a nightclub imaginatively named Rick's Cafe Americain. Rick runs his &quot;gin joint&quot; in French occupied Morocco but German controlled . Waltzing into his club one night is a former lover Ilsa played by a stunning Ingrid Bergman. She and her husband husband Victor (the under rated Paul Henreid) are on the run from the Nazis.  Everyone wants a piece of them and their only salvation in this duplicitious  town is Rick.With an outstanding supporting cast including Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet (who was so popular that he was teamed again with Peter Lorre in another film shortly after Casablanca), Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt, everything seems effortless in this classic film..That's the best compliment you can give any film. So many undeserving movies have won Academy Awards that it's amazing when a great motion picture actually does win; Casablanca was recognized for writing, direction and best picture. There were a number of deserving nominations for this film (including Bogart but he was rewarded later for a far less deserving portrayal in John Huston's The African Queen) but the Academy elected to share the rest of the wealth with other films.A nearly flawless print and beautiful transfer have been used to produce this remastered edition. The crisp, black and white images look amazingly sharp given the age of the film. The bright and clean look of the film is probably due to significant digital clean up and it was well worth the effort. Although there isn't a huge improvement in terms of image over the previously released DVD from a couple of years ago, the generous extras more than make up for purchasing the film again.Since the original film was recorded and shown in mono, there's not much beyond clean up that can be done here. That said, the film still suffers from the same limited range typical of a film from the same time. The documentaries included on the second disc sound terrific though.There's two strong commentary tracks one by film critic Roger Ebert and the other by film historian Rudy Behlmer. Of the two, I found Ebert's track the most fun and informative at the same time. Behlmer's commentary is fine and provides lots of interesting background and trivia for the viewer but Ebert is the better entertainer.Luckily the usual suspects weren't assembled for this deluxe edition. While the documentary You Must Remember This appeared on the previous edition, the other extras are, for the most part, new and exclusive to this edition. It's inclusion allows fans of the film to replace the earlier edition.Bacall on Bogart provides quite a bit of insight into Bogart. Having Bogart's widow and fellow actor Bacall host the special that was original produced by Turner Entertainment and WNET was a savvy move. Lauren Bacall manages to provide insightful observations about Bogart's career and how he ended up doing Casablanca. Directed by David Heeley and written by John L. Miller, the documentary is breezy and information. The use of clips and stills also benefits the program making the documentary less static than most.A little known fact is that Casablanca also gave birth to a short lived television series. The premiere episode entitled Who Holds Tomorrow? Is an interesting alternative to the film. While the characters and some of the situations are familiar, the pilot provides enough minor surprises to make it worth viewing. Without DVD and the resurrection of Casablanca again, many fans might have been deprived of the chance to see this interesting bit of television history.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, than Criterion must be blushing. Warner also presents the original radio broadcast by the Screen Guild Players a feature frequently found on many of Criterion's discs of vintage films. What's most interesting is the fact that the trio of top billed stars in the film (Bogart, Bergman and Henreid) perform their parts in this broadcast. It wasn't uncommon during the 30's, 40's and 50's for actors to reprise their roles in special radio adaptions of current films. It's fun having this bit of history included.Finally Warner pulls a rabbit out of its hat. The Bugs Bunny cartoon Carrotblanca with Bugs as Bogie is also included. This hilarious short was produced back in 1995. Although it is missing the breezy direction common to the better classic Warner cartoons, it can more than hold its own against most of them. Carrotblanca looks colorful and vivid in a terrific transfer. If this is what Warner has done to their stable of classic cartoons set for release later in October of 2003, then Looney Tunes fans are in for a treat.Although many fans of the film have probably purchased Casablanca previously on DVD, this deluxe edition has extras galore making it essential. The new print and transfer are vivid and vibrant besting even the earlier edition (which looked very good, indeed).Most film fans would pay a king's ransom to get their special movie treated with as much class and respect as this one. Sure, the usual suspects are present but there's also a whole lot more for fans to view in this  top notch DVD.	5.0	Not the usual extras on deluxe edition of classic film	2003-10-02	9	8	1

I almost had to take a star off for the 'Carrotblanca' &quot;tribute&quot; cartoon.  It is, in all honesty, an abomination. Warner Brothers should have their license to ruin bugs bunny &amp; company permanently revoked.  The voices were bad, the drawings lacked the original quality, and the gags in the cartoon were everything you'd expect to see in a Looney Toons cartoon, but aren't executed well &amp; come across as totally unfunny.  If they had any respect for these classic cartoons, they'd stop ruining their image w/ crud like this.

If you've never seen this movie before you'll be amazed how  many of the movies you've seen are derived from Casablanca.  If you have  seen it this is a great edition and the interviews and discussions that  have been added are very interesting.	5.0	Greatest Movie Ever Made	2000-01-29	2	1	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1AZ4WJUKNZOZ6	William Robert Kinney	The last time I saw Casablanca it was in the historic Tennessee theater in Knoxville and that was some twenty plus years ago.  When I first noticed the blu ray edition I snatched it right up.  I was not disappointed.  The audio and video transfers  are immaculate and as good as any theatrical showing.  I also purchasedThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] andTouch Of Evil (50th Anniversary Edition)and on Sept. 13 I will be eagerly awaiting the arrival ofCitizen Kane (Amazon Exclusive 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition + The Magnificent Ambersons on DVD) [Blu-ray].There is nothing more to say about the film itself because hey, this is Casablanca.	5.0	Hey, this is CASABLANCA	2011-07-14	5	2	3
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	ATY8W5WR0OQE3	William Shepherd	"It is no misjudgement that ""Casablanca"" is the greatest film ever to come out of Hollywood. Humphrey Bogart's rivetting portrayal of nightclub owner Rick has stood the test of time, and is only complemented by Ingrid Bergman's outstanding performance as his beautiful ex-lover Ilsa Laslo. This classic film made amidst the shifting global currents of World War II tells a tale of love and sacrifice the likes of which has never been surpassed.Rick is a seemingly narcisistic nightclub owner running the premier club in Casablanca. He is enjoying a relatively carefree existance until Victor Laslo arrives in town. Laslo is a fugitive from the iron fist of the Third Reich who is seeking authorization for passage out of French Morocco. With Nazi supporters all around, Rick knows that providing aid to Laslo is an unwise venture. However, Rick's existance spirals downward when Laslo enters his Cafe with his wife, Ilsa (Rick's former fiancee who jilted him in Paris before the occupation).Time has shown no mercy to either Rick or Ilsa; they find that they still love each other despite the hate brought about by the years of volatile separtaion. Rick's choice is not an easy one. He can either escape with the woman he loves to Lisbon(leaving Laslo at the mercy of the Nazis), or sacrifice all that he has worked to achieve and help the fugitive couple escape to freedom.Don't deny yourself the opportunity to own the greatest drama to ever grace the silver screen. Once you see it you'll love it, and as the underlying themesong of the film says, you'll only love it more ""As Time Goes By."""	5.0	"It only gets better ""As Time Goes By"""	2012-12-23	1	0	1
0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AUTBHG6070SL4	"wiredweird ""wiredweird"""	I've probably seen this movie more times than any other, and I'll keep watching it, year after year.A lot has been said about Casablanca, so all I can add is my personal impressions. This movie is black and white. Even if color had been available, black and white would still have worked better. The scenes, the closeups of people, they all have some some monumental quality, some kind of skill that's been lost for decades, now. The personalities also stand out in black and white - a resistance hero, a man without a country, a cheerfully venial functionary. Even the DC-3 in the last scene is the icon of a plane, F-15s and 747s not withstanding.No one can claim to be literate if they haven't seen this movie, no more than if they haven't heard Beethoven's Ninth. At the time, this movie was just one among many churned out assembly-line style. Something in it captivated people, though, and keeps captivating them today.Whether or not it's your first time, be captivated.//wiredweird	5.0	Keeps on being a favorite	2004-09-18	5	3	2

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A2XVIPXX2IZKVO	"W. M. Robbins ""The Badger"""	It's hard to believe that when Casablanca was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in 1942 it was &quot;just another&quot; of the 50 or so films that the studio was producing every year, as Lauren Bacall points out in the documentary about the film included in the special features. The movie was an instant success with audiences everywhere, and won three Academy Awards including Best Picture. Called &quot;America's most popular and beloved movie- and rightly so&quot; by The Motion Picture Guide, and &quot;The best Hollywood movie of all time&quot; by Leonard Maltin, Casablanca was  voted the #2 film in a list of the top 100 films of this century by the American Film Institute.Set in refugee strewn French North Africa in 1942, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), a night club owner, and his friend Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), Prefect of Police, enter into a wager as to whether or not Resistance Leader Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) will be able to escape Casablanca and reach the Free World. When Laslo arrives in Casablanca, Rick is stunned to find him accompanied by his ex-lover, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Filled with mystery, suspense, intrigue and romance, Casablanca will remain a favorite of classic movie lovers for years to come.The supporting cast include Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson as Rick's piano playing confidant, Sam. The entire cast are superb, the settings are excellent, and the cinematogrophy is wonderful.The song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was made famous by Casablanca, as it's melody is entwined throughout the film, and it too is now a classic, filled with romance and nostalgia.This is one film that absolutely MUST be in your DVD library!	5.0	&quot;You must remember this&quot;....	2002-10-27	246	209	37

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	AP6QZPQ4UIWA3	x=10 tialist	Why is this 1942 movie the great classic cult film?Bookcases have been filled with answers to this question. The most important point is however that you should first see the movie.The story is timeless, the lines easy to remember, the shots are often perfect and watching the film cannot be a disappointment.The fact that the story is timeless probably comes from the fact that ancient (by Hollywood standards) themes are played out: the independent cowboy Rick and the committed hero Lazlo. The bad guy from Berlin dies in a gun battle.The film is famous for the story that up to the last moment the directors had not clear ending in mind. Their solution, although highly improbable, is perfect: the committed hero gets the girl, the girl is acted upon (she has no influence on her fate), and the cowboy hero strolls towards the sunset towards new adventures.The fact that the film was made in 1942 is significant: the &Iacute; stick my neck out for no-one'position of Rick is heavily challenged throughout the movie. A reminder from 'businessman' Ferrari to the audience is that in 1942 Isolationism is no longer a practical policy. The US indeed did land in North Africa no long thereafter. This is not to suggest there is a causal relation. It is to indicate that the film industry has been telling, sometimes foretelling, at other times supporting, the American story. This frequently was the retelling of that archetype Western movie as you can see today in Troy or the movie on the Crusades.Regardless of your motivation: you have to see this movie	4.0	Here's looking at you kid	2005-06-15	4	2	2

I don't consider myself anything of a film expert, but I know a good film when I see one. It's hard to imagine that the part of Rick was originally scripted for Ronald Reagan, but Bogart's performance is flawless, as is Bergman's. I also find it somewhat ironic that it spawned a catch phrase that was never spoken verbatum in the film, but aside from that, wow. A lot of people may find the storyline somewhat dry by today's standards, but I love it. All of the actors have marvelous voices. Casablanca only gets better 'As Time Goes By' (neat little reference, eh?), and I highly recommend it to anyone with a pulse and a soul. If you must see one more movie before you die, it doesn't get any better than Casablanca.Also, Bogart fans should check out ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Enforcer""."	5.0	Bogart's Best and one of the best films ever!	2005-05-08	3	3	0

0790743132	Casablanca [VHS]	A1DSOF0EK9G06C	Zarathustra	The Hollywood studio system has been much maligned. Stanley Kubrick moved to England to evade it and Robert Altman totally ignored it. But as Roger Ebert points out in his excellent commentary, Casablanca shows what that system could accomplish. Warner Brothers was cranking out a new film every week in 1941. Casablanca was filmed on a Hollywood back lot, but the presence of so many Europeans in Hollywood fleeing the Nazis who appear in Casablanca makes the film look like it was filmed in North Africa.Michael Curtiz was the director of the film, but Ebert points out that the producer Hal B. Wallis was responsible for the final product. Script revisions came out daily. Ingrid Bergman was unable to shoot new scenes because her hair had been cut for her next Warner Brothers film.Somehow Wallis and his team came up with a masterpiece.	5.0	A Triumph of the Hollywood Studio System	2010-05-24	3	2	1
