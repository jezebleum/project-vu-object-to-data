1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	AXJTNYD3UK1BP	"1smileycat ""1smileycat"""	"I was soooo excited to get this home and play it because I grew up listening to these cartoon segments every Saturday morning!  But it bored me.  They just weren't as good as I remembered them, I guess.  I ended up fast forwarding through most of it.  I paused for the classics ""I'm only a Bill"" etc, but I didn't seem to recognize most of them anymore.If you're looking to relive a little childhood, rent it first-  then if you think you can live with it, buy it.  Perhaps you need to check to be sure you recognize more than 1/2 of the titles too.  (I 'thought' I did!) -I personally wish I had my money back.  (My kids even begged me to shut it off!) Just my opinion...hope it helps those of you looking to purchase it.)1smileycat :-)"	1.0	I'm Disappointed.	2003-03-17	80	12	68
1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A3PXP53XA8S7GQ	2Foxcee	I was in awe when I purchased the entire volume.  Growing up I never realized that we as young kids didn't see the entire Schoolhouse Rock!!! None the less I view it now... I'm 38 and my son that I purchased it for LOVES IT and he's 3!!!...Any cartoon, show,play or movie that was out when we were growing up is it what I would call the CAT'S MEOW of the entire tv industry.  If the era wasn't phenomenal how come everything that comes on is a remake? No origianl ideas at all - I feel sorry for today's kids - they have nothing enjoyable and good to watch or listen to for that matter(My opinion!)!!!  Enjoy -  touches on subjects that are fun while learning!!!	5.0	Nostalgic Viewing!	2005-10-11	0	0	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1Q37OU314RRVQ	"""718191"""	This is a must have for all Gen-Xers and for their kids.  The songs are great.  The picture has been cleaned up with vibrant colours.  Not to mention that there is something to be learned from each short.The one negative point I have to make is the glossing over of history in favour of a pro-American stance, but all historians are biased.  It is still very enjoyable.	5.0	Must have for all Gen-Xers	2002-08-29	3	1	2

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A2OUMON7GX93QJ	A. Bush	We actually got this about 10 years ago and hadn't watched it - VHS format. Our kids are now 2 1/2 and just 5 and they LOVE these videos. The 2 1/2 year old sings along to the songs and the 5 year old is asking questions about the different songs and he hasn't started kindergarden yet. Hubby and I grew up with these videos and it's a lot of fun to see our kids enjoying them now. Admittedly, the first couple of times the kids watched it, I was a little bored, but the more that I listen to it as I do things around the house, the more I'm enjoying it. And since my kids love it, it's a winner.	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock 30th Anniversary Edition	2013-11-15	0	0	0
1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A3OGWBZV2F8M74	"Adam Rosenbaum ""Author of 'How to Remember No..."	As the cover says, this two-DVD set includes every School House Rock song ever created, and then some.If you spent time in front of the tube on Saturday mornings in the 1970's, these videos about conjuctions, adverbs, electricty, and how bills become laws will be quite familiar to you. In retrospect I realize how much I actually learned from these great songs.The only negative about the DVD is that the videos are organized in an on-screen jukebox, which is somewhat cumbersome to manage with your remote control. However the selections are categorized by theme (grammar, government, science, etc.) within this jukebox, and you have a variety of options on how to play them, including a Top Ten, all songs in a category, or one-by-one.For fans of School House Rock this is a terrific and complete collection that you will enjoy and also be able to share with your children. I highly recommend it.	5.0	Brings back memories	2005-07-24	4	4	0

He received the DVD for Christmas.  It is amazing how well I remember the words to these shows from thirty years ago.  My son is already starting to learn them.  How many people from my generation learned the Preamble to the Constitution from this series?  It is great to have copy of these songs.  This DVD costs considerably less than the old way buying four different VHS tapes.  All of the spots are incuded in one DVD.  There is also another DVD with other extras such as lost songs and other things.  Other reviewers have critcized the DVD because of the extras.

Since they're so effective, the songs have stayed with me.  I sang them to my daughter when she was little (she's now 30).  When she was in high school, she received extra credit for being able to say the preamble to the Constutution (We the People, in order to form a more perfect union...) before the class even studied it.  Although she sang it in her head as she said it, she got it right.  I'm ordering three videos now for granddaughter and nieces and nephews for Christmas.  What a rewarding gift!!

His class loved it so much that someone stole it!  We replaced it.  The next year my husband lent it to the teacher in the next classroom.  She had it for two days, then one of her students stole it.  We are now on our third copy.  My children have told their dad that he isn't allowed to take it to school anymore.

Shortly after receiving a complimentary copy, my husband was singing along to old favorites and our toddler was having a grand old time learning the songs.  All original 46 songs from the show are here, as well as the brand new ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College"", about the electoral college, and a lost song, ""The Weather Show"".  There are also three songs  with the series' only continuing characters, Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips.You can view a full selection list or see items grouped into categories of Grammar Rock, Science Rock, Multiplication Rock, America Rock or Money Rock, and a jukebox capability allows you to make playlists of songs to be played in order or on shuffle.  There's a short trivia game with quizzes and word scrambles, puzzles, four music videos (by the Lemonheads and others) singing SHR songs to the SHR video, a featurette about the show's Emmy wins, a Nike commercial using a SHR song, and fun, interesting commentary by several of the SHR team.  This dvd version is terrific, demonstrating that the Schoolhouse Rock team is still just as dedicated to quality programming and education as it ever was.

Fertig	"Having never seen the orginal School House Rock (SHR) classics when they first appeared on tv in the early 80s, I rented these DVDs from my local library out of personal curiosity. I was amazed by how incredibly brilliant these educational cartoon musical shorts are. The songs are ingenious, the music is exceptionally high quality and enjoyable to listen to. Of course I had to own it.Now, we most often play the SHR DVDs in the car during long drives. The DVDs are a great way to make the drive seem shorter and I honestly hear my kids learning valuable ideas, information, grammar and math skills with every passing mile.The only thing I'd say is annoying about the DVD setis the format in which the songs are placed on the DVD. All the shorts are broken up by category, such as math, science, social studes, etc. This is nice in concept, but whoever compiled and programmed the DVD forgot to include a ""Play All"" feature.As we use the DVDs primarily while driving, this becomes a problem because the whole DVD won't play end-to-end, therefore, requiring frequent fiddling with the DVD -- no easy feat when you're driving AND trying to advance the programform the front.This aside, the School House Rock DVD collection is the most popular addition to our educational DVD collection."	4.0	My kids are learning that learning is fun	2005-08-16	4	4	0

This material is fun, entertaining and educational, ""dated"" or not. Bob is the musician composer behind those amazing catchy and intelligent songs.In promo material for the Disney production, I saw not a single mention of Bob Dorough (although his name appears on the sidebar promos for other branded Schoolhouse Rock DVD's on the web site). So let me just say that Mr. Dorough deserves prominent billing as a key contributor to the core content, and the success, of the show. His name should be included in the promo material.BTW, Bob is an amazing and unique jazz musician who is still performing and making great music well into his 80's; singing energetically (an understatement) while playing piano at the same time. Very difficult at any age. Bob still does it in uplifting and inimitable fashion.Find him on the Internet, and see/hear him if you can.

Now, for the first time, you can have every Schoolhouse Rock tune ever made on this great 2-disc set.  Of course, all of your familiar favorites are here, from ""Conjunction Junction"" to ""I'm Just a Bill,"" but there are many forgotten treasures as well, such as a Nike ad using ""Three is a Magic Number.""  The show's original creators have also written a totally new song, ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College"" (about the electoral college), which perfectly recaptures the magical feel of this amazing series.Schoolhouse Rock may be 30 years old, but this set takes full advantage of modern DVD technology, offering a wide variety of viewing options (such as jukebox and shuffle features) as well as some fun extras on Disc 2.  And don't be fooled into thinking that Schoolhouse Rock is too outdated for today's kids:  my 7-year old nephew, who excels at Math, recently loved watching all of the number songs with us, and my younger neices are captivated by the catchy tunes and silly graphics in songs like ""Elbow Room.""  Regardless of whether you have kids of your own or simply enjoyed Schoolhouse Rock yourself when you were a child, I highly recommend this as a must-have addition to your home DVD library."	5.0	A must-have for fans!	2007-01-30	3	3	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	ALC4ULJVIX0JP	"Bill Stein ""CJ"""	"I learned the preamble to the Constitution by singing along with Schoolhouse Rock on Saturday morning television.  I also learned things like conjunctions and how a bill becomes a law, and a lot of other things about grammar, science, math, American history, and politics.  Now that means that either I watched too much TV as a kid, or the stuff we watched as kids was really informative and was made so well that it becomes a classic.Schoolhouse Rock is just such a program.  It was delivered to kids in bite-sized portions that held their attention spans just long enough to get the message across, and the cartoons were so engaging that they probably could have made the segments last twice as long and we still would have been glued to them.  Many in my generation learned quite a bit from Schoolhouse Rock.This DVD is produced in the same style as all the original segments, offering a ""jukebox"" feel along with some novel technology that allows you to create playlists of your favorite episodes, or put them on ""shuffle"" and let it pick them randomly.  You can also choose ""The Whole Enchilada,"" and let it play each and every segment in order.All of the original segments are on this DVD, as well as a heretofore unreleased segment called ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College"" which teaches about the electoral system and the punned Electoral College.My kids absolutely love this DVD, although sometimes they have to pry the remote out of my hands.  It's awesome to see them watch (and actually learn) with the same attention that I paid to it as a kid their age.And on occasion, I hear one of them singing the preamble to the Constitution, and I just smile, because a timeless program like Schoolhouse Rock can, and will, continue to teach kids for generations to come."	5.0	Tell me you didn't learn SOMETHING from Schoolhouse Rock...	2007-10-24	0	0	0

Smith	Schoolhouse rock was basically created by ABC ad men who's normal function was to create commercials...It's nice to see how an energy which is usually spent for the all mighty dollar went to create a new way of learning. I remember this stuff in the 70's, and they were more important than the Saturday morning cartoons they came between. The tunes are classic, the lessons are thorough(2 x 98 = 2 x 100 - 2x2 = 196) and the best thing about it is the facts don't change; 2x2 still equals 4.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	AOIXWMMND5XCX	Carmen	This brings back memories. Not that I remember all of them, but the ones I do are sure entertaining.  I am a teacher and my students like it too.  They kept asking to listen to the &#34;Bill&#34; song and were singing it all the time.  Keep in mind some of the content is a little out dated and may need to be explained as there are some generalizations that are made.  But in my opinion, that is a history lesson in itself.  So I think these are amazing, simple, fun ways to get a little history lesson in there.	5.0	Amazing	2014-04-14	0	0	0

Recently, I decided to buy this movie for my brother who struggles with practically every subject found on this DVD. As a result of watching it and listening to the lyrics, he has become more aware of the ""simple"" answers these songs describe repeatedly. I would recommend this DVD to all parents/guardians because this DVD is capable of explaining concepts to children in a way that most adults cannot clarify for children.The concepts applied in the songs allow a child to follow along willingly and easily. Because the songs are catchy, it's easy to begin singing them when you least expect it. This is the ideal gift for children because the characters are easy to relate to and comprehend. Concepts are broken down into the simplest form for children unable to fully grasp certain ideas (like multiples of 8). I don't want to completely credit this DVD with my brother's much improved grades; however, I know it did do wonders for him as a result."	5.0	Highly Infectious Music!	2008-01-18	0	0	0

Lloyd ""parkatola"""	"I read a bunch of the reviews for the Schoolhouse Rock DVDs before buying them, but knew I would get them anyway.  And I'm glad I did.Our three kids, 11, 8, and 5, all love these and have hardly stopped watching them since they arrived.  That's fairly typical with new videos or DVDs, but this is the first one we've bought where the kids walk around singing about adjectives, the shot heard 'round the world, how electricity works, and interplanet Janet.Face it.  Anyone who watched Saturday morning cartoons in the 70s and 80s probably can still recite the preamble to the US Constitution.  And tell you where the piece of paper in ""I'm just a Bill"" is sitting.  And with a bit of coaching, could tell you what the function of conjunctions is.  (""Hookin' up words and phrases and clauses,"" for those who never saw them.)I haven't seen anything out there today that compares with these as far as teaching kids useful information in an entertaining way.  My kids love them.  My wife and I still love them.  And there are a couple of new ones, including one about the electoral college, and an even better one about Tyrannosaurus Debt, the US deficit, how it started, and how it keeps growing.I had no trouble with the jukebox format or navigating my way around.  I was surprised how easy it was based on some of the other reviews, but no problems here.If you ever watched these when you were a kid, get these DVDs.  If you have kids, get these DVDs.  If you've never heard of them but want to watch some entertaining, short, educational cartoons, get these DVDs.Darn, that's the end."	5.0	Nothing out there today compares with these short vids	2005-03-07	69	66	3

Not to sound redundant, but these songs ROCK!!!  History/Politics, Math/Banking/Investing, English/Grammar/Sentence Structure, Science/Astronomy...AWESOME!!  Talk about not minding if my cutie pie asks to watch a show...  OKAY!!  Please...watch...enjoy...  And I can tell that at least some of what she's watching is sticking because she'll refer to something from the show during our learning times.  Perfect!!As far as the trailers in the beginning are concerned (as another reviewer mentioned), I just hit &#34;next&#34; until I get to the SHR menu (&#34;menu&#34; is not a usable function to get there).

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A38K5P68YFIF1J	Chuck Potocki	"A good percentage of my childhood years were spent glued to the TV watching cartoons every Saturday morning and afternoon, but more than those, I LOVED Schoolhouse Rock!  I can honestly say that I learned just as much (if not a bit more) from these classic episodes as I did in 8 years of Parochial school!  While Schoolhouse Rock is not meant to be an alternative to a ""proper"" education, they succeeded in making learning a LOT MORE FUN!When I heard that Schoolhouse Rock was finally available on video, I practically rushed out the door to buy the DVD, and my fiancee and I spent the next few hours glued to the TV just like we were kids again!  Classic episodes like ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly"", ""Conjunction Junction"", and our all-time favorite ""Interjections"" filled us both with many wonderful memories, and we remembered the lyrics to EVERY one of the songs word-for-word without looking at the lyric sheet!  It's amazing (but not surprising) how these things that we loved as children have had such a lasting impression and are still very much with us even into our adult years!  We enjoy them even more now!Schoolhouse Rock is a bonafide classic that will never go out of style and transcends every generation...relive the memories you have and pass them on to your kids so that they too will make their own memories!"	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock ROCKS!!	2002-09-05	18	17	1

My wife and I watched our favorites first.  It is amazing how the songs are still in my memory.  The price is right too, cheaper than I could get it locally.

This production has by far been one of the best educational programs on TV for children. It is beyond me why this was pulled from the Saturday series of cartoons.No matter how innovative today's music has become, School House Rock holds a format of music that sticks to you. Therefore, part of the lessons in the songs are embedded in your memory. Twenty-five years plus and I can still recall the wonder of learning about electricity, verbs, money, conjunctions, etc. The animation may not compare to today's modern style of cartooning, but it still entertains the viewer with an exciting and original idea. With a variety of different topics throughout history in a musical format, SHR series serves its purpose of enlightening the brain.With this said, every parent should have this in their DVD library for their child(ren).

I remember since Saturday Dec. 28th, 1974 the day I heard this song I was very depressed, and unfortunately, my mom was not in the most supporting manner that day. She said she was tired of my complaining, and she was sick of my not smiling anymore. I am crying now whenever I hear this song. I know that growing up my family always wanted me to smile, and that there was no room for complaining, frowning, and other things that just didn't make for positive behavior. I know I am still haunted by this 32 years later; I pretty much played this for my son on the dvd, and since then the memories have flooded back. I know that I played it tonight, and after putting my son to bed I cried like a baby. It's crippled me emotionally, and now I'm going to find out why, so that way I can begin to put this behind me. I know that 2 weeks prior to this I stopped talking to at the time my best friend as he wanted me to break into a abandoned house. I told him ""No"", and he responds by ripping my jacket up with a small pocket knife. I don't know if this has anything to do with why this song makes me so down and depressed, or not. I feel that other than this, and Eisner the rest of this collection is very good.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1GALZCXD8FHOR	Daniel L Edelen	"Schoolhouse Rock is an unusual American cultural phenomenon. Nearly every person who grew up after the late Sixties is familiar with the series. How ubiquitous is it? I would predict that if you started humming ""Conjunction Junction,"" ""I'm Just a Bill,"" or ""Three Is a Magic Number"" in a room of a dozen people, three-quarters would know the reference and at least a couple would probably join in humming or singing the words.This is unimpeachable stuff. To say that this 2-disc set is definitive is to do injustice to the word ""definitive."" EVERYTHING you would ever want to know about Schoolhouse Rock is here. All forty-six cartoons ever done for the series are included, even the ""Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips"" series that looked at computers. The electoral college toon that was done later is part of this collection, too.The extras on the second disc are outstanding. In addition to Scooter Computer and the rarely seen ""The Weather Show,"" you get a behind the scenes look at the electoral college song, a Top 20 countdown of the best in the series, a puzzle game that features the songs, four music videos of the songs arranged by contemporary pop/rock groups, a feature on the Emmy Awards won by the series, commentary by the creators, and more.The navigation design of the DVD is superb. Only want to see the ""Multiplication Rock"" or ""America Rock"" toons? You can select the specific series you want, play all within a series, or pick each specific toon from a series. You can also choose to play all forty-six toons or just the ones chosen by fans as the top ones. There's a built-in shuffle feature as well. Every DVD should be this easy to navigate and use.Even the booklet that comes with this edition is helpful. The lyrics for the top ten toons are included as is the history of Schoolhouse Rock. A chapter breakdown is included at the end of the booklet.Schoolhouse Rock is virtually impervious to review due to its unbiquitous nature within a whole generation or two of Americans. The cleverness of the animation enlivens the topic discussed, not to mention holding the attention of young children. The songs are exceptionally catchy; I'm still amazed at how they managed to do such a great job marrying the Preamble of the Constitution with a hummable melody. Definitely a reflection of the musical styles of the day, songs like ""Verb: That's What's Happening"" (done in the style of the soundtrack of ""Shaft"") or ""The Preamble"" (70s Folk/Rock) capture the era perfectly. It makes those of us who grew up in those days misty-eyed for a return of that AM radio sound to today's music.If you have kids (or are just nostalgic at heart), this DVD is essential. I'm using it as homeschool material for our kids. When my son sings the songs, it's great to know another generation will appreciate the merits of Schoolhouse Rock. No question, this 30th anniversary edition of Schoolhouse Rock is truly worthy of five stars."	5.0	Part of the American Consciousness	2004-10-05	346	338	8

I prefer DVD, but whatever.My kids watch it all the time. I like it too. The songs are as fun. These clever rhymes are unforgettable, but unlike some annoying kid's songs, you don't really want to forget these.I really feel like my kids need to be informed about the Bible too, (whatever they choose to believe later), so I have also been thrilled that they made a CD and DVD calledScripture Rock.	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock Rocks my house!	2002-10-15	31	29	2

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A3OA1CBIQ275VM	David J. Neal	"Don't like the Disney commercials at the start? Hit the menu button just like the screen before the commercials tells you to. You go right to the good stuff.You know them, you loved them as a kid and if you actually remembered much of America Rock or Science Rock, you'd get a few Jeopardy questions the contestants miss. All the three-minute classics are here from the 1970s plus a couple that were done in the 1980s plus Money Rock, a series that appears to have been done in the 1990s PLUS a brand new Schoolhouse Rock on the electoral college. That's dual tasks as homage and lesson -- the son of one of the original animators worked on it and Jack Sheldon, the voice behind Conjunction Junction and I'm Just a Bill, sings on it.So what we've got here is one DVD set I'll call ""splendid"" if I may unpack an adjective. One little thing I love, just for the change of pace, is the slowed electronic piano version of ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly"" that plays when you're at the second menu on the disc. Something about it seems to match the wistfully nostaligic feel I get watching these (and I had this disc BEFORE my daughter came along).What's missing? Commentary by the creators. I'm a commentary junkie. To me, a dream summer is me spending every day doing nothing but sipping Long Island iced teas and watching director's/writer's/actors commentaries on my favorite movies and TV shows.OK, some of the Schoolhouse Rock creators have died, but those alive surely have some interesting stories about how they came up with these marvelous tunes and how they were able to get established artists such as Sheldon and Blossom Dearie (Figure Eight, Unpack Your Adjectives) into working with them.Also, while there's a Top Ten Jukebox, with the 10 greatest Schoolhouse Rock songs as chosen by an online poll, that's the only place you can really program songs to play in a particular order. The book with the DVD set has the lyrics only of these 10 songs. That's also where you get the only creator commentary, a brief Q&A; with George Newell.So it's missing. I'll live without it. The genius is still there and so is the magic."	4.0	Classic stuff missing only commentaryl	2006-12-17	5	5	0

The students are learning more at a greater pace and earlier in their lives. They truly are receiving a great education. However, I get the sense that some material is grazed over or skipped. School House rock is a fantastic way to give your children (and the adults in your life) reinforcement in the basics of education. Strengthen their educational foundation by putting this DVD in your player and letting it loop when the TV is not in use. The children will hear it, will stop and watch, and will absorb the information. I give this a high recommendation!	5.0	3 is a magic number...and so is this DVD!	2012-03-28	0	0	0

I know it got me and a few classmates to pass the Preamble test...sure we sang it but we passed.I like the option to see all of the songs in order (mild) or shuffled up (spicy). This makes learning fun for kids. We are very happy with this DVD. Plays great, cool songs, and the kids love it.	5.0	Conjunction Junction, what's your function?	2007-01-31	0	0	0
1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1BTPEXRTCZX52	"D. VESSELL ""aka David Vesel"""	"I can't explain -- nobody in my generation can, I don't think -- why Schoolhouse Rock worked so well.  Given the bizarre experiments being done on us in public schools -- forced busing, social promotions, ""new math"" -- we had to learn somewhere.  Fortunately, being really the first generation to be immersed in television, we dutifully spent our Saturday mornings in front of the tube and, if it happened to be ABC we were looking at, it involved Schoolhouse Rock shorts.  It's not an exaggeration to suggest that Generation X really learned the basics in 3-minute chunks.I bought this DVD almost on a whim, thinking, ""Hey it would be nice for my kids to see 'em, and I can be all nostalgic.""  What I didn't expect, sitting with my 3-year-old daughter Maggie, was the sheer visceral impact of flashing back to my childhood, getting all teary-eyed over the songs I recognized from the '70s, and watching with interest the clips from the '80s, when I was in high school and had started to outgrow the series (it ended in 1986, the same year I graduated).The content on this DVD deserves every star on the scale.  Yes, the presentation isn't perfect, but geez get over yourself!!  Ads have been on DVDs and videocassettes, even kids' videos, since when?  You're going to knock it down to 3 stars because you don't like ads and the menu layout?!?  Are you serious?Yes, what the previous reviewer said was true...the ads are annoying.  But they're not anything we haven't been seeing from Disney for years.  Yes, the menus are poorly organized, but I guess you needed a Schoolhouse Rock short on ""metaphors"", because you *can* play the entire thing at once.  It's labeled ""The Whole Enchilada"", at lower right, and it even gives you the option of playing them straight through as organized (Grammar Rock, Science Rock, Money Rock, etc.) or shuffled randomly.Do not be fooled by the previous review.  The actual content on this DVD set is all 5 stars.  More stars, if we were permitted.  Schoolhouse Rock is one of the defining cultural touchstones of Generation X, and this collection does it justice."	5.0	Where Generation X *REALLY* learned their stuff	2007-06-03	3	3	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1XC099UZR8591	"East West ""Don Quijotee"""	Criticisms of this program today reflect the many changes in our society but the project exemplifies a great creative work motivated by a sincere objective presented in a positive spirit. Only a few of these videos, such as The Checks in the Mail, may soon altogether lose their frame of reference, but the majority remain relevant and should remain relevant for many a decade more. Some of the images could be considered to portray negative stereotypes but the overwhelming spirit of this work is positive and encourages good discussions among children, parents and teachers. Some of the Christian and Islamic references (gospel music, Noah's ark, polygamy, etc.) may seem more sensitive topics by today's standards, but the overall impression is one of acceptance, family values and individual self-esteem.I admit nostalgia in purchasing these videos as much as a desire to teach my children, still, these decades' old cartoon music videos remain effect tools in teaching simple but important concepts. There are elementary lessons in grammar, multiplication, American independence and expansion, health and hygiene, basic government and money management, civil rights, etc. put to many musical styles such as soul, gospel, jazz, blues, folk, etc. The lyrics are clever, original and memorable, the music catchy and the messages are on-point. This is superior craftsmanship that is much more than retuning nursery rhymes. Best of all is that the CHILDREN `get it'!This collection contains two DVD's. The first contains reproductions of all the original music videos for all the original categories but with limited interaction and lesson. The second disk provides interactive activities. Some mouse functionality/interactivity failed after a short while requiring tab/enter to run programs. This is a failure of the disk programming functions but otherwise this is a solid product from Disney. And if not for the disk functionality issues and some consideration of content, this is a 5 star product and admittedly a rating of loving nostalgia as much as appreciation for the clever works of music and video.	4.0	Classic Rock for Elementary Schools with a 70's Feel	2012-02-05	1	1	0

It was really helpful for school.  It helped me to learn multiplication, social studies, language, science, all school subjects.  The best part was I learned without really feeling like I was learning.  I find that children learn easier if you put the information in a song.My [...] year old just watched in the the first time this morning and asked to watch it again.

I bought it today and had to pop it in.  These great animated shorts helped kids learn multiplication, science, grammar, american history and money. You want an explanation of our national debt? - watch Tyrannosaurus Debt :-).The first DVD has all the original shorts categorized by groups, you can play them by group, or play them all in order or play them all or shuffle.  If you choose a particular group, you can pick the ones you want to play in the playlist or select the Play All button.  I was having a blast seeing remembering how many of these I could still sing.The 2nd DVD is the Extra Credit portion of the set.  You can watch with Captions or Audio Commentary.  I really had fun with the ""Earn Your Diploma"" Trivia and the Arrange A Schoolhouse Rock song.  The Earn Your Diploma gives you a set of questions to answer to each group (Science, Money, etc).  When you get them all right, you get a clue which when you solve all the groups you can then solve the Master Jumble to become a Schoolhouse Rock Graduate.  The Arrange A Schoolhouse Rock Song has 3 of the Schoolhouse rock songs mixed up and its up to you to get the lyrics in order.  When you get them right, the song clip will play.  The music videos section was funny - the first 3 had the original animated shorts but the music/voices were redone by Better Than Ezra (""Conjunction Junction""), Lemonheads(""My Hero Zero"") and Deluxe Folk Implosion(""I'm Just A Bill"").  I didn't care for the last one by Goodness (""Electricity, Electricity"").  That was just a music video but that one doesn't take away from the rest of the DVD.I saw one review here getting a little too deep in reviewing the american group.  I say, don't worry about it - these were meant to help kids learn and I can say they definitely did me good.  This collection was well done and it's worth the price :-)"	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock totally rocks!	2003-01-25	6	6	0

I'm so happy to have this. It brings back memories from my youth and I realize now that I was unconsciously absorbing the lessons. There is also a plus of having jazz performers Blossom Dearie and Grady Tate and future Broadway writers like Lynn Ahrens performing the scores (rock in the title is a bit of a misnomer.)Thirty years later, the songs are still hummable (Figure 8 is a beautiful song for all ages) and the lessons still apply. I bought this set for my 5 and 8 year old cousins and they love it. They're also ahead of their class in English and Math and I'm sure this set has something to do with it. So the Seventies weren't all bad.Now if only I could get Electric Company on DVD.	5.0	Conjunction, junction what's that function?	2003-01-29	0	0	0

These songs helped to define our generation, and you could probably pick any random young adult, and he would be able to hum or any sing one of these tunes!  I am SO glad that schoolhouse rock is out on DVD. I have the VHS tapes from a decade ago, but it's nice to have all the songs (49 total, just about) together. Some of my favorites were Conjunction Junction, Interplanet Janet, Sufferin' Till Suffrage, Elbow Room, Figure Eight, I'm Just a Bill, The Preamble (I can still recite the US Constitution's preamble thanks to this!), A Noun is a Person/Place/Thing, Shot Heard around the World, and A Victim of Gravity. Everyone will have their own favorites!The DVD is a 2DVD set. The 1st one has 49 songs, which can be listened to individually, by subject matter, and all together. You can even choose up to 10 songs (or repeat a few) to be played. My favorite method is the random jukebox, which plays random songs - you never know what's going to be played next, just like on the old ABC saturday morning cartoon days. The 2nd DVD has a ""lost"" song, a new song, 3 forgotten computer songs, a few featurettes, commentaries on a bunch of songs. There's also a trivia game - kinda fun, and it unlocks a mini-song. Also a few fun easter eggs around. All in all, it's a fun disc to look over, and the kids will like it, too. There's even a top 20 songs shuffle count-down, too.I'm glad I have this DVD.

I'm sure she will have even more appreciation of the wit and educational value of this video as she gets older. The Playlist feature is great! I love the options you are given in using this DVD. The only complaint I have is the over the top number of Disney promos at the beginning. I can see having one preview, but the number they place at the beginning is unnecessary, stupid and annoying.	5.0	A Must Have DVD	2009-09-04	0	0	0

And more importantly, the lessons that are learned by the end of each song are way cool.Perhaps I am stuck back in my childhood days; but I am looking forward to sharing this with my 1 1/2 year old daughter.  Each song has a way with sneaking in something educational without the child realizing the true value.  Before you know it, your kid is singing along and saying ""Hey!

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	"Until recently cartoons were largely created for children and confined to Saturday mornings.  In the 1970s, ABC television network developed a series of educational shorts that were sponsored by major advertisers.  Known as SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!, the series consisted of three-minute cartoons that described multiplication, grammar, and American history and government.  In the late 1970s another set of shorts about science was added; still more came in the 1990s and after 2000.The most famous of these shorts are the originals, which are unexpectedly clever.  Each short is set to music and the lyrics are easy to remember, and anyone who grew up in the 1970s should recall most of them and have their own favorites.  The multiplication shorts are perhaps the least memorable of the original--there's only so much you can do with the multiplication tables--but ""Naughty Number Nine"" and ""Little Twelvetoes"" are surprisingly entertaining.  The grammar shorts include several very famous titles, such as ""Conjunction Junction,"" and (inspired by the looming bicentennial) American history pops with everything from the Preamble to Sufferage.One of the most interesting things about the series is that it shows us how we have changed since the shorts aired.  Pluto is described as a planet; the nervous system is described as telegraph wires.  The videos strive to be inclusive, but the only minority that receives significant play is African American; at least one character smokes; and the whole thing has a distinctly Judeo-Christian slant.  The music itself is also of the period, and whether blues or folk or rock, the entire thing has a distinctly New York funky feel.The collection does not include everything produced under the SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! banner--there's nothing from the ""Earth Rock"" series and a number of individual titles (usually the more recent ones) are left out.  Whatever the case, it's certainly fun to revisit these shorts--but when they are played back to back they become somewhat wearing.  SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK is probably best viewed in small chunks.  I'm not sure how often adults will return to the collection, and it's difficult to know how modern kids will take it, whether they will mentally tune in or out.  Even so, it's enjoyable, if only as nostalgia.  Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"	4.0	Get Your Adverbs Here	2013-08-05	1	1	0

There is something wonderful about singing through what one learns. Now if school lessons were musicals, I think more students would remember their subjects better. School House Rocks gets this concept. Sometimes, I catch myself singing Conjunction Junction while running around town.

On this first disc is all the SHR songs ever aired as well as a choosing to play all the math ones, or all the grammar ones, etc. You can also choose to play all the songs. However, the songs will play in the order of type, though, not in order of their air date. It's not that big of a complaint for me, though. I personally liked playing them individually, but if you're ever in the mood to play a series of songs, then there's always that option, too. And to answer the other complaint of one of the spotlight reviews, you can easily skip over the trailers by hitting the ""menu"" button on your DVD remote.The second disc has a ton of specials, such as the collection of the not as well known ""Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips"" episodes, a Nike commercial featuring music from ""3 is a Magic Number"" and new animation when pressing on random things on the menu screen like the water faucet or light switch. There's also the latest SHR song about the electoral voting system.The only major complaint I can think of is ""how come the footage wasn't remastered?"" Disney's been releasing their older movies remastered, so you think they'd do the same with this series as well. Regardless, the music videos are still watchable, but you can definitely tell that they could have been improved upon, especially when comparing the brightness with the later ""money rock"" songs.As for how effective the songs are to viewers, I still think this was one of the best ways I was able to learn about some stuff way back when. But the key factor for how effective this stuff will be to your kids all depends on what they're interested in. For those of you showing these to students, I suggest showing them to the younger kiddies who haven't been as affected by the dribble on TV.All in all, this is a pretty good set that has better than average special features."	4.0	Could've been better	2007-04-06	25	25	0

You get all 46 Schoolhouse Rock songs here, including the long lost song ""The Weather Show"".  These songs are wonderful, charming, tuneful, and simply gorgeous.  Unlike most current children's programming, which is incredibly dumbed down, this series isn't.  Adults can watch it and appreciate it just as much as kids can.  It doesn't talk down to children.  Children are not as dumb as people think they are.  It doesn't have that overly commercial feel that a lot of programming does today.  I love seeing and hearing Three is a Magic Number, the adverb song, the noun song, pronouns, telegraph line, etc., etc..  The only songs I didn't care for were the money rock ones, probably because they were done relatively recently, and they're too slick and modern.  They don't have the charm of the earlier stuff.  I'm glad that no one has tried to remake this series.  It would be a travesty.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	In this captivating collection of Schoolhouse Rock! you get all the old favorites ranging from My Hero, Zero to Little Twelvetoes.  There are also great grammar numbers like Conjuntion Junction and Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get Your Adverbs Here, as well as mini civics lessons such as I'm Just A Bill and a new one on the electoral college, I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College, which adults could learn a little about as well.  Bob Dorough composed and sang many of the songs, but you also hear Blossom Dearie and The Lemonheads among others.  Of course what makes this collection special is that you have all the animated pieces to go along with the songs, which provided valuable fillers between Saturday morning cartoons all those years ago.  Too bad The Cartoon Channel didn't pick up on these animated classics, instead of Disney, as it would make the viewing experience a little less mind-numbing for children.  So, I bought this collection to fill in the gaps.	5.0	Who says learning isn't fun?	2006-07-31	4	3	1

I was hooked from ""Conjunction Junction"" and never stopped being a fan.We like to play this DVD in the mornings, selecting the ""spicy"" version, which plays the songs in random order. Our children watch it as they have breakfast.This makes me happy for two reasons:1. I know the catchy songs will help them learn, just as they did for me;2. and, because my kids can enjoy this DD instead of being bombarded by TV commercials.We actually rented this DVD from Netflix first to see if our kids were going to like it.

These cartoonish music videos that lasted less than five minutes somehow managed to teach us concepts that required dedicated lesson plans in school. This is the essence of Schoolhouse Rock.I'm a parent now, and I still haven't seen anything on TV that comes close to the clever way educational concepts are integrated into the lyrics and music. Each song addresses a single topic, but the range of subjects include American History, science, numbers, grammar, and money.

There are some challenging trivia games and other oddities included as well, making this a well-rounded archive, but there are some curious omissions.I'll unpack ""frustrating"" first. There is a top 20 list of SHR songs on disc 2, presumably from the on-line vote prior to this collection's release. Why not list all 46 with their vote totals/percentages? Why is this list on disc 2 and not on disc 1 as a play list option? There are also some fairly interesting (but not too revealing) commentaries for a couple of handfuls of tunes on disc 2. Why are these commentaries not on disc 1, and why not for all of the songs? Only 3 of the original 4 Scooter Computer songs are included, and the long-lost ""Weather Show"" is obviously edited. A history of the failed Scooter Computer series would have been nice, as would an explanation of why the ""Weather Show"" was pulled from circulation and then edited for this release. These items were omitted, but the Nike commercial was included? What were they thinking?!Don't let my griping turn you off. This set does contain a lot of nice touches, including some hidden features. Be sure to complete the trivia challenge for a special treat!

Finally in one place, all of the Schoolhouse Rocks that we know and love, as well as some that we may have forgotten or not loved (I don't remember Money Rock). For the completist, all of the rocks are there, including the newly released ""Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips"" set that are fun, but truly seem dated. You can go to specific titles, or hit the highlights with the Top 10 Jukebox - great for jumping into the CD.A brand new Schoolhouse Rock is included - ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"" about the Electoral College. It's interesting and in the style of our favorites, but it lacks some of the pizzazz of the originals. I suppose it's very topical after the 2000 election, but I just don't see it having the fun of education that things like ""Suffering until Suffrage"" did.They could have stopped here with just all 46 original songs, but luckily for us the bonuses are fantastic. Music Videos as an outgrowth of the Schoolhouse Rocks! Rocks CD of artists interpreting their favorite songs. See how much you really remember in the trivia quiz.

I hadn't heard some of them since the mid 1970s but they came back to me instantaneously.  I remember Bill the bill waiting to become law, the nouns, electricity, interjections, and the rest.The entire concept was unique (though remember in the 1970s the FCC had more control over television content as they do now).  But nowadays television commercial time is far more valuable than actually teaching the kids something.  Without sounding too much liike George Carlin, I do believe the people who control our televisions have no desire to actually educate their viewers.  They just want to sell stuff, crap we don't really need.But back to the subject at hand.  These are short, simple lessons on how grammer, our government, science, and financial systems work.  They overlook some deatils in some of the segments, but the general point is well made.  I recommend this DVD to anyone with small children or those not so small children who want to relive a piece of their own past.	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock	2008-03-08	0	0	0

I didn't pay good money for the privilege of having Di$ney jam additional advertising down my throat and that of my toddler.Second, and somewhat less offensively, the organization of the individual vignettes through a ""jukebox"" menu function is somewhat interesting, but not very well implemented.  Yes, it's kind of fun that there are menu seletions to watch just the ""grammar"" episodes or just the ""math"" episodes, or whatever. But you'd think, wouldn't you, that there'd be a plain old ""watch 'em all from start to finish"" option wouldn't you?  But no.The latter is a minor quibble.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	ADEETJWRKD6OA	"J. Moran ""aralim"""	"This is a great DVD containing all of the original songs we grew up with during our Saturday morning cartoon days. It's just as entertaining and catchy as it was in the early 70's, and if my daughter's any indication even children as young as 2 will find it enjoyable.What surprised me when I saw the list of songs was that there were many that I had never seen. In particular, all seven money songs didn't get on the air before I stopped watching cartoons, so there was actually new stuff (from my perspective, anyway ;-D).You can play the songs in a few ways. First, you can go to the Play List and select songs by their group -- grammar, science, history, money, multiplication. There's also an option called ""The Whole Enchilada"" which will play all 46 songs. Depending on the style you choose (""mild"" or ""spicy""), the songs either play back in order by group or in a random shuffle.There's also an option called ""Jukebox"", but this was deceptive. Instead of letting you pick any set of songs you want, you can only pick from the top ten songs (as determined by the publisher based on viewer feedback from years ago).My daughter just turned two in September, and she loves to watch the Grammar Rock set. Within two days of seeing it, she was singing the chorus of ""Interjections!"" (as well as a two-year old can sing, that is ;D). I don't know if it's mainly due to this or just the rate her language skills are naturally developing, but her use of pronouns has greatly improved in the last couple of months and that song is another of her favorites in the Grammar set.The other sections are moderately advanced for her age (especially multiplication rock and money rock), so she's not so interested in those yet. Surprisingly, she loves to watch ""Suffering Until Suffrage"" in the America Rock set -- probably because of the music.The bonus materials DVD is OK, but apart from the Emmy section it's mainly fluff. The Scooter Computer and Mister Chips set is the one set of songs that's visibly dated, just by virtue of the subject matter. And I'm not sure why they called ""The Weather Show"" a lost song -- I clearly remember seeing that on Saturday mornings, which means they had to have been playing it pretty regularly. Maybe it was ""lost"" from the Science Rock VHS tape, but then why not just put it in that set on the DVD?Overall, a definite 5-star buy!"	5.0	25 years later, it's still great.

[you will have to check it out yourself]I remember these from my childhood so was surprised when my daughter's 4th grade teacher suggested them to help with learning multiplication. I must admit I was a bit worried that it would be too dated or that my daughter would find it silly and reject them.  Was I surprised, she LOVED it! We sat down and watched all of the math videos in one evening, pausing to explain to her hidden tidbits that I never noticed as a child myself.  All of a sudden it started clicking for her, she could make patterns with the numbers! Now, math isn't so boring for her. She also spent a sick day watching the Science, Language and History sets. She loved ""Interplanet Janet"" even though she noticed some of the old science was no longer valid, she just made sure to bring me up-to-date with the 21st century facts. LOLThe caution on this product is that it was designed a few decades ago, when smoking was still acceptable and so was Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve and a family that includes both a mother and a father.

Nepali is so different that I have a hard time even deciphering the sentence structure. Nepali sentence structure difficult is.I cranked up Schoolhouse Rock on the laptop and it was a whole new ballgame (so to speak). They loved the preamble to the Constitution. They kinda liked ""Fireworks."" The scene illustrating the ""pursuit of happiness"" with the male colonist chasing the female colonist across the screen led to a lot of puzzled looks, but that's a concept that's hard to explain to people who come from class-ridden, authoritarian regimes. We spent two class periods on it.The music in the videos simply disarmed them. Suddenly they were having fun rather than just rote-memorizing the answers to 100 questions. I think the favorite is probably ""I'm just a bill."" When you come from a country ruled from the top by ukase, the idea that a new law is hammered out by so many people is very new indeed.For you folks who say all immigrants should automatically learn English ... they pretty much agree. They have a separate English class, but even so the citizenship class spends about half our time working on English.Oh, and the song about the ""shot heard round the world""?

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A10G4BPT5MGBHY	Julie Neal	"Nifty! This DVD has eight different ""Play All"" options! You, I mean your child (this IS for your kid, right?), can choose to watch all 46 shorts in chronological order; all in random order; watch only the ones themed to grammar, math, money, science or American history and government; or watch only the Top 10 ""Schoolhouse Rock"" classics (such ""Conjuction Junction,"" ""Three is Magic Number"" and ""I'm Just a Bill."")And cherry-picking is just what this set needs, because, frankly, this is a hit-and-miss collection. Some of these shorts are indeed classics (and hold up perfectly well today); others are, frankly, downright lame. But taken in small, hand-selected doses, this 2-disc set can be a great way to introduce, or reinforce, subjects your child is learning in school. Most of the songs are catchy, most of the lessons are simple and clear. An aspiring artist, my daughter also loved the sweet, simple animation, especially in the early shorts. The letters and numbers are drawn by hand. And the solids! Apparently colored in frame-by-frame with a Flair pen, their shading jumps around frame-by-frame -- just like that on early ""Sesame Street"" segments.(Please take my comments with a grain of salt, as I was one of the original ""Schoolhouse Rock"" addicts. Every Saturday morning I had the same routine: plop myself down in front of the TV and watch hour after hour of cartoons. At the end of each show were these cute little shorts -- the same cute little shorts I had seen the week before, and the week before that, and the week before that, drilling lyrics into my young brain such as -- sing them with me -- ""Conjunction Junction, what's your function?"" or ""Lolly, lolly, lolly get your adverbs here!"")Good or bad, you get a lot for your money, more than three-and-a-half-hours of material. The shorts include:MULTIPLICATION ROCK""My Hero, Zero""""Elementary, My Dear""""Three Is a Magic Number""""The Four-Legged Zoo""""Ready Or Not, Here I Come""""I Got Six""""Lucky Seven Sampson""""Figure Eight""""Naughty Number Nine""""The Good Eleven""""Little Twelvetoes""GRAMMAR ROCK""Unpack Your Adjectives""""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, Get Your Adverbs Here""""Conjunction Junction""""Interjections!""""Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla""""Verb: That's What's Happening""""A Noun Is a Person, Place or Thing""""Busy Propositions""""The Tale of Mr. Morton""AMERICA ROCK""No More Kings""""Fireworks""""The Shot Heard 'Round the World""""The Preamble""""Elbow Room""""The Great American Melting Pot""""Mother Necessity""""Sufferin' Till Suffrage""""I'm Just a Bill""""Three-Ring Government""SCIENCE ROCK""The Body Machine""""Do the Circulation""""Electricity, Electricity""""The Energy Blues""""Interplanet Janet""""Telegraph Line""""Them Not-So-Dry Bones""""A Victim of Gravity""""The Weather Song""MONEY ROCK""Dollars and Sense""""Seven-Fifty Once a Week""""Where the Money Goes""""Tax Man Max""""Walkin' on Wall Street""""This for That""""Tyrannosaurus Debt""""The Check's in the Mail""NEW SHORT""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College""Bonus features include a previously unreleased ""Scooter Computer"" and ""Mr. Chips"" four-song set; a behind-the-scenes look at a new song (""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College""), a few video games, an Emmy Awards featurette, even a Nike commercial featuring ""Three Is a Magic Number.""Should you buy it?

All of the original crew from schoolhouse rock was involved, except the original animator, but his son does a wonderful job.

Who doesn't learn better when information is put to music.  The multiplication rock section is fantastic, not only because the child can learn through music, but the songs are the kind that stay in your head all day.

But just reading the list of videos that are on this tape, I see them flash right before my eyes. Therefore, I feel perfectly qualified to review this product for you.  I don't quite know what I would have done without Schoolhouse Rock.  Well, maybe not Grammar Rock, although those were some of my favorites (""Conjunction Junction, what's your function?"").  But I know that when I come up against a problem in my adult life that forces me to multiply an odd combination,  like 13 and 7, I immediately go back to a skater telling me ""Now here's a chance to brush up on your new math tricks, 'cause 8 times 12 is the same as 10 times 8 plus 2 times 8...80 plus 16, 96!""  And when the MSM has me totally discombobulated about what's happening with the law that was supposed to be passed last year about the Hossenpfeffers not killing off the Bellywhackers, suddenly I find myself singing to myself ""I'm just a bill, yes I'm only a bill..."" and I remember the process.  And how long it can take!  (Now, you have to understand, teachers for babyboomers took special classes on how to make history and civics as boring as possible.  So Schoolhouse Rock and Little House on the Prairie were our only exposure to what our past was like.  Accurate or not.)These videos are timeless.  All kids can benefit from learning about multiplication and grammar.  All kids in the US can benefit from learning about incidents in history such as when women got the vote (""Oh we were sufferin', until suffer-age!"") and the signing of the Declaration of Independence; as well as how our tripartate system of government works.

They helped you learned the definition of a noun, the appropriate interjection to use when you're happy, and the process of becoming a bill on Capital Hill!  Wasn't it great being a kid in the late 70's?!  Ah, the good ol' days when WE were kids...!This collection is on two discs (our family uses the first disc the most, which contains all of the songs).  It has been such a delight singing along and reliving some of the fun moments had while watching Saturday morning cartoons.  The tracks can be played according to topic (history, mathematics, grammar, etc), shuffled, or from top to tail.  There is even an a fun trivia game and puzzle, and a sort of BEHIND THE MUSIC history of Schoolhouse Rock.Of course, the tunes and animations appeal to today's kids, making this a great gift for child and adult, alike.	5.0	We the people, in order to form a more perfect union...	2004-07-26	2	2	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A3KN5JAFNGNTRT	"kresnels ""kresnels"""	"Just on the strength of the material alone, this DVD is a must-have for parents who grew up with these terrific, educational animations. The great shame is that most people only remember ""Conjunction Junction"" - ""3 Is A Magic Number,"" ""A Noun Is A Person Place or Thing,"" ""Interjections!"" """"Ready Or Not, Here I Come"" and the classic ""I'm Just A Bill"" - if you heard these only once as a child, you'll be surprised at how much you retained. While the animation is very limited, adults and children alike will love watching Schoolhouse Rock.This DVD goes one step further, however: you can pick a mode in which to play the classics. You can play them by group (Grammar Rock, Multiplication Rock, etc.) or you can play the top ten favorites (voted on by fans - I'm only upset I didn't get to put my vote in for VERB) or you can shuffle play the whole disc. This feature naturally wouldn't be desirable on another DVD, but here ... what a great feature.Great educational material; great, intelligent songwriting, and an entire extra disc of supplemental material.

I wondered if there was a way to expose my daugther to the songs to let her enjoy them too.  I found a CD collection at a local store, but when I searched on Amazon and saw the DVD with EVERY Schoolhouse Rock video ever made, I had to have it! (Interjection)She loves the CD's and the DVD.  The DVD allows for great flexibility in playing her favorite songs, in whichever order she desires.  As she is 2 1/2, that means playing ""Loli, Loli, Loli"", and ""Conjunction Junction"" over-and-over again.There is also a nice section of bonus material which has a voice over interview with the creators of Schoolhouse Rock discussing the videos you are watching.My only complaint centers around the America Rock group of videos.  A history lesson addressed to primarily white children of the 70's, really looks like a white-washing of history in today's more ethnically aware society.  ""Elbow Room"" and the other America Rock videos don't address the more troubling parts of America's past (i.e. the treatment of native Americans and of slaves).  Really, these are impossible issues for funny video's to cover, so I would have suggested leaving the history part out.Overall, these videos are wonderful.  I'm not sure how much I learned from them, but they are a lot of fun and if my daughter is any indication, a entirely new generation of kids will embrace them as well."	4.0	Schoolhouse Rock!	2002-11-29	18	5	13

Admittedly, the animation in these pieces tend to be rather simplistic, and a bit of the animation is reused in them, the catchiness of many of these songs more than make up for this.  Besides, the simplistic animation is what gives these segments their distinctiveness uniqueness.The first disc contains all 46 segments that were produced (which include both the segments produced in Schoolhouse Rock's original run, and the newer segments that were produced when Schoolhouse Rock returned to television in 1994).  It also includes the song ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College,"" which was a new song when this set was released in 2002.  This disc also has a play all feature, a shuffle all feature, and a top ten jukebox (the top ten jukebox includes ""Conjunction Junction,"" ""I'm Just A Bill,"" ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here!,"" ""Electricity, Electricity,"" ""Interjections!,"" ""The Preamble,"" ""Three Is A Magic Number,"" ""Interplanet Janet,"" ""A Noun Is A Person, Place Or Thing,"" and ""The Shot Heard 'Round The World"").The second disc contains a lot of bonus material.  There is the long-lost song, ""The Weather Song,"" three of the ""Scooter Computer And Mr. Chips"" segments, a behind-the-scenes of ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College,"" a top twenty countdown, four music videos by contemporary artists, and Emmy Awards featurette, the Nike commercial that features ""Three Is A Magic Number,"" audio commentaries, and another copy of ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College.""  In addition to these features, there is the ""Earn Your Diploma"" trivia game (where the user answers questions pertaining to the topics covered in the Schoolhouse Rock segments) amd arrange-a-song puzzles.  For the puzzles, there is an easy puzzle, and medium puzzle, and a hard puzzle.  For each puzzle, the viewer watches a short clip of a segment.  After it airs, there are screen shots put on the screen.  You select each one to hear the audio that goes with it, and you have to arrange the screen shots in the right order.Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD release, and my kids really enjoy the songs.  My youngest, who can be rather squirmy, has been known to put the first disc in and watch all of the songs on shuffle play and sitting still the whole time.  I would really recommend this DVD release to parents, because kids really seem to get an enjoyment out of these songs and segments.  I would even recommend this set to members of Generation X who don't have children to have in their collection for the sake of nostalgia.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband and I purchased."	5.0	All of the classic Schoolhouse Rock segments in one set	2010-11-20	1	1	0

We were all walking around singing our favorites. (Mine is Mr. Morton.) Then when it came time for our oldest to memorize his multiplication facts for school it came in handy again. My kids teachers both asked to borrow it and started using it in class for language arts, math, and social studies. You can select individual songs, songs in groups, all the songs in order, or all the songs randomly.  So we decided that we would buy copies for them as classroom gifts. They loved it and have told us they use it for instruction and center time.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1Q6WVYCFE0RNQ	"Literature Lady ""Marie"""	I technically grade this 4.5 stars :-)! Had real & modern day schools rocked on this unique path of learning, we'd be fun loving, rhythmically generous/genius. I remember as a child thinking it was a blip or an extra commercial before the morning cartoons continued. It's not hung up on who's the best teacher but WHAT'S the best teacher with everyone participating! It affords you the luxury of seeing it, singing it, repeating it, moving or dancing it, enjoying it and then behold, learning & understanding it! Be it about grammar, multiplication, science, money, voting or America. It was so fun to watch the Special 30th Anniversary Edition dvd afer not seeing or hearing the songs since the 70's and singing (eyebrows raised) with the characters as enthusiastically as back then...educational fun, WOW, that's a positive impact! And the dvd's are user friendly, interesting and came with a keepsake booklet featuring a short interview with one of the creators displaying a (dated ha ha) photo, chapter index and lyrics to the top ten Schoolhouse Rock tunes. This is a definite keeper, pardon me, gift for children who are at ease with school/teaching or for those who find it a challenge or worse a bore! My two dvd's arrived in great condition.

The only complaint (and the reason I didn't grade this DVD 5 stars), is the number of menus you have to go through to get the DVD to play all the vignettes in a row.  It's great that the DVD is structured so you can pick out which ones you want to play, but with over 260 minutes of vignettes, I don't know too many people that are going to use their arrow keys to pick and choose their way through the TWO discs it comes with.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A2W00XKTTF1G0Z	"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa..."	"SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK is a fantastic collection of the musical education tools I group up with starting in 1972. (Am I dating myself?) These are great ways for young kids (and adults) to learn science, math history and grammar in a way that creators Radford Stone, David McCall, George Newall, Bob Dorough and Jack Sheldon never thought would be as lasting or revolution. I made it through social studies and history thanks to the tunes of the `Preamble', ""The Shot Heard Round The World', `Sufferin' Till Suffrage', `I'm Just A Bill' and `The Three Ring Government'.If you don't know what I am talking about these are basic, yet clever, animated shorts that use music to teach you the ins and outs of government, science, multiplication, grammar and even money. They are cleverly written and organized. The DVD has them sectioned off into their various categorized, but you can run them all, play them randomly or play the top ten - whatever you want to do.The Extras are very good. You can watch with the captions and sign-a-long or even program only the ones you want to see. Michael Eisner even introduces the Making Of the newest cartoon - I'm going to `Send Your Vote To College'. There is the original Emmy Award Broadcast where they received their 4 awards (over Sesame Street).  There is also the Scooter and Mr. Chips series of Schoolhouse Rocks. The commentary is great, listening to the creators talk about the production, voices and music they used.There are even modern day music videos of the songs that made them famous. This is a must for every family with kids. Watch it with your kids and sing-a-long and you'll have a great time too! Really this is worth every dollar!

I still hear former students humming the tunes from ""Conjuction Junction"" to ""Three is a Magic Number"" in other classrooms.  This series may appear dated to some but, students in the elementary grades hum right along with the music and will watch the video over and over again.  The Grammar Rock video still teaches the basic parts of speech to students and I am still discovering things about the parts of speech to use in daily language instruction.  The segments are short enough to be used by themselves for mini-lessons.  The only complaint from the students is on the Multiplication Rock video about the number 8.  They think this segment is too slow and boring.  However, they do laugh at 'Mr. Twelve Toes'.  The Science and Social Studies videos in this series still hold the students' attention and provide an entertaining way for students to learn about government and elementary science.

If you watch all of them at once it does go on for quite a long time, but it's nice because as we play we can listen to it and then it's still there to watch when we're ready for more down time.  Great nostalgia and our son really loves the music, so we're hoping it will hold his interest long enough for him to start learning some from it, too.  The only thing about this collection is that I don't think we've ever once watched whatever is on the second dvd, we really only wanted it for the original songs anyway so while it's not that big a deal, I do feel it could have been cheaper to have just left that out.	5.0	Great Collection!	2011-10-11	0	0	0

The animation may be of a lower quality than we've become used to, but the lyrics and music are incredible.  I haven't been able to stop singing ""Sufferin' til Suffrage"" and ""Rufus Xavier Sasparilla"".  I recieved the DVDs as a gift and a dozen of us sat down (during a party) and watched these wonderful animated gems.

I remember waking up on a Saturday morning and singing along.  Not really knowing that I was learning.  Schoolhouse Rock has been a great learning exprience for myself and my brother and sister.  Even though I have no children of my own, I bought this product for a friend of mine grandson. He is only two years old, she tells me that he already knows that song to Conjunction Junction.  My all time favorite is The Bill.  That song help me pass the constitution in the eight grade.  I had to remember what the bill was for on the test.  Not to Toot my own horn but I aced the test.  So if anyone who isnt entirely convenced in buying this product.  Do so it will help your children out alot.  And the good thing about it is that they wont even know that they are learning until it is to late.	5.0	30 Years and Still Rocking	2007-09-01	5	4	1

If you grew up somewhat annoyed by these frequent PSA's that seemed to always get in the way of Dungeons & Dragons and so forth, but found yourself one day years later humming School House Rock on the subway, then this is definitely for you!Quite frankly, this is one of the best designed DVD packages available.  It's a two-disc set with all the making-of stuff and over two hours of memory lane fodder that had me laughing out loud.  There's a ton of material here that stretches well beyond the years I watched SHR, so not all of it will necessarily be as memorable to everyone.  There's a jukebox feature that lets you play all the tracks in random order, or you can watch them by category; grammar rock, math rock, science rock, etc.Some of the material strikes me as remarkably heady for ten-year-olds which is what SHR was initially designed for.  There's a math tune entitled ""Hey Little 12 Toes"" which discusses base-12 math.  The government lessons revel in obvious political biases which are really quite charming and clever, regardless of your politics.The only criticism I have is that there weren't recurring characters, which in my opinion worked against the potential for greater popularity among kids that were ""forced"" to view this stuff while waiting for cartoons.  This is so minor that it's barely worth noting however.Eventually the networks abandoned the Saturday morning institution that stretched back to the 50's in favor of extended lite-news coverage.  Any extant cartoon production was outsourced to things like Nickelodeon [Nick Jr.] or left for the cable networks such as the Cartoon Network to gobble up...and thus began my disdain for corporate America [haha].In general, the School House Rock Anniversary DVD is absolutely wonderful from start to finish and is a superlative reminder of that forgotten shared experience we all knew as Saturday morning cartoons.5/5"	5.0	Perpetual Saturday morning!	2003-01-21	4	4	0

I purchased this tape for my young nieces and nephews convinced that ""School House Rock"" would prove to be a fun and easy way for them to learn about key U.S. historical events, elements of grammar and basic mathematics.  The arrival of the tape triggered a flood of memories. The words to my favorite episodes, ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Verb"" and ""Bill"" begin to spill forth as if I were eight years old sitting in front of the television captivated by the music and colorful characters that make up each episode.  Well, I had to open the box and play the tape, just to make sure there were no manufacturers defects (O.K., so that's what I told myself as I excitedly opened the package that is to be a Christmas gift for the little ones).  After getting through a series of Disney advertisements, I was greeted with images and songs that were a critical component of my childhood.  I soon found myself singing along and acting out parts.  I was surprised at how much I'd remembered (had learned) and how entertaining the episodes are.  All of a sudden, I'm making long distance calls to friends reminiscing, singing, laughing, and being young again.This is a perfect gift for kids.  Anything that makes learning so much fun that the student doesn't know he's learning is worth remembering and passing on. I didn't fully appreciate how much I'd learned from ""School House Rock"" until I was well into adulthood.  The music rocks, and the lyrics are superb.

The graphics in the Americana portions bring visualizations that are impossible in the books schools use and the key points in Grammar ('a noun is a person, place or thing', the exclamation point vs. comma in &#34;Interjections&#34;, etc) stick very, very well.

We popped the DVD in early that morning and danced and sang around the house for the 4 days that I was in town.  My sister and I had a blast.Schoolhouse Rock originally aired on ABC in the early 70's in between cartoons on Saturday morning TV.  Although I recognized back then that these were educational cartoons, I only just realized how much knowledge I truly absorbed once I saw the DVD at Christmas.  The rules of grammer that I now spat verbatim when asked a writing question clearly came from what I learned from watching SHR in the 70s.  I'd previously thought I learned these things in school somewhere between elementary education and earning my BA in English.  Apparently, I was wrong.I would recommend this DVD to everyone; but, especially those who grew up with them or have small children.  The songs and cartoons are timeless.  I agree that the Disney advertisements are annoying but not enough to change my rating of the DVD overall.  As the distributor, it is only natural that Disney would seek to promote their other videos and movies.  Just ""fast-forward"" the DVD.  You'll be in for loads of fun once you finally arrive at the SHR menu and can access Grammer Rock, Multiplication Rock, America Rock, Science Rock and more."	5.0	5+ Stars despite the annoying Disney advertisements	2008-01-18	0	0	0

Then sitting at dinner a month later my 8 year old daughter was complaining about learning her 5's on the multiplication table. I tried to explain a trick to her but wasn't doing very well. So after dinner we sat down with the multiplication songs and after 2 minutes of watching ""Ready or Not Here I Come"" (multiplying by 5's) she yelled,""I get it! Now lets do 6's!"" The next day she went to school and made a 100 on her math test! Amazing!I took the DVD to school to show our 8th grade history teacher all the history songs which she had never seen. She was so excited to hear the ""Preamble"" song, she asked how she could get her hands on the set.I so remember singing the Preamble in Senior Government as I had to write it for a test along with all my other classmates.

I grew up with Schoolhouse Rock, but to be honest I thought about it only when my husband and I laughed nostalgicly about memorable songs like Conjunction Junction.  Then, he bought the 30th anniversary edition for our daughter (he was trying to qualify for free shipping when he was buying the Tripletts of BelleVille!).  So, it can be said that neither of us anticipated how fantastic this DVD would be -- STILL!  My 3 year old LOVES it, and I can't say enough great things about the creative lyrics that teach grammar, numbers and how the body works (maybe I should reach into my bag of adjectives, which my daughter charmlingly calls ""magictives"").  It is the one DVD we own that I don't feel any apprehension about evil or scary characters, dark plots or questionable character influences (which are startling present in many videos for preschoolers).If you're wondering about getting this video, wonder no more.

(Special 30th Anniversary Edition) from Amazon. I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality of the DVD from Amazon. This DVD offers access to dozens of Schoolhouse Rock! songs that are fun for school-aged children to learn, sing, and dance along with. The DVD was available to me for only a couple dollars. I couldn't believe I'd found such a great teaching tool for under five bucks. I love reaching my students from all different areas in a variety of different ways. Each child enjoys the songs as if they were bowls of ice cream. The best part about the Schoolhouse Rock! songs are that, each song teaches various aspects of lessons, in great detail, that children need to know. The DVD was delivered within a few days and was in such great condition that it looked brand new.	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock Really ROCKS!!!	2013-01-07	0	0	0

He loves it and watches it every morning before school. He chooses to watch it over Nickelodeon and CN. After he watches one or two videos, we discuss them and later, we sing them. He has already learned heaps of math, grammar and US history. The latter is important because we live in Japan and I'm trying to see that he learns about his ""other"" nation. I also want to see him maintain his English as the school system pours more and more Japanese on him. School House Rock achieves all of these goals and more.

When I discovered that the entire collection had been released, I told my wife that I wanted to get it for our two sons. (In truth, it was as much if not more for me than for them!) Being the sentimental fool that I am, I sat up for three hours after everyone had gone to bed and watched every single one of them. Hearing the tunes that helped define my childhood literally brought tears to my eyes. It took me straight back to those Saturday mornings in the late 70 in front of the television, the smell of breakfast coming from the kitchen....sorry, got carried away!

I remembered them fondly from my childhood.  So, I just knew my almost 9 y/o son would love it.  When we first played it, he was less than thrilled.  His first reaction to things is generally like that.  However, he has played the songs numerous times and I often find him dancing around the house while singing them.  An even bigger hit with him are the trivia games on one of the DVDs.  He'll work on those for hours if I let him.  I think learning, for the most part, should be fun.

The ""new"" School House Rock cartoons do their best to mimic the old feel and style, but I wouldn't say they add a lot, especially considering how quickly technology has progressed. The stories are sometimes too simple and a little biased, but they deliver some very good basics about grammer, numbers, history and science. How can you not love conjunctions!

While I can no longer see what it is I saw in the cartoons (though I still think they are better than what is on today) I can clearly see why I loved Schoolhouse Rock (and still do)!  I forgot all these tunes/cartoons when by the mid to late 1980's I was in college.  One night over the dinner table my usual group of about 10 people stated ""Hey, whatever happened to Schoolhouse Rock?  I loved those songs?""  We then all began singing our favorites and wishing they could still be seen. These songs allowed us all to know the difference between a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, to know about the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Louisiana Purchase, the Revolutionary War, math, and even a little science.  They are catchy, memorable, make learning fun, and best of all in today's ever popular ""don't-put-anything-on-children's-television-unless-it-also-has-a-toy-to-sell"" world, simply good for goodness' sake.  I have seen other reviewers criticize this for not being 100% correct, well perhaps, but more importantly, Schoolhouse Rock may inspire children to want to learn more about the subject matter - a key step!  The day my husband and I first discovered they were available in VHS/DVD was a great day.

There has to be at least a two-track audio master out there somewhere.  If they can release classic movies of the 40's, like the Glenn Miller Story, in 5-channel, certainly they could have done it for this great collection.  After all, the songs are what we remember the most about this series.	4.0	If It Only Had Stereo Sound...	2002-08-30	0	0	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A2XP6LZSVYPX03	R. Barr	All the School House Rock songs I loved a as kid plus some newer ones.  I had VHS tapes of the Grammar, American History and Math but these have ALL of the songs.  My son enjoyed the VHS tapes but is at the right age for the science and other parts of speech songs, the money ones are timely, and though new to me, seem another good way to teach kids.  I do not care for the video menu layout as much but am getting accustomed to it.  I know I'm used to the order on the old VHS tapes (and, when they were on the TV we got them in random order) but they made more sense:  e.g., in grammar nouns and verbs first, other parts of speech next, and sentence composition/order last.  This puts nouns and verbs quite a bit down the road after adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, etc.  May seem small, but when you use the play all feature it just seems odd order.  [In reviewing the DVD just now, it's only the grammar rock order that's weird].  There is a feature to hear all the songs in a section or chose one at a time in your preferred order.  There's also a feature to play all the songs of all the sections in their order or as a random jukebox mix. The quality of the recordings seem good, the container was adequate and cellophane wrapped.  I think I'll purchase one for his elementary school's use.	5.0	Content 5 stars, DVD set up 3.5 or 4	2013-12-14	0	0	0

How about ""Interjection""; remember that one?  These are some of the songs that I remember from the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" DVD and from watching TV as a kid in the '80's when ""Schoolhouse Rock"" songs were sandwiched between cartoon segments on Saturday mornings.  This is for the older elementary school child.  Though my Kindergartener likes some of the songs and finds the animations cute and funny, it was harder for him than his older sister in third grade to fully appreciate all of the songs.  Your child will learn not only grammar, but American History as well:  how the West was settled and how a bill becomes law are some examples.  It is all animated with adorably sketched characters and memorable voices singing memorable songs."	5.0	This Schoolhouse Rocks!	2007-01-18	0	0	0

I remember my years in elementary school (2nd-6th grade, especially), watching Saturday morning cartoons and then seeing a Schoolhouse Rock toon. Anyone who has kids (which I don't) or grew up in the 70s (which I did) needs to have this 2-DVD set because it is wonderful! I love every single thing about this 2-DVD set. I love the fact that it's got all 46 oringinal animated Schoolhouse Rock toons plus the new Schoolhouse Rock toon called ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"", plus you can play the toons in their seperate categories (grammar rock, america rock, multiplication rock, science rock & money rock) or all of the toons together, either in order or in shuffle play. I also like the top 10 jukebox feature. The bonus features on disc 2 are really amazing, such as the long-lost Schoolhouse Rock toon ""The Weather Show"", the 3 out of 4 Schoolhouse Rock toon set called ""Scooter Computer & Mr. Chips"", the top 20 countdown of Schoolhouse Rock toons, the 4 music videos by certain music groups and the Nike commercial set to the tune of ""Three is a magic number"". The audio commentaries are interesting, but what's really neat are the surround-sound version of ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"" the behind-the-scenes featurette about the making of ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"", the featurette about the Schoolhouse Rock creators winning 4 Emmy Awards and the 2 interactive games: the arrange-a-song puzzles game & the ""Earn Your Diploma"" trivia game. Altogether, this is a perfect 2-DVD set and I recommend it to anyone who has children or just wishes to relive their childhood because it is GREAT and if I were a teacher & they were in my class, I'd tell the Schoolhouse Rock creators that they passed with flying colors!"	5.0	Schoolhouse Rock 30th Anniversary DVD gets an A+ from me!,	2008-06-25	0	0	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	ALS0041SS519N	ROGER L. FOREMAN	"And it's even educational! I was so pumped (now that I have a DVD player) to hear that they were releasing a big-time anniversary edition of Schoolhouse Rock in its entirety. I've had four of the videos for years, but this set is so much better. Disc One has all of the original songs--you can play them in order, randomly, just the top ten--and an all-new song about the Electoral College (inspired, no doubt, by the 2000 presidential election). The way you can navigate your way through any and/or all of the songs is very easy and great for when you don't just want to hear about grammar (or history, math, etc. . .).What really puts this over the top, though, is Disc Two, with a bucket load of extras: the lost ""Weather Show,"" a new computer three-song set, a making-of feaure, top 20 countdowns, an interactive trivia game, music videos by contemporary artists, audio commentaries, Emmy Award footage, etc. . . . I can't wait to explore even more than I got to last night! This will be such a great tool for my 21-month-old daughter (who will know how a bill becomes a law and how to use a conjunction in a sentence!) and a ton of fun for me in the process.The video quality isn't MONSTERS, INC., but it doesn't have to be. The old animation holds up just fine, as does the audio, which audiophiles could probably complain about if they want to poop the party for the rest of us. What really stands up to the test of time, aside from the basic content, is the music. These guys (primarily) did some really good arranging, little of it in the rock 'n roll genre, ironically. Jack Sheldon delivers some spectacular jazz vocals on several of the more famous tunes. Complicated yet catchy melodies are the strength--that's why we all remember ""I'm Just a Bill"" and ""Conjunction Junction""--with great backing vocals and instrumentation to boot. The contemporary artists' renditions didn't hold up to the originals, but they were pretty interesting to hear. The interactive stuff will be great for kids hearing these songs for the first time. The interviews and commentaries are really interesting, especially in hindsight. Great new additions, discoveries, and formats all add to the charm of the original forty-six songs. How they managed to get all of that factual information into essentially a music video, while keeping the kids (and me) entertained, is still a mystery to me.Bottom Line: You'll be hard-pressed to find a better combination of education and entertainment. If there are any factual inaccuracies, they are minor enough to overlook and could actually spark interesting conversations. The basic content is right on-the-money. The fact that they'll actually be talking about and be interested in the grammar, history, science, and economics is important enough to overlook any minor flaws.The fact that my daughter, who two years (and a couple of months) old, actually knows that ""Wow!"" is an interjection, a fact that most of my juniors (I'm a teacher) wouldn't know off the top of their heads, speaks volumes. . . !"	5.0	This Is So Cool--Facts can be Fun!!	2002-10-10	40	38	2

I can go right to the shows without having to go through any advertisements.  My 8 and 5 year olds love it.	5.0	flashback	2005-09-15	2	2	0

I'd never heard of it, but was impressed to hear my husband sing ""Conjunction Junction, What's Your Function?"" and the preambles of the U. S. Constitution. Kids should listen to ""School House Rock"" in their classrooms as well as at home, I'm so impressed: plenty of catchy melodies and memory tools to help kids (and adults like me) remember important information. CD we have, and listen to, but I thought the DVD would be nice addition for visual (and I tend to be TV avoidant). DVD includes original 46 animated songs, a new ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College,"" and some extras, including an ""Earn Your Diploma"" trivia game.

One problem... The DVD stops after each segment as opposed to playing straight through. I have found that children quickly loose interest in the time it takes to scroll through the menu to the next song... However not quite as rapidly as their parents become frustrated with the stop, scroll and click routine. Totally nostalgic, just as much fun for adults.	4.0	Learning is Still Fun!	2007-07-07	0	0	0

Of course, everyone can recognize Bob Dorough, who is really the chief voice of the series and should get a lot of credit for a gee-whiz and accessible tone of voice and some very clever songwriting.Other notable voices: the bluesy conjunction juntion singer Jack Sheldon -- a better voice than almost 99% of what you hear in conteporary blues these days; also, Blossom Dearie, who I wish did more. (Her ""Figure Eight"" melody, so delcate, which busts into a great uptempo bridge, is just lovely.  And of course, she also does a kind of cute soft-spoken Olive Oyl voicing on the song about adjectives!) Then they get some good work from Lynn, and even the Tokens (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) and Dave Frishberg, the great jazz satire singer.The animation is witty as well, with all kinds of visual puns, quick throwaway jokes and kid-frendly action and color and concept.No wonder I still remember the tunes like it was yesterday, and when daddy showed it to his kids they sat enraptured and then lept up and said ""daddy - I'm skating a figure eight too!""  ...So cute, and they're only four.Really, the level of intelligence for these videos is about 7 to 10 cause they get to third grade topics, but kids younger than that will pick it up quick too.Thanks Bob!!"	5.0	Great Singing, great songs	2006-05-08	10	9	1

I really wanted her to see it because she's having trouble memorizing her times tables and it's better than flashcards by anyone's measure!Once she got over the animation quality [I told her it's more like a comic than a fancy show, and she had an easier time accepting that], she got into it. We sat down together and ended up watching nearly all the subjects over two hours. And she's asked three times in the last couple days to watch the dvd some more. Right now she's watching it to help her do her math homework. I don't mind. Whatever it takes to get the repeated exposure and finally make it click in her head is worth it.Of course, I have the worst 'ear worms' I've had in forever -- since they're from my most primal memories as a kid [born 1971] -- but truthfully, I'm THRILLED!!! [interjection ;) ]I don't much care for the 'money' section, made far later, and the texture looks strangely stark and cheap, maybe early computer animation, but my kid likes them so it's okay with me. However 'Tyrannosaurus Debt"" is weird -- I'm not sure how a young kid is supposed to make anything out of the national debt, and the teen taking Civics is not watching these shows. Maybe it's meant for the parent in the room to happen upon? A lot of us don't really understand the debt very well either.I imagine I'm preaching to the choir, but far too many of my generation would not have learned anything if it weren't for School House Rock. I now have hope my kid will learn something too growing up! [Though she watches lots of really well done PBS shows which are far better then when we were young.

Let's put it this way...This is one of my kids' most requested DVDs (ages three through seven), and they walk around the house singing about nouns, the branches of the government, counting by 5s, electricity and the National 'Tyrannosaurus' Debt.The songs in this compilation of shorts that used to run between regularly scheduled shows on Saturday mornings on ABC mainly during the 70s actually helped me in school. Schoolhouse Rock! is a series of 46 educational shorts featuring easy to sing along to songs about grammar, science, math, economics, history, and politics. Money was added in the 90s and computers to the 2002 DVD release.My preschooler--because of this DVD--can count to 100 by 5s and my second grader knows what a noun is and that all he needs to do to describe nouns is ""unpack his adjectives"".Each song is apx 3 minutes or less of straightforward education. And since the songs are so brief and the lyrics are so easy to remember, kids retain a lot of information from some very short, simple lessons.This is an essential purchase if you have young children.Side note: The ads at the beginning of the DVD are indeed a pain, but easily circumvented by pressing the STOP button TWICE on your remote as soon as the first ad starts, then pressing your MENU button instead of PLAY to get the DVD going again; this brings you right to the main menu where you can play the DVD by topic, mix up the songs or play them in order."	5.0	Interjection...HEY!

Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera ruled the airwaves during the morning hours. Sneaking in now and then were live-action classics from Sid and Marty Krofft.And between shows, if you were on the right channel at the right time, were these quirky little musical cartoons. They had catchy tunes, and kept us glued to the TV between shows.And they educated. They actually taught us things. Things we could use later in school, and throughout life. Basics of grammar, mathematics, history, science, civics and more, all in 3-minute chunks.Now, Saturdays are cultural wastelands, ""educational TV"" is mostly unheard of outside of PBS (because e/i rules don't apply to cable), and the only cartoons that don't exist solely to sell toys are adult-oriented.Thankfully, with this DVD set, we can return to the glory days of Saturday Mornings, and share the experience with a new generation.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1DSVCBYFO6AZ3	Steven W. Strom	Yes, just like anything nowadays, you have to skip through the previews and hit the DVD Menu to go to the main screen. I think it takes all of 10 seconds to do this.  It's a little funky the way the menu is setup but anybody who knows how to work a DVD player within the past 10 years should be able to adjust.  They have it setup where you can select a specific cartoon based on the category or you can play the 'whole enchilada'.  Selecting this option will begin to play every cartoon and you will need to use the skip button to toggle between scenes.  Yes, they could have done a better job with the scene selection...but who cares..it was $15.00.Personally, this is an excellent learning DVD for the kids.

All they do is condition your child to watch TV.  The creator of such videos were recently quoted in a parent's magazine as saying that kids are going to watch TV anyways, why not have them watch something without commercials and product placement.  Not a bad idea, but I think this DVD does the same and provides some educational value.My child is not into TV at all, but we find that the songs usually grab her attention and set her off bouncing happily up and down to the beat.  The catchy songs and colorful videos are also full of little education tidbits.  I bet most of you probably learned how a bill becomes a law from these classical songs.Anyways, my 16 month old enjoys it.  My wife and I enjoy them.  And I think you will too.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A3647U1U334SRW	"Tihocan ""tihocan"""	"There's a lot to like about Schoolhouse Rock. I grew up watching it just like everybody else my age.Looking back on it now, sure, the nostalgia factor is high.  But sometimes, the various segments can be factually inaccurate.For example, the ""Verb"" song identifies ""batting"" as a verb, when it's actually a gerund that acts as a noun in a sentence. Example: ""I like batting."" The subject is ""I"". The verb is ""like"". And the object -- which has to be a noun -- is the gerund ""batting"". Now, maybe gerunds are a little beyond the scope of the song, but then it should have stuck to plain old verbs like ""bat"" (I bat, you bat, etc.), not ""batting"".Another problem is that ""Interplanet Janet"" strongly implies that the sun is a planet, when it is actually a star. (The lyrics briefly -- very briefly -- mention that it's a star, but the overwhelming repetition of the word ""planet"" in the song, as well as the inclusion of the Sun along with all the other planets in order, implies that the sun's a planet too, just like all the others.)There are other slip-ups like this throughout the series, if you look for them.

Disney took control of this compliation of all the hit Saturday morning cartoon episodes.  So if you were a fan or have 5-12 year old kids, it will give you both something valuable to watch.  I believe this holds kids attention as when I saw it when I was my daughter's age.  If you are an educator, then this product would be an excellent purchase for your school.

Over the past thirty-odd years I've caught myself out of the blue humming ""Conjunction Junction"" more times than I can count! What a blast to go back and see them all again!I bought this as a surprise for my family (wife, son and daughter--and yes, me too!) for Christmas. I knew my wife would remember them and I wanted to introduce the kids to them to give them a glimpse of how seventies Saturdays were. It's been awesome.We'll watch an episode and my wife and I will talk to them about how we used to enjoy them. My son, who's into music bigtime, gets a kick out of the period atmosphere of the songs and the lyrics. My daughter thinks it's really cool how the songs can be so catchy and teach so much at the same time. Of course, I do too!My wife has always said I'm a lot like the kid on ""Wonder Years""...always reminiscing. Guilty. It's just that some things are worth remembering, and this series is definitely one of them! I get the same kick out of this that I do out of the Peanuts Christmas/Halloween/Thanksgiving specials. There's an atmosphere about these toons that makes you want to stop whatever you're doing and just soak it up because it's so campy it's mesmerizing. You know you're witnessing something really nice.I'm not a grandparent yet, but for all of you who are and who remember the Rock, then this should be one of the first gifts you ever give your grandchildren. Young parents, take note...you may not remember these toons, but your kids will never forget them.Buy them. Now. LOADS of fond memories! (And they really help the kids in school too!) And they're so cheap you can't possibly regret it!By the way, my mystery is solved. I knew there was one of the toons that kind of spooked me out when I was little, but couldn't remember which one. Finally figured it out after three decades! It was the mathematics cartoon about number twelve...little twelve toes dude used to scare me! And the music was kind of surreal like a Pink Floyd song.

Some of those history ones might open some eyes, since I don't think that is the history they teach. I don't remember the bank one, or the one on the national debt. But all the originals are here, even broken down by math, history ...  Get it for yourself, or use the lame excuse that it's for grandkids.

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A1PNVQ71NAVIN2	T. Tsubota	This came up as a gift idea for toddlers ages 2-4.  This is not so.  School House Rocks covers grade school curiculum.  This would be better for a child between the ages of 6-12.  I use School House Rocks in my classroom all the time.  The fun tunes and animation make learning U.S. History, money (the stock market), basic math, etc. easy to learn.  The words to most of the songs is included in the DVD case.  This is a fantastic teaching tool for grade school aged children.  Not appropriate for toddlers.

Every song is here, including some that I had never seen before (mostly the ""Money Rock"" entries). They still hold up as being fun and informative, even today.Two minor quibbles:1) The shuffle feature never worked on my DVD. The songs played in the same order every time - staring with ""Unpacking My Adjectives"" and then going through each section the same way. This may just be a glitch in my DVD.2)  Since the good people at Disney now own ABC, we are ""treated"" to eight - count 'em - eight previews for Disney videos, movies, and assorted junk. You can get past these by either hitting the ""Menu"" or ""Title"" feature on the remote or Chapter Advancing past them all.In spite of these, I would still recommend this to anyone feling nostalgic for their youth or needs to teach someone about civics or multiplication.

And there are some very teachable moments as well.  ""Gravity"" is a good opportunity for discussion about being careful not to fall or drop things.

As a college professor I have used this series to teach my students about the Constitution, principles on how our government works and the history of our country,  Schoolhouse Rock is more relevent today then it was 30 years ago.  The princples it teaches has been lost by many Americans.  My students juniors and seniors at the college leave can not answer basic question about their governmnet and how it works until they are shown Schoolhouse Rock.  I show these programs every semster in order to give my students a sense of how and why things occur in the their countries covernment.  I have gotten other colleaques at the college and high school level to use this series.  One of my colleagues an English teacher loves the vignettes on grammer and punctuation.

I think all of us who grew up in the 1970's and 1980's learned from the catchy jingles.If it weren't for the countrified ""The Preamble,"" I wouldn't have it recited nor known what a veto is had it not been for ""I'm Just a Bill"" (both from America Rock).""Electricity, Electricity"" is really a rewrite of ""Conjunction Junction"" but no less informative or entertaining (from the Science Rock series).  The ""Victim of Gravity"" song stands out with its 1950's doo-whop influence (the character in the video even has James Dean sideburns!).If it weren't for ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Lolly Lolly Lolly,"" or the funky ""Verb That's What's Happening,"" I probably wouldn't have been as successful with grammar (all from the Grammar Rock series).But most of all, I think I learned my multiplication tables thanks to Multiplication Rock.  The songs ""Three Is a Magic Number,"" ""Lucky Seven Samson"" (ya gotta love that long eared blackeyed bandit!) and ""Ready or Not, Here I Come"" were favorites(I used to count this way whenever I got tricked into playing another dreaded game of Hide and Seek!).The folky ""No More Kings"" almost sounds a little anti-British now, I suppose (and the animators goofed since the British flag did not include the red cross of Northern Ireland at the time; aside from that, still a very educational and catchy song/video!).Money Rock and Computer Rock introduced some new learning songs to an even younger generation (Mr Chips is introduced as a returning character and there's an interesting song about saving your money, which gives a nod to Reba, Wynnona and Dolly Parton).There are commentaries on ""A Noun Is a Person, Place or Thing"" (I like the mention of the Beatles, the Monkees and Chubby Checker!), ""The Great American Melting Pot"" and ""Figure Eight,"" to name a few.  In addition, ""The Weather Show"" (which was previously banned from syndication and VHS anthologies due to legal entanglements) and a ""new"" song ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College"" are included in this 48 song anthology.  There are interviews with the producers, animators and some of the musicians and performers.While I was away at college, I read in our school newspaper there were picketers to bring Schoolhouse Rock back on the air (it worked!).  I remember as a 29 year old watching intently ""Energy"" and my older brother said tongue firmly in cheek ""You're the biggest kid I know!""

It's two cds, and it orders the songs into nicely sorted groups for you to pick. Definitely recommend it.	4.0	Great nostalgia and great for my daughter	2014-05-04	0	0	0

1569494126	Schoolhouse Rock! - Money Rock [VHS]	A2X1BIP5PTVBBC	ZBoomer	"I grew up in the 70's watching Schoolhouse Rock, and I can't recommend these enough. I was still using the information I learned well into high-school and beyond. I remember my freshman year, one of our first assignments was to memorize the Preamble to the Constitution, and I thought, ""Are you kidding? I've had that memorized since I was a kid!"" lolI was stunned to recently discover my wife had never seen Schoolhouse rock, so I bought this DVD to catch her up. Now she's humming Interjections, Conjunction Junction, and Nouns, among others, haha.The video quality isn't the greatest since these are so old, looks like VHS, but they are awesome all the same. I was actually surprised how much I had forgotten out of all these.Anyway, these things are great for teaching kids without them even realizing they are learning. They have stuck with me my entire life, highly recommended!"	5.0	Great flashback, never gets old, and you can still learn a lot from these!	2012-11-02	0	0	0
