6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AQEOUNGRPW1E1	AkaAM@6isBTNMAA	this is a great movie in the tradition of previous Riddick movies.  However, several issues need mentioning. 1. The plot is great, but for those that wrote the script, it leaves one wondering if people in real life use the F word that often-especially in some off world futurist Sci-Fi flick, 2. The movie over does the Lesbian and Religious characters parts and 3. some of  scenes drag on.  I gave it a 5 star as I like Riddick and now have all his &#34;off Earth&#34; movies.  Had it not been for Riddick, I'd give the movie a strong 3 star given my comments above.  However, go and buy the movie-good entertainment.  BBDGW	5.0	Two many F words	2014-02-24	1	0	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A20NRTNP7L9KJN	"Alan L. Wautier ""boulonman"""	I've always enjoyed VinDisel's one-dimetional tough guy w/sarcasme character. However, being the main character to support the entire movie isnt quite enough. But being a sci-fi lover I can overlook the lack of depth in both acting, & plot development by enjoying the great special effects eye-candy.His previous Riddick & sequel were better movies in the sense of character development & overall theme of lone survivor against the entire universe! But, if you liked the earlier &#34;Riddicks&#34; & several other similar Sci-Fi flicks Vin-D. starred in, you'll enjoy this one as well. Its not the greatest, but I've seen far worse. I would have waited to see this film free when it hits NetFlix, if I had known. But I wasnt entirely bored.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A20VF7HMAA9N2X	Amanda R. Warren	I'm a fan of the original _Pitch Black_. I found it innovative, complex, and surprising. This third film in the series seemed like an attempt on the writers' and director's parts to try to recapture some of that complexity (something lacking in _The Chronicles of Riddick_ which was a very different type of film), but it fell far short of the goal...it was almost goofy at points. There was too much of an attempt to recreate the scenario of the original film maybe without an awareness of what made that first film so great. The whole plot felt forced and contrived, and there was just enough of a tie to the first film to remind me of what was lacking.	2.0	I wanted to like it	2014-02-07	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3FYBR5XMRIPWV	"Amazon Customer ""allschool"""	the whole Riddick plot is only so so, but I just like listening to Vin Diesel growl at people and watching him kick ass. This is not as good as his role in the Fast and Furious series, and probably not as good as his role in XXX, but in the Diesel filmography, this ranks ahead of Knockaround Guys, and probably The Pacifier (which I liked, honestly). I don't know if playing bad asses with a heart of gold meets all of Vin Diesel's artistic aspirations, but me? I'm entertained, and I appreciate the menace he brings to these roles. I mean, who else could you picture as Dominic Toretto, or Riddick, or XXX? That's a skill in and of itself, to create a memorable film persona.If your idea of a great movie is some weepy British period piece that's an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel (no disrespect to Ms. Austen), you should wait for the next Colin Firth movie, but if you like growling action and butt kicking, and especially Katee Sackhoff (yes, please. She's kind of bad ass, and smoking hot), this is worth seeing.	4.0	I have to admit...	2014-06-04	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A4FGSNWBJG4Z7	"Amazon Customer ""Direwolf"""	I looked forward to this film for quite a while.  I enjoy the Riddick character quite a bit, however unless the viewer has seen the Director's Cut of The Chronicals of Riddick, with the extra Furyon footage, the motivation for Riddick to seek Furya is lacking. The trailers for this film pushed the illusion that this was a repeat of Pitch Black, but it's not, in fact, it bucks almost every expectation the viewer might have based on the previous films, while staying true to the savage, sarcastic Riddick character.  I found an interview where two more movies were discussed, to bring the story to a conclusion, and I look forward to those as well.	4.0	Good move - but it feels like a reboot	2014-01-28	3	2	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2YALLJTB0ONSN	"Amazon Customer ""gpymd"""	We've been waiting for Riddick's return for a long time. Riddick as a survivor is really his best mode. You get plenty of that here. This story won't get high marks for being unique, but it is still enjoyable. Unlike pitch black...which is often what this movie is compared to..you already know who riddick is at this point. In pitch black he might have been a bad guy. In this movie, you already know he's a good guy who just has a bad attitude and is a bad ass. He's almost like Clint Eastwoods characters in the old westerns.I look forward to more installments.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1CFV4A78XZJRV	Amazon Customer	I am happy with the film. Vin Diesel at his best. Not complicated or over done. Like Pitch Black, this movie is just a good watch. Perfect for a couple of beers and a good recliner. Riddick does what he does best. He's a loner just trying to survive in a hostile universe. I don't wish to spoil anything so I'll just say it is the Riddick we all came to think of as an all around bad ass. I understand that the movie could have gone in multiple different directions and I am so happy they made it a simple action, sci-fi flic. If this is the future of the franchise then I am on board as long as they continue. Pitch Black was lightning in a bottle and in my view Riddick is an excellent continuation. I don't ever go into an action or sci-fi movie with high expectations. That is how you get disappointed. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who loved the first.

Constant action, some thought provoking scenes, and a lot of revenge.  The story line was excellent.  Bringing in the Johns Sr character, was an interesting twist.  I would say that this movie is one of closure and shows what it means to have that type of closure within a family group.  Johns Sr wanting to know how his son died, Riddick seeking out his home world, and glimpses of the previous movies.  I did note that in one scene a rock outcropping looked vaguely like the creatures from Pitch Black.  All in all, an excellent movie.  The end sequence leaves you wondering if there will be another installment in the Riddick series as he is looking for Vaako.  A possibility maybe.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A39DYD0874AV7E	Andie	"This movie is awful. Its like a stop off on the story line. Everyone says it is like Pitch Black, but only if you ignored the feelings and only watched people's guts being strewn all over. That's basically what this movie is... Its a B movie. Guts and some pornography... I guess if you are into that sort of thing...I kind of liked Riddick prior to the movie ""Riddick"" because he was an anti-hero... It kind of had that Shrek, Gru, I can't explain it, but a guy that isn't really a bad guy, but everyone else makes him out to be a bad guy feel.That was the whole point of Kira or w/e her name was, duh.I feel like in order to like this movie, you really should not go into it expecting Riddick to be anything like the character seemed to be prior to this movie, and you really should not expect them to tell the next part of the story.... because they don't. They never make it to telling the next part of the story. It was like telling a story about someone travelling in 4 parts, and part 3 is just this long drawn out explaination of a rest stop.Yup, a rest stop.... that is exactly what this was... seen it, done it, boring, monotonous, and full of crap.And don't even get me started about the insulting way they handled the female characters of this movie. Especially since it is much better explained by the Mary Sue:  [...]I would not have even given the movie the time to write this, except I happened to see it in the streaming advertisement with 4 stars, and that just isn't right. I needed to say something.This movie is unacceptable, and more people shouldn't be so willing to accept whatever garbage is slewn at them. I'm not willing to accept it. They are going to have to try way, way harder next time to win me back because after this movie, I never wanted to see another Riddick movie ever again.Try to make a movie good enough that you can get by with a pg 13 movie and people will still come and watch it next time."	1.0	This was unacceptable B movie garbage.	2013-12-17	29	9	20

I'm going to bury myself balls deep in her? Come on.The whole Riddick story line is like one of those toys that jets across the room and bumps into to something only to shift gears and go full tilt into something else.Pitch Black introduced the character.  Chronicles was supposed to introduce the bigger story/world of Riddick.  It started to but didn't have a clear vision of what that world was.  Riddick started over again with  mere moments of Chronicles story line to tie it in.  To what? I don't think even Twohy knows.One last gripe.  Riddick hopelessly fighting his way up to a pointed cliff, surrounded, outnumbered, beaten down and oh so boring!  Come on.  This screams perfect Riddick moment.  But it was ... not.The video kept stalling and loading.  Movie wasn't that exciting to begin with sure didn't help that you had to wait to.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AADMY7VV0PEP4	Angryman	Like others have said, if you have seen pitch black, you have seen this. Watching Pitch Black and Riddick is like watching Alien and watching Aliens. But where Aliens delivered on much of the same suspense/tense situations that was found in Alien to accompany all the gun toting Marines, Riddick doesn't bring the same suspense that was found in Pitch Black to accompany the gun toting mercs. In Pitch Black you were trying to figure out how these surviors would make it in the face of such terrifying circumstances. You also knew something about the creatures, who though they weren't the main focus, drove the movie. And the pacing was great.In Riddick, I don't know what the point is. They devote too much time in some areas and not enough in others. The tie in to chronicles of riddick was sufficient at best, but you can't tell if the main intent of this movie was to create another Pitch Black or Chronicles or a hybrid of both or neither. The creatures do not fully take over until the last 20 minutes of the film and there really is no concern about them until then. So they are not driving the movie and I don't know what is. Hell I had to &#34;rewind&#34; back 3 times just to see what the hell riddick was looking at in the storm, then put it together. But here, there is no concern over &#34;how we are going to survive or what to do&#34;. Everyone hides behind and are saved by their big guns. conversely, ff this was meant to focus on Riddick, why do such a poorly developed tie in to the Chronicles? Why not focus on him losing his edge or how he lost it, then all the desert and hunting stuff makes sense. But we knew Riddick was a badass from Chronicles. So watching him take out Mercs based on 5-10 mins of background from his time with the necros shows us nothing new about the character.Overall, if it wasn't for the storyline of Johns finally developing, the movie would have been terrible. On a side note, I'd like to see both creatures fight. I'd give the Pitch Black creatures the edge for having &#34;arms&#34;	3.0	Glad I rented it	2014-03-10	0	0	0

It wasn't near perfection like the 2000 Pitch Black, but it was close.I don't need to go into how good the near-cult classic Pitch Black was with it's tight story and even tighter direction. The second movie was so interesting but so flawed when it tried to cram two movies worth of lore into one grand yarn.The third movie, however, was more of a character study in Riddick himself and was more similar to the first. Riddick is one of the best sci-fi anti-heroes of late.The only thing that doesn't gel with me was the ending. It was too pat. I understood what the script was trying to accomplish and setup for movie four, but it fell off on execution and hence only 4 stars.Even so, it's nice watching a sci-fi action thriller with a great protagonist and ultimate an adult movie.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AJRZ98VIOES0U	Argyle Ronin	The Riddick trilogy is the best of Vin Diesel's starring roles. Vin doesn't have the chops to pull off something on par with the Terminator or even Predator, but his role as escaped convict Richard B. Riddick is some serious entertainment nonetheless. Bloody, ultra-violent, and campy as all hell, this flick is a solid conclusion the trilogy. Like Pitch Black, 2013's Riddick is low-budget trash sci-fi that is marketed toward the lowest common denominator. Acne-infested preteen boys with cracking voices and comic books stacked to the ceiling featuring topless space cadet chicks vaporizing each other with laser canons is what comes to mind. If you think you can fit in, you will like this movie. This entry's Riddick is goofier than its predecessors, but the carnage and gore are turned way up since the character's last outing. The one striking problem is the movie's lack of kickass factor. Riddick doesn't fight much, instead he is lethargic, lollygags with his pet CGI dog, and ends up in shackles for much of the second half. The ending was awful, but at least it leaves room for a fourth sequel.	3.0	More Pitch Black Than Chronicles	2013-09-23	5	2	3

But in this one (Riddick) they have some similar plot lines, but didn't make the effort to pull it off in the exquisite manner they did in the other movie.

I felt like the writer gave up on the story and Riddick. Seemed like much was borrowed from Pitch Black and too much of the storyline was left to ride on the reputation of Riddick instead of sharing more background on him; for instance more about Furya instead of a tease for a fourth installment.	1.0	Not a treat for a true Riddick fan...	2014-05-15	2	2	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2NMIW0RRH9J6S	AvidConsumer	I love the Riddick movies, books, animated stuff, even the video games, so I was excited for the last piece of the trilogy to finally be released. Unfortunately, like many trilogies tend to do these days, they just ruined the previous installments. Pitch Black was good, Chronicles was great... this one was just pathetic.I don't believe in giving a synopsis or spoilers in reviews, but I can tell you this. Riddick is almost literally a re-hash of Pitch Black and not in a good way. I mean setting, plot and characters - almost identical to Pitch Black. I can't believe it took them this long to come out with this. If you are a Riddick fan, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.However, if you aren't familiar with the Riddick series, you won't find much interesting sci-fi stuff here either. In fact, you may find yourself confused because they re-hash a lot of stuff that happened in the previous movies.Don't get me wrong, Riddick is a great character, and Vin Diesel is phenomenal in the role. Definitely watch the previous two and even the animated films (if you are into that sort of thing), even the video games are worth a play - though they will be dated by now.I'll just do like the Matrix and pretend this one didn't happen.	2.0	Riddick let me down!	2014-01-24	0	0	0

Alas, I had nothing to fear (but fear itself...)Story is well written and coherent, dovetailing smoothly into the preceding movies. Movie is well shot, well acted, and special effects are spot on. Unlike some other reviewers, I was unable to find anything to be unsatisfied or dissapointed in, leaving me totally thrilled that the series not only didn't die with &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34;, but has the potential for more movies without becoming duplicitous or redundant.I sincerely hope they are willing and able to make the next installment, presumably to answer &#34;Where is Vacco?&#34;, as I will be right here to buy a copy.	5.0	Totally Worthy Sequel, and I want more	2014-01-29	2	1	1

So did RIDDICK deliver? Yes, yes and hell yes. The wife and I went to see this together in the theater and we both got what we were looking for. I got ultra-violence and cool mercs and monsters and she got Vin Diesel...flexing.I wasn't thrilled by the last entry but DARK FURY and PITCH BLACK were both solid.

It is so full of cliche's that I was laughing at the &#34;scarey&#34; parts and simply shaking my head at the &#34;funny&#34; parts. The very worst part of the entire movie is the Harley Davidson sound tracks used for the hovering motorcycles. I mean come on! Did any of you Hollywood geniuses ever take any science classes?

Riddick always seems to be fighting against incredible odds to survive...and nothing like that was going on with this movie. He forms an attachment to a digital character, and although it was sort of interesting...it just never felt real enough for me to believe this human actor was bonding with the digital character. He ends up battling a small band of bounty hunters, and nothing he does was Riddick like...so, I felt a bit confused and disappointed at the end of the movie.

There is something that is going to happen to the planet in 24 hours and Riddick is the only one who can get everyone off the planet safely, because he's awesome like that. And the final showdown happens on the planet when it is raining and pitch black. Three people officially make it off the planet. A highly religious male, a female, and another male.Sound familiar? That's because that synopsis is for both &#34;Riddick&#34; and &#34;Pitch Black.&#34; I'm not going to say this is a horrible movie. In fact, it is rather good for what it is. Sadly, the entire time I was watching it, I couldn't help but draw comparisons between &#34;Riddick&#34; and &#34;Pitch Black&#34;. It was almost more of a remake then an addition to the story line, and the only advancements we see at all are at the very beginning and the very end and even those were rather circular. Even the main alien lifeforms that are trying to kill everyone look very similar to the alien lifeforms from Pitch Black.I would recommend this for any fans of the Riddick series, just don't expect to get anything new out of it besides the fact that he makes an entertaining friend while stranded and has some pretty cool slow-mo jump-kick-slash moments.I also found it mildly annoying that Riddick managed to turn a lesbian woman straight.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A33Y35HJGDHZ2H	B. Wright	***SPOILERS AHEAD*** -- Stop reading now if you want to watch this filmRiddick is a poster-child film of why Hollywood is so bucked up. I don't know how many films have done exactly what Riddick has done, but the first one that comes to mind is Event Horizon.  Like Event Horizon, Riddick starts off with a promising premise. A sort of training ground, if you will. Riddick is tired of being Lord Marshall and decides not to take the oath to remain in office. As a result, a lot of people around him disrespect him and that decision and want to kill him so they can usurp the title from him.Being tired of the role he's been forced into, Riddick decides to run off and look for his home world Furya, with the help of some people that, for whatever reason, he trusts. Unfortunately, that trust is misplaced when they strand him on a fairly inhospitable world, not unlike the planet in Pitch Black. These people also attempt to kill him before stranding him, but the best they accomplish is sending him hurtling down a landslide to a broken leg. After coming to, Riddick realizes he's become complacent and rusty. He realizes he needs to hone his skills, to get his edge back. After being dropped on this eat-or-be-eaten world injured, he begins overcoming the odds by going from prey to predator using only his wits and skill. Again, an awesome starting premise.Unfortunately, this is the point where the promising start ends. At about the half-way mark in this film, the writers take an about-face and turn this film into a Pitch Black clone with slightly different rules. Instead of darkness bringing out the creatures, rain does. And that's when the killing begins, at least mostly not by Riddick's hand. Riddick also realizes he needs to get off the planet by trying to obtain a ship. Unfortunately, he has a few surly bounty hunters he needs to dispose of first. So, the remaining part of the film is about either Riddick or the creatures picking off the bounty hunter ship crew one by one until they join him or die. Riddick does have a few choice scenes in the latter half, but not enough to make up for the incredibly trite last half of the film.Riddick (the film) simply becomes a clone of Pitch Black and ultimately a been-there-done-that moment. This film doesn't deserve one star because it's at least entertaining up to the half-way mark including a few parts of the second half. The effects are reasonably decent and the jet-cycles are completely cool. If the writers had continued on with Riddick having some quality alone-time and honing his skills, then quickly making his way off the planet to go after the guy who stranded him there, I'd have been all over that plot. Unfortunately, it turned into a sentimental journey reminiscing about the Pitch Black days and also mimicking Pitch Black in the process. At the end, you're left scratching your head trying to decide what everyone really accomplished.	3.0	Started out promising, ended up a clone	2013-12-22	3	3	0

The plot takes a much more simplified approach compared to the broad scope of previous film &#34;Chronicles of Riddick&#34;, but there's nothing wrong with that.  That said, there is still plenty connecting it to the events of &#34;Chronicles&#34; and in the end, it leaves us with a good sense of where the franchise could go from here.  I hope that it does indeed continue.Unrated Director's cut adds a few more extended scenes, in particular, a brand new ending scene that was cut from the film completely yet is quite important in regard to what could be in store next for Riddick.	5.0	If you like the character, this film delivers.	2014-01-11	2	0	2

The dialogue was very mediocre: Random swear words that don't add anything. And what was up with all the naked women? We wanted to see an action movie, not a porn movie (needless to say, they had NOTHING to do with the story.) The other two movies didn't have that!!!! We almost turned it off a few times.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AYWSFRCIMOAYE	Cestmoi	When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it's bland. How wrong I was.For the first 45 minutes, the suspense was breath-taking.  I could not figure out in advance how Riddick (played by Vin Diesel) could kill the giant, scorpion-liked monsters that lived in the water.The special effects were  life-like and amazing, especially with the monsters and the hyena-liked dog. They did help make  the film more interesting.The way Riddick eliminated his hunters was also gripping. Katee Sackhoff and Jordi Moll&agrave; were convincing as bounty hunters. Matt Nable was engaging in his role. In the last half of the picture,  Jordi Moll&agrave; acted like a fool, not like the capable leader of the bounty hunters.  I did not like that.The action scenes were fast paced, decisive and interesting.There was some humor too which made the movie more enjoyable.Of course, it had big logical holes but I was able to suppress my logic to enjoy the film.According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:Production Budget: $38 millionDomestic:  $41,199,570+ Foreign:  $48,000,000Worldwide:  $89,199,570So, this movie took in 51 million dollars more than its production budget. That's a huge amount for a low budget movie. I'm sure we'll see Riddick 4 by the end of 2018.In short, It's definitely worth watching.	4.0	Unexpectedly Entertaining because of Breath-Taking suspense + Engaging Acting + Life-Like special effects + Some Humor = 4 stars	2013-10-08	5	3	2

I don't think this film can be fully appreciated without the back story in those titles.	5.0	Fan of the Series	2014-04-09	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A11L8QJD2JXBUP	Charles M. Britzman	The Riddick movies all take place on the fringes of a futuristic human universe, far from Earth, and what we have here is a loner who apparently got himself in criminal trouble long ago, and has been on the run ever since (I haven't tried any of the Riddick video games, or read up on the backstory that goes along with them ; I only know what the three movies have shown). If Riddick is a representative specimen of the people of his native planet, Furya, then we can surmise, as always, that strong, cunning, superlatively trained and highly intelligent people that take responsibility for their actions (and inactions) will quickly run afoul of  'normal' society, where such things are feared and/or make life harder for the parasites that prey on it. As you watch the movies, you get the feeling Riddick is just another man who did what he had to at some point, and it just happened to be against the law, whatever it was (probably murder). Like in StarTrek, we never learn much about mainstream society in the Riddick universe (maybe none exists), but unlike in Trek, as humans have spread outward in the galaxy, they have encountered no other technological alien societies yet. But there are plenty of highly-evolved hostile alien animals on the various Earthlike planets Riddick finds himself on. The Necromonger episode of 'Chronicles Of Riddick' was Riddick's highest profile in the large scale events of the human universe, while both 'Pitch Black' and 'Riddick' take place more in Riddick's native context : in the backwaters and shadows, pursued by both bounty hounters and hostile alien creatures.'Riddick' is action/adventure, first and always, and as such requires the usual suspension of disbelief from the viewer, which we should all be well-practiced with by now. I gave it four stars simply because I think there are deeper scifi efforts out there, but I ain't complaining. The special effects I found to be more than adequate for immersion into the story, and the CGI dog/hyena steals every scene it's in!If this third movie seems like a repeat of former story elements, it's because Riddick is still Riddick , dealing with a Riddick life, and I love watching his style, decisions, problem solving, and coolness under pressure. In some ways, his life is like that feather blowing around at the end of Forrest Gump ; each chapter of his life sets him up for the next. And, as one previous reviewer mentioned, I'll be there with my bourbon and coke, hugely enjoying the ride.	4.0	INTERSTELLAR SURVIVOR	2014-01-17	0	0	0

Unfortunately, David Twohy has spent considerable time bringing us a character with a mysterious backstory and &#34;Riddick&#34; does not deliver on the promise made by &#34;Chronicles of Riddick&#34; to open the curtain a little more on Riddick himself.  The quick bow to &#34;Chronicles of Riddick&#34; at the beginning of the movie is almost as though Twohy wanted to push it under the rug.  Personally I would have loved to see more about how Riddick dealt with the circumstances he found himself in at the end of &#34;Chronicles&#34;.Altogether not a bad movie--Riddick is one of my favorite sci fi characters--by not by any means what I was hoping for.	4.0	Back to Pitch Black	2014-02-02	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2ZR9AJZP3WNLR	Chris	The formula for the Riddick movies is pretty simple, despite that they've always been able to keep things interesting.  From the first one, which was fairly simplistic yet entertaining, to the second one which took a direction I don't know if any of us could have expected, to this.  You never know what you're going to get from these movies, and they always turn out to be pretty fantastic.I bought this hoping for a Chronicles-esque sequel, something to continue the really strange universe they delved into.  What I got was something that catered to both movies, continuing the basic story of Chronicles of Riddick as well as playing on the same structure of Pitch Black.  I don't feel like it went back to the roots of anything, considering none of these movies are alike.  And that's one aspect of what makes them so great.Out of anything that released in 2013, this is probably my favorite.  Whether you've been a fan of the series or not, it's an enjoyable movie either way.	5.0	Amazing	2013-12-20	5	3	2

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ	Chris Kennison	"Forty-six year old Vin Diesel returns to the role and the movie series that rocketed his career in 2000, ""Riddick"". While ""Chronicles of Riddick"" tried to get too fancy, ""Riddick"" and ""Pitch Black"" proved that less is more.""Riddick"" to me is a tale of two movies. The opening moments of the film find Riddick stranded on a sun-scorched planet and find him struggling to survive his wounds, the elements and the planets creatures. The first half of the movie, while simple and less eventful, is the most interesting part. As Riddick explores and uses his instincts and survival skills to stay alive, I was completely invested and enjoying a good old fashion science fiction adventure.  Later on, mercenaries join the story as they come after Riddick for the bounty on his head.The addition of more people to the story didn't lessen the film by any means. In fact, it just pushed the movie into a different direction and it was also very interesting. What did lessen the film though, was a collage of terrible dialogue, silliness and character motivations and personalities that changed from scene to scene.  I was completely enjoying the film and was prepared to call this the surprise hit of the near-summer, until the creators failed to proofread the final third of the film.A vicious mercenary named Santana is after Riddick's head and he is vicious, except for when he's being punched in the face by the one girl in the movie or if the scene calls for him to be comic relief. A silly kicking a sword scene served no purpose except for the creators to do something new and gruesome and it was so silly it made the audience laugh. Finally, a bold prediction by Riddick as he's chained up basically spelled out the entire finale of the film, including that the one girl in the film would be straddling him at the end. From that point on, as I watched each one of Riddick's predictions come true, I couldn't stop thinking about the 'straddling' part of his story.""Riddick"" could have been good, or even great, but the filmmakers tried overtly to make things fun about halfway through the movie, not realizing that the movie was already fun. We were there. We were beside Riddick and his ability to friend a wild dog despite the dogs nature. Then the movie went into silliness land, it lost its edge and it reeked of a group of filmmakers trying too hard to make something entertaining."	3.0	POTENTIALLY A GREAT MOVIE but spoiled by overt silliness	2013-09-09	6	2	4
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A9MFC0BWDCP7W	Chris Miller	I absolutely LOVED Pitch Black, and the Chronicles of Riddick...  So when I saw this movie coming out I couldn't wait to get it!Then I finally got it in the mail and put in the player.  It was plain awful.  I endured the first 30 minutes hoping it would get better, but it only got worse.  So about 35 minutes in to the movie, I stopped watching it altogether.  I've never been so dissappointed in a movie.  The script was horribly written, everything about the movie looked fake, the CGI was so poor and sloppy that it was totally distracting.	1.0	Don't waste your money	2014-01-16	10	2	8
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2Q6KIPD4YUUGP	Chris Ridley	I am a fan of these movies and as such had to add this one to the collection no matter what. I found it to be a good movie, but not a great one or even a &#34;conclusion&#34; to the series. The movie seemed to be rushed when telling how Riddick ended up on the planet and no follow up on what happened to the Necros after or really a good reason why they did it. The movie then drags on with some good solo time with our hero and then he discovers a massive wave of water and has to move on. After he finds a way to defeat the monster at the gate, he comes upon an outpost to which he can send a signal to trick someone into coming to get him. Surprise, he gets not one but two ships that arrive because they were so close to this one planet in the middle of now where. The final note that I didn't care for was the mystery of the one bounty hunter and his relationship with someone in Riddick's past. there was never a good story that tied it together, grrr.Overall the movie reminded me of Pitch Black. I enjoyed the action scenes and many of the ideas or suggestions, even though they were never fully realized. Unless you are a fan of this series, it is worth a rental and not a purchase sorry to say. Thank you Vin for making this and I wish you the best in the future.	4.0	Good, not Great	2014-02-09	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1RBMIW93238DA	Christian R. Ward	Even if one isn't a fan of Vin Diesel, the Riddick character is quintessential sci-fi anit-hero. Though the movie starts slow with Riddick's rise from the dead, it quickly becomes more a battle with the bounty hunters who would kill him. I didn't enjoy some of the more violent parts of the movie. Still, I've become a fan of the dark anti-hero Riddick. The cinematography reminds me of film noir on another planet and recalls somewhat the flavor of the original Bladerunner movie. I enjoyed this and was engulfed by the story.	5.0	Great sci-fi	2014-05-15	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2AKEUNLA67IB2	Christine Kramlich	First off let me say I am a fan of Vin Diesel and have really loved all of his movies.  I was so excited when I found out he was making a sequel to Chronicles of Riddick that I pre-ordered it months in advance just so I'd have it as soon as available.  It arrived and I planned a movie night and was so excited.  Unfortunately while it is a continuance of Chronicles it is choppy and uneven in the story.  How it gets to where he is from where he was isn't clearly brought out, the transition from leader of the Necros to stranded is too abrupt, not enough lead in.  There is lots of action but so far I have watched it through once and tried to watch it again but just couldn't get through it.  Maybe sometime in the future I'll try again, or maybe it's just me having a preconceived idea as to what this new Riddick movie would be like.	3.0	Not what I had hoped	2014-02-14	1	0	1

Sadly though I felt let down.  It felt like a combo of Pitch Black with Chronicles...but it didn't fit right.  I was also extremely disappointed that Urban was only in the movie for around 5 mins at best.I've also played the Riddick games, and this movie reminded me more of the games than a film.  This whole thing would've worked great as a game, but there wasn't enough real story to be a proper movie.  This felt like a preview to the real sequel.

The previous two movies were two different beasts with the first being almost an Alien horror movie and the second being more of a typical big budget summer popcorn flick. This movie...I just don't get it. The script/idea around it almost completely mimics the first movie. Within the first couple minutes everything you have invested in Riddick is thrown out of the window with no fanfare at all (big mistake). Beyond that, the actors in this movie just did not seem to jel...either that or it was the TERRIBLE dialogue. I swear at times I just laughed and how corny and cheesy some of the stuff that was said or done in this movie - it was nowhere near the bada$$ things we've seen in the past.

Too much reuse of lines from the original are more distracting than funny.  Like Chronicles of Riddick, too much digital background takes away from the action.  Both films were too busy, not clean and crisp like the original.  As usual Vin is great in his role and plays Riddick with lots of enthusiasm but overall the film has fallen victim to too much CGI.

I really didn't want to see this one, to me the trailer screamed rehash of PB.  There were similarities, but for me this was a pleasant surprise that I thought surpassed the 2nd installment and rated right up there with the original.Great action, nice story and the Blu is ridiculous in the audio department.

From the beginning to the end you are given a ton of action packed sequences with violence, but also a story that adds to the two previous movies that have been made. The actors do a great job bringing their characters to life and you are drawn into the story itself. This movie goes back to some of its' monster movie roots as you will find Riddick having to kick the butts of a ton of monsters in this movie which is part of the overall fun itself. All-in-all this was a ton of fun and you will be kept on the edge of your seat until the very end of the movie.*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*	4.0	Action Packed!	2013-12-27	3	2	1

It is true, that this film is predictable, and follows the story of the previous films, but maybe that's why I liked it. I would like to see a bit more to the story for the next Riddick film that I hear is in the works. I watched this one a couple of times already, and have to same some of the dialog is just over the top funny, even outrageous, like when Dahl suggests jail-breaking the ship power supplies... that's a scifi stretch that cracked me up, not to mention some of the things that come out of Santana's mouth.

I just hope that if we are lucky enough to enjoy future entries of films following the ever oppressed Riddick that the writers don't over do it with the &#34;humanizing&#34; of the main character and allows him to remain the hardened outsider that prevails despite the best and overwhelming efforts of the bounty hunters that seem destined to never give up in their efforts to capture our &#34;hero&#34;.This is a great movie and I enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend watching it if at all possible.	5.0	"Yet another great movie in the ""franchise"" started by Pitch Black"	2014-04-12	0	0	0

The killer leading the party of ship-wrecked passengers to safety on a planet riddled with death was a treat for the eyes, and I left the theater wanting more.  &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; was a good movie, once you got past the whole Necromonger bit.  &#34;Riddick&#34;, Vin Diesel's third installment of this live action series, is a worthy addition to the character.  We see much less of the Necromonger side of things, and more of what Riddick is good at - surviving a harsh environment.

The awesomeness that could have been was left in someon'e creative sketchbook a guess in lieu of a regurgitation of the original story line with a few dashes of the graphic short in tow.What bothered me about the whole movie was that the original concept of the 'Fury' seemed to get lost.  We see an info dump up front about how Riddick feels he got soft which led to his current set of circumstances, however nothing in all the past movies or story lines would have led any of us to believe that the Riddick character would have been careless in the midst of murderers and cut-throats.  It would seem that the 'jump the shark' moment happened when the writers decided to do a 'restart' of the whole series in guise of another sequel.  Hey, it worked for the Marvel and D.C. world why not for this franchise right?If there is another sequel, it will be Riddick against Vaaca or another Necro just like him and that should make us feel somewhat insulted, after all, we saw this all take place already and were waiting for something much more worthy of the Riddick legacy...  or at least I was....	2.0	Sad that nothing new came from this franchise....	2014-02-11	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2HD6G443MGH2A	dookerJ	This is technically the &#34;second&#34; of the Riddick series&#8211;Pitch Black (also an excellent movie), according to the director/writer, was the &#34;Prequel&#34; to the series.  While Chronicles of Riddick will always be my favorite, borrowing elements (nicely) from David Lynch's Dune, this film seems a bit more like the original prequel (Pitch Black), but with a bigger budget, and with plot points that connect the three films.Without giving any spoilers away, Riddick finds himself on another harsh planet, working both with and against two teams of mercenaries.  Vin Diesel is the only guy who can play this role.  He really gets into it, alike a classical, method actor.  His facial expressions are wide-ranging and suit the various aspects of the plot.  He retains the glowing eyes/infrared vision from the rest of the series.  It's a thrilling ride with a lot of innovative creatures and plot twists.Also, where Chronicles of Riddick borrowed heavily from Dune, this film takes quite a few elements from the Aliens movies (Alien and Aliens (the sequel, which was excellent).It's a thrilling ride, innovative, and simply kick ass.My only two qualms with the film are1) The endng&#8211;I watched it digital download as soon as it was out, but the blu-ray, Director's Cut version has an alternate ending.  I'd like to see that without buying/renting it again.2) The Title &#8211; &#34;Riddick&#34; &#8211; I feel like they went the safe route and called it Riddiick, when it really is the third film in the series.  They could have given it a better/more aggressive name given that it was the third film.  I feel like calling it Riddick played it safe for audiences, when it really was the third title in the series.  But, you take what you can get.  Regardless, it is an excellent film, and I give it 5/5 for sure.  Definitely worth a the price.	5.0	Riddick is the role Vin Diesel Was Made For	2014-01-19	2	1	1

Vin Diesel was hardcore as expected but it was just like pitch black.  I was hoping for a continuation of Chronicles of Riddick or a completely different story. The type of continuation shown in the beginning of the movie lacked depth.  Vin Diesel needed more supporting actors in the beginning but he was going rogue to try and survive with the supped up dog he was with.After the ship landed the movie got interesting but we have already seen this type of acting in Pitch Black.  In many ways I could feel Vin Diesel honoring the character by focusing on who Riddick is but part of it felt too soon.  I feel as if he wants to end the character so he wanted to do a final movie.  However; he should do one more movie with a different story first. Then the final on Riddick.	3.0	Another Pitch Black	2014-03-07	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A29TKSIWA3JKF3	Einsatz	"Another inhospitable world out in the middle of nowhere, Riddick needs a better travel agent.After developing all that ponderous mythology for the second film, for reasons never stated, they suddenly decide to switch gears and abandon it in favor of another simple survival story.  They waste only a few minutes to bridge the gap between Chronicles and this installment.Once again, Twohy creates a fantastic world he doesn't allow us to fully appreciate.  It's either dark or distant; very little time is spent on middle ground before the clowns (bodies in waiting) descend on the big lug in the form of not one but two ships loaded with professional mercenaries (Vin and a cast of nobodies).  To complicate matters, one of the mercenaries is the father of that fake cop from the first film (the drug addict who wanted to use the girl Jack as bait).  How we're supposed to remember that requires a lot of devotion to all things Riddick.  It's ancient history and a bit late to be starting a grudge match.In this movie, there's some but not enough monsters (a wide assortment would be greatly appreciated).  The dialog is ludicrous (and not helped by Vin's bored monotone drone...........""you are getting sleepy, sleepy, sleepy"").  It's also impossible to root for someone when they're all psychos.  But I did like the jackal-beast-puppy.  As for the closing debate, is Vaako dead or alive or both................who cares?  That wouldn't be the follow-up that I'd like to see.

The only minor complaint I have is the insinuation that a man can be so epic he can even turn Gays straight! I'm sorry but it just doesn't work that way and its very chauvinistic to believe otherwise. Do I believe women in experiment more and can be attracted to both sexes yes, but that personal factoid changes nothing of plainly a poor message to send young women (why I care very little despite the severity: little lesbian girls probably aren't watching Riddick but hey this is all my perspective... what do I know)	5.0	Sweet	2014-01-01	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A28JKHZSYGW859	Elizabeth Alexander	Thanks Vin for a new installment in the Riddick universe.  Though Diesel has a great sense of business acumen and loyalty to his fan base, I really long to see him in more dramatic roles.  Riddick once again delivers a rough and tumble character piece-delivering it via action rather than well written words. I gave it five stars for Vin Diesel, who once again, was rationed on-screen.  He eats the camera, people.  I can't be the only that sees Riddick as a standup guy who is studiously persecuted for setting boundaries.The positives:  Riddick's &#34;force-of-nature&#34; charisma.  Not sure why everybody calls him an anti-hero.  Johns is an anti-hero.  Riddick is a niche waiting to be found.  His character reveals a universe out of alignment simply by comparison.  He lives truthfully and everyone resents him for it.  He's miss-labeled, completely underutilized, a veritable Audi being used to deliver pizzas; Riddick galls the Necromongers by being the antithesis of death.  The dude just wants to go home, but for some inexplicable reason--he rubs everyone the wrong way.The reality is, Riddick is exactly who you want with you when walking into Mordor (where one just doesn't walk), or traversing the mines of Moria.  He's survives.Another positive:  The Dog. The dog was not only realized beautifully via CGI, but seeing Riddick grab it and slide under the pincher creature to escape to greener pastures, while simultaneously disembowling it was one of the best scenes, if not the best scene, in the whole film.What I missed:  really lovable mercs like Nick Chinlund.  The mercs generally speaking, with the slight exception of Dahl and Johns were ... kinda boring, though I did like the kid.  In fact, I wondered why the kid was even there with all of them and did he make it off the planet?  I don't remember.  I hope so.Another thing that was missing was Riddick rawhiding spaceships - and this may have been a budget thing.  Maybe they simply couldn't afford cgi scenes with cool skiffs skimming the atmosphere and such, but it was sorely missed - especially with Riddick at the helm.  The merc ships were ho-hum in design and the Necromongers ... well, aside from Karl Urban, they remained as borning as they were in The Chronicles of Riddick.All in all, to see our favorite Furyan in full survival mode during the first part of the film was worth the price of the download.	5.0	Five Stars for Diesel	2014-01-02	4	2	2

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2IY9M330NKBW6	Eric Sanberg	"When I first saw ""Pitch Black"" I thought it was just okay. I certainly didn't think it was director David Twohy's best work. A subsequent viewing looked a lot better to me. But I'm still surprised it sprouted not one but two sequels. The latest ""Riddick"" is more like ""Pitch Black"" than ""The Chronicles of Riddick.""Here's the scoop. Riddick comes to on some unforgiving planet. He's got a compound fracture on one leg and a multitude of bruises and whatnot. He's also surrounded by creatures who look at him as though he's their next meal. He puts himself back together and activates a beacon at an outpost that draws the attention of two sets of bounty hunters. They want his hyde. He wants one of their ships. A storm brews that will awaken more monsters and make the two parties dependent upon one another.This is a somewhat different approach in that we see a Riddick that isn't always on top off things. An adversary gets the jump on him which is how we come to see him in his beat up state at the beginning of the flick. It's also more leisurely paced that the twp previous outings. Twohy takes time when letting Riddick mend himself, settle down and then domesticate one of the local canines. But this is some nasty stuff. I actually had to turn my head a couple of times, like when he puts his leg back together and again when he immunizes himself against the venom of one of the indigenous nasties. But when the bounty hunters arrive we see the old Riddick who is always a step ahead of his foes and it's fun. Twohy did a nice job with the hunters. They are better written than one usually finds in this kind of movie. The one odd exception was Bokeem Woodbine's character.  He was little more than a sketch and gets killed in a rather unceremonious fashion. Katee Sackhoff, of Star Trek fame, is on hand as a butt kicking sharp shooter who gets warm for Riddick's form. But it's all pretty cool. Riddick gets to do what he does best, which is to dispense people. And the tenuous bond he forms with the leader of one of the hunter groups plays pretty well.This is no great flick by any means, but for those who like the franchise, or this kind of movie in general, it delivers the goods in spades."	4.0	Beau-Coup Goo and Blood	2013-09-23	5	2	3

It starts off slow and laborious until other characters are introduced. Then it does get a bit interesting. The 2 groups, which are bounty hunters, have their own agenda that does not become clear until later on. The characters are not developed enough and are bumped off rather quickly. There is only a small sequence referring back to the necromongers, which I think was a mistake. This feature tries to stand on its own, but, I think it fails. Where have the previous villains gone? What about the other characters in the prior movies, a back story would have helped. And the creatures that were designed for this slaughterfest were unimpressive. The best movie was the first, original and well written and introduced us to Riddick. The second one was a big extravaganza with a lot of visuals, but with less impact than the first. This third one is anemic. I hope that Vin got his money back because he funded this movie with the mortgage of his house. I think he is better than this and so is David T.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	ADWQPR0LJD4J	"ERSInk . com ""Eric"""	After nearly a 10 year gap between films, many were wondering if we really needed a sequel to &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34; The 2004 follow-up to &#34;Pitch Black&#34; veered off from the simple &#34;fight-to-survive&#34; scenario and took us into a world overstuffed with CGI razzle dazzle. What would Vin Diesel and Director Dave Twohy do with the third installment in the franchise, simply titled &#34;Riddick?&#34;What they've done is return the lead character to what he does best. I can't completely say this is a good thing. Riddick is a survivor. Whether you think him to be good or bad, the guy has a way of saving himself while &#34;accidently&#34; saving others at the same time. Strange thing is he's always rescuing people he doesn't even care about.Director/Writer David Twohy has found a way to mash together elements of &#34;Castaway&#34; and &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&#34; with &#34;Aliens&#34; and &#34;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation.&#34; In the first part of the film, the title character is banished from the city of the Necromongers. He's making his way solo through the desert fighting off all sorts of alien beasts. The second half has Riddick trapped in an abandoned outpost with a group of mercenaries and bounty hunters while fending off water monsters that have surrounded the motley bunch.The CGI and practical effects in &#34;Riddick&#34; aren't so bad. They're a lot easier to stomach than what we were served up in &#34;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.&#34; The visual effects are scaled way back from what we saw in &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;You can tell Vin Diesel loves the character of Riddick. He fully embraces the role and savors every moment onscreen. Katee Sackhoff portrays one of the bounty hunters like she's playing a grimier version of Starbuck from &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34;The DVD version of &#34;Riddick&#34; only includes the theatrical version. The Blu-ray has an unrated version which I haven't had a chance to watch. Special features for the DVD include two featurettes entitled &#34;Vin's Riddick&#34; and &#34;Meet the Mercs.&#34; &#34;Riddick: Blindsided&#34; is a motion comic filling in the gap between &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; and &#34;Riddick.&#34; I don't really know why this is necessary, seeing how the beginning of the film already does a lot of that.&#34;Riddick&#34; is rated R for strong violence, language, and some sexual content/nudity. The only nudity is an extremely brief and very unnecessary shot of Katee Sackhoff in the shower. The rest is just sci-fi gore and bounty hunters cussing like sailors.For the most part, &#34;Riddick&#34; gives the viewer a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The survivalist beginning of the movie does keep it from completely falling into retread territory. However, I'm still pretty sure it wasn't the sequel people wanted from this franchise. I can't tell you exactly what I wanted from it, but it was something different from this.	3.0	"""Riddick"" Returns in Disappointing Sequel"	2014-01-29	3	2	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1LYQL40IB7SBL	FNDNreview	"If you're a diehard Vin Diesel fan, then you probably remember him even for his lesser known roles in films that include Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room, and Knockaround Guys.  But, the rest of us have come to know Diesel in basically two roles and two roles only:  Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise and Richard B. Riddick in the Riddick franchise.  Depending on how you feel about these two particular franchises - odds are that's how you judge whether you like or dislike his acting choices, which have largely included the role of the thug or tough guy.  Regardless, The Fast and the Furious franchise quickly lost its flavor without Diesel involved, eventually leading him to disappointing and lackluster roles in films, such as The Pacifier and Man Apart.  Eventually, Diesel reclaimed his role in the Fast franchise over the course of three more sequels - not to mention his fame.  And, much like Sylvester Stallone with Rocky and Rambo, Diesel hasn't forgotten the character that put him on the map.  It's been nearly 10 years since Diesel played the role of Riddick, but after a lengthy wait - the saga of the shiny-eyed convict finally continues in the second sequel (unless you count Dark Fury, then it would be the third sequel), simply titled - Riddick.David Twohy (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick) is back to direct Riddick, starring Vin Diesel as Richard B. Riddick - a convict, last seen in The Chronicles of Riddick, had just conquered the Necromonger Empire.  However, it was only a matter of time before Riddick was betrayed by his underling, Vaako (Karl Urban).  Riddick attempts to return home, but is instead marooned on a desolate planet by the Necromongers - and must once again ward off not one, but two groups of mercenaries looking to collect the bounty on his head.  At the same time, a storm is approaching that will once again allow a massive race of predators to unleash maximum carnage.  Jordi Moll&agrave;, Matt Nable, Dave Bautista, and Katee Sackhoff also star in supporting roles.Personally, nothing pleases me more than when a franchise has the same director for all of its films.  As a devoted fan of these flicks, I believe it's of the utmost importance to establish and maintain a rock-solid continuity. It appeases the fans that have stuck with the franchise and makes the entirety of the story flow in ways that most franchises just don't care enough to sustain.  More often than not, it's brutally (but not always) obvious when a film is shot by one director, and then said director hands off the reigns to someone else.  A recent example would be Jon Favreau leaving his directing duties on Iron Man 1 & 2, giving way to Shane Black in Iron Man 3 - who obviously has a completely different style of directing than Favreau.  In any event, director David Twohy is back in the director's chair for Riddick - his third stint (out of a possible three) in the Riddick saga.  His imagination and fingerprints are all over this franchise, from the development stages to the plot direction - all of which have contributed to this pure, high-octane series of action sci-fi films.It seems relatively easy to say any given role is the best for an actor.  Since I already used the Iron Man reference, a perfect example would be me saying Iron Man 3 is Robert Downy Jr.'s best performance to date.  Some people might agree with that assessment, but it's the same character being portrayed by the same person over the course of several films, so why does it really matter?  That's the rule of thumb I'm applying to Vin Diesel in the Riddick films.  Without a shadow of a doubt, Riddick is Vin Diesel's best work.  In this case, that's not a very large stretch to say since Diesel has only had a handful of characters in his tenure as an actor.  Riddick could be comparable to Dominic Toretto, but Riddick is much more a savage character - active, deadly, and a character that says what he means and means what he says.  I suppose that's a completely backwards way of saying he's a total badass.  If you've seen the first two flicks, then Riddick is more of the same - meaning immensely enjoyable in terms of overall entertainment quality.While Diesel thrives in his role, there are still some bothersome issues about this film.  First and foremost, Riddick reflects Pitch Black too much for its own good - visually and plot-wise.  Don't get me wrong, Pitch Black was a quality flick with a pleasing plot and plenty of action, but there's still a moderate amount of disappointment surrounding the fact that after waiting nearly 10 years for more Riddick, the film is a rough rearrangement of the first film.  Speaking of disappointment - it's also a major disappointment that Karl Urban only shows up for a matter of seconds.  You heard it - he has nothing more than a brief cameo.  There's an endless amount of potential lost with writing a script that didn't include Urban, especially since he's established himself as a top name in Hollywood.  Since his role in The Chronicles of Riddick, he has ballooned into a near household name - but I suppose a brief appearance is better than no appearance at all.  Hopefully, Riddick will accumulate worldwide success and before long, Riddick will be knocking on Vaako's door in a not-so-distant sequel.Overall, Riddick is chock-full of memorable moments that will have Riddick fans screaming to the rafters with joy (present company included).  Recent news reports have cited the difficulties Diesel endured financially to make this sequel, so he should be commended for making a film for his fans - especially since there are plenty of actors out there that would have passed on such a gamble.  In my opinion, Riddick pays off with dividends in terms of action, CGI visuals, acting, characters, and complete quality of the end product. Even more impressive is the fact this movie was filmed on a reduced budget of $38 million, compared to its predecessor, which cost more than $100 million.  Obviously, this film warrants a view, but there are strings attached - and this is where Riddick might hit a snag in the ""success"" department.  The major drawback is that it's been 13 years since Pitch Black was released, and 9 years since its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick, was released.  Naturally, that means if you haven't seen these two films, you'll need to watch them before watching Riddick - as there are heavy details from both films that tie into Riddick.  But, if you're caught up on these flicks already, you're good to go.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com"	4.0	Diesel at his best in the sci-fi sequel, 'Riddick'	2013-09-06	177	155	22

I am always seeking out whether the writers do an adequate job of bringing action movies to a close that would point to the next chapter and in this case I would give them a B- for their efforts. I will have to acknowledge that the CGI work is superb, especially with the new crop of &#34;monsters&#34; inhabiting this particular planet but they are not quite as fearsome as the ones in &#34;Pitch Black&#34;.Good all around effort and well worth the viewing.	5.0	Riddick at His Best	2014-01-28	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1W1JYIUJXGJOP	Gary Olsen	Vin Diesel is aptly named. He is like a locomotive, indestructible, coming at you with strength that goes beyond the bounds of credibility (I know, this is science fiction), and he's got just the right touch of wily problem solving skills. The supporting cast in this &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34; (nod to Heinlein) story is a very able band of caricatures one would expect to find in a Vin Diesel space movie, mercenaries, bounty hunters, some questionable military guys, and a muscular female who looks like she could crack your head like a pistachio nut in the crook of her arm.But the real scene thieves and stars in this movie are the CG animals on this strange planet. Though I saw plenty of water and desert on this far away desolate plain, there was a fair amount of water, so I am still wondering how anything survives on this planet without plant life to anchor the ecosystem. What is wrong with these screenwriters? Did any of them stay awake in high school science class? Yet here are all of these alpha predators roaming the planet. We just don't build a planet populated by bacteria and then alpha predators. Where are the plants, plant eaters, and the stuff that builds a food chain? So the alpha predators feed on each other? Makes no scientific sense at all. The only guy to get this right is Avatar producer, James Cameron. But he's a scientist as much as he is a film maker.The creatures in this movie are amazingly well done. I mean they are not perfect, and they are augmented in closeups with real creature effects and not CG which are fantastic and well executed in their own right. I loved the dog-like creatures the best.  I particularly enjoyed loved one that became a domesticated pet and raised by Riddick from an adorable puppy.  Spoiler Alert! Don't read the next two sentences if you haven't seen the movie. It broke my heart when his dog was killed. I haven't been so upset since Disney's Old Yeller got the rabies.There's a lot to like in Riddick if you're a special effects geek. I like this movie better than Pitch Black which introduced Riddick on the same kind of hostile planet but with this insane Dune Chronicles motif. The armor-clad actors looked like the minions of Ming the Merciless from the original Flash Gordon series of the 1930s. Buster Crabbe? Never heard of him? He probably couldn't kick Diesel's ass, but he was much more charming and Romantic. Mmmmm Dale Arden, Flash's earthly girlfriend, was pretty and not muscular, but Ming's daughter, Princess Aura, was the dark, smokin' sexy one. But I digress.	4.0	Special Effects Extraordinary	2014-01-24	4	2	2
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AJOXH616XO3UI	GaryWin	I actually loved this movie and almost gave it 5 stars. The special effects are good, especially Riddicks canine companion. Riddick was tricked into going to a deserted planet thinking it was the lost planet Furia, the planet of his birth. The plot borrows a couple of items from Pitch Black and some special effects from Chronicles of Riddick. Again his nemesis are mercs trying to collect the bounty on him. I liked the merc character Doll, she is one tough woman.Again, a stand-alone movie but watching Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick (in that order) would add some understanding to Riddick.I read a report that Vin Diesel made a deal with the studio that made the first two movies. He would do a cameo in Fast & Furious 3 in exchange for full rights to the Riddick character. They went for it. I look forward to more movies like Riddick.	4.0	Riddick is Back, badass as ever!	2014-01-03	3	2	1

The story line is simple and there is no going back and forth  between  current  to past Events. Left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators. Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick's past.  most of  the Actors do a Great job with their performances and the movie is well shot.  The movie ends like it should and i highly recommend it to those who like Vin Diesel  and or like Drama Movies.  I give it a 7 Stars out of ten or 4 Stars out of Five.  It's not a young kids movie, there  is Violence and one small Nudity scene  in it.  I hope he makes another Riddick down the Road.	4.0	Vin Diesel Delivers in Riddick 2013	2014-01-03	3	2	1

Strange creatures lurk about that only come out in droves when it rains.... I honestly could be a bit forgiving of this if they actually gave us some decent or atleast gave us 45 min or so of an overview of what happened to Riddick as he led the Necromongers, but we basically get a 10 min disertation....

The storyline isn't much, bad creatures, turncoat people and gunplay.A surprisingly decent appearance by Katee Sackhoff (Vic from Longmire) as the butch Dahl gives the lacking diminsional acting a boost.	3.0	Riddick Has Been Better	2014-04-06	2	2	0

(But Chronicles is really it's own movie, with a familiar character, in my opinion.)  I was afraid this would just seem like Pitch Black so many years later, and as much as it is all very familiar, it is still a different movie.  If you like Vin, if you like Riddick, you'll like this film.  The language and nudity are unnecessary, but I still enjoyed it.	4.0	It's Vin and Riddick just like we like him!	2014-02-04	0	0	0

I was hoping for more of a space opera (like the second film) than the mostly planet-bound action here.Despite that, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's similar to the first Riddick film.  In fact, it's almost an &#34;apology&#34; (in the literate sense) for the first film.It is over the top at times, but new viewers have to understand that Riddick is a super-human anti-hero.	4.0	It's Good	2013-12-18	11	7	4

Sci-Fi is about suspending skepticism and enjoying what may be possible in the far future.  That shouldn't allow common sense to be thrown out as well. This movie is so riddled with contradiction and stupidity that it's easy to feel like the producers were just milking the Riddick legacy.  I regret seeing it.	2.0	Disappointing	2014-03-29	1	1	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2CYULPE4Z76BJ	Holly Billick	The one thing I love about the Riddick movies is that he really should be the bad guy. Honestly, he is a murderer. But, along the way, there is always something worse than him that shows that he also has a great compassion for goodness. He knows that he really should stay away from people, and tries his best, but when push comes to shove and you really need him to step up and be the hero, he does.	5.0	Riddick at his best	2014-02-18	1	0	1
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AHD66U9MG0MKI	Holly Kubaskie	I may have misread that Riddick was suppose to end the series. It takes an odd approach to showing Riddick's human aspects. As expected, Riddick is a badass in this movie. It has aspects of movie 1 and 2 and ties up some loose ends. It appears to be laying the ground work for more movies. I can only guess the idea was to make Riddick more likeable for some bizarre reason.As I own both previous movies, the animated short, and bought this one tonight, I like Riddick. This movie had its good points. It added aspects that are sadly common in more recent movies involving sexuality and nudity. It fell short of the same feel as movie 1 and 2. Its not awful. But it didn't meet my expectations.	3.0	Confused Riddick fan	2013-12-28	2	1	1

This was a good installment... but, I don't like the way they treated the way he got kicked off the ship!!! The Chronicles of Riddick was the best one to me... didn't even watch Pitch Black until after I saw Chronicles... This one is more like Pitch Black on the desolated Planet with the critters! Felt sorry for the hybrid dog though, but it was kind of predictable what would happen to it... In any case, I liked the movie enough alright... The action - as usual - was good.  This is one of those movies where you are either going to love it or hate it... and... it's clear that he is still in search of ""home"" which leaves room for another one.

This is the kind of movie that shouldn't shy away from the gore or the swearing. The nudity was a bit gratuitous, though. &#34;Riddick&#34; was a bit predictable in places, but the character was returned to his roots and they dispensed quite nicely with the idiotic &#34;Chosen One&#34; shtick from the last movie and the action was more in line with the character and instead of making him into a super human they made him just &#34;more than&#34; human in ability.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1Y2UGUCT44QH2	Ian Hutchins	Okay, so after a movie like The Chronicles of Riddick, where does the series go? I was hoping anywhere but here.In the first 20 minutes of the movie, I was excited. Riddick had been left for dead on a hostile planet and we get to see some flashbacks and some really legit survival scenarios. Now up to the point where he calls for help, things where looking prettygood, granted I was disappointed that they didn't proceed with a Necromonger related storyline, and then we get the nextbadly paced hour and a half of this movie.The movie starts rehashing plot points from the first movie to an unapologetic degree. They're on a planet, they wantRiddick dead, a once in a blue moon event is about to occur, a lot of predators are going to come out, and they haveto go and retrieve power nodes for their ships, and after a few of them survive, it ends with each ship flying off into space.I kid you not; it's just Pitch Black with modern special effects. Now after Chronicles, I was sitting there just blown away by theending; it was unforeseen and made me jones for the third installment, but my excitement was shot dead completelyin this film; needless to say, I won't be expecting a fourth installment to the series.So what does that mean for the bottom line? It simply means that this movie is a 39%- Despite a strong opening, Riddick isbadly paced, derivative of it's first installment, predictable, and fails to build on the strong story concept that was presented inthe climax of it's predecessor.	2.0	Put Simply: It is a Carbon Copy of Pitch Black	2014-03-02	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A4PBMA9X7CFIE	Idel78	Any movie that creates a real off world feel with original environments and creatures has already done half the job of me liking or loving it. This flick has created another unique palette to tell the story of Riddicks endurance and survivibility. After him being marooned on a foreign planet I was amazed to see Riddick at such a raw and visceral state where he does some soul searching, strategizes and plays the trickster against some mercs.I always thought Riddick was definitely a one of a kind outside the box sci -fi character..his convictions, his past, his journey and Vinny owns it! Overall it was interesting and great entertainment to watch on my big screen. Blu ray picture is pretty sharp and picks up grand detail.

The writer/director took some creative risks in this movie to incorporate aspects of both Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick that I find commendable.  Essentially it's B level sci fi fun that helps get the Riddick franchise back on track and leaves the door open to intriguing sequels.  The directors cut features content that adds to the film in a positive way in my humble opinion.  If you love Riddick then watch this move with realistic expectations and enjoy the ride.	4.0	Not perfect but a very entertaining movie for the true fans	2014-01-18	0	0	0

Why people didn't like Chronicles of Riddick is beyond my comprehension because that movie was great.  Riddick gives a little history of what happened post Chronicles and sets up the next plot line nicely.  Vin Diesel was destined to play this part, akin to William Shatner as Captain Kirk, and is a natural at it.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1HUGWHNIWLRNC	irishgaels	My wife and I both really liked Riddick (3). It went back to its monster movie roots (see the film Pitch Black, if you have not already seen the first of the Riddick series). Without giving any of the plot away you have a simple (nothing wrong with simple) tale of survival, hideous monsters, two types of mercenaries and all the action you expect in a Vin  Diesel movie. Instead of being a mere continuation of the 2nd Riddick it makes a gentle (?) break and returns to what made Vin Diesel a big star in this franchise. A number of people didn't like the 2nd Riddick film. I really enjoyed that one too. Still, I believe that that particular plot had run its course and now we get Vin Diesel at his best, a convicted , hunted, criminal with a certain sense of nobility and character amidst a dystopian world of horror where humans fight each other, Riddick and monsters deadlier than Pitch Black. Have fun with this. It is entertainment at its best. I give it a solid 4 stars. 5 stars I am very stingy with.

They took the story line from pitch black and recycled it every body just got lazy, from begin marooned on planted and hunted by bounty hunters to having to fight off monster like creatures. The only difference was instead of having to do it in pitch darkness; they do it in a rain storm.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	Let me start off by stating that I absolutely LOVE David Twohy's PITCH BLACK. It's not wholly original, but what it does with the genre, how it explores certain archetypes and how it creates one of the great anti-heroes of Sci-Fi are totally captivating. I'm also a fan of THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, but much less so. It did a lot towards building the universe around the characters, but it went too high-concept. RIDDICK is very much a return to its roots kind of sequel, and again it starts off in such a compelling way and builds suspense incredibly effectively, but loses a lot of momentum when it goes for the big finale.Left for dead by Vaako (Karl Urban in nothing more than a cameo) and the Necromongers from CHRONICLES, Richard Riddick (Diesel) is stranded on a planet that he was hoping was his home planet of Furya, but is a desolate waste of a planet where everything living is trying to kill him. The first act of this film is Riddick trying to survive this harsh environment, and aside from some issues with the CG jackals, it works rather brilliantly. Then he finds a mercenary outpost long-abandoned and triggers an alert that will send mercs to once again try and capture and/or kill him, but he just wants a ship that'll take him off-planet. Two very different squads of mercs arrive with very different reasons to take him in (portrayed by the likes of Katee Sackhoff, Bokeem Woodbine, and Dave Bautista just to name a few). When they arrive, Riddick starts putting his plans into motion, killing and creeping up on the mercs like the quiet villain in a horror film while the mercs start panicking. And things are very interesting and scary and cool, including a reveal about one of the mercs that goes back to the first film. But when the creepy-crawlie giant-scorpion-like aliens start to surround them (brought on this time by a torrential downpour rather than the eclipse of the first film), the film starts to lose its tether to what makes Riddick and his adversaries interesting, and therefore, the film starts to become less interesting.From a character standpoint, most of the mercs are archetypes that Twohy puts a spin on. From righteous to religious to violent to hyper-ultra-violent. And in the midst of all this is poor Katie Sackhoff. Her character is initially cool, and aside from her original presentation as a lesbian (which is a cool idea to have that represented in a futuristic sci-fi action-horror), she is absolutely competent in her work. Until near the end of the film, it seems that Riddick intends to, for lack of a better term, cure her of her sexual preference because he's Riddick and he can do anything. That REALLY made me angry. I'm not saying that these films are intended to be the new zeitgeist of sci-fi action-horror, but PITCH BLACK and CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK did actually take the time to go beyond the adolescent male fantasy zone. Also, Riddick seems to get a little too touchy-feely with his more primal impulses towards his potential captors/killers at the end as well.Now the effects. There's almost nothing that pulls me out of a sci-fi film faster than unconvincing effects, practical or digital. Now, I know that this isn't AVATAR; it doesn't have a $200 million budget, but there are effects houses that can still do really good work on the &#34;cheap&#34;, but whoever worked on RIDDICK isn't one of those. Both the jackals and the scorpion things from a design perspective look really cool, but the digital work just isn't fluid and realistic enough to make them seem truly cool on-screen. However, the climax of the film helps these creatures simply by the fact they are now surrounded by darkness, so not as much detail needs to be given.Still, for two out of three acts, this is a five-star movie. But RIDDICK loses points at the end.	4.0	The first two acts of this film are pretty awesome... the third act, not so much.	2014-04-14	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2BI50OK30D9LN	James	So I am a Vin Diesel fan and a big fan of the Riddick character. The character himself was not bad, but the overall movie seems like a cheap scifi channel flick with big named actors. I was overall disappointed. It started out promisingly, though in order to get into the predicament they had to make Riddick fall for some uncharacteristically stupid stunts, but still I could believe it.After that, it just seems like they are trying to remake the original movie, with a lower graphics budget. I think if you go into this expecting the same as the original 2 movies, you are going to come out unimpressed.	3.0	Entertaining yet dissapointing	2014-03-10	0	0	0

You know how some people have to put on more cologne each day just so they can smell it, while the rest of us gag? That is baseline tolerance.Now let's talk about Computer Generated Imaging: Starting with the 1973 Yul Brynner oater ""Westworld"" and decades later ""Avatar"" in 2009, we have seen so much CGI, we gag. Hollywood can't seem to smell it yet and I admit some of it is dazzling, but how about a good script? Lots of cologne can't mask a failure to bathe, nor can lots of CGI mask a lame script. Which brings me to this third installment of a third Vin Diesel franchise (""Fast and Furious"" and ""xXx"" are two others); it has brilliant CGI but some of the dialog made me wonder how the actors kept a straight face...Here they are:* Vin Diesel (""The Pacifier"") is Riddick, the legendary loner who sets his own broken leg (don't ask).* Karl Urban (""RED"") in a 30-second bait and switch. Do NOT go if you are expecting to see Mr. U. in an actual role...* Jordi Moll&agrave; (""Knight and Day"") is Santana, the bounty hunter. To him, Riddick is worth more dead than alive.* Matt Nable (""Killer Elite"") is Boss Johns, seeking Riddick to learn more about his son's death.The story? Left for dead on a sun-baked planet, our hero fights against all odds and plots revenge. That pretty much covers it.This has some of the best CGI work I have seen to date, the production design is wonderful, the photography is masterful, the story is basic but involving, and like other Diesel outings, includes an anti-drug bit. On the other hand, the R-rated plot is rudimentary, the comedy is crude, the fight scenes are endless (use your fast-forward on your DVD from Amazon), and one of the monsters eats its own entrails.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1UEW0GN2JOK5B	Jes	A great addition to a character I have enjoyed.Never really got into the universe the series takes place in, but the character Riddick always had my attention.  Like many, the second film really threw me.  It wasn't that I thought it was a bad film, it was passable.  It felt out of place, not highlighting the aspects of the title character as the first film did.  In a sense, too much fluff, not enough substance.  So, when the third film was hinted at, I had mixed feelings.This one returns the character to the basics, which I think was a good thing.  Small cast, functional but not overdone locations, identifiable threat, sprinkled with a nice blend of moments of humanity and violence.  You can do so much more with a simple approach than with grand scenes full of CGI, explosions, and thousands of extras running about.  I think this film is a good example of that kind of movie.Personally, I thought him raising a pet was an interesting touch that kept him human without having him loss any of his 'badass' persona.  While the film does showcase a lot of the title character's strengths, it also keeps him grounded by weak moments, such as him dealing with sever injury or reacting to extreme moments in a softer light (the previously mentioned pet and the merc prisoner being two examples).This is the kind of film I wished the second film would have been, and if they do more in this tone, I certainly would continue to support the franchise.Buy it, rent it, stream it.  If you seen Pitch Black, and liked it, this is the film for you.	5.0	Riddick	2014-01-17	2	1	1

Sometimes you just want a good, &#34;clean&#34;, action packed cathartic release of #@@-kicking. And that is what you get with this movie.It starts with a bit of explanation as to why our anti-hero is here, and moves into a fighting struggle of survival.If you occasionally enjoy a visceral action packed fighting movie then this is for you!I would agree it is very similar to Pitch Black, which I admit I watched more times than I can count!I for one am glad to see this series do what it does best, getting you to root for the anti-hero, and consider that all things are not black and white. All the while entertaining you with action!I would have given it five stars, but I will admit the monsters and scenario were a little too similar to the first one! Don't get me wrong, it was great, and I was happy that it had a bit of an unexpected twist in the end!I recommend this to anyone who wants a good action packed monster/survival flick!Oh, loved the dog!	4.0	Not bad!

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A29EAXCG7XUOSI	"J. Hofmann ""Kindle on Fire"""	Riddick quickly changes gears from the 2nd movie The Chronicles of Riddick (an epic, somewhat overblown space opera) into a more exciting movie about survival on a harsh planet -- much like the original &#34;Riddick&#34; movie, Pitch Black.  As it opens, we find Riddick seriously injured trying to survive on a harsh planet.  But he's Riddick and he uses his time alone with the nasty local beast population to find his inner savage again.  To get off the planet, though, he must overcome the bounty hunters and revenge seekers who answer his &#34;distress&#34; call.  The movie has loads of badassitude from both Riddick and former Battlestar Galactica fan-fave Katee Sacklehoff who looks great back in space gear.  Jordi Molla, a Spanish actor, makes a memorable impression as Santana, the &#34;shotcaller&#34; for a bunch of bounty hunters and Matthew Nable also shines as a mercenary seeking Riddick for answers about the death of his son (who was Riddick's adversary in Pitch Black).	4.0	A good sequel (to the first film!)	2014-02-03	0	0	0

His only choice for survival is to activate an alarm system and call in bounty hunters looking to kill or capture him.  Talk about being between a rock and a hard place....I am just a Vin Diesel fan and a Sci-Fi fan and I couldn't resist getting this DVD and watching it.  I enjoyed the film and the special effects.  The storyline just was not as fresh as the first version of Pitch Black.  I like Pitch Black and the Chronicles of Riddick more than this film.  Pitch Black was a fresh, hot and shocking story and this film just seems like a continuation of that one as if no time had really passed.  It was time for a new storyline and not a major rehash/duplicate of the original series opener.I did enjoy Riddick's new pet dog.  That was some great CGI effects. I would watch one more Riddick finale but it should be done with a flare of how the baddest man in the universe confronts those that want to kill him.  I would like to see Riddick going after them instead of being trapped on a planet and having to escape!

Other than those few moments, this film dragged on with a bad story, worse acting and an overall sloppy feeling. I will not ruin anything with spoiler information in this review, but I will say that if there is any comparison I could make with other movies it would be the following:1. Pitch Black is equivalent to Star Wars IV: A New Hope2. The Chronicles of Riddick is equivalent to Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back3. Riddick is equivalent the lame sequel to Star Wars, Star Wars I: A Phantom Menace.I am in no way saying that any of these movies are comparable, I am just comparing these in their own categories and by my personal scale of awesomeness gauge. To elaborate, in the fantasy world of Riddick, I would say Pitch Black was the original  movie of the series that set the stage for great things, as Star Wars: A New Hope was for the world of Star Wars. With Riddick it seems they decided to skip Return of the Jedi and go straight for the depressing and disappointing Phantom Menace, as the story lacked depth, had overly cheesy lines and seemed to just be banking on sales because of the name.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2GMUNBN9HKRZS	John D. Aldridge	The tough to survive beginning I like, Riddick being Riddick. Befriending the dog I like. When the merchs show up it becomes ordinary, with diluted drama. I don't care about the merchs, their problems, their clashes between themselves. What I would have found interesting is no merchs, but something like Riddick and his dog in a battle against some kinda hostile predatory tribe. Anyway, as Vin D. states in one of the DVD extras he had mortgaged his house to get this film made. Grandiose ideas were not affordable. Riddick is a character us guys like. Would like to see a few more outings. Put him in tense situations that challenge his unique qualities. Avoid past scenarios. The film is competently made. It's watchable, and enjoyable. The dog is quite an impressive fabrication. Did they do Mocap using a real dog? Anyway give this a shot. And hope for more Riddick.	4.0	Some good, some OK, but still worth it	2014-04-25	0	0	0

I really enjoyed the story BUT the only thing I did not like is it is too dark. This sequel reminds me of Pitch Black; too dark to see anything. The only light you get during the dark scenes are from the character's flashlights on their guns or the lightning that is coming from the storm towards the end of the movie.

Recently, I rewatched it again and was surprisingly enjoyed.  I then bought the blu-ray version.  I watched the unrated director's cut, but I prefer the theater version.  As a general rule for me, I almost always prefer the theatrical version, because this version was best tested before theater debut and preferred by the director.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3EZTI5625BXO9	"Jonathan P. Flynn ""Jonathanpatr"""	I have loved this franchise since I watched the second installment, and Vin Diesel has developed his character really well. However, I am now and have always been dismayed at how science fiction is often reduced to slimy creatures getting killed or killing. This was a really really cool creature! But to have millions of them getting squished and shot and cut was just splatter gore, not sci fi. A rag-tag group, led by Riddick, staying in the line between skin shattering dark and cold and vaporizing sun (with Dame Judy Dench in the cast) gave me a science fiction movie I can watch several times (3). Wasting the plot from before and discarding Urban--a willing adversary--was a bad choice. Again, the character is more fleshed out now, less superhero and more reluctant force of semi-good. I like that. Just a little hint to Universal, we are ready for females who are more than sexual fodder. A great actress like Katee Sackoff should not be wasted in such a narrow role. I know Vin Diesel is open to better interpretations and leads. I look forward to the next iteration...	4.0	long awaited sequel was a little off	2014-02-16	0	0	0

Otherwise you will spend two hours watching this and think &#34;that's about what it was like going through airport security the last time I flew somewhere&#34;.This movie is not to be missed as it is a stepping stone to the next in the series which hopefully will have more meat on the bone in terms of a big idea plot surrounded by story lines.  You may be clueless nonetheless if you have not been following along.  So get on board.  This is one of those great big, really long movies where you can take calls or go grocery shopping and when you get back you haven't missed anything.  Except the dog.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A26JMA4B5QPHJT	Joshua Rakes	I think this movie was great. Riddick was thrust into a situation he&#8217;s never been in before. He&#8217;s on a desolated rock of a world, being hunted by &#8220;Merc&#8217;s&#8221; all while evading the predators that inhabit the planet. Johns is in a relentless pursuit to capture Riddick, no matter what barriers he must tear down. They all end up relying on each other to fight the predators on their home turf. Hold on, I don&#8217;t remember if I&#8217;m reviewing the first or the last movie. Well, I think I&#8217;m just gonna wing it from this point and review the movie the way I think it should have been.Riddick is a middle aged degenerate, constantly being forced to just do what he&#8217;s told and follow the crowd. He has relationship problems with his girlfriend because he refuses to commit to a shallow life with her. She seems to control everything and he just wants to be free and uninhabited.  His professional life is in shambles as well, working for an uncharismatic boss at his 9 to 5 Monday through Friday job for an IT firm known as &#8220;Initech.&#8221; He wants to do something different with his life, but has no motivation to make a move in the desired direction. Well dang, I must&#8217;ve have been drinking cause I just mixed up Riddick and Office Space.Why doesn&#8217;t Riddick just get some cool sunglasses? He never really swims with his goggles. When he does hit the water,&#8230;&#8230; no goggles. What&#8217;s up with the blonde chick. I thought she was from the last movie, but I guess not. She&#8217;s the annoying girl from Battlestar Galctica. I have to say, she kinda ruined that show from me. I was hoping Riddick would have punched her in the face for being so dumb on that show, but nooooooo. He wanted to make sweet love to her.Anyways, it was a good movie. I liked the action, although Batista didn&#8217;t power bomb Riddick, it was rather entertaining. I would definitely recommend this movie to my great grandmother.

I like to think because his home world of birth was destroyed and he is the ferocious retributor of excellent record. He brings the freshly opened cans of whip ass in a way that makes one cheer for the outlaw. Hope Diesel makes more movies in this series however the story telling  needs to improve.If Diesel and his company can find stories to be adapted from other stories in other languages and cultures maybe a harvest can be had. Also if John Scalzi  might be interested in a provided story then more power to all. Although Scalzi is an excellent writer and maybe screenplay writer (I am not so knowledgeable); and aware he is familiar and comfortable with the &#34;Star Trek&#34; franchise and writes easily Galaxy wide civilization travel capable and a military centralized government. He has a dark underlying intriguing principal earth and its inhabitants as mushrooms and believing space is hostile and wanting to destroy humans not part of Colonial Defense Forces.

When he activates an emergency beacon that alerts two ships he must confront a band of mercenaries and the other captained by a man from Riddick's past.I have been a Vin Diesel fan for a while and like the coolness he brings to his roles and I liked the original Chronicles movie and while I was eager to see this new installment, however I felt disappointed in this sequel.  Vin Diesel was solid as his character bringing that same cool alter ego that he has with the role but even he couldn't save the storyline.  As other have said this movie seems a bit like the movie Pitch Black.  The movie starts very slow as well with very little happening other than Riddick battling the elements and some weird poorly designed CGI beasts.  The special effects and CGI part of the movie seem to be suffering the effects of a lower budget and it shows from the beasts to the flying &#34;hogs&#34; as they call them.  But I could have dealt with just the poor CGI but the story line was really the weak point here.  With the first half mainly concerned about Riddick's relationship with his alien dog and the second half more concerned about a battle of 11 to one and the last man standing kind of thing and turns into something that lacks originality in story and strays from a story with a point to one where there is nothing but Riddick showing he is superior with the goal of eliminating all the mercenaries and then goes to save them all against the beasts.As for me, a totally unsatisfying storyline for such a good character. This movie could have been so much more, Vin Diesel does all he can but with the lackluster script there is only so much you can do.

Really I was hoping for this one to bring some life (ie moredepth of character and story--I guess I was delusional) into theseries.  Had it been done well, it might have propelled this on forseveral more films.  Instead the writer(s) and director chose a safepath: just more of the same, in a different location.The plot?  What plot?  Riddick gets dumped on the wrong world(he thought it was his home planet, but it's not) then 2 ships showup, both crew looking to capture him.  You just know he's not gonnastay captured &#60;yawn&#62;.

I was expecting much more for the sequel to Chronicles of Riddick. I mean, it was &#34;chronicles&#34; so I'm expecting some good, interesting stuff as the Lord Marshal in the sequel. Chronicles was well written, well acted, had excellent cinematography, and very interesting characters, good, bad, and ugly. Riddick is poorly written, Vin Diesel is too old for the part, none of the characters are of any interest aside from the lead.Riddick is almost a re-write of Pitch Black, stuck on a planet against a mass of vicious animals while trying to get a power source to get a ship up and running to get off planet. Except this time the animals are on land instead of flying. Pitch Black was much better. The only time I cared for any of the characters in Riddick was when his dog thing died. The first half of the movie I'm just waiting for him to get off the planet. This doesn't bode well for the last movie in franchise.	3.0	Not even close.	2014-02-24	1	1	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AFOHUSVNZZ49W	K. Reynolds	VIN DIESEL has skills. In &#8220;Vin&#8217;s Riddick,&#8221; a bonus feature available on both Blu-ray and DVD, executive producer Samantha Vincent says, &#8220;He started his career as a writer, director, producer, and actor. So wearing these multiple hats is something he&#8217;s done from the beginning.&#8221;Director/co-writer David Twohy says, &#8220;Vin always had a sense of himself as something bigger than what he was when I cast him in &#8216;Pitch Black,&#8217;&#8221; his first lead role. In &#8220;Chronicles of Riddick,&#8221; Diesel became a producer and, by the third film, he had secured the rights from Universal Studios. Fans wanted the Riddick story to continue after &#8220;Chronicles&#8221; and the success of Diesel&#8217;s other franchise, &#8220;Fast & Furious.&#8221;Vin himself tells us that, even 10 years after &#8220;Chronicles,&#8221; Facebook fans were saying, &#8220;If we all gave you $10 each, you could make it yourself.&#8221;Which is, essentially, what he did in &#8220;Riddick,&#8221; bringing his anti-hero back to the screen and his more vulnerable, hard-scrabble roots for an adventure we can sink our teeth into.Kind of what we imagine happens to the alien vulture that swoops down on our battered hero in the opening. Comparisons to &#8220;Pitch Black&#8221; are certain. However, the rough and ready look is easier to believe in than the polish of &#8220;Chronicles.&#8221; The first part of the movie has no dialogue. Once the king of the Necromancers, Riddick has been left for dead on a desert planet. He&#8217;s in bad shape, with a broken leg, no supplies and no shelter. He digs himself out from under an avalanche to become the target of critters who&#8217;d like to make him into Riddick chow. But this John Wayne of the space age has other plans.We follow Riddick&#8217;s healing and discovery of other cave-dwelling, venomous mud monsters. Around that time we also meet the scene stealer, an &#8220;escape artist&#8221; dog-like creature. As seen in the previews, he&#8217;s a tiger-jackal mix native that Riddick rescues as a puppy. There&#8217;s no sentiment on Riddick&#8217;s part; he needs something to experiment on to get past the cave monsters. Still, their scenes together are some of the best in the show, and it&#8217;s the dog who alerts Riddick to the planet&#8217;s hidden danger.Next thing we know, Riddick is at a mercenary maintenance station sending a beacon to let the bounty hunters know where to find him. Two teams arrive &#8211;and both quickly learn this will be no simple pick up; Riddick promises to let them leave as long as they give him a ship so he can depart himself. The pace slows as the mercs introduce themselves, but starts escalating again once Riddick begins picking them off.Both the Blu-ray and DVD are loaded with extras, although the Blu-ray gets great exclusives, such as an unrated director&#8217;s cut along with the theatrical release. The director&#8217;s cut adds 8 minutes, including an extended ending.Extras included on both discs are &#8220;Meet the Mercs,&#8221; which provides background on the actors and how they created their parts. Most interesting is learning how a sequence was created for Keri Hilson, who auditioned for the part of Dahl, a role that went to Katee Sackhoff, formerly of the new &#8220;Battlestar Galactica.&#8221; Along with &#8220;Vin&#8217;s Riddick,&#8221; there&#8217;s &#8220;Riddick: Blindsided,&#8221; a short motion-animated film showing an alternate beginning, some of which is used in the film.Blu-ray exclusives feature &#8220;The World of Riddick,&#8221; demonstrating the technical world- and set-building details from Twohy, Vincent, production designer Joseph Nemec III, visual effects supervisor Gunnar Hansen, and director of photography David Eggby, who also worked on &#8220;Pitch Black.&#8221; Hansen says inspiration for the planet came from the Bisti Badlands of New Mexico, a haunting expanse of eroded rocks and plateaus hidden away in the San Juan Basin. It might remind some of Monument Valley, where John Houston shot many of his films. Bisti is protected land and Twohy&#8217;s crew was not allowed to shoot there. Still, comparison photos of the desert and scenes from &#8220;Riddick&#8217;s&#8221; world show how Bisti plays a significant role in creating the look of the film. We also see how they used Doberman Pinschers as stop-motion capture artists, puppets and CG as the basis for the jackal-dogs.&#8220;World of Riddick&#8221; also runs through the development of the mercenary stopover or maintenance station. It&#8217;s run by solar energy and has an abandoned military post-look. Life-size space ships were built for the set. It&#8217;s amazing to learn what can be done with Styrofoam, plywood, paint and special effects, but, from ships to sets, it all looks real.There&#8217;s more to learn in &#8220;Riddickian Tech,&#8221; especially about the &#8220;jet hogs&#8221; &#8211; terrific hover bikes who owe their grit to Harley Davidson. Nemic explains they used parts from a variety of things &#8211; turbine boosters, electronics, thrusters that work like those on a Harrier &#8211; to create a &#8220;retro jet cycle.&#8221; The bikes look like a collection of rusted nuts, bolts and turbines, with a seat similar to a Western saddle, and I want one.&#8220;The Twohy Touch&#8221; pulls it all together with an interview from the director on his approach to the film.None of the featurettes are much longer than 10 minutes, which goes to show extras don&#8217;t have to be hours-long to say what they need to in an interesting and memorable way. There&#8217;s no commentary, but do we really need one? What&#8217;s good is &#8220;Riddick&#8221; itself &#8211; a return to a gritty, action-filled space adventure and a hero we&#8217;re glad to see again.	5.0	Blu-ray exclusives showcase 'Riddick'	2014-01-16	2	1	1

This is how the story goes: When Riddick is left for dead on a lifeless planet, however, he realizes that he is not alone. With a storm due to hit the planet, Riddick activates an emergency beacon from an abandoned outpost on the planet. 2 ships respond to the beacon's signal, one of them a mercenary ship and the other ship, piloted by someone connected to Riddick's past.The cast led by Vin Diesel (also produced) (as Riddick) is great.

Then when this came out in the theater, hubby and I went to see it-- he'd never seen the others, but really liked this one. So I got this for him for his birthday. Now we have the whole set.

I read up on the background about how this latest movie came to be before I watched the movie. Therefore, I knew about the type of digital graphics used and the budget they worked with before I watched the movie. I thought for a 30 million dollar movie that it turned out AWESOME!The plot is great. I think it's brilliant they went back to a scenario similar to Pitch Black (Riddick stranded on a strange planet). There, the similarities end. Its definitely not a knock off of Pitch Black.I enjoyed the banter of the movie, the casting was very well done, and Vin Diesel turned in another great performance as the anti-hero Riddick.	5.0	Highly enjoyable	2013-12-20	2	1	1
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1NA3BY2VED6TT	K. Seyfert	To begin, yes I'm a fan of this series and love both of the preceding installments (Pitch Black/Chronicles of Riddick).  However, after sitting through this sequel last night I found myself very unsatisfied with what I had watched.If you were to watch Pitch Black and Riddick side by side the only significant differences you'll find is the first 20 minutes or so -&#62; this time around you follow Vin as he recovers from being betrayed and finds himself an odd choice for a pet.  Along with this there is also significantly less time spent fighting off the aliens that reveal themselves as the darkness and rain arrives.  This movie literally felt like a cheaper version of Pitch Black (and Pitch Black was a low budget film..).The struggles between the aliens began and ended within 12-15 minutes and you're left with a scene with Johns and Riddick are facing one another in opposing aircrafts exchanging hokey dialogue and then the credits come.For as much as I typically like these movies, this was just bad and there is no way around that.	2.0	If You Saw Pitch Black You've Basically Already Seen This..	2014-01-18	3	3	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1DWUPXRD1HN1B	Kurt Russell	This movie has the worst middle of any movie ever. It's as if the makers had never seen another movie before or understood basic structure. The beginning is quite good, and the end is fine, but why the creators thought that having a whole new batch of characters star in the middle for an hour while completely removing the eponymous hero from the proceedings, is really mind-boggling.The bookending sections with Riddick and all the SFX are 3 to 4-star, with some decent action/horror more akin to the original &#34;Pitch Black&#34; than the second one.But that godawful middle is pure 1-star garbage, equivalent to straight-to-video drek with bad actors and bad dialog doing nothing in a drab, static environment, all without Riddick. I think Diesel had to go make a &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; in the midst of the shoot and told everyone to keep making a movie until he got back.	2.0	Not as good as either of the first two	2014-02-03	1	0	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1NHOTCBLJIBS1	Leif C Tornquist	Someone should tell Vin Diesel (God bless him) that the Riddick franchise is dead. Does anybody really care about a dude with a preternatural gifts wasting faceless &#34;mercs&#34; movie after movie? Because that seems to be where the franchise is going after this latest installment. The more or less ad hoc series picked up some steam in the last movie when they introduced a somewhat compelling overarching narrative with the Necromongers. This movie ditches that narrative and ends up dying long, uninspired death on some desert planet where Riddick and a bunch of blustering mercs play a few rounds of grab ass and shoot at each other. Although Diesel seems committed to the concept, the series has yet to properly develop a compelling narrative arc for Riddick.	2.0	A Failing Franchise Continues to Fail	2014-04-29	0	0	0

However, that was not the case.  I have to say I was pretty disappointed in what they came up with in this film.  This film is basically the first film, Pitch Black, revisited.  It seems that creativity and good ideas ran pretty short for this time around.  I would have rather seen a movie that centered on the ending from The Chronicles Of Riddick.  Instead, they go back to what they already did in the first film.  Don't get me wrong, I did like the movie, it's just they've ran the classic most-wanted man in the universe plot into the ground.  I wanted to see a story line that was something different, new, and better, and this was anything but that.	2.0	Riddick Not That Great	2014-01-17	2	1	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3V6Z4RCDGRC44	"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t..."	I realize many Riddick fans will disagree with my review, and that's OK. We all have different movies we like and dislike. I just ask that you read my reasons behind my thoughts and consider the point of view I'm coming from. Note there are spoilers in this write-up.First, I adore the Riddick series up to the final movie, Riddick. I've seen Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick many, many times. I love Vin Diesel and his alpha-male character. In Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, his relationship with Kyra, the subtlety of the situation, was great. There were so many aspects of these movies that shone. The sense of man-against-the-world. The nuances of the cultures. Judi Densch was super as Aereon, the neutral entity. Karl Urban as Vaako and Thandie Newton as his conniving wife were great. There were so many characters in here which filled out the environment. The special effects were cool. It was immensely satisfying to watch.So I went into this third version of Riddick with great anticipation.The plot is pared down. That's fine. I loved the first Pitch Black and that had a fairly simple plot. In fact, it was pretty much this plot. Riddick on a planet. Mercenaries out to grab him. Riddick takes them all on. Beasties. Riddick wins.Where the first two movies had superb writing and everything that happened cohesively made sense, many aspects of this one felt as if the writers took shortcuts and didn't bother to map out an overall scenario. Why would the bad guys drop Riddick on a planet which had a fully stocked mercenary base on it? Surely they knew the reputation of this guy. I know they intended to kill him - but still, you plan for all eventualities. Surely you drop him on a completely abandoned planet with NO chance of getting off. Why would the mercenaries build a base on this planet covered with death-creatures and not leave a large warning in the base to let people know this happens occasionally? You can't tell me with all their sci-fi scanning devices that they didn't notice the bodies beneath the sand. That's what mercenaries excel at - finding hiding bodies. There's situation after situation like this. The writers could easily have made minor tweaks so all of this made sense, but they didn't bother.I do love many of the special effects in this. The puppy was quite real feeling and had expressive body language. The creatures were appropriately threatening. But in other cases the sets felt cheezy. It was clearly them standing on a stage and not a real planet. Again, just a little bit more effort would have eliminated this problem.But the real issue - the one that has me just shaking my head in disbelief - has to do with the women in this.Again, I realize this is a fantasy. But look at the first two movies! Kyra was amazing. Aereon was great. Dame Vaako was great! These were fantasy women with grit and strength. They had to be, to live in this world. They helped Riddick then become even stronger, as he dealt with and interacted with these women.So, what do we have in this latest incarnation of Riddick?Women group 1: Four totally naked slave consorts that Riddick Fs every chance he can get. They were slaves ripped from their homeworld, forced against their will to become whores. Riddick doesn't care. He Fs them as much as he can until he gets taken away.Woman 2: Captured woman who is repeaetedly Fed by the &#34;bad&#34; mercenary group. She's shaking and traumatized by her ordeal. So she's released and shot in the back. The lead merc says he was getting too fond of her so he decided to kill her. I realize this is a way of showing these mercs are bad, but still. Repeatedly raped, traumatized woman forced to be a whore. Isn't this what we had in group 1 where Riddick was the culprit?Woman 3: Starbuck!! I adore Battlestar Galactica and Katee Sackhoff. I was just so thrilled that she was in this movie as Dahl. And then my joy turned to frustration. What is Katee's role in this? To be someone every other guy wants to F. We get a view of her naked breast and Riddick comments on her nipple color. Bad merc tries to rape her. Riddick boasts that by the end of the battle she'll beg him to F her, even though she turns away all the other men. Sure enough, at the end, she asks him to F her, and one of the last lines is about Riddick wanting her to keep her &#34;box&#34; warm for him. So he can F her some more.And that's it.Good God Almighty. That's the fantasy version of women? Whores that want it, whores that are raped, and tough women who resist other guys but the hero is so studly that she gives in and begs him for sex?It's not that the Riddick series has always been like this. The first two movies were great! Where in the world did this mentality come in? And even more concerning to me, why do so many viewers not even blink an eye that this is how women are shown? Do they think it normal that women are either whores, rape victims, or women who secretly crave a tough guy to take them? You could say that at least Katee fought off her rapist. Great. But there's still the very clear statement here, in pretty much every scene, that she is there for sex. Every guy just wants to F her, and eventually the hero will break her down and make her beg for it. That's her purpose in life, to be Fed.She's a superb fighter, a great sniper, and has many other strengths - but the attention she gets is solely about a guy stripping her naked and using her.Is this really the level our fantasy movies have sunk to? That women are solely sex dolls to be grabbed, used, and discarded? Maybe killed if they get in the way?Conan had Valeria, a tough-as-nails fighter who matched him. Madmartigan had Sorsha, amazing with a sword. Riddick has ... slave whores? And a &#34;warm box&#34;?This is a fantasy world men or women want? Why not fantasize about living on a planet with cyborg sex dolls?	2.0	SO Disappointed - I Adored the First Two Movies - Spoilers	2014-07-14	2	2	0

In fact, the only  major problem I had with this movie was the complete 180 from the last film.  Without ruining it for those who have not watched, He became very important across the whole galaxy, yet this movie spends about 3 minutes giving a somewhat simple and unrealistic break from that plotline to strand him (yet again) on (yet another) deadly planet.You would have assumed that from the level of fame and his previous position, even though there were those who were for and against him, I felt really let down in the way that I felt there was a lot more story there. They should have spent more time writing a plot towards his eventual fall from grace instead of the sudden yet kind of predictable manner in which they did.	4.0	Not Dissapointed.	2013-12-20	2	1	1

As always, the action sequences are amazing. The supporting characters are two dimensional but I don't think we have come to expect much else from this series.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A24KZBAAUTC83R	Mace & Lacey Gannon	This is the only franchise we like this actor in. Fast 5 movies are stupid and his acting in them is terrible.But like some other actors who totally 'fit in' perfectly in a role, Riddick is perfect for Vin Diesel. Much like Blade was for Wesley Snipes. They just have that particular character inside them, fitting like a 2nd skin.For the life of us, we can't figure how a pretty solid B-movie like Pitch Black was better recieved by fans than the bigger and better Chronicles of Riddick. HUH?! They wanted it dumbed down more. Complained that there were not any monsters in the sequel. We'll take style over substance any day of the week. Chronicles of Riddick was awesome, and we will state right here that it was hands down one of the best science fiction action movies ever made.Now, after all of these years, we finally get Riddick. We went in hoping for the best, expecting a dumbed down version that the 'fans' yelled and cried they wanted, not the story-and-character-driven and much better special effects extravaganza that Chronicles was.Now, after seeing and thinking over this much anticipated 3rd installment, we have come to the conclusion that it at least wasn't the pile of crap most half-assed sci-fi small budget movies come out with. (And it was surely better than all the Fast 5 movies we ever saw!)For what it was, (Pitch Black 2, really!), Riddick was very enjoyable. Had more laughs than most comedies, (Hangover 2 & 3 anybody!), and had TONS of creature features for the 'dumbed down' fanbase that screamed for it. The cast was good for what storyline it had. Katie Sackoff's character could have really come off much better since she has the acting chops. But for what it was, a back to B-movie basics, due to those hordes of 'stupid fans' that didn't support the bigger and much better Chronicles, director Twohy and producer/actor Vin Diesel gave us at least a fun time at the movies.A good pulp sci-fi action/adventure is in our blood. So, basically, we did like the film. But would have much more like to've seen a richer film in which the sequel was leading us to. LOVED the beginning. With Riddick being stranded on a very hostile and creature-filled savage world. Twohy and Vin Diesel did a solid job here. We love dogs, so to have Riddick get himself an alien pet was a major kudos for animal lovers out there. You don't see this being done in sci-fi/fantasy movies.I think a movie staying in this form might have been even better, just having Riddick and alien dog friend living off the harsh and brutal savage planet. Maybe running into a race of alien cannibal beings. Instead of the usual Riddick battling mercs story. And we love mercenary books and movies! (Riddick 3?) We hope so.We really didn't have any major issues with this new movie, until the end. The ending was not bad, but left us wanting more, especially in terms of 'proper endings' go. We loved how the director and Vin connected the 1st movie with this one, but leaving a certain bounty hunter alive was a stretch. Riddick would not have done this. Nor would the merc father. Rather would have seen everybody die except for Riddick riding off into the far off reaches of space with just Katie Sackoff.But, as it is, we really enjoyed the action-filled adventure of this latest Riddick. His dark humor was great. Just like the previous movies, Riddick comes up with great one-liners that don't come off as eye-rolling stupidity. We also love that Riddick doesn't pander to the PG-13 rating that most do nowadays. We expect our Riddick to be hardcore R action and sexually charged. And this one was. Thank you for sticking with that!Although it was dumbed down, Riddick ending up being another classic B-Movie in the best sense. Harking back to the days of pulp action heroes from Jeremiah Johnson to Conan the Barbarian. We really hope for a 4th and bigger entry in this series. It truly deserves it.	4.0	Riddick Dumbed Down 3rd Entry	2013-09-13	10	6	4

However, If you were hoping that the movie Riddick would be a satisfying conclusion to the character Riddick's story arc you're in for a disappointment.I'm sure that the ending of Chronicles gave everyone the impression that we would see a strong Necromonger story arc but that's not what this movie brings to the table.

So we'll probably never see another Riddick film as a result.  Which is a big shame because this movie is actually really good. If you're a fan of science fiction and action films this will be right up your alley. I hope Vin Diesel gets a cut of DVD sales as he had to spend all of his money to get this made.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AZZ4GD20C58ND	M. Brookes	I've enjoyed the Riddick series so far (yes even the second film), he's a fun character, strong, some cool moves and amusing one-liners. Plus the fact that he's not a clean cut hero makes him more fun to watch. This third film in the series didn't disappoint, it starts with him having to survive on a hostile planet with some nasty creatures and after a while, a cool pet.Eventually he finds a mercenary base that enables him to call off world, luring a ship of mercenaries after the bounty on his head. Two teams arrive, the first want him dead, the second (led by someone with a familiar name from the first film) wants him alive. Naturally Riddick cares for neither of those options but wants one of the ships so he can leave.The film ties off the connection with the second film quite quickly and returns to the format from the original, which gets my vote. Once again we have alien monsters hunting the humans (who are better equipped than those in Pitch black, not that it helps them much), the creatures are pretty cool. Nasty and alien looking, although I preferred the design of the creatures from Pitch Black, these do make suitable bad guys.Riddick is the star of the show of course, but the members of the two crews have their moments and for Battlestar fans there's Katy Sackoff as the token female. The pacing is good, the action starts quickly and keeps going through the film. All in all it's an entertaining piece of sci-fi action, worth a watch.	4.0	A fun watch	2014-01-16	0	0	0

Of course I am a Vin Diesel fan, and so my review will be skewed because of that fact, but in order to be a reviewer I have to distance myself a bit and take a look at the Whole...So, having said that, I found the movie a very solid action flick that had very few (if any) lulls in the 'attention grabbing' department. The plot also solid because it picks right up after the last Riddick.  It made sense. So few sequels catch that feeling of continuation that has brought the fan back for more in the first place.In this installment of Riddick, the Necromongers turn on their new king. And wasting little time in doing so. Riddick commands his new minions to return him to Fury for some unfinished business. But instead, they deceive him, and drop him off on a hellish planet and try their best to leave him for dead. As have so many others.But Riddick being ....well...Riddick, he soon adapts to a desert world of foul pools of poison waters where giant amphibian scorpions live. And as he struggles to find fresh water, he becomes the object of a relentless pursuit by packs of hellish canine beasts that stand six foot tall at the shoulder and look like a cross between a giant Doberman and  a Hyena!  Once again Riddick being Riddick, within a year or so he has made himself at home. He even adopts one of the canine beasts that soon turns out to be his best friend. He has once again made a life that he would thrive and be happy in.....if only things would stop going to hell for him. Off in the distance, his new friend warns him of a storm coming. But no normal shower this. Instead a whole sea of the scorpion monstrosities travel beneath the thrashing rain.....suddenly it all makes sense....all the pools of poison water...each infested with the poisonous amphibians...what will Riddick do?Great story. And a great CAST of unknowns are about to show up. Because he has no other choice but to send for help....But bounty hunters aren't the coastguard!	5.0	Very strong story line.	2014-01-21	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2YXKSUFYUB0XY	Michael DePietro	A sequel in the Chronicles of Riddick series. Riddick is stranded on a desolate planet populated with large jackal like dogs, and scorpion like insect creatures who want to eat him ( literally). Later on in the film we add violent bounty hunters who merely want to collect his head in a box ( literally) for the ransom payoff, as the payoff is doubled if Riddick is dead. Oh yes Riddick must also deal with no food, no water and a broken leg. The amusement is seeing how Riddick handles on this. Which if you are familiar with the series is by killing everything and almost everyone. No surprises, not a lot of plot, but can be mildly distracting if you watch on an iPad while working out on your treadmill.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	I've been a fan of Riddick (Vin Diesel) since his debut, way back in &#34;Pitch Black&#34; when the glassy-eyed badass from the underworld of space first showed us that his streetfighting skills were more than a match for sound-sensing aliens.  Three films and five years later after the last installment, he's come full circle with a movie named merely &#34;Riddick.&#34;Where last we saw Riddick, he followed the Necromonger motto of &#34;you keep what you kill&#34; to its logical conclusion, which led to him killing the Lord Marshall and taking his place, Conan-style, on the throne. But it turns out Riddick didn't quite fulfill the oath required for the office, and with assassins lurking everywhere (particularly in his harem), things simply aren't fun anymore.  Riddick wants out, and strikes a deal with Commander Vaako (Karl Urban) to take him back to his homeworld of Furya (fans will remember Riddick is a Furyan, the last of his kind). Vaako gets to be Lord Marshall in exchange.  Sounds simple, right?It's perhaps no surprise that the Necromongers are not content to let Riddick walk off into the sunset.  Krone (Andreas Apergis), Vaako's right-hand man, tries to kill Riddick off.  And for a brief moment we see Riddick with the same superpowers the previous Lord Marshall had in the last act of the previous film.  Exactly how one acquires these powers (given that he didn't take the oath) is an open question -- as well as when he loses them.  But needless to say Riddick survives the betrayal at great personal cost on a very hostile planet that isn't Furya.Despite some leaps of logic, for the first half of the film &#34;Riddick&#34; is near perfection.  It's Riddick, being his badass self, against a host of vicious creatures, ranging from jackal-like canines to mud demons.  The mud demons are the most innovative part of the film, and Riddick's discovery of their ecology is part of the joy of &#34;Riddick.&#34;  His eventual friendship with a jackal beast even makes Riddick a likable Davy Crockett of outer space.Then everybody else shows up.  To be fair, Riddick invited them there, brazenly showing his face on a distress beacon to lure mercenaries with the intent of hijacking one of their ships.  It's at this point that &#34;Riddick&#34; takes a turn for the worse as every sci-fi macho stereotype shows up to strut and spit, mucking up the elegant beauty that was the first half of the film.The first group is a bunch of space pirates led by a filthy and violent fellow named Santana (Jordi Molla).  The second is a military-style operation led by the crisp Boss Johns (Matt Nable). It's of note that accompanying Johns' team is sniper Dahl (Katee Sackhoff).  Riddick proceeds to play a cat-and-mouse game with the mercenaries, offing them one by one, interspersed with some pretty bad dialogue in which Riddick laughs at his enemies and promises to do things to the women.There are some ties to the previous films, most specifically in Boss Johns' connecting to a character from &#34;Pitch Black.&#34; It's also worth noting that the religious figure here, instead of being Muslim, is firmly Christian -- and that's a shame, as &#34;Pitch Black&#34; was willing to differentiate its future with a non-European perspective.In a sense, that's the flaw of &#34;Riddick&#34;: there's a distinct string of misogyny running throughout -- at one point, Santana tries to rape Dahl but it's no big deal because she fights him off. The fact that &#34;Dahl&#34; sounds like &#34;doll&#34; and that Sackhoff takes off her top are certainly not related.Riddick's stealth and killing skills border on Batman-levels -- which he didn't have when facing down against the mud demons.  And of course, those mud demons show up in great numbers due to a natural phenomenon. Or to put it another way, &#34;Riddick&#34; is a lot like &#34;Pitch Black&#34; only with more nudity.That said, &#34;Riddick&#34; isn't a bad film, and is still arguably better than &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;  But setting the bar low doesn't make it an improvement.  This is a bridge film to get us to a bigger budget in the next installment. Hopefully it's worth the wait.	3.0	Leaping the low bar	2013-12-01	7	5	2

About 20 minutes into this film, I remembered how bad the first Riddick movie was and this sequel is worse. The plot could have been written by a third grader, poorly directed, horrible editing, and bad acting by all, except for Vin who does the best with what he was given. The directors cut with alternate ending adds very little if anything. By the way where exactly was the original ending or maybe that was the alternate. I like Vin Diesel a lot, but him mumbling to himself throughout most of the movie and long tedious, repetitive fight scenes with alien monsters didn't do it for me.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.Eight years after escaped criminal Richard Riddick endured the latest of his ""Chronicled"" adventures, producer and star Vin Diesel along with director and co-writer David Twohy bring him back to life in this less ambitious film. In fact, the filmmakers make a mostly successful stab at the feel of the original movie in the franchise, ""Pitch Black"" (2000).Here Riddick (Diesel) is double crossed after years of playing royalty on some distant planet. By his own admission, he had gotten soft. He is unceremoniously dumped on a scorched planet devoid of humans but with plenty of local carnivores. With years of a life of luxury and debauchery he had lost his edge.  Riddick is quickly forced to get it back as his broken body must now deal with the large hyena-like creatures and the nasty water-serpents, both of which are looking for a meal.Riddick stumbles upon an abandon research facility and sends out a distress signal. Once he has been identified, a couple ships of mercs (mercenaries) set down after him. One for the reward (doubled if head brought back) and one out for revenge. A reference that goes back to ""Pitch Black."" The 2 assembled crews at first are competitors but eventually must work together, not only to kill or capture Riddick but to deal with the local fauna.The all-male crews, but for lesbian (or not) Dahl (Katee Sackhoff), are your standard ruffian himbos for the most part. The most diabolical is led by Santana (Jordi Molla). The other is led by the father (Matt Nable) of the Johns character from ""Pitch Black."" He wants answers as to what happen to his son. For most of the film, Riddick is in his full Rambo mode with elaborate traps, many of which are cool if not realistic. The sets here are pretty good, but I don't see any Oscars for technical designs.I did like the creature features, especially in the final act as Riddick pulls out all the stops to escape. Is this movie an improvement over ""The Chronicles of Riddick?"" Yes, the tension and sparseness of a good ""B"" movie are there. Does it equal the terror and horror of ""Pitch Black?"" Not quite. Will there be more Riddick adventures? That depends on how well this film does. For me, yeah I like the character."	4.0	3 1/2 stars for Richard Riddick's roucous return	2013-09-13	2	1	1

Vin Diesel in his best role delivers memorable lines and lethal kills. The CGI is very good and the movie has a good build up and payoff. The ending could have been better than the quick one chosen, but Riddick is a worthy action/sci-fi/horror hybrid that reminds us why Vin Diesel was a star to watch after 2000's Pitch Black.	4.0	Finally, Riddick is Back	2013-09-07	2	0	2

I bought it since I like the series and it's the only action Sci-Fi that interests me.  The score is the same as last time, but it makes for a good tune. The writer did well in keeping the scenes consistent and by making it 2 hours to make up for Riddick needing to heal. There was one spot where Riddick could have used the word &#34;epic&#34; but the Twohy could see how hackneyed it would sound.

Where you see people saying stuff about this movie being essentially a rip off/ repeat of pitch black, yes, they were correct.I think still some of the scenes are classic riddick. but overall, this really showed us nothing new and was a step back. not a huge deal. i think this one is a disappointment but riddick will be back and next one will be great! wait and see.thinking back, there are definitely several scenes in this movie, particularly the interaction between riddick and the bounty hunters where he is going the classic tough guy that were pretty cool. but over all this is an incredibly stupid film that was hard to believe. The interaction and thinking of the main bounty guy and riddick was absurd. i dont want to spoil anything so i will say no more. but i walked away thinking some of the other posts here are very much correct. flat out did not make sense and was hard to swallow.overall, i would vote this one as a skip.	3.0	Worst (and only bad) Riddick.	2014-01-04	4	2	2

Not worth keeping? ok strange because no one can beat riddick right.? so he's bamboozled into this planet which turns out to be as bad as the one he escaped . Luckily for him theirs a huge bounty on his head that will make anyone go to the end of the universe to find him. Only to find themselves being rescued by the bounty they came to take.

With the ever growing trend of churning out PG-13 flicks, it's awesome that Riddick went back to rated R.  This movie only made it to the big screen because of Vin Diesel's passion for the character of Riddick.  He put up his own home to fund much of the budget.  He said he felt like he made a promise to the fans to bring it back.Vin wants to follow this movie up with at least another sequel with hopefully a much bigger budget and on a much bigger scale (think Chronicles).  Vin wants to take Riddick through the Underverse to Furya or something like that.  I hope it happens.  I absolutely love the Riddick universe and want to see the mythos expanded.  The problem is Vin isn't getting any younger.  I wish his priorities were the Riddick movies and not the Fast and Furious movies, but those Fast movies make all the money, unfortunately.  Vin says he can't put out sequels to Riddick like Fast and Furious because ""they're too dark"".  Come on, that's not the reason.

This Riddick movie was rushed, poorly plotted and very disjointed most of the time. Most of the film was staged in &#34;darkness&#34; with more music to hide some of the characters lines. One would have to watch this movie several times to even catch half the dialogue. In a nutshell, you would be far better off watching this movie on Pay for View; rather than purchasing it as I did.

I have seen both Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick. Both of those movie were just OK, so I was expecting about the same from this one, and that is what I got. Think the first tow movies were a bit thin on storyline? Well, this one's got even less of a plot. The plot is basically that Riddick has been stranded on a planet and needs to find a way to get off of it - no more, no less.There are some decent action scenes, but nothing fantastic. This is one of those movies I could watch once and be content to never watch again. It is definitely nothing that I would spend money on owning. If you are needing some sci-fi action, rent it and check it out.

The plot pretty much recycled-and I say that lightly-Pitch Black give, swapping characters for whomever you choose. It's probably better if you get this from the Red Box.

At the end of this film, Riddick is almost eaten by a huge hole, that is, a gigantic mouth with massive teeth attached; he is then rescued by a woman whose lesbian sexuality is somehow important to the film; he has converted her, she now wants him. While this film is surrounded by a hole umbrage &#8211; pun intended &#8211; the lack of acting skills and the lame script lets this film down. It&#8217;s like a mix of &#8220;Rambo&#8221;, &#8220;Alien&#8221; and &#8220;Starship Troopers&#8221; but with the mouth of Philip Marlowe on Riddick, played well by Vin Diesel.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AH88AEY9F6C9K	Orlando G. Acosta	Well&#8230; Technically, if you count Dark Fury, it&#8217;s the 4th installment but I am only counting previous live actions; Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick.Riddick falls short on quite a bit but it does a pretty good job retreading Pitch Black. Having known that this was basically a Pitch Black redux I was impressed by how well the filmmakers deceive you, throwing up all sorts of figurative smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand to trick you into believing the story is original. It&#8217;s done very convincingly by interjecting bits and pieces from Chronicles in the beginning and at the end; serving as story arch bookends of sorts. I actually did not have an issue with this &#8216;illusion&#8217; as it was executed well. As a fan of the previous two films, I felt I was thrown a pretty good sized bone in terms of giving me a bit of story to compliment Chronicles. One could think that at some point early on, David Twohy wanted to release a Chronicles of Riddick Directors Cut version 2.0, pulling a Lucas and inserting a few new scenes, and at the same time he wanted to remake Pitch Black with a bigger budget and fancier effects. He pitched this (no pun intended), was given 40 mil and instructed to put both of his ideas together and make a new film.riddickOkay&#8230;So you want to know if this is a good thing or a bad thing? It depends on how hardcore of a fan you are would be my answer. Like I said earlier, I loved the first two films. I respected them for the lush underverse world they created. The creatures, the necromongers; the overal cannon&#8230;You don&#8217;t get this level of originality too often in modern science fiction these days. Where this one hurts the franchise is it doesn&#8217;t bring a whole lot new to the table. A disposable subplot of Johns looking for answers about his son&#8217;s ill fated encounter with the Furyan goes absolutely nowhere. It makes no impact on the story but doesn&#8217;t detract from it either.On a technical side. I was bothered by the fact I knew this film was shot entirely in a confined soundstage before I even watched the special features. At times the camera is tracking the action you can tell there is no depth in the background. This can pull you out of the moment if you fixate on it long enough like I did a couple of times. Also, I know we are not watching a film like this expecting Oscar-worthy performances but some performances are really bad. Bad to the point that I&#8217;m not sure if it was done intentionally to elevate Vin Diesel&#8217;s delivery of deadpan lines or just for the &#8216;camp&#8217; effect. The Visuals are at times awe inspiring and at times they look like matte paintings. It would seem that the FX team were novices in their craft and did not realize how many FX shots go into a science fiction flick that is filmed entirely in a green box and they cut corners&#8230;A lot of corners.The score is mostly carried over from Chronicles, which is a good thing. Sometimes it has it&#8217;s rough moments but all in all it won&#8217;t make or break the experience.Bottom line.. Riddick IS enjoyable&#8230;If you liked the first two and enjoy Sci Fi action flicks. If you don&#8217;t, or are on the fence, this one won&#8217;t charm you over. It may push you further away from getting your feet wet in the pool that is this great genre. While I don&#8217;t like using numerical scores on films, I will agree with IMDB&#8217;s review average of 6.4&#8230;Maybe even go as high as 7 but no more. I hope that if there is a 4th one somebody reads this review and heeds my simple, honest gripes. This is a great world that has been created.

All these things make him cool, but the problem with this latest installment of Riddick is that it is the same story as Pitch Black with less cooler monsters. It's a step in the right direction from the last movie, but it's not a leap forward. I want to see Riddick grow up. I hope that maybe the next Riddick movie has him tied down in a bad desk job and then he has to find a way to escape that life to pursue his dream of running a yogurt stand.

If I critique first, you'll not read the rant expressing the core objection.I like sci-fi.  I like the Riddick character and how Vin Diesel plays him.  I liked the previous Riddick movies.  Didn't like this one as much as I wanted to.  Vin Diesel was great.  Special effects team first rate.  Creature animation as good as the past movies,creative and fluid.  Plot has such huge unbelievable holes they could have been made with a Death Star.  Costly film time animating a robot that does nothing.  Interstellar space ships carry no spares for their most important parts.  If they did, this move would have ZERO plot.Most of all, the insistence by a particular verbal crowd the only acceptable sci-fi is R rated because normal people cannot have sci-fi.  All sci-fi moves have to have nudity, foul language, unbelievable plots and meaningless images which have NOTHING to do with the story so only these few people and perverted critics will accept it.  If you had nothing but the violence, scary creatures, sense of immediate danger and bleeding edge survival, this would still be an R movie so the nudity and language were unnecessary.  Vin, I know your instincts are to make this heroic character more accessible than this.  Spend the money more wisely next time please.If you step up to the plate, I will too and watch the next Riddick because I'm not a car chase fan, but I am a fan of a persecuted hero who cannot resist helping other underdogs.	2.0	Made me not like what I like	2014-03-02	2	1	1

The Chronicles of Riddick was a great sequal, so when I saw the preview of Riddick wow I was very excited, what a let down. Now make no mistake the CGI was excellent but how can it not be nowadays with the technology and the budget, but's all there was. It seemed more like a TV episode than a movie and talk about exploiting the fan base with that ending! I do not think I will purchase the next one, I might give it a chance on Prime, I might not.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2XQV8YZVSROU	Peter D. Cornwell	If I had to place Riddick on a continuum between the awesomeness of &#34;Pitch Black&#34; and the beat your head against a wall repeatedly awfulness of &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34;, then it deserves a solid 3 stars.Vin Diesel does what he does best - play Vin Diesel - but this Riddick is  like the guy from &#34;Fast and Furious&#34;, previous Riddick movies and &#34;XXX&#34; had a baby.  The movie seems to spend an amazing amount of time establishing his cool, stylish, amoral killer credentials - and then launches into an epic retelling of the first movie, with just a smattering of necromonger at the start. Its not terrible, but its not a sled with &#34;Rosebud&#34; burning in the furnace at-the-end movie awesomeness either.The biggest let down is Katee Sackhoff.  She does a wonderful job of reprising her role of Starbuck in Battlestar Galactica, just with more expletives and less acting range.  Can she play other characters as well?  I'm sure she can - it might be nice if she could stretch herself a bit artistically beyond the cool, stylish killer type (see above).Thats it.  Not art.  But watchable.  Pretty much movie #1 with less Australian actors.  Enjoy.	3.0	Somewhere in the Middle	2014-01-31	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3V1A3C9DTLPME	"Peter Faden ""robilar5500"""	Is this a great movie? Not by any stretch of the imagination. Should you watch this movie? Absolutely!To me, this was sort of like an amazingly good B movie with a major studio budget (although from what I hear, no major studio would fund this and so Diesel found backers himself and also put a chunk of his own cash into the film). The action is on par with the two previous movies, the dialog was at times witty and hilarious....sometimes, the dialogue actually caught me off guard and had me rolling....funny stuff. The visuals were at times stunning, and did a great job of setting the stage from which the movie was based.All in all, definitely a movie that will end up in my permanent collection to be watched here and there over the years.If you enjoyed the other two Riddick movies, you will probably enjoy this one as well. I know I did.	5.0	Fun as hell	2014-01-19	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3VIHZUSNOGWFY	Peter Olafson	"... but things tumble downhill ass-over-teakettle once the mercenaries arrive. The movie never recovers.Why didn't director/writer Twohy stick more closely to the Riddick character? He was on the right track. The initial premise is a good one -- Riddick against the wilderness -- and Twohy over this stretch touches the right bases. Diesel, in his element, is at his most watchable. And the story still had promise as the first act drew to a close. The film had my full attention, and that is an increasingly rare thing these days.And yet, 10 minutes later, I was beginning to tune out.The shift to the mercs 40 minutes into the film adds nothing. In fact, without a steady supply of Diesel fuel, ""Riddick"" goes slack with astonishing speed and begins to drift inexorably and anonymously through terrain plowed with greater success in Twohy's earlier ""Pitch Black.""This dim second act raises all sorts of questions. Why squander your greatest asset this way? Why rely so heavily on last-second saves? (There are a bunch of them, and it's a sloppy device that quickly extinguishes the film's by-now-flickering flame of authenticity.) Why not bring the same attention to interior production design as to the environment?And, above all, why use these bland, all-purpose, SyFy channel mercs? They are simple cannon fodder and their scenes play like cannon fodder with insipid, ultra-predictable dialog. None of them have have any personality or purpose that isn't inconsequential or simply demeaning, and I felt more for Riddick's pet jackal than I did for any of these purported human beings. Give us a merc with history like Toombs -- played with immense gusto by Nick Chinland in ""Chronicles"" -- who, after being abandoned on Crematoria, would have had a whole new reason to want to see Riddick in a cage.Chinland is not here. Instead, we get Jordi Moll&agrave; as main villain. He over-acts. He over-acts a lot. That's not necessarily a bad solution to problematic second act. If you're not permitted to play a real character, a comic-book level villain rooted in over-the-topness can be kind of fun. (John Lithgow in ""Cliffhanger"" comes to mind.)But it's not fun, foaming-at-the-mouth over-acting. It's just bad old acting, without much motivation or conviction to back it up, and when his character finally joins the ranks of cannon fodder, I felt only indifference.In fact, beyond Diesel, there's almost nothing distinctive here -- Karl Urban, battered and dipped in flour, is barely present --  and the whole Necromonger worldview, which helped make Riddick so relentlessly watchable, is given short shrift.It's surprising to me that Twohy did not allow the grandeur of ""Chronicles"" to better inform this production. Perhaps he just didn't have the funding. The earlier film may not have been a license to print money, but beside the increasingly direct-to-DVD-like ""Riddick,"" it is a positive work of art. (There -is- an effort to link ""Riddick"" back to ""Pitch Black,"" but it is faint-hearted and quickly founders on a one-note character and loud but uninspired acting.The rest of the movie pretty much defies intelligent comment. Much of the last act is bog-standard material mired in wretched cliches. Twohy doesn't seem interesting in wrapping things up in a provocative way that lays a groundwork for what might follow. Or might have followed. So flimsy and improbable was this ending that I no longer much care if anything follows."	2.0	A solid first half-hour ...	2014-03-04	0	0	0

The first two were pretty decent, even the animated one was good, but this one is, frankly, terrible.  The plot could fit into a single sentence, the dialog consists almost entirely of lame one-liners, and even the CGI seems to be better suited for saturday morning cartoons.  If you're going to watch this, set your expectations low, especially for the &#34;motorcycle&#34; scenes.  Also, if you happen to be female or gay, or both, you may find this pretty hilarious, or maybe offensive, depending on your outlook and level of inebriation.

It was much like a Heavy Metal mag story blown up and brought to life.  I especially liked that they didn't follow the formula of the first as many sequels do.In this one, the machete decapitation scene stands out has one of the dumbest I have seen in any movie.  It is almost so bad it's good but it hurt the limited credibility of the rest of the story/movie drastically for me.  The characters have some twists and a couple name actors gave us nice performances.  It does have heart, humor and some playful fun but neither the tension and desperation of the first movie nor the ass-kickery of the second is rekindled.

We find him already stranded on an unknown planet, left for dead. He's severely injured and immediately has to battle for his life.Through a flashback, we find out what went wrong on the necromonger ship (if you want even more of the backstory you can read the online comic), but in true Furyan fashion, his powers of recuperation have him up and running in short order.But this new planet has treacherous lifeforms ready to kill at a moment's notice. The leopard dogs and water-dwelling creatures that have a very crafty attack prove to be all a severely injured Riddick can handle, but he adapts and eventually finds some sort of a bounty hunters' PlayStation where he alerts mercs that he is alive  and waiting.Two crews show up in short order. One is intent on bringing Riddick back dead, the other has a more clandestine agenda. There is a minor twist that plays out through the rest of the movie and by the end you're mot really sure which way it plays out.There are some pretty cool kills like a merc who's killed by a couple predator-restraints and Riddick displays a fair amount of bravado. But if you liked the other two movies, particularly Pitch Black, you'll like this one. There's a storm coming and when it finally arrives, the entire environment changes.I'd give this movie 3 out of five stars. There's something cutesy that happens early on, but they keep it to a minimum and it actually plays into the story. The ending leaves room for another installment which I'd definitely be in line for.Gerald RiceAuthor ofThe Zombie Show	4.0	Long Live Riddick!	2013-09-09	90	74	16

I have seen all the movies and played the PC games. &#34;RIDDICK&#34; is a return to the simplicity of the Pitch Black plot. Take a group of mismatched characters, give them hidden motives, put them up against evil aliens and add Riddick as a wild card. This is not a terrible formula. It was very entertaining. What made this awkward was the sexual dynamic between Riddick and the Dahl character. Riddick is awe inspiring because he is a force of nature. He is driven by hate, he is merciless, he suppresses emotions, he possess super powers, yet he plays by a set of rules. He is a rogue. When you change his persona so that he is trying to &#34;get with&#34; the Dahl character, it makes his seem like a jock. I miss the Riddick that fought for the Kyra character because she was his friend, not because she was &#34;keeping it warm for him.&#34; So, besides the Riddick libido, this film was definitely worth seeing.	4.0	Pitch Black 2.0 - This Time Riddick Likes Girls	2014-02-08	2	1	1

Vin has been acting for over 20 years and along with many of his past acting efforts, this pearl deserves 5 stars. Action, suspense, story (another Riddick installment in the line of Pitch Black and the Chronicles of Riddick) and everything about it was terrific. I couldn't wait for Amazon's delivery. I received it today and with such anticipation viewed it this evening. It was over 2 hours of movie pleasure. However, I can see age catching up with Vin but, I sure hope there will be more Riddick movies. Vin is still in great shape and certainly doesn't look his age. As far as that goes I would hope that Vin has many more action movies to do. Again, I loved everything about this Riddick installment.	5.0	Riddick be the Man	2014-01-27	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2WE24HCTKKM4X	"Roy Clark ""rclarknv"""	My rating stars rise from my respect and enjoyment of prior RIDDICK series. The disparaging atmosphere, from all which came before could have been spiced with new challenges, surprises. So rating stars are victims of the repetitious nature of characters who lack layers, challenges, motivations, and complex depth of prior characters. Riddick always is portrayed as cynical, aloof, bored. Here, mostly bored. Me too, after seeing so much same-old again. And again.How about next time (I sure hope for more) Riddick writers write about an Upperverse or Quantumverse, or maybeeven something new: Non-derivative plots/characters? Like, surprising? Maybe with a tad more humor or even unique, stronger story lines (as in Riddick #2), with multi-layered characters? Riddick's character, hero/anti-hero complexitiesis GREAT, totally unique. Sure hope more attention/imagination gets woven into other (many, I hope) Riddick stories.	4.0	MONSTERS FROM PITCH BLACK, BOUNTY HUNTERS FROM EVERYWHERE, TOKEN TOUGH CHICK FROM BATTLE STAR GALACTICA	2014-01-16	1	0	1

Riddick's second movie took him to an unstable kingdom on an unstable world, then got lost and muttled in incomplete detail and a flawed story, backed with surplus of effects.  His third movie, &#34;Riddick&#34; takes the anti-hero back to his roots.  Survival on an unforgiving world, full of creatures starved of prey, becomes the underlying goal as bounty hunters fight to get their reward.

And it's not as overly complicated as &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick,&#34; yet stupidly simplistic in motivation &#34;You keep what you kill.&#34; Stupid ideology for a flourishing society (Necromongers). This movie needed more of an FX budget. The graphics hurt my aesthetic sensibilities. All the CG graphics have no depth of field (distance or motion blurs, and no points of focus). There was some goofy exposition showing Riddick's soft side, but I felt it unnecessary. Riddick can be tough without degenerating into a goofy kid with his dog.

This movie picks up were the last movie finished; however they still leave you with more questions than answers. This movie is hardcore and cut throat from start to finish. Once again Riddick finds himself abandoned on some unknown desolate barren planet were he must utilize all of his cunning might and true survivalist skills to escape this horrible planet filled with stunning and dangerous creatures. I'm amazed by the consistency and attention to detail Riddick producers seem to get right every time. They know how to take you to another place and time, and create stunning futuristic (sci-fi) fantasy worlds that will put you in awe.  My compliments to both writers and producers for accomplishing this.  All acting, props, sets, wardrobes and effects were to (A-list) standard, and monies well spent. This movie is very impressive and there are (no) dry-boring areas; its action all the way through. However, it's not surprising that producers left this epic series open for a (4th) installment in the near future.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AAVUPDWN8UR6S	Sean M. Walters	There are too many tropes and plot devices from 'Pitch Black' that are reused in this recent installment of the Riddick franchise. That being said, I still enjoyed the film. I won't go into detail about the recycling as it may spoil the movie for some. Some of the action is over the top, it was ridiculous but entertaining. For the framework of the film, I thought the supporting acting was exceptional. I liked the filming of Riddick's survival instincts in the early part of the film. 'Riddick' certainly won't turn heads for the sci-fi genre in the film industry. If the series can go outside of the conventions that its trapped itself with in future installments, it may rise to its true potential.'Riddick' is watchable and enjoyable, but it was lacking in a refreshing new setting and development for the anti-hero.	4.0	Decent but not jaw-dropping	2014-02-24	1	0	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	Director David Twohy and Vin Diesel bring Riddick back toPitch Blackform in this awesome flick. To me Pitch Black was a perfect Sci-fi/Horror flick from back in 2000. Then the sequel in 2004The Chronicles of Riddickleft me hugely disappointed, bored and disenchanted with the Riddick character and film franchise. But 2013's Riddick film redeems the character, the franchise, and it has me right back where I was 13 years ago after watching Pitch Black for the dozenth time: hoping for a sequel!In this flick, Riddick is abandoned on a desolate planet and back fighting some sick looking monsters to survive....The most vicious being the scorpion-like Mud Demons. So when Riddick realizes that major approaching rain storms will turn the planet to mud...well let's just says that you don't want to be on a muddy planet that's infested with Mud Demons. So Riddick's only hope is to make his presence on the planet known to intergalactic bounty hunters by setting off an emergency beacon. When the bounty hunters arrive looking to kill versus capture Riddick, he's got his work cut out to figure out a way off the planet alive.The movie gets an R, but (once again) I think the MPAA got it wrong and should have given it a PG-13. I watched the Unrated version, and sure there's some gore, but no more than you might see in some TV-MA shows these days likeThe Walking Dead. Riddick is a thoroughly entertaining Sci-fi/Horror/Action flick that shouldn't be missed by fans of the genre.	4.0	Back in Black	2013-12-28	0	0	0

I had read one reviewer state is was basically Pitch Black 2, and I thought to myself, &#34;come on, no way.  must be an exaggeration.&#34;.  Let me tell you, it's not.

At the end of that movie it proved that He could care again. The second film strayed away a lot from the first , and was  on a lot bigger scale and that one ended with Him as the leader of the Necromongers . Riddick title of this film shows Him bored as the leader always having to look over His shoulder, and now wants a way out . After being stranded on a hostile planet , He must search for Himself  and get back to His animal self . His time running out on this planet , He must send a beacon for the Mercenaries to get out of there....fast . It has a good supporting cast . Katee  Sackhoff  and Bokeem Woodbine . The end of the film was weak , but left a opening for the next chapter. The movie doesn't take it self too serious an has some laughs .

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	Riddick is one of the coolest anti-heroes to come out in very, very long time. The man is an efficient killing machine, but has more depth to him than merely his talents. Riddick is a back to basics kind of movie, and gives us the character with the best of the previous renditions (which include movies, video games and a direct to video animated feature). This R rated flick is more than just the violence Riddick fans crave. It touches on different aspects of the character and gives us a better look at his view on life, the universe and such.So Pitch Black was the fan favorite. Riddick was just a bad guy who was going some good, but only because it benefited him. Then in the end we see there is more to him than just a selfish killer. Dark Fury (the animated feature) was basically lip service for the fans who craved seeing Riddick as a complete bad ass. Chronicles of Riddick (a disapointment for many... not me) put the character in a grandiose setting and while he kept talking like he was just looking out for number one there were plenty of other people he was standing up for. From these two movies we see Riddick evolve to being more than just tough guy. The fans didn't like the direction, so director David Twohy and star Vin Diesel decided to go back to the roots. However they didn't just redo Pitch Black. Far from it. This is probably the most personal Riddick movie to date.The movie starts with Riddick getting unceremoniously tossed from the Necromongers of the previous film. From there he is stuck in an alien world having to fend for himself. The first act of the film is just Riddick. You get to see how his mind works as he finds ways to survive no mans land. You also get to hear some reflection on who Riddick is and the thinking behind why he is the anti-hero that he is. It's a really nice change of pace from the previous movie, which was practically non-stop with the bravado.The second act is even more interesting. Riddick finds an abandoned outpost and hatches a plan to get off the planet, which includes signaling mercs to come get him. Riddick knows there isn't much time until this planet's monsters start coming out of the woodwork and kill everything in their path (here's the Pitch Black reference). Riddick spies on the mercs and learns more about which ones are particularly brutal and which are professional. From here it appears he picks his targets, killing off the bad mercs one by one. It's a reminder that Riddick doesn't just kill for the hell of it. He has his own moral code (the Chronicles of Riddick reference). We even get the over the top &#34;he's too bad for words&#34; example when he calls out exactly how he will kill one of the mercs... while he is captured and bound (sounds like a Dark Fury reference). If you look for it the second act is an almost complete profile of Riddick.Then the third act comes along. Tons of monsters everywhere and everybody is in a panic on how to get out. Riddick's plan is starting to come to fruition, but not without it's hiccups. This is where the full on action from Pitch Black comes into play. It feels similar of course, but at the same time it's a very different animal. Riddick has two enemies to deal with, the mercs and the monsters. There is a pretty intricate play on alliances and betrayal that moves the act to more emotionally charged (and satisfying) heights. You also get to see a back story (again a reference to Pitch Black) come full circle. All in all the story is rock solid and hits all the marks that the previous franchise items got right.The production values of this movie are remarkable. This was a low budget movie when compared to other A list sci-fi/fantasy films being made these days. It looks a lot more expensive. Sure there only a few sets, but the story was perfect for it. Sure the computer animation can be noticeable at times, but I have seen a lot worse with movies several times the budget. The pacing was right with just enough reflection at the beginning and the right amount of thrills in the end to give this film a very polished look. At $38 million dollars Twohy and Diesel were able to make a movie filled with depth, story, action and thrills. Considering all the movies done that year that were $130-$200+ million in production costs, but fell flat this is a great achievement. Add to that the fact the movie made almost $100 million worldwide (more than twice the return on investment) and I would call Riddick is standout success of the year.This Blu-Ray has scrawled on the top of it Unrated Director's Cut. Usually you see this in video releases as just a way to entice you to buy it hoping to see something shocking, titillating or just plain interesting that wasn't included, or maybe taken out to keep the rating, in the theatrical release. Often times the unrated moniker is worthless with nothing added even worth noting that. With Riddick you do get something special. It's only an additional eight minutes added to the film, but there are two big additions that make it worthwhile. The first is more time on Riddick's role as the Necromonger ruler at the beginning of the film. It's essentially a live action version of the animated short Blindsided. Though the theatrical release did a good job transitioning you from the previous film this additional time really fleshes it out more. Plus you get a lot more Karl Urban as Vaako. The other notable addition is an extended ending that eludes to a sequel. Maybe it was taking so as to not keep our hopes up. However I welcome the lead in.Like the Chronicles of Riddick blu-ray you get both the Theatrical version and the Director's Cut in this disk. Visually the disk really stands out with a 1080p/AVC transfer. Reports say the color and contrast are near perfect. Audio will be strong with with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. The special features are a bit lean on length, but are good on content. I am a bit disappointed there isn't an audio commentary. I would think Twohy and Diesel would have loved doing one and giving the fans even more dirt on the Riddick movie and franchise. Here is a list of the other features:The Twohy Touch - A six minute featurette on director David Twohy's contributions to the Riddick franchise. There are cast and crew commentaries covering their experience with Twohy as well.Riddickian Tech - Going a bit over ten minutes this feature covers the various vehicles and weapons on the film and how they were designed and implemented on the film.The World of Riddick - An exploration on the design and inspiration for the movie's setting, &#34;Not Furya&#34;. 11 minute run time.Vin's Riddick - Similar to The Twohy Touch this featurette cover's Vin Diesel's contributions to the franchise and also includes interviews with cast and crew talking about Vin. Running time about eight minutes.Met the Mercs - An interesting compilation of interviews with the supporting cast and their comments on the characters they portray. It goes into some detail with discussion about the weapons used and clothes they wear. 11 minute run time.Riddick: Blindsided - This is the animated short that was released prior to the movie to help promote the film. It chronicles Riddicks role as the Lord Marshall of the Necromongers just before his betrayal. The animation is more like an animated comic book than full on animation.Riddick brings the best of all the previous films together into one cohesive and satisfying film. I dearly hope with the success of this movie that we will get to see Diesel and Twohy's ambitions for this character come to life with future productions.	5.0	Finally an unrated version worthy of getting	2014-01-13	17	13	4

The ingenuity of the character in making tools, fighting predators and trying to survive are amazing. The genius level planning of securing a ship to get off world is excellent screen writing.This movie is better than the Necromonger storyline and mythology they tried to create, with bad boy Riddick (almost but not quite evil, in Pitch Black, like saving a kid from murder but savagely killing anyone who is a threat) somehow the redeemer or savior of the universe. The Riddick movie plot-line flies. This movie would have been great as the second Riddick movie, instead of &#34;Chronicles of Riddick&#34; that took a bad ass survivor a little less evil and a lot more focused than the bad guys and tried to turn him into the King of the People who Worship Death and want to kill everyone.	4.0	Riddick returns to his roots, gets better	2014-02-15	0	0	0

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2XHAPXNOFRXMK	TC	This time around we find that Riddick is no longer a king. The story begins with Riddick living alone and fighting tosurvive on a hostile desert-like planet where every living thing seems to exist just to bite, claw, gouge or eat him.As expected we see that our hero can thrive in this kind of predator environment, but then mercenary/bountyhunters in space ships drop in for a visit. These mean, tough, grungy looking warrior hunters with their guns andgadgets have come to capture Riddick.They wind up getting outsmarted by the local animal life and Riddick's badattitude. So in the end, just like in the first movie, a only a lucky few leave the planet in one piece and Riddick onceagain shows us why he's the top dog. The movie has suspense and action. The highlight was Vin Diesel charactergoing back to his roots. Katee Sackhoff's character stands out because she looks tougher and more competent thanthe other bounty hunters.

I give it a high rating due to the fact that it is an enjoyable movie as long as you don't watch it as a 3rd installment of the original but as another day in the life of Riddick. Watching the unrated version is better than the theatre version. it explains a lot more about what happened after Riddick takes over the NERCO's.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2LHMP07OFU6JW	Texas Reader	When I heard Riddick was coming out, I did not need to see a trailer or review.  There are two roles that were made for Vin Diesel.  One is Dominic Toretto.  The other is Riddick.  Unlike his character in the Pacifier, he was meant to play these two characters.  No matter what the critics say, I will go see Vin Diesel in any film he portrays these characters.On Riddick's opening night, I went to see the film.  I was disappointed. Riddick is almost the same exact film as Pitch Black.Aside from a few minor differences, this film contains many of the same elements.  Allow me to list them (Beware.  Spoilers ahead.):1.  The film takes place on a desolate planet that does not have much life.2.  There are bounty hunters that want to capture him.3.  There are monsters on the planet that want to eat all of them.4.  The main plot is to get off the planet.5.  Two hot women.  One will die.6.  Scene of Riddick battling the monsters with his bare hands.7.  Scene where Riddick cuts the monster in the stomach and its guts come out.8.  Sexual frustration between the lead woman and Riddick.9.  Monsters will come out of their respective habitats once the conditions are in  their favor.10. Bounty hunters must work with Riddick in order to survive.11. Takes the team through the monsters in order to reach their goal.I thought I was going to see a film with Riddick as the Lord King Marshall of the Necromongers.  I guess with a budget of $40 million, the makers of the film could not afford to create that storyline.  Chronicles of Riddick had a budget of just over $100 million.This is still a decent film, mainly because of Vin Diesel's charisma and on screen presence.  That is why I give the film 3 stars.  Add a star if you did not see Pitch Black.	3.0	Pitch Black Reloaded	2013-10-29	67	59	8

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3GGMPRYCQ87CY	The Cool Guy	"What does that even mean?I was disappointed with this movie. I felt like it was a huge step back for the franchise. Where ""Chronicles of Riddick"" elevated what had begun in ""Pitch Black"" to epic levels, ""Riddick"" drops it all back to just being a standard action flick. It did little or nothing to advance the characters, and was not a satisfying continuation of ""Chronicles"".The story I found hard to buy into. So the emperor of the known universe is headed to Furya (later to be stranded on a planet), and he doesn't even have one advisor or security guard to accompany him? I mean, I know Riddick is awesome but I didn't think he was dumb. An emperor would have an entire entourage.And then when he activates the beacon, suddenly all these death warrants display, and mercs show up to kill him. Uh, excuse me? This is the emperor of the Necromongers here! On politics of this scale, there would be loyalist factions searching for him and trying to rescue him immediately. Especially with the Necromongers, he'd have all kind of religious freaks laying down their lives for him. There would also be opportunists trying to rescue him just in the hopes of a reward. But kill him and ONLY kill him? No, I'm not buying it. Not unless you want to forget that the entire ""Chronicles of Riddick"" movie happened, which apparently this movie does.Another annoyance to me was the role of Dahl played by Katee Sackoff. First, was it really necessary to show her topless? Not that I didn't mind looking, but it had nothing to do with anything. It was just a distraction, and a tasteless one at that. Oh wait, it was so Riddick could steal her makeup mirror... Seriously?Speaking of tasteless... The way Riddick talks to Dahl I found to be pretty disgusting. I know Riddick is cool and Riddick's the man, but the way it came off here I just didn't like. And was it not a little bit insulting that he is so charming that he turns a lesbian straight? I've heard it said in reviews that Dahl isn't supposed to be a lesbian, but is just pretending to be one so the other mercs don't hit on her. But this movie gives no indication of that. Taken as it comes, Riddick turns a gay woman straight. Ugh. Really?Or say she's secretly straight after all. But is that scenario any better? She pretends to be a lesbian, until she can no longer resist his charms. And what was it about Riddick that she found so charming, exactly? When he spied on her in the shower? Or when he talked dirty and told her he's going to rape her (sort of - she'll ask for it first)? Anyone else who did that would be labeled a perv. I didn't like this at all. I felt like Katee deserved better.That's not to say the whole movie was bad. Being a Riddick fan, I still enjoyed it a lot. It may not seem that way from my review, but I did like the movie. I just felt like it could have been much, much more. After so many years in development, it was a huge missed opportunity.I liked the role of Daddy Johns. I felt like that characterization was really well done, and a nice callback to ""Pitch Black"".I also - for the first time in my life - actually liked the CGI in a movie. For the first time that I can ever remember, the CGI looks so realistic you can forget it's CGI. I'm talking about the jackal. It was so well done - and such a good character - that it was really enjoyable to watch. I mean, you know this is a made up, CGI creature. But it looked so realistic it was uncanny. I kept feeling like I was looking at a real dog on the screen. And it interacted seamlessly with Riddick. That part of the movie was just really well done.I also liked seeing Karl Urban, if only for a cameo. Karl is a fantastic actor. After seeing him in ""Dredd"", it's hard for me to watch him take a second seat to Vin Diesel. I sure hope there's a 4th movie, one that revolves more around Karl's character, Vaako.The differences between the Theatrical version and Director's Cut here are slight. The biggest difference is the ending. The Director's Cut takes the same ending as the Theatrical version, but then adds an epilogue of sorts. The epilogue has Riddick returning to his kingdom, and hints at what happened to Vaako. It almost comes off as a spoiler for a 4th movie.Anyway, in short, I liked this movie okay but thought it was a missed opportunity. It certainly wasn't up to snuff with the previous films.

In the first few minutes of the film Riddick displays his toughness by setting a broken bone in his own leg...then he puts screws in it. He makes friends with an alien dingo. Eventually he goes up against only eleven seasoned bounty hunters...and we know how that goes.The special effects were decent. The dialouge meets our tough guy expectations. Good mix of drama and action, with a touch of levity. The plot is very simple, Riddick vs. bounty hunters vs. alien creatures. Good popcorn film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Katee Sackhoff + full frontal) sex talk.	4.0	AND THEN THERE ARE LEGENDARY BAD DAYS	2013-09-15	12	9	3

Like wise with Pitch Black.  Riddick was a criminal who lost his reason to care really about anyone.  The movie had so many characters that had depth and seemed so real and alive.  This movie had the same depth and feel as Pitch Black and the game (escape from butcher Bay). This film does acknowledge the second movie even though it is ridiculous and in serious need of editing, It does so beautifully.  Tis film was way better than I was expecting and just as great as the first film and the game. five stars.	5.0	Everything I wanted and more.	2014-01-12	1	0	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A277UC8WJVAIIE	The Wiz	"This latest sequel in the Riddick series, takes us full circle as the baddest anti-hero in the galaxy finds himself betrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead.  The first part of this film is essentially a great survival story, where Riddick returns to his more feral roots however the tenor quickly changes when he finds a way to signal for ""rescue"" but instead gets reminded that he's still a wanted fugitive (VERY wanted).  At this point, the movie becomes semi-horror reminiscent of the original ""Pitch Black"" (except much better) as he reminds everyone, including the audience, just why he's so feared.This is easily the best of the trilogy in my opinion and presents a darker and more violent story than ""Chronicles"" represented by the PG-13 back to R rating however it doesn't saturate the dialogue with gratuitous profanity as in the first film; there's also very brief nudity and again, lots of violence but these things all supplement what is essentially a fierce tale of survival and a very well made sci-fi film.As I was watching Riddick at one point, surrounded by enemies in the midst of a raging storm, I was reminded of a line from a poem: ""Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody, but unbowed.""  :o)"	4.0	Survival of the Fiercest	2013-09-07	89	74	15

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	When Pitch Black came out in 2000 it became a surprise hit and made a star out of Vin Diesel who portrayed the anti-hero, Riddick.  But the 2004 sequel The Chronicles of Riddick disappointed fans with its deviation from what made the first film work to a more space opera tone.  With Riddick (and boy these guys are not too creative with their titles are they?) the series returns to its Sci-fi Horror roots and while it might be too evocative of Pitch Black, it&#8217;s still a fun and effective film.The film begins five years after the events in Chronicles as Riddick has become bored with his life as Lord Marshall of the Necromonger fleet.  An assassination attempt prompts Riddick to give up the post to Vaako (Urban) in exchange for being taken to his home planet of Furya.  Vaako&#8217;s aide, Krone, and a handful of other soldiers accompany Riddick down to the planet.  Riddick quickly realizes that this world is not Furya and that he has been betrayed.  He barely escapes, killing several soldiers although Krone manages to get away.Riddick finds himself without weapons on a planet filled with hostile, native life including packs of Jackal-like predators and poisonous creatures that look like crosses between pincer bugs and scorpions called &#8220;mud demons&#8221;.  He makes his way to an abandoned outpost and sets off an emergency beacon which brings two rival teams of bounty hunters to the planets intent on collecting the reward for the infamous criminal.  Riddick begins a cat and mouse with the two groups, eventually managing to steal the power cores of their ships and using them to negotiate his safe passage off the planet.  But before anyone can leave the region is struck by a massive storm which causes hundreds of the mud demons to come up from underground and besiege Riddick and the bounty hunters.Riddick flies so closely to Pitch Black that it almost seems like a remake.  Riddick has to ally with those who want to imprison him and having to fight off swarms of deadly creatures which come out during the storm&#8230;which coincidentally is also in the dark.  But for all its lack of originality Riddick still works because of the central character.  Riddick is so unbelievably bad-ass that even the bounty hunters end up deferring to him as their best chance to survive.  Vi Diesel&#8217;s tombstone-grating voice adds the whipped cream on top of what continues to be a fascinating character.  While Director David Twohy doesn&#8217;t hit the same heights of terror and suspense that he did in Pitch Black, he does have a more interesting cast to play with this time around.At one point Riddick is scaling a hill, surrounded by the mud demons and fighting them off with anything he can find.  It evoked the image from Frank Frazetta&#8217;s painting of Conan poised atop a mound of bodies and fighting off scores of enemies.  Riddick is one of those movies that takes full advantage of its 5.1 DTS-HD sound and was made to be played with a sound bar or theater system as it virtually surrounds you with its resonating depth.The Blu-ray comes with both the Unrated Director&#8217;s Cut and original theatrical cut.  The Director&#8217;s Cut runs about eight minutes longer and includes an extended opening sequence and an alternate ending.  The cast features Katee Sackoff and WWE wrestler Dave Bastita, both playing mercenaries on opposite sides.Blu-ray ExtrasThe Twohy Touch (6:22) - The writer/director discusses returning to the series after nine yearsRiddickian Tech (10:14) - This featurette covers the props, weapons, and ships used in the film.Vin's Riddick (8:50) &#8211; Diesel as well as the other cast members talk about the character of RiddickMeet the Mercs (10:44) &#8211; this featurette covers the cast of the two groups of bounty hunters/Mercs and their various characters and training.The World of Riddick (10:50) &#8211; This looks at the visual effects of the film including creating the world and the various alien creatures.Riddick Blindsided (5:20) &#8211; This is a motion comic which was adapted into live-action scenes featured in the Director's Cut.	3.0	Getting back to the Pitch Black roots	2014-01-25	2	1	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1XT8AJB7S9JJG	Tony Heck	&#34;There are bad days and there are legendary bad days. This is shaping up to be one of those.&#34; After being betrayed by the Necromongers, Riddick (Diesel) is left for dead. Alone on a remote desolate planet he is forced to regain his instincts and survive the harsh landscape. When he notices a deadly storm approaching he has no choice but to activate a beacon that draws bounty hunters to him. Now he has to find a way to escape while battling bounty hunters, an alien species and a oncoming deadly storm. First thing I should say is that I'm not a huge fan of this series. I thought Pitch Black was OK but didn't like Chronicles of Riddick. So my expectations for this were pretty low going in. Even with low expectations I wasn't impressed by this movie. The beginning was very slow movie and Vin Diesel doesn't have the chops to carry a movie where he is the only one it it for longer then 5 minutes so the first 20 was a struggle. Then it turned to the bounty hunters and Vin Diesel pretty much disappeared for awhile. When he returned the movie fell into a straight remake of Pitch Black. A group of mercenaries who want nothing more then to kill Riddick for a reward but realize they need his help with the aliens and storm. Dialog is awful and the movie could have been a half hour long and lost nothing. On the other hand, if you are a fan of this series you will really enjoy this more then I did. Overall, nothing but a remake of Pitch Black with a bigger budget, I give this a C+.	2.0	If you are a fan of this series you will really enjoy this.To me it was nothing but a remake of Pitch Black with a bigger budget	2014-01-11	4	1	3
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	AQSMM1Z9BEOYT	Toorop	"Diesel's passion project for the last half decade finally comes to the big screen and fans like myself were very excited. Little did I know this movie would be so thin in script and short in scope. The big seller for this film was ""It is like Pitch Black"". That sounds good and while it tries, it does not succeed. Frankly the movie is watchable and I am looking forward to seeing a directors cut in hopes like with ""Chronicles"" that it will help the film's scope and possibly its script (I have my doubts). Having said that I still cannot get over how underwhelmed I was coming out of the theater. Diesel tried it seemed to bring his best to the role (especially in the first 30 minutes of the film) but at the end of the day the script tried to hard to remind the character that he was not expanding like he was in ""Chronicles"" and instead going backward to a place we've seen already. Lastly I think this film went in the wrong direction and yes with its budget it couldn't do much of what the franchise did in ""Chronicles"" but that isn't an excuse to go backwards with a decade old character that many have grown to love."	3.0	"Had potential but a thin script and a long wait made ""Riddick"" the weakest of the franchise."	2013-09-12	8	2	6

I think that the movie should have ended with the traitors being aware of Riddicks escape and showing the fear in their face, over the next installment of Riddick chronicles. You know Riddick won't let this betrayal go unpunished. I mean come on, it's like Darth Vader being spun off into space, you know there's another one coming. This movie was Okay, but I would have liked more from the writers, than just different words, characters, and camera angles of pitch black.	3.0	Set up for the vengence of Riddick	2014-02-25	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	In David Twohy's sci-fi action &#8220;Riddick,&#8221; Vin Diesel (who also co-produces) once again plays the anti-hero of the title, the most wanted man in the whole universe. This time Richard B. Riddick is stranded on a desert planet alone, where a lot of deadly creatures prowl around.For those who have not seen the two previous installments &#8220;Pitch Black&#8221; (2000) and &#8220;The Chronicles of Riddick&#8221; (2004), the story of the new film might appear incomprehensible. Who is this &#8220;Vaako&#8221; Karl Urban (who very briefly appears) plays? Crushed spaceship?Moreover, the film&#8217;s first thirty minutes features only one human character Riddick (like Tom Hanks in &#8220;Cast Away&#8221;) trying to survive in the hostile environment. It is ambitious storytelling, but I found it a little boring.This is followed by more interesting section that pits Riddick against a group of bounty hunters. Actually, things get more complicated when another group arrives. Some effects are disappointing and the rest of the story looks as if recycled from &#8220;Pitch Black,&#8221; but action scenes are fine and actors all did great job, especially Katee Sackhoff as a tough mercenary Dahl.With some effective action set-pieces and unique sense of humor &#8220;Riddick&#8221; is by no means a bad film, but some part of it feels like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. If you have not seen any of &#8220;Riddick&#8221; films, I strongly recommend that you start with &#8220;Pitch Black&#8221; which is still the best.	3.0	"Saga Continues But ""Pitch Black"" Still Remains the Best"	2014-03-09	0	0	0
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1MHOMAKP8SZ4V	T.T.	I have been a fan of Riddick - and indeed of Vin Diesel - since the first Riddick-movie, Pitch Black. And I was naturelly very excited when it was announced that they were going to make a third Riddick-movie.taking it from the top, Vin really has made the Riddick-caracter completely his. It is inconcievable that any other actor out there could ever succesfully succeed Vin as Riddick. The set-up of the movie is clearly identifiable as a Riddick-movie and the action-sequences are great. A real popcorn-movie just as it should be.One thing however lets down the side. This picture does not add to the texture or universe of Riddick. It is - basically - a new version of Pitch Black: A group of people are stranded on a desolate and hostile planet. The humans are in conflict with each other, but has to overcome those conflicts in order to survive when the monsters starts crawling out of the woodwork.It is a great pitty that the people behind the Riddick-franciase didn't have a greater vision for this the third movie. They could for instance have centered their focus on the conflict between Riddick and the Necromongers, which they only glanced at for a couple of minutes in the opening sequence. To bad!	3.0	Third time is not quite a charm.	2014-01-12	2	1	1
6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A7D1CHK8KC8NQ	T. Walsh	I love all things Riddick but even I have to admit this movie is a really slow start (like the entire first half of the movie).  Some cool moments but you find yourself wishing it would move a little faster.  It also could've used a bit more of a wink/nod to the fact that he's been down that exact road before, though there is a little bit of it, which was great.  Generally enjoyable but not even close to the caliber of Pitch Black and falls short of the 2nd movie.	3.0	Some great moments, some good moments, is really slow for the first half	2014-05-27	0	0	0

The plot isn't thin; it's anorexic.  Now, I'll typically overlook the lack of a plot or credible characters if a movie makes up for it with explosions, chase scenes and the like, but this one doesn't even do that.  You've basically got some wild dogs, some slithery reptiles, and dust -- over and over and over.  I liked the Riddick before this one.

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3VU9EC95GZ418	Xbox gamers = REAL GAMERS unlike the sonymite...	For you movie goers I thought I would share my spoiler free review of Riddick.The movie is broken into 3 acts, the first and third acts really shine while some of the second act drags. The movie really resonates with that Pitch Black vibe throughout the third act. The movie suprisingly has alot of humor thrown throughout, the theater was filled with laughter. Their is a downside to the movie though, the second act and some scenes tending to drag on in the begining. Overall the movie is definitely worthy of a blu ray purchase for Riddick fans and redbox/netflix rental for fans of story driven movies with some action sprinkled throughout. I give Riddick a 3.5/5	4.0	A vinnie and his dog = 1 heck of a ride	2013-09-07	2	1	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A3R8RSVWSCW1R8	youngzen69	Vin Diesel returns in this third installment to find himself once again abandon for dead on a hostile desert like planet. I believe Riddick 2013 to be the second best film out of the series. Not as good as Chronicles of Riddick but is somewhat better then Pitch Black. So to sum this up Riddick 2013 is much closer to Pitch Black in overall tone and feel then it is to The Chronicles of Riddick. If you are a big fan of Pitch Black you will love this movie but if you was not a big fan of Pitch Black but more of a fan of Chronicles of Riddick then this movie will not be for you.	4.0	A overall worthy successor!	2014-02-13	1	0	1

6302219205	Riddick (Dvd, 2013) Rental Exclusive	A1S1BJFTA644TU	Zalmorion the Fantastic	What the heck did I watch here?  Riddick Lite?  Diet Riddick?First of all, most of the film is Riddick limping around trying to befriend alien dogs and immunize himself from the sting of an amphibian.  He has flashbacks to being the leader of the half-dead people he defeated in movie 2.  Big deal.  Nothing happens.  Nothing meaningful comes of these memories.  We get to see Karl Urban for five seconds.  Big deal.  Literally for NO REASON.  Go back to Almost Human.  Then, FINALLY, Riddick causes a bunch of mercs to come get him.Well, folks, the mercs don't really improve anything.  The mercs are dumb.  They set up tech that is . . . dumb.  The dialogue is . . . dumb.  Dave Bautista's character, the guy who you might think is going to give Riddick a pretty terrible one on one struggle, is pretty useless.  I'm trying so hard not to flat out tell you why.  The girl is pretty tough, which is fun.  But the mercs are all forgettable.At least there is some action.  One merc has a really lame &#34;surprise&#34; connection to a character in the first movie.  The monsters get rowdy.  That's all.  Riddick is a beast, as always.  Diesel nails his character.The ending is the absolute WORST ending I have seen in a movie in a long time.  It is as if an artsy fartsy writer/director just threw a scene together cobbled from the ludicrous philosophical ideas floating in his brain after he just dropped acid.  Transcendence.  Oh, thank you Karl Urban's two minute cameo for that incredible foreshadowing.  Huh?They have taken a great anti-hero and given him over to half-witted writing and meaningless plot devices.I am so baffled that I have to re-watch this film.  I just cannot believe how poorly they treated a beloved franchise/character here.  I am hoping I missed something.  :(You should ONLY watch this if you are a die hard Riddick fan.  No one else needs to be subjected to this failure.  Definitely do not buy it--like I did--and regret your purchase till your last breadth.	2.0	Riddickulously Mediocre	2013-12-25	10	5	5
