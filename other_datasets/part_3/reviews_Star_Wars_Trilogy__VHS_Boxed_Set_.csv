0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A10OB9HK2VVKEY	"""13thumper"""	It's interesting what time has done to the SW trilogy.  27 years ago, it was the greatest thing ever. 10 years after that, it was kinda cool, Empire was better than the original, and what was up with the muppets in the 3rd one. 10 years after that we couldn't wait for the prequels, while seeing the originals again on the big screen.  Then, when the former kids, now grown ups, didn't get the exact same goose bumps as 1977, they panned the new ones as junk.  Now, finally, coming to DVD, some don't like the new special effects, some don't like the story of Anakin being connected from the beginning, and some just forgot that they ever liked the original in the first place.  I find all of this interesting as it will become the greatest selling DVD ever, and millions will flock to see the new one next year.The SW trilogy, is quite simply the greatest trilogy ever.

This is the movie series that started the new age of special effects and sci-fi movies. The trilogy is a part of history in the movie biz and I highly recommend it to all.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1ALOIPRR8Q06J	"2 cents ""meaningless memes"""	"Thank you producer Gary Kurtz, writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, director Irvin Kershner. And Stuart Freeborn and Frank Oz for Yoda. Also much appreciation goes to actor Harrison Ford for changing his line from what Lucas wrote and therefor making what would have been a corny, poorly written scene into one of the classic moments of the entire saga.The story behind the greatest Star Wars film is incredible to me.This is excerpted from wikipedia (because I'm feelin' lazy as Lucas in writing here):""During filming of The Empire Strikes Back George Lucas suffered an apparent panic attack, accusing the filmmakers of ruining his movie. He followed this by taking the existing footage into an editing bay and cut together a fast-paced action version of early scenes, excising plot-oriented content, then showed it to Kurtz and other members of cast and crew, who reacted with laughter. Lucas later admitted this was a mistake(.....)Even after the financial success of The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas regarded The Empire Strikes Back as a failure. It was after this pronouncement that Kurtz and Lucas parted company.It is notable that the more mystical aspects of the Jedi were absent from Star Wars films following Kurtz's departure, while similar mystical elements appeared in Kurtz's later muppet fantasy film The Dark Crystal. Lucas' replacement of mystical or spiritual explanations with more scientific-seeming explanations such as midichlorians in the Star Wars prequels has faced heavy criticism from Star Wars fans.""""A failure"", said George Lucas of The Empire Strikes Back. The undisputed fan favorite and favorite of film critics is a failure to George Lucas and his least favorite Star Wars film.This shouldn't surprise anyone either:""After Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, Lucas became convinced that audiences no longer cared about the story; they were simply there for thrills and entertainment, and he began to deviate from the original nine-episode bible starting with Return of the Jedi, at which point Kurtz quit the series""."	4.0	the 2nd film	2010-04-18	4	1	3

There are also some inconsistencies with the soundtrack including dialogue and other obvious changes to characters.You must know that Princess Leia went to great lengths to try and convince George Lucas not to tinker with our story. Millions of petitions were collected from numerous star systems and sent to him with Jedi emissaries Master Yoda and General Qui-Gon Jinn, attempted to exert their influence on a number of occasions in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution. Secret meetings were held and plans to raise money to fund a release of our own, were dashed when it was discovered that George Lucas's wealth and influence is more powerful than the force. Many have declared him a traitor and a sympathizer to the Empire for his treacherous displays of indifference.""Flash""! This just in......... Supporters to the Jedi council have just informed us that a small, but elite band of rag tag misfits who call themselves ""Sisters of C3PO"", have set out to hunt and destroy Lucas. This small but effective army of droids have been described as being very effeminate & fastidious killing machines, who's primary goal is to wipe out the threat of a maniac who forces his ""New & Improved"" vision on us.Recent reports claim that Mr. Lucas has taken flight aboard a star destroyer headed for the hoth system in an attempt to elude any possible assassinations. Our secret inside sources close to the Empire say that this information may be a ruse or ploy to break apart the droids, sending them on false missions while weakening their effectiveness. Some factions of the old rebellion have said that Mr. Lucas intends to resurrect a new senate council, in hopes to bog down efforts to securing any attempt to bring him in for questioning and listening to reason.In a last ditch effort Ewoks were dispatched to Skywalker Ranch to picket with signs like; ""George Lucas is a scruffy looking nerf herder"" and ""George Lucas is Jabbas love child"", while a small band of Jawas gained access to the production studios and attempted to steal the plans for the DVD release. Unfortunately it ended in disaster with a number of Ewoks and Jawas slaughtered by the Imperial Guard on George's payrollSo while we continue to fight the evil genius Darth Lucas in a on going battle to restore artistic freedom to the galaxy... keep your light sabers up and may the force be with you.Obi-Wan KenobiEditor In Chief"	3.0	Greetings and Salutations to all.......	2004-05-22	13	6	7

It's not like some random man ran up and changed the movies these were done by George Lucas himself and they look great. I can't blame George for making these changes being he didn't have the special effects to make his vision a reality in the 70's. George wants to leave behind a Star Wars that visually will stand up to the test of time.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3N26CT3Z7WA6K	A &#34;Billy T.&#34;	Besides some classic Disney movies, the first film I really remember seeing in the theater was Star Wars.  Empire left me depressed, and I made sure I saw Jedi the day it opened in 1983.  These films were groundbreaking and breathtaking for their time.  Fast forward to the 90's, and I was somewhat depressed that a whole bunch of inferior films looked better than the Star Wars movies I had loved.Unlike some Star Wars &#34;officiandos,&#34; I LOVE the special edition versions of the film.  Although there are some gratuitous &#34;we did it because we could&#34; scenes added (I didn't like Jabba's band the first time around), the tie-ins to the 1st trilogy really make them feel like one long, epic story arc and the movies are much cleaner to view&#8212;particularly on our modern-day HD flat panel digital televisions.  These films look like they could have been made in 2007 instead of 1977, and my son, born in the new millennium, is also a child of the Force, like his father before him.	5.0	I LOVE THE SPECIAL EDITION	2014-01-16	1	0	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AR9QPZFX65LDV	Aaron Alexander	I was very happy with the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD in general. I loved how clear the picture was and how they got rid of the black outlines on the AT-ATs and the rancor. However, the special edition (the only kind in the DVD trilogy) has a lot of digitaly added scenes that don't seem to fit very well with the more realistic set and puppets. In A New Hope, Mos Eisley is riddled with pointless digital add-ons (a robot hitting a probe droid out of it's way, jawas falling off the back of a large animal, ect.) that would have been right at home in Episode I The Phantom Menace. In the cantina scene in which Han Solo shot Greedo from under the table, Greedo never got a chance to shoot (in the original). I don't know if someone was complaining about Greedo not getting a fair shot or what, but now Greedo shoots first, then Han. Greedo fires, Han does some wierd dodge (more like a twitch) and shoots back. That aside, the DVD trilogy also has a good amount of special features which includes a large library of production photos, all of the original theatrical trailers, a very long documentary on the making of the original trilogy and three smaller documentarys: The Birth of the Lightsaber, The Characters and The Force is With them: The Legacy of Star Wars. There is also a short documentary on the recreating of Darth Vader in Episode III.	4.0	4 and a half stars	2005-09-08	2	2	0

We are reviewing the product not the film maker and their decision after all.  So about the product, I love the fact that this comes with both Blu-ray and DVD as I have not commited to a Blu-ray player yet and prefer to wait until I get an Xbox one anyway.  So having both in the same package is great so I can watch it now on DVD and when I do upgrade I can watch it on Blu-ray with out having to but a whole new trilogy box set.  For the price your paying and everything you get from it this is a fantastic deal.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3KZM27QXMIV59	"Aaron Nyquist ""I've got a bad feeling about this"""	As a longtime and devoted fan of Star Wars, I've looked forward to the release of the Trilogy on DVD with eagerness for quite a while.  However, the reviews that are written from the points of view of a few ignorant viewers are not accurate on how the Special Edition additions contribute to these timeless films.  First of all, before any aspect of Star Wars is analyzed, we must all first remember that these were films created from B movie serials FOR CHILDREN.  As much as we all love to find all the adult themes and mystic qualities, these are films that were first made for the entertainment of children.  So, settle down.Secondly, and more importantly, the negative reviewers of the Special Edition fail, as do many of the film critics of the prequels, to see that these are not individual movies.  This is a six part saga.  So thus, it's probably a good idea to have some continuation throughout the series.  You see the progression of characters and design in the prequels to end up where the designs are in the original trilogy.  So it makes perfect sense to add scenes to these films, for the continuation and EASE OF UNDERSTANDING for the story.  You cannot tell me that the addition of one scene with Han and Jabba, or some extra battle shots in the Death Star are going to completely ruin your experience of the movie.  If so, you're an easily distracted fool, who doesn't grasp the magic of this story.  While in some times, the added scenes may not add a ton to the plot, they certainly do not detract.  Maybe, once we look at this as more than 3 individual movies, and more as an epic story, we can get away from ignorant accusations of George Lucas being a malicious freak.  Enjoy them for what they're worth.  That's time a lot better spent than whining about a little change.	5.0	Open your mind	2004-08-27	23	11	12

It's a shame I came that close to NOT treating myself (decades later) and my kids to the Star Wars experience. Yes, the quality is lower than one expects from today's DVDs, but such is the quality of that era's movie productions compared to today's. As one reviewer stated, it's still better than VHS.I was about my son's age when Star Wars came out in the theater. It was something special to see him express the same enthusiasm and interest in these stories. We watched the original theatrical version, since that is what I remember seeing, but I imagine the 2nd time through we'll watch the special edition just to see what changed (and to experience the better surround sound encoding).Seeing the original trilogy has renewed my interest in the prequel trilogy, which I am going to order now.

In style it was sort of old time Saturday Serial which George Lucas admitted at the time was deliberate. I can't remember now if I've seen the next two in the original series beyond bits & pieces on TV but they were similar in nature from what I've seen.Some say these earlier Star Wars movies are the best of the bunch, better than the current ones, I would venture to say that they're about the same- the differences being mainly better FX now (and I think the originals were revolutionary for their times)and maybe a slightly different style.This set should've been released years ago, I've forgotten Lucas' lame excuse for not doing so. I can understand cleaning up or even upgrading the special effects as was done in the '97 theatrical re-release but I don't get changing some of the things that have been redone.

The original jolt of creativity which first greeted Star Wars so many years ago has long since faded. But there is a quality to these films which transcends time and the loss of luster. That quality, captured so well on DVD is the film's ability to rediscover what it felt like to really become part of a whole other set of universes. After a while you rally begin to believe that such creatures as Jaba the Hut, C3P0, Darth Vader, and the power of a force in the universe which has dual sides, really exist.

Cox ""Artist, Musician, Physicist and Cook"""	"Like many (many) people I still remember the original 3 movies, I've seen them back to back many times, on tv, on video, in original, extended etc. They are still the defining movies for the 70's/80's, they are more influential than the Matrix (which I loved), and more beloved than The GodFather. When they came out there was no competition to their status, but times move on.Now, it's interesting that people keep on mentioning some masterpiece not being changed by some artist after completion. Someone once asked Picasso if he ever finished a painting, and he replied ""they are never finished"" (or something to that effect). Artist don't 'not change pieces' because they are satisfied; that the piece is already 'perfect', they don't do it becasue they can't! They might not own it, they can't be bothered, they're too busy doing somethingelse, they might be even happy with the way it is; however, it's unlikely to be perfect. As someone who paints (amongst other things) I know understand this, a piece is rarely complete or (even close to) perfect.However, some artists do change/revise a released product later, this is obviously not always the case and composers throughout the ages have decided to make changes to certain pieces for better or for worst; anyone who's studied perfomance practice will know the difficulty in finding the definitive version of a piece.At the end of the day, it's Lucus' dream, his concept and they are his masterpieces. Now I don't believe these movies need to be changed, but if he does, its his perogative. I'd still thank him all the same, and I can't wait to own these."	5.0	A masterpiece !

It is more like a moderen remake of the old film. I would only buy the Star War movies that I saw back when they first came out. I remember reading about how ground breaking the films were at the time and could not wait to see them. I like, I am sure many others, watch older movies because we know ever piece of the film and enjoy waiting for each scene we know by heart. If the originals ever come out then and only then will I buy the Trilogy.	1.0	Star Wars Con.	2004-09-01	53	25	28

I have NO idea how it got past the editors.  It's HORRIBLE!  AWFUL mistake! What a slap in the face!  It's the worst thing in all three movies.  About 30 seconds of film ruined the entire boxed set for me.  I'm referring to the scene where the TIE fighters fly around the Falcon during the escape scene.  There are HUGE, discolored black boxes surrounding each fighter!  It's worse than anything in the original version of the movie!  How this got past the editors I will never know.  George Lucas should be ashamed!  He is gonna HAVE to re-do this, absolutely!  It's a MAJOR FLAW!Other than this major mistake, which comprises about 30 seconds of film, I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY by the rest of the movies.  Chewbacca was much better looking and his mouth moved correctly, adding to every scene he was in.  Jabba looked better and certainly moved much better in A NEW HOPE than he did before.  Everything was improved and BETTER, except the lightsabers in A NEW HOPE.  Apparently Lucas cannot change them much.  But SO much was added that ENHANCED and IMPROVED this set overall!  It was like watching them for the first time again.  So much was added to EVERY SINGLE scene.  It was eye-candy all over the place.  Dagobah, Hoth and Cloud City especially.  Unbelieveable attention to detail.  So many things to talk about that there's just no room...BUT the TIE fighter sequence during the Death Star escape in A NEW HOPE was the worst.  Unbelieveably sloppy!  The rest of the space scenes looked STELLAR throughout the rest of the movies.CHECK IT OUT, STAR WARS FANS.  You won't believe your eyes!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2FE8EIEGNWC41	"Adam Cole ""Ministry of Silly Walks"""	"[rating: 5 stars for these true classics of American film, minus one for padding their re-release with extra footage that bogs down the pace]When I saw the first series of Star Wars movies as a child, I was transported by the stark, Manichean outlines of George Lucas's mythology.  I bought plastic action figures and light-sabers, braved noxious glue fumes to piece together model X-wings and Millennium Falcons.  I was hooked!Now that the newer, more technology-driven prequels have arrived, there is a tendency to criticize the themes of these films as trite--a guileless, desperate, outnumbered good, faced with an implacable and unfathomable evil.  And indeed, there was a moment some 20 years after _Star Wars_ appeared when its lessons seemed quaintly simplistic to me, either because I'd grown up, or because America had:  grown far beyond childish dualism to a sophisticated appreciation of the complexities and subtleties of a world best described in shades of gray.And then 9/11 engulfed us, and suddenly things were simple again.  Much like Luke, we seemed locked in a struggle against Evil itself.  A terrible storm was at hand, a day of reckoning.  And today I worry for my country, not because the simple moral lessons of Star Wars are so relevant once more, but because we seem so bent on ignoring them.  To our leaders, perhaps, Osama bin Laden is the archetypal Vader figure, menacing the courageous Rebels that comprise our Western world...but what was it Vader said to ensnare Luke in _Empire_? ""Luke...release your anger!  Only your hatred can destroy me!""The Imperial enemy was indeed an evil worthy of eradication, but the obvious path--that of unchecked vengeance and destruction--led only to ruin and damnation, the Dark Side of the Force.  Now, in our own response to 9/11, we seem determined to hurl ourselves headlong into the same fundamental trap. Ruled by pain, fear, willful self-deception, and reflexive rage at an enemy whom we insist on glibly misreading, we've electively invaded a country that had *nothing* to do with 9/11, inflamed the entire Muslim world against us, and adopted a bunker mentality toward our own proud tradition of civil liberty that seems likely to destroy more of it than it preserves.  To the 3,000 murdered on that fateful day we have now added a thousand brave soldiers, over 10,000 Iraqi lives, $200 BILLION tax dollars, and priceless international credibility, all to give Osama bin Laden exactly what he wants: a riven, joyless world, set ablaze with enduring hatred.  Listen closely, and you can almost hear the Emperor gloating at the spectacles of Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and Fallujah.  A Jedi craves not these things, but fights out of necessity, with eyes open.I think both Obi-Wan and Yoda would've agreed with the war philosopher Sun Tzu, who said, ""If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.""  Our leaders have done the nation a great disservice in failing to do either.  But unlike Star Wars, our final episode is not yet written.  Whatever happens in Iraq, whether or not we kill bin Laden and a hundred like him, there is still time to step back from the brink and remember who we are, still time to avoid the most grievous loss of all: that of our own ideals, freedom, honor, and humanity.  As FDR famously reminded us, we need not be governed by fear even in the darkest of times.  The first step toward positive change need not be perfect, but it must come soon.  November 2 is approaching.You know what to do."	4.0	Star Wars: A Lesson for Modernity	2004-10-08	21	4	17
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2UNWTVNHZK8ZW	Adam Crowson	"Content -- ""The Original Trilogy"" doesn't mean original theatrical release. I think it's implied that Star Wars Trilogy means Episodes IV-VI. So saying original trilogy made me think these were the theatrical releases that we all grew up with as kids or saw for the first time. Nope. At least Star Wars and Empire are palatable. Can't say the same for Return of the Jedi. The closing sequence or the Max Rebo Band's performance at Jabba's Palace are an absolute joke.This package should have offered the original theatrical release.Technical aspects -- Technical aspects raise my rating a bit. The blu-ray transfer is amazing. The sound is even better. The picture is brightened just a bit which brings out details you can't see in these movies in standard def or even on the old VHS copies I have.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	"It's nearly impossible to review such an enduringly integral component of pop-culture out of that context, but Star Wars was the new fairy tales for a generation who had outgrown the old ones. A post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, jaded, cynical society was looking for new legends in which to believe, and they found them in the form of the Death Star, Darth Vader, and Luke Skywalker. To this day, Star Wars is big business (just look at merchandise sales and box office grosses) which still has a rabid group of fans, but recent installments have been critically panned and lukewarmly received by viewers. So, not having been able to hold back fan response any longer, Lucas has released the first three movies on DVD, in a move that is sure to give him even more money. This time, though, we know we're getting good stuff: two classic films and a pretty good finale.Star Wars brings back a lot of nostalgia for a lot of people, and for good reason: it taps into the ever-powerful good vs. evil motif, it gives us a hero to root for and a villain to hiss at. There's space battles, jailbreaks, and a powerful emotional payoff at the end. It is the template of what makes a good movie, and happens to be pretty entertaining to this day. Its sequel, though, is my favorite of the group. The Empire Strikes Back adds shades of gray to the Star Wars universe, its much darker look and feel and mythic overtones (and less than happy ending) make this the least favorite of some and the favorite of the rest of us. The Empire Strikes Back also has one of the best plot twists in history, and aside from all the spoofing throughout the years, I still get a tingle down my spine when Vader tells Luke, ""I am your father!"" We get a gritty melodrama where things don't turn out all right at the end of the day, but it is not a grim tale, there is a balance in the storytelling that really works for the movie. The final installment, Return of the Jedi, is less than the sum of its parts. Good vs. Evil -- good. Father vs. Son, Vader vs. Skywalker -- good. Ewoks -- not so much (they were born to become collectible teddy bears for Star Wars fans). This movie did end the trilogy in a very satisfying manner, though: the emotional payoff made the entire journey worthwhile.There's still a lot to like about these movies: I think the special effects look great (and unlike recent installments are not at all gratuituous), the fairy-tale like narrative style and fantastic locations and images are indellible. Although there is a high probability that everyone in the world has seen these movies, and many own a set, the DVD set promises to be worth the buy (until Lucas releases another one in a year).

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3HQ5CWXZJXF8J	Adam Platts	"Star Wars is the story of a young man (Luke Skywalker) who in just one day's time goes on an incredible and unbelievable adventure of a lifetime, exploring the depths of outer space, confronting terrible evil, and prevailing against a machine designed for terror and destruction.George Lucas' first Star Wars film ""A New Hope"" is one of the best movies of all time, but it is also one of the most unbelievable, and succeeds at suspending one's disbelief.  As one example, Luke Skywalker leaves his home planet on board the Millennium Falcon, a space ship about the size of a basketball court.  While traveling through space the Falcon provides its passengers with ""Earth-like"" gravity, always keeping their feet firmly planted on the floor.Another example of how well Star Wars ""suspends disbelief"" revolves around the story's main plot line: that a small, manmade, metal moon has been designed by the evil empire in order to keep control of all its imperial possessions through the threat of terrible force.  The empire's ""Death Star"" moon is equipped with enough fire power to destroy a planet, and early on in the movie it does fire a death ray that completely obliterates a whole planet.  The problem is that the Death Star is a moon.  If the empire wants to go destroy a planet it has to go ""hover"" over to some region of the galaxy where it can then fire its guns.  Traveling at the speed of light, it would take about 4 years for someone on Earth to reach the next closest solar system to our Sun.  The Death Star does not travel at the speed of light.  It hovers.  If the Death Star hovered at a considerable rate of thousands of miles per hour, that would still be only a tiny fraction of the speed of light.  When the Falcon escapes the Death Star, because ""the old man got the tractor beam out of commission,"" the space ship blasts off into hyper space, traveling a tremendous distance in a short amount of time to reach the Rebel base.  Then, in hot pursuit, comes the Death Star, ""hovering"" after Luke, Leia, and Han in the Falcon.  That very same day the Death Star catches up to the Falcon at the Rebel base.  Luke, a farm boy from an insignificant corner of the universe, is entrusted by the Rebels and gets equipped with one of the Alliance's X-Wing fighters so that he can go destroy the Death Star before it destroys the Rebel base.  And as the Death Star makes its final approach to the Rebels' planet, the evil imperial lord Darth Vader says, ""This will be a day long remembered.  We have seen the end of Kenobi.  We shall soon see the end of the Rebellion.""  The key word is ""day.""  This whole Star Wars adventure took place in just one day.  So the Death Star covered many millions, or perhaps many billions of miles, in a fraction of a day.  Conquering this impossibility of reality is really what make Star Wars so great.  The plot features the triumph of good over evil.  The cinematography features the triumph of science fiction over physics.Review by: Adam Platts"	5.0	Star Wars - conquers your disbelief	2006-05-11	9	5	4

I know that some complain about the fact that the ""original print"" is included, but in my opinion these versions with the addition's ( SW fans know where they all occur so I won't give a run down ) and CGI enhancements make the film even better.The only one I will mention (as an example) is when the X-Wing's take off to go and take on the Death Star. Look at the original version and try to tell me that it looks better than the close up version of the X-Wings flying towards the Death Star in the Special Edition.Anyway, if you remember when the special editions were released on VHS a fews years back, it was explained that the original film print had deteriorated so much, that it was almost unwatchable (we are talking about 20+ year old film here boys and girls). Who would want an ""original print"" in that condition transferred to DVD ?The doco's are very imformative with plenty of behind the scene's footage.  It would of been great if the set included the original ""Makings of..."" series that come out prior to the original cinema releases.  Mind you, I find that with Special Features on any DVD, I normally only look at them once or twice no matter how intersting they are - you get the DVD for the actual movie anyway.The sound and picture are great - I don't own a huge home theatre set-up so I am probably not the right person to voice a hi-tech opinon on how it sounds in 5.1 or looks on a large wide screen tv, but for the average-joe with a DVD player, Stereo and TV setup it all looks fine.I won't comment on the actual movie/story line because if you have never seen Star Wars, chances are you would not even be reading this.

Estes	"With George Lucas becoming an overrated, bloated egomaniac and completely sucking the life and adventure out of the once promising series, the classic ""original"" trilogy is the only Lucas road worth traveling. Watch these movies and compare them with the two recent prequels, and you will see many differences in quality. Sure, the new ones are amped up on SFX steroids, but are missing the heart that the semi-low budget ""A New Hope"" had. My favorite movie out of the trilogy would probably be The Empire Strikes back, which completely destroys ""A New Hope"" in my opinion. I recently bought this trilogy and enjoyed watching it because it reminded me of when I was really small and I used to own all 3 movies in their original packaging (Too bad they got sold at a lawn sale 8 years ago).

I'm thrilled, which is more than I can say for some of the other customers reviewing this grand series on this site.  For all you hard-hearts out there, listen to yourselves:  you are complaining about the Star Wars trilogy being released on DVD, with beautiful color, and ample bonus features.  On DVD.  Think about it.And speaking of which, I'm not sure why the customer who rants about Star Wars being a LOTR rip-off is so angry.  Certainly there are similarities like say the ""good vesus evil"" theme.  But to say that George Lucas is a thief?  Ouch.  This is a space western, pure and simple.  If anything is a rip-off of LOTR, it's Harry Potter, despite it being enjoyable in it's own right.  Come on, the gigantic spider?  Professor Dumbledore?

Without the improvements, future fans of Star Wars would be hopelessly left with films that don't quite fit together in a nice, tidy package.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	There's not much praise I can give to the new effects in this movie; the only ones that are really effective are the ones in the extended assault on the Death Star in &quot;A New Hope.&quot;  It's great to see the X-wings soaring around at break-neck speed like we always knew they could, and we get marvelous new angles of the Death Star's variated surface.  I would have to say that this is where it should have ended though.It's tough to take all three movies into account at the same time because of the strength of one, the brilliance of the other, and the somewhat troublesome last one.  It's sort of common ruling that &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; is the best, &quot;Star Wars&quot; the second, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; the last.  Now, considering what &quot;Jedi&quot; is up against, it's still a great movie, just not &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; quality.  Forgive me for saying this too, but were it not for &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; I don't think we'd be talking about Star Wars like we do today, and George Lucas's ghastly new movies would be only sidebar mentions in movie-mags.Overall, the quality of the tapes isn't very good.  The picture is exceedingly bright, to the point where we can't make out details in the background.  The special effects are sort of a first-generation attempt at modern movie sophistication (&quot;Matrix&quot; anyone?) and were interesting at first glance, but considering how far we've come since then, they've become almost corny in appearance.  What's up with Jabba the Hutt?  He looks now like a concept effect and not a finished product.  And why couldn't they clean up the lightsaber effect?  If so much of the movie's old effects weren't good enough to remain, why was the painted-on blade allowed to stay? (which is the only good thing about the new movies vs. the old ones).  And what's interesting too is how they still don't stack up to those highly detailed models they made back in the 70's and 80's.  Give me a Star Destroyer cruising past before I see Jabba the Hutt slithering on by.The performances haven't changed except for Han Solo shooting first (an unforgivable transgression by Lucas, must all our heroes be virtuous and unspoilt?)  Frank Oz's performance as Yoda was allowed to remain, which we should all thank our lucky stars for.  I suppose Lucas didn't want to jeopardize his relationship with Oz since he needed him for the new trilogy.All in all, I prefer the old versions to the revamped versions, which I can still find at my local used-book and movie outlet.  I would recommend going purest and getting those instead of these &quot;special edition&quot; versions.	3.0	The &quot;Holy Trilogy&quot; reworked	2004-01-28	637	379	258

Forget VHS, even if the ""real"" Han does shoot first on your old tape.  I've seen Star Wars a gazillion times, but the best time of all, barring only the first time, was watching these DVDs.

Gullicksen ""ghost squire"""	"George Lucas has said that he will never release the original versions of the classic trilogy in any format, ever.  That is not speculation or innuendo but practically a quote.  Apparently Lucas was and is unhappy with the technological, monetary and time constraints placed on him during their filming, so new and ""improved"" versions of the classics will most likely keep popping up every decade or so for the next eon, and guess what?  Their existence will increase exponentially.  That's right, for every new technology, (VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, god knows what else) there will be 4,5 or more ""Special Platinum Director's Cuts"".  And as more media viewing technology pops up, there will be a version for each one.  So get ready to spend.George Lucas is a very smart man.  He used to be a god to me, and I still admire him greatly.  But he is greedy.  Now, there is nothing wrong with that, we are all greedy to some extent.  But I wish he would realize that many fans love his classic trilogy in it's original form, and just release it on DVD.After reading all of the Star Wars books, and playing with all of the Star Wars toys, and sleeping in Star Wars bedsheets and paying to be in the fan club, I now realize those things were just distracting me from the greatness of the essential mythology, filmmaking and fantastic story of Star Wars.Mr. Lucas, I still love you, please release a boxed set with a cleaned up, widescreen, digitally mastered, etc. etc. original classic trilogy on DVD, the scripts for the movies, your rough drafts (Anakin Starkiller etc.), the screenplays, Ralph McQuarrie's production paintings and conceptual drawings in some sort of bound book, the making of the movies DVD with interviews etc. and some sort of documentary chronicling your journey of the creation of the original Star Wars Trilogy.I'm giving this product 4 stars because it is an adulterated, alloyed version of the original, which gets 5 stars."	4.0	Lucas Quite Insane	2004-09-23	7	6	1

HA!)There is a night-and-day difference between this set and its counterpart. Yes, it looks dated in spots. Yes, the green-screen effects occaisionally throw a glitch into the works. And yes, the non-human characters look like puppets and costumes, but the original releases are of a much higher caliber than the new ones. Maybe it's just how old I am, what I am used to, but Episodes IV through VI, are just better movies, period.Anakin Skywalker is now in full Darth Vader mode, drunk with power, and his offspring, Leia and Luke are leading an organization set on overthrowing his regime. As with its precursor, you must take the time to sit through all three installments to better grasp the story, but each does hold up on its own.Again, maybe it's my age group, but I think the outer space visuals are phenomenal. And the scenery is more what I imagine a life-friendly place to look like. And, having characters actually in front of the camera, does hold a tactile sensation that the digital age seems to be bent on undoing. But old meets new here, as some segments of the older films are occaisionally given CGI treatments. Done sparingly, it works beautifully. Done to excess, it is just sterile. It could have been helpful to use the advent of CGI to make the puppet characters' facial expressions more life-like. They seemingly spared no expense in putting out the new and re-issuing the old, so why not?But, as I have said, my bias leans heavily on this box, instead of the other. And sitting through all of it, is like watching a movie that is almost 15 hours long.

Then, as so often happens, they will probably share the results with the world, free of charge.  Then, the people who can't stand what you've unilaterally done to their childhood memories will go and download those results, because it's the only way to get a high-quality transfer of what they *really* want.  In the process, they will put zero nickels in your pocket.On the other hand, if you release BDs that either contain just the original material, or contain it as an additional disc, I think you'll find that most traditionalists will go against their better judgment and actually give you even more of their hard-earned money, just for the sake of having legitimate hardcopies.

Take this for instance- If you were watching A New Hope right now, not knowing when it was made, when would you guess that it was made? It was so far ahead of its time, a 1977 movie!! The movie is suspenseful! It was very clever in the Death Star trench scene. Never have I seen a better ended movie.

Jenista	Come on George, what's your problem?You can try like crazy to make it appear that you envisioned the entire series of star wars when you made the first movie, but clearly you DID NOT. So instead you make liars of all but Darth Vader in the movie, which is ironic. I was shocked back when I saw you had changed the title of Star Wars to Episode IV a new hope... and realized that you would be spinning up numerous movies predicated upon greed, both at the box-office and in merchandise.I love the way the new set LOOKS seamless with the new movies... but then again, I DON'T REALLY CARE MUCH FOR THE NEW MOVIES. Why not? Because rather than inventing something new, you try to build upon the old. But then, in the final analysis, all you can do is go back and revise the originals. Trying to make a story consistent which is not. Little subtleties like Obi Wan lying to Luke about his father. Clearly that was the real story - but you realized that it made for a far less exciting Empire Strike's Back, so you have Darth tell him that he's his father, and set about creating this sequence of changes.I am surprised you couldn't spend all this energy on creating a separate and exciting adventure, that has nothing to do with the old characters... what a colossal waste!Even with all your revisionism you can see that the stories still don't line up, the inconsistencies are too great - and the final tragedy is that of having the Queen of Nabu, or Nabu itself, never go back and purchase Annikan's mother's freedom. Like she, or the Jedi counsel, or Amadhala, would not of just went and bought her. But then, there wouldn't have been a movie right? You had to struggle to concoct a reason for Darth Vader's story, and try to pack the theatres for another three movies.I wish the original movie, in it's unaltered form, could just be released. But, then, it is too revealing not of the special effects of Hollywood, and their state at the time, but rather it is too revealing of George Lucas' greed in revising the story.Too bad, and what a waste of money.	1.0	George Lucas's lies and revisionism is getting old!	2004-09-24	75	26	49

You wouldn't even be complaining if he didn't do them in the first place.I just wished that he had included the scenes with Biggs and Luke before Biggs left Tatooine to join the Rebels, and the scene where Luke looks up to see the battle between Princess Leah's ship and the Star Destroyer.

However there are changes: these are the special editions so for purists there most be some things that they wont like, but if you (like myself) enjoyed the Special Editions re-release on theaters, you will enjoy this one as well.Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi never looked and sound so great! With digital sound and restored film footage it looks like its all new.However there are small changes: on Empire the conversation between the Emperor and Vader (with Ian Mc Diarmid added when it was the holgram figure of Clive Revill speaking) is changed from the original (just the lines of the Emperor) that was a little lousy change, and also including Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin at the end of 'Jedi' that was also very strange. But still those minor flaws you can enjoy a good and a classic popcorn movie. A few good changes? For example the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Vader on 'A New Hope' was given speed which makes thing a little Vader. The already added scene of Jabba and Han Solo was also a little bit tweaked so Jabba can match the color of the puppet on ROTJ.Anyway the 4th disc are the extras wich are AWESOME!!

I actually haven't seen these movies in years, as I knew that they would hit DVD eventually, and I'd never seen them in widescreen before.  I would have been satisfied with the original cuts, but am not disappointed with the special editions.  For the most part, the added effects look great, and provide a better transition into the new trilogy.What really disappoints me is the disc for Epsidode IV: A New Hope.  This disc is a disaster.  In some scenes, the dialog is drowned out and 'dirty' sounding, while in other scenes, it sounds very crisp and clear.  That alone wouldn't be so bad, but there are plenty of visual glitches in my copy as well.  In the second half of the film, there are many digital skips and artifacts popping up.  It looks like the disc is ready to start skipping at any minute, and then, at one point, the movie freezes for several seconds and skips ahead a few minutes into the film!  I looked at several messageboards and it appears that it is not just my disc.  Apparently, it's a known problem in the pressing of the discs that is only evident in certain dvd players.  I trust that LucasFilm was unwarare of this problem when shipping the product, and that they will make replacement discs available.I don't know if anyone from the studio is reading this, but with the many many people chiming in every day to complain about the things we DO know were done intentionally, I wouldn't blame lucasfilm for staying as far away from these reviews as possible.  Shame, really.  I just want what I paid for to work properly.The disc for Empire played flawlessly, and still stands out as the best looking of the trilogy, but the Jedi disc had a few odd video glitches, and also froze at one point.  Taking the disc out and putting it back in allowed me to resume the film and view the rest without any problems, however.. so I don't know if it is related to the problem with the 'A New Hope' disc.I trust these problems are not going to be ignored, and that we will have replacement discs available soon.  If not for these terribly distracting glitches, the set would easily get a 5 star rating, as the movies look and sound fantastic, and despite the problems, they managed to fill me with the joy and giddiness that I felt watching these films as a child.	3.0	disappointing technical problems mar this awesome set	2004-10-02	5	3	2

Anyway, the original Star Wars Trilogy (sort of) is finally on DVD.  Yes, these are the Special Editions (sort of).  Even more changes have been made here.  I consider myself a moderate Star Wars fan: I enjoy the films and the video games, and I still collect some of the action figures, but I don't read all the books, sleep on Star Wars sheets, dress up like characters from the films, or anything like that.  There was a time when I was younger that I would've been very much against the idea of altering these films, but now that I'm older I feel that Lucas should be able to (for better or worse) modify his films (he would say ""complete"" them), but I also think the originals should be available for those who fell in love with them back in the day.Anyway, on to the films.  They look and sound great, and most of the changes don't alter the films in a negative way.  I like the addition of the Jabba scene in the original Star Wars, and they've improved the CGI to make him look more like he does in Episode I.  Unfortunately however, Greedo still shoots first in this version, and even though it's been improved a bit, it still looks bad, and still changes the story for the worse (in my opinion).  This is my single least favorite change in the whole trilogy.One other change that has some fans angry is the substitution of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return Of The Jedi: now, instead of seeing the spirit of an older Anakin, we see young Anakin...looking kind of creepy no less (though it would explain why old Anakin's body doesn't disappear when he dies if it was young Anakin who became one with the force).At any rate, this is a great set, and the bonus disc has (among other things) a great documentary on the making of the trilogy that will surprise a lot of long-time fans.I recommend this DVD set, though hopefully someday the original versions of these films will be released for those who want them."	5.0	Featuring Carrie Fisher as Margot Kidder!	2004-11-14	16	14	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ATP8ZQ7C7SP0	Alan	"That's 5 stars for the original version, minus one star for editing to get the DVD version, minus two stars for taking away control of my own FF button before the actual movie starts playing.Ever since two of the three tapes in my VHS version of the original trilogy degerated to the point of being unwatchable, I have been waiting with great anticipation for the DVD versions of these classics.  SPOILERS HEREIN.I about fell out of my chair when I saw Anakin as a spirit at the end of ROTJ.  I can understand adding snippets of extra scenes, e.g. the celebrations across the universe at the empire's demise, but this Anakin thing seemed pointless (notice that Obiwan and Yoda are shown in their older forms).  I could give many other similar examples, very few of which I found an improvement over the original cut.Also some mention has been made in previous posts about the quality of the sound mixing.  I must say I found the audio leveling very poor - it was often difficult to hear the dialog through the background clatter and soundtrack, when the orignals were perfectly clear (e.g. CP3O and R2D2 approaching Jaba's palace at the beginning of ROTJ).But the thing that really irritates me more than anything else is starting the damn movie.  Why oh why do so many DVDs force you to watch 20 seconds of FBI warnings, 20 seconds for InterPol, another 20 seconds for the MPAA thing, still another 20 seconds of worthless mish-mash, followed by some agonizingly long ""cutsie"" pre-menu animation (which I have to watch EVERY time I want to display the menu) before giving you control over your own fast-forward button?!  I suggest more DVD producers take a lesson from two of the greatest trilogies in DVD history as examples of how best to design control/menu functionality: The Godfather, and Lord of the Rings.  Pop it in, go straight to the menu, and then straight to the movie.  Brilliant!!"	2.0	annoying DVD features	2004-09-22	27	18	9

I thought they were okay, but not nearly as good as the original.  Part 3 was great until the hilarious darth vader noooo scene.So here we have another George Lucas revision to his movies...  And this is not turning old movies into the new ones sorry to say, it's more or less turning them into crap.  When Obi Wan does his krayt dragon call, he now sounds like a crazy old man.  Better run sand people!  That crazy old man is coming for ya!Then we have the infamous greedo scene.  I know it was in the 1997 version, but it's still there.  You had a guy who was a badass, and you make greedo shoot first and miss.  It's rediculous.  Georgey should go and ask tough guys how being tough is before making any more changes and making bad guys look even dumber...Such as Darth Vader.  So now Georgey boy makes Darth yell noooooo when throwing the emperor into the pit.  I'm guessing the emperor didn't notice Darth yelling nooooo?  You could hear that a mile away!  If they made a dumb and dumber 2, that sound should be the new most annoying sound in the world!So no, not everyone in our generation likes watching Georgey boy transform badass dark lords, anti heroes, and tough old men into crazy old men, guys who get shot at by idiots, and emo dark lords.  We actually like good movies.  Ignoring sales..	1.0	Buy it if you want to watch crazy old men, greedo shooting first, and emo dark lords	2012-03-25	10	6	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AJYU5DYJQ81YH	Al DiCostanzo	"I have read several reviews, and I must say that there's a lot of whining going on. I'm only 16, so I haven't see the original versions of the movies as much as the revised versions, but I like the newer versions. First of all, most of the changes made make sense. For example, inserting Hayden Christiansen in the final scene of ""Jedi"" is good because that is what Anakin looks like in the prequels, not that older person that was replaced. Another example: putting Ian McDiarmid in as the emperor in ""Empire Strikes Back."" Why does it make sense...oh, well, because he does play the emperor in every other movie that the emperor is in, so having the other actor in ""Empire Strikes Back"" just threw the viewer off once the prequels were released. Even without the prequels, McDiarmid is the emperor in ""Jedi."" Second, if you don't like the enhanced digital picture and 5.1 Dolby sound, then you're living in the past way too much. It makes the movies so much better. But even more than that, it helps the original trilogy catch up a little bit with the prequels, in terms of picture and sound quality.Personally, these movies have only gotten better in my view. The changes have helped make the overall story more understandable. And yes, I still don't love that musical scene in Jabba's Palace very much, but the other alterations make sense. Plus, the bonus footage is really cool.In short, these new DVD's really enhance the great story and overall product that is Star Wars. And, if you haven't seen ""Sith,"" you absolutely must!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away'.I was 14 when I first saw this now-famous opening 'card' to what was then just Star Wars.  It had not yet been given an Episode number or a subtitle.  It was simply Star Wars back in the summer of 1977, and George Lucas was not sure - and neither was 20th Century Fox - whether his dream of a six-chapter Skywalker/Star Wars saga would be realized.  After all, this mixture of space adventure, Western, war movie, and old-fashioned mythology was, according to some studio executives, a souped-up comic book story with no chance of making money.Yet, the adventures of farmboy-turned-into-hero Luke Skywalker somehow defied the logic of skeptics and fuddy duddy critics, and Star Wars went on to make movie history (and billions in ticket sales and licensed products).  Lucas went on to write the next two films' stories and screenplays (with the creative talents of the late Leigh Brackett and writer-director Lawrence Kasdan to assist), and with the success of Star Wars (which by 1981 would be renamed as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) to build up Lucasfilm Limited (LFL) into a huge multi-media empire.  And even though it would be almost two decades before the prequels could be made and released, the Star Wars Trilogy's completion in 1983 laid the groundwork for the creation of Episodes One, Two, and Three.This boxed set of the Star Wars Trilogy consists of the 1997 Special Edition films.  These were released to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Star Wars, which was a good promotional tool for LFL to build up fan enthusiasm for the still-in-production Episode I.  The Special Edition re-release featured not only a restored print of the film, but also some deleted scenes (mostly with Jabba the Hutt) were incorporated into Star Wars: A New Hope.  Mos Eisley was practically reinvented digitally, and some scenes were tweaked digitally, pleasing some fans while annoying others.  The other two Episodes (The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) were given less drastic retouches' or at least there were fewer gripes about the changes there.Of course, none of the elements that made the Classic Trilogy such a big part of our lives is missing in this Special Edition.  Luke's earnest quest to be a Jedi, Leia's resolution to restore the democratic Republic, the droids' Laurel-and-Hardy friendship, Han's casual courage, Chewie's fierce loyalty, Obi-Wan's quiet nobility, Yoda's quirky teachings, Palpatine's unremitting evil, and Darth Vader's dark power are all there, just as we aging teenagers of the Star Wars Generation remember them.  Industrial Light & Magic's then-visionary effects have been cleaned up (there are none of those unsightly mattes that are evident in home video transfers), and John Williams' classic score still sounds fresh and timeless.The Star Wars Trilogy - at least this is my impression - is the movie series that has been most shamelessly re-released and re-packaged since the advent of videotape.  Since 1992 four boxed sets (original, THX, 1997 Limited Edition, and 2000 re-release) have been launched like so many probe droids.  This latest video release has the fewest extra features of the last three - the 1992 boxed set has no extra features.  While the THX version from 1995 opens each film with a short intro by George Lucas and Leonard Maltin, and the 1997 limited release comes with explanations of how and why the films were altered and/or restored, the 2000 boxed set only has a short promotional featurette about Episode II.This boxed set comes in an easy to find pan and scan (full screen) format and a harder-to-find Widescreen version.  Until the DVD set comes out sometime in 2005, this boxed set is the best way to enjoy the original Star Wars films.	5.0	Hard to find...but worth buying	2003-06-10	9	6	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A28CR7IWZXBBPK	"Alex ""ironeagle214"""	Now just so you all know, I LOVE Star Wars.  I used to read all the exdended universe books, I can play the movies in my head like DVDs in and of themselves, and I still get chills when I watch the final Death Star run.Now that that is aside, I do NOT like these movies.  IT is nothing against the Star Wars movies, it is against what George Lucas has done to them and is continuing to do to them.These movies were and continue to be a cultural phenomenon that cannot be explained.  The reason that they were was that nothing like them had ever been made before.  EVER.Alright, I'll stop beating around the bush and say it flat out.  I believe that George Lucas should have left these movies alone completely.  I do not approve of anything that he put into them.  NOTHING.  In my opinion he has tainted what used to be a wonderful movie experience with the mistakes he has made on the subsequent prequels.  I grew up with these movies, I could recite them before I could multiply (not joking).  A large part of what made these movies great was that you could see the flaws in them.  Hamil and Fischer's shadows off-camera, the lightsaber blades disappearing at certain angles, the at times ridiculous-looking props.  It was charming.  Lucas has taken many of those moments away.Let's take a look at some of the things he put into the trilogy.  The Jabba scene.  Oh please, I definately see why that was originally taken out.  The scene sucked.  (PS.  Why the HELL is Boba Fett in that scene?  He would NEVER be just hanging around Jabba like some henchman.  He's the most deadly bounty hunter in the galaxy.)  Other things Lucas added.  Greedo shooting first.  Please.  The updated space battles.  Yeah they're cool-looking, but I was so fond of the actual models.  Other things, the extended Wampa scene, the new ending of Jedi...the list goes on.  I just can't find any reason why one should mess with a good thing.The least that Lucas could do would be to give us the option of getting the un-augmented version or not.  Just give us the choice, that's all I'm asking.I don't know if I'll buy this movie.  I do know that I will treasure my VHS originals (from the 80s) for a long LONG time.PS.  I also have no faith in the upcoming third prequel.  The other two destroyed all my hope for any kind of greatness.	3.0	Just hear me out...	2004-07-23	15	13	2

Yes, the story is still there along with some of the cheesy effects that I fell in love with, but there are more computer animated scenes.

I for one have always preferred the original theatrical cuts of the three movies. The new effects fit very poorly with the original shots--a problem that is endemic throughout the 'new' trilogy--and essentially add nothing. However, some people like the new version, and I respect that. Therefore, Lucas should have cranked out *two* DVD sets. One with the original cut, one with the expanded cuts. Easy as pie--people do it with fullscreen/widescreen movies all the time. Might even have made *more* money. But, no. Now, if I want to see the originals, I have to fall back on my VHS tapes.

Every time he releases 'Star Wars' he feels the need to tinker and alter and change and SCREW-UP something that doesn't need fixing. People say ""oh, he can do whatever he wants - they're HIS movies."" Wrong - he didn't direct 'Empire Strikes Back' or 'Return of the Jedi' & those were the best movies of the trilogy (coincidence?).  For his latest screw-ups he's given all the Ewoks blinking CGI eye-lids, created a very awkward pan and scan scene of a new CGI door for Jabba's Palace, added X-Wings to the final Deathstar assualt, AND made an even goofier, longer 'dragon noise' when Obi-Wan scares away the Sand People.But those are nothing compared to the worst change of all. Now....there have been some awful edits in the past (Greedo shooting first, Jabba in a 'New Hope', Gungans at the end of 'Jedi', Hayden's force ghost & the truly embarrassing new song in Jabba's Palace) - NONE of those tragedies are as terrible as this newest ""improvement."" It's all over the Internet and it looked like a joke but it's all too real. When Darth Vader kills the Emperor to save Luke's life, Vader no longer appears as an old warrior whose forgotten self triumphantly rises from the ashes. NOW Vader gives us an awkward ""No?"" and, as he picks up the Emperor, Vader moans a pitiful ""Noooooooooo!""  It's embarassing - it's bad filmmaking. It completely ruins the tone of the scene, the character of Vader & the climax of the entire film cycle.What next? Where does it end? How about a CGI tail for Chewbacca? CGI Yoda in ""Empire"" & ""Jedi""? Erase Alec Guinness and replace him with Ewan McGregor?With this latest batch of tinkering, Lucas has finally ruined these films for good. It's an insult to the fans and to everyone who worked so hard on the original films. 'Star Wars' has been butchered and destroyed. Meanwhile Lucas REFUSES to release the originals in any viewable format. It's time Lucas and his 'yes men' were sent a message.

You see the cardboard boxes in stores as well, in huge displays with the Full Screen and the Widescreen versions alternating, a checkerboard of bronze and silver.What's all the fuss about?  Many if not most of you are STAR WARS fans already and while I don't want to waste your time by ""preaching to the choir,"" for newbies' sake I ought at least to say a little about the three movies in the just-released *STAR WARS TRILOGY* before we get into quality of transfer, etc.STAR WARS, to me, is the classic ""space opera,"" and I admire these three first films released by Lucas most of all.  I wish the innocent fun, earnest acting and slam-bang heroism of A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI--technically Episodes 4, 5 and 6 of the STAR WARS cycle but in actuality the first three movies to hit the screeen--oh, how I wish those qualities were present in Lucas' last two or three flicks from the STAR WARS cycle!Technically, let's recall that NEW HOPE, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and JEDI were stunningly professional, up-to-the-minute works of cinema in their original 1977-1983 period.  Ironically, though, and with the possible exception of the ALIENS franchise, these films will probably go down in history as the last of the great big-budget ""analog"" (or, should I say, pre-computer animation) era of of sci-fi Hollywood moviemaking. Before virtual reality cut out a considerable swath of old-fashioned regular physical reality in the special-effects canon of blockbusters, the effort Lucas & Co. had to make to create those humongous space ships, futuristic hover-cars, weird aliens, and entertaining ambient sounds bespeak a level of SFX technology much closer to THE WIZARD OF OZ than to, say, Lucas' latest releases in the STAR WARS cycle.This TRILOGY really pushes in our faces a dilemma that Hollywood has, until, now, successfully avoided:  Should a restoration be true to the original cinematic release and entail only cosmetic clean-ups; or, on the other hand, should the joyous cornucopia of options that post-1995 CGI makes available to Lucas, be used by Lucas to create special effects he wished he had back in the Seventies?Well, the jury's out, and that's precisely because the kind of work put into this consumer product was indeed, as a prior reviewer said, rather ""half-assed.""  If you expect to see the limitations of that older technology ameliorated or eliminated with the tools of the digital era, you may be disappointed with this new boxed set.  The editing and composition are almost 100 percent the same as in the enhanced VHS video versions that Lucas released years ago.  The CGI used here is the kind that excels in skittering little reptilians and rodents in the desert, but no effort was made, for example, to give a realistic-looking mouth to the blue-headed assailant who confronted Han Solo in the Tatooine saloon sequence early in Episode IV.  Perhaps Lucas and Fox were conflicted as to how many arguably ""charming"" flaws to leave in from 1970s technology, and perhaps Lucas compromised by leaving the speaking parts alone to concentrate on the ""diddlies"" . . .  or maybe it was just done on the cheap.Of course, the person who buys this new STAR WARS TRILOGY will receive the net benefit of DVD's superior rendition on a regular TV or HDTV.  Yes, the color is better but not perfect.  The sound is usually all right but it is pretty obvious when steps have been taken to punch things up by graphic-equalizer  enhancement or perhaps the actual human actors' speaking and re-looping their original scenes.  But one suspects that the high-tech restoration/ enhancement of TRILOGY was pretty much a hands-off project.  The level of now-routine restoration technology that Fox used in the original MARILYN MONROE DIAMOND series is evident here (you won't get speckles in the screen), but I'm not seeing evidence of labor-intensive human hours and decisions and all the kind of sweat-and-strain that made the Monroe collection so desirable and so rewarding to own.Will Lucas come out with a more scrupulously worked set at a higher price?  Hell if I know!  He's about as predictable as Disney was when founder Walt was still alive.  Was Lucas' attitude toward his enormous (and potentially even more so enormous) audience to ""Let the Force"" be with us, or was it more along the lines of ""To the Egress""?  I don't know or care.But I am giving this product five stars: Specifically, because  the bells and whistles were 'most everything a fan could want. The commentary track, for example, voices not only Lucas and Carrie Fisher, but special-effects luminaries Ben Burtt (sound) and Dennis Muren (visuals).

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1FXEHWJN2TU3M	Allen W. Nyhuis	I always go back and forth between the Star Wars movies.  They're good, well-made movies, but I don't want to labeled as a &quot;Star Wars Freakzogeek&quot; so I tend to keep my distance.  If someone asks if I like Star Wars, what I do is say, &quot;Those are good movies, but have you seen The Matrix?!?!&quot; because that's like the cool movie right now, I guess.  And the amazing thing is, they're both VERY similiar! (Think about it!)A New Hope was the first in the series (not really the FIRST, but let's not get that started), and it's a good movie.  I always feel sad when I see Mark Hamil.  I mean, here's a guy who never went beyond the Star Wars films and is probably out alone right now crying in a hotel room thinking about how big Harrison Ford got it and how low he sunk.  I think the last I heard he was doing a voice-over for some video game.  That's pretty bad.The Empire Strikes Back was the next movie made, and it's probably the deepest (which means most people don't like it that much; the hosers).  Yoda is in it, the creep.  Sad ending in this one, because Harrison Ford gets frozen.  Of course, if Mark Hamil got frozen the audience would've stood up and cheered, the poor sap.And now we come to Return of the Jedi, the last WELL-MADE Star Wars movie that's been released.  It basically three movies: you got the Jabba the Hut part where Carrie Fischer runs around half-naked; you got those horrible, little Ewok creatures that's a warning about how &quot;cute&quot; Episode One will be; and then you got the whole creepy Emperor, who's a real jerk and likes to zap people.  Darth Vader turns out to be a good guy (and NOT James Earle Jones; he's some bald, old, white guy!).The Phantom Menace is one of those Disney &quot;kids-are-smarter-than-adults&quot; films cleverly disguised as a Star Wars movie.  There are some pretty clever hair styles in here, so if you're a barber, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  It'll give you some creative ideas.If you're a Star Wars nutso, you can see those boring Ewok movies (Ewok Adventure, Battle for Endor, etc.).  They're kinda creepy, like the Ewoks themselves.  I never really liked them that much; those movies gave me nightmares when I was a young 'un.	5.0	Star Wars - Sraw Rats!	2001-11-04	4	2	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3A75R2S8CU9G9	Amazon Anonymous	"""Q: Why aren't Blu-ray Disc movies available in ""Full Screen"" format?A. ""Full Screen"" movies have been modified to make them fill the nearly square dimensions of a standard-definition TV screen. Blu-ray Disc movies are intended primarily for display on HDTV screens. Therefore, since all current HDTV screens are designed for the 16:9 theatrical aspect ratio, Blu-ray Disc movies are delivered in that aspect ratio. In essence, 16:9 is the ""full-screen"" format for HDTV screens, so 4:3 ""pan & scan"" versions are unnecessary. However, since many films are originally shot in aspect ratios wider than 16:9, you may still observe black bars at the top and bottom of the screen when viewing certain movies.""The listing of the Full screen Aspect ratio has to be a mistake.  I have never seen a Bluray movie that was full screen.  It would kind of defeat the whole purpose of Bluray, would it not?  I don't think the Bluray spec even allows for the full screen aspect ratio.  Its seems amazon has pulled the aspect ratio, I no longer see it listed.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A21SCKAVRX4GTE	Amazon Customer	Somehow between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Mr. George Lucas began his inevitable progression towards the Dark Side of moviemaking. His Prequels are downright awful, and most of the changes he made to the original trilogy helped ruin the magic of those wonderful films. What has happened to you, Mr. Lucas? Why don't you care that most of your fans want to see the original trilogy in its original form on DVD? Just restoring the picture and sound would be enough to make us want to buy it. Why bother with making even more changes than the previous &quot;Special Edition&quot;? Especially when most of the changes are either stupid (Greedo shooting first) or make significant changes to situations/characters(like Han bullying Jabba around) in the original versions of the films.I can see why Lucas identifies so much with Anakin in the entire saga. Like Anakin, Lucas has gone through his own conversion process over the years, proceeding from the &quot;good&quot; side of the Force to the &quot;dark&quot; side. He simply couldn't care less about what his customers--the fans--think. Which is the ultimate tragedy, really.	1.0	Darth Lucas	2004-08-01	22	13	9

Once again in a Jar Jar Binks effort he has changed lines, watered down the true ""dark"" feel of the originals, and has tried to make Han Solo look pure ""vanilla"".  How could he have changed the bar scene by not having Solo show his true aggression by striking first?  My suggestion is that you try and get the originals on Laser Disc on E-Bay.  Mr. Lucas has completely written off the very individuals like myself who got this whole ship off the ground back in 1977.  Without us ther wouldn't have been a phenomenon.  Oh by the way I have heard that in the new release Darth Vader only appears for two minutes at the end of the film.  Can you believe it?

These are the restored, updated, and upgraded director's cut special editions lovingly and meticulously improved in every way from what was released in theaters 36 years ago.Just look at all the documentary footage for the Special Edition releases and tell me if these versions aren't an improvement in all aspects of the film. There are no original versions of the film anymore. As was pointed out in those documentaries, the original films all had different little bits and pieces. There was no consistency. Everyone saw a slightly altered version of the film whether it was music, sound or visuals.These new cuts were the first time that every different version of the film was finally incorporated into a single print. The original film is still in there plus so much more additional improvements were added.This is the definitive version of the Star Wars saga. I don't believe that the majority of fans would want to see the old unaltered versions. There is no money to be made by catering to a small but vocal group of nagging spoiled brats who think that George Lucas ruined their childhood memories. Seriously?Yes, these are the same films that are already available on both Blu-ray and DVD separately, but this is the first time that both formats are included in one package. If you haven't seen or own these films yet and you have children, this is the best option and the best version.If you want to see the original unimproved basic raw versions, pull out your VHS tapes and laser discs, which I still own too.

I have to say, though the DVD Widescreen version of the Star Wars Trilogy far exceeded my expectations and is one of the best purchases I've ever made with regards to DVDs. The image quality is absolutely excellent and if I can remember right, even better than the movie release. Sound is great in that I thought the VHS version sounded muffled. In the DVD version, you can hear what everyone is saying although there are maybe a couple of spots where there's a blip in the dialogue but nothing too noticable. I did not mind the additions/changes to the DVD with the exception of the very last scene in ""Jedi"" when they substituted Hayden Christensen for the actor who played Luke's father. This is the only addition that I didn't care for since the face of Anakin had already been revealed earlier during the death scene of Anakin Skywalker so Lucas should have been consistent and just kept the original scene with the same actor. Unless you saw the newer Star Wars movies and knew that Hayden Christensen plays the young Anakin, the last scene with HC in the scene doesn't make much sense because you wouldn't know who he was. Also, why does Anakin get to be young but Ben is still old? (unless that is explained somewhere in the new Star Wars movies?) Anyway, this was the only change I objected to. The rest was fine.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ARPNJFA3F2QCA	Amazon Customer	"This is it!  The greatest trilogy in movie history has finally made it to dvd.  Now, I was a little dissapointed that Lucas decided to release the Special Editions as opposed to the original versions but c'mon, stop your crying and take a look at these!First of all, the picture and sound is better than it's ever been before.  No longer is there a slight haze to the picture as everything looks clear and bright.  The sound has been touched up and Lucas even edited a few scenes to make them better soundwise.For example, there is the scene when Luke & Leia get seperated from Han & Chewie on the Death Star (In Episode 4: A New Hope)and are shooting it out with Stormtroopers across the broken bridge.  In the older versions of the film whenever Leia shot her blaster it sounded like she was firing a Magnum!  In this DVD version Lucas fixed that problem and now it sounds like she's firing a blaster just like everyone else.Also, the picture is so good now that I noticed something that Lucas didn't fix.  As Han & Luke are shooting at the TIE Fighters after they escape the Death Star in A New Hope, when you see the shots of the TIE Fighters flying by the Falcon you can see translucent ""boxes"" around the TIES!Besides the better picture and quality Lucas did go back and add some more scenes and also retouched many of the scenes that he added in the Special Edition movies.  Jabba looks awesome in the scene between him and Han in A New Hope.  He's about as life like as I have seen any CGI character and I am glad Lucas retouched that scene.  Also, the scene between Han and Greedo has been redone and while Greedo still does shoot first, it's almost at the exact same time as Han and is much better now.  Another scene that was touched up was Lukes fight with the Rancor in Return of the Jedi.  I HATED the Special Edition version of this because the new Rancor shots looks 2D and had just looked completely fake!  Lucas fixed this problem and not only do the Rancor shots show un in 3D but it the new shots also look really good.Throughout these films hardcore fans will notice a lot of new insert shots.  They are quick but make the movie fresh in a whole new way for all of us who have seen this film over and over again.There are also new scenes in this film that have a lot of people complaining.  My comment:  please shut up!  If you give these scenes a chance you will see that they work better!  For example when Vader talks to Emperor Palpatine over the holonet in The Empire Strikes Back they now have the actor who played him in Episodes I, II, III, and VI.  Not only does this add continuity to the films but it also has some new dialog between Vader and Palpatine that connects to the prequels and raises some interesting questions for episode III.The other scene that has people crying is the celebration scene at the end of Return of the Jedi.  We now see Hayden Christenson as Anakin's Ghost and a quick shot of Naboo celebrating.  I love this ending so much better now.  It makes a hell of a lot more sense to see the young Anakin in the Jedi Knight robe than the older one who cast down the Jedi Knight robe and was a Sith up intil the last 10 minutes of his life.  Also the young Anakin fades into this scene as if he's just arrived.  It makes the scene work and I like it a lot.Besides the films themselves there are a bunch of special features.  The commentary tracks are sure to keep you busy as well as the trailers (the trailers for these films are so bad that if those were the only things that I had as for what the films were about I would have never went to see them!  They're a lot of fun to watch), featurettes and the 2 1/2 hour documentary Empire of Dreams that covers a lot of ground on the Star Wars saga.Besides those things there is also a preview for the new video game Star Wars: Battlefront.  Also, if you have an X-Box you are in luck because if you put this disc in your X-Box you can play a playable demo of Battlefront!  Awesome!I like this set so much better than the Special Editions released in the 1990's.  Star Wars purists will probably hate this release.  If you hated the Special Editions though I still urge you to give this version of the films a chance.  I am a huge Star Wars fan as I have seen the orginials and the Special Editions as well as read many of the books about the extended Star Wars Universe.  I hope that you will give these films a chance.Also, there is a chance that Lucas will wise up and release the originals down the road.  In a recent interview fans asked some of the Star Wars staff if there is a possibility that there will be future releases of the Star Wars trilogy on DVD and they said almost certainly.  Star Wars purists will have to wait until then but to everyone else: Your Holy Grail has arrived!"	5.0	At last we have the Holy Grail of DVDs within our grasp!	2004-09-24	47	32	15
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1MCQLJGZ2ODCK	Amazon Customer	This is a great set, It comes with 6 discs which have the original movies and redone version of the movies. The digital remakes are good quality picture. The original films show in a very small window on the TV and are grainy and not that great of quality, but it is the original version - what do you expect from the late 70s and early 80s. Either way it is a nice set because they include the original movies.I am not holding out for any blu ray version... how much better can they get the quality from movies that were filmed 30 years ago. The digital remasters are good enough for me in that case, they look decent on the TV and I don't really need to see Luke Skywalker's arm hair (that's a blu ray joke). Anyway, This set is well worth the price if you are a Star Wars fan. They come in thin dvd cases so the whole set does not take up that much room.	5.0	Still cool after 30 years!	2010-08-10	4	3	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1D676Z8ZD6BEV	Amazon Customer	(UPDATE of May 30, 2013: I updated this review to correct an error or two and to further emphasize some of my thoughts. Original review was April 10, 2012.)Although I was not a fan of this saga in the beginning - and it's still not in my top ten - I have these episodes in my VHS collection so I thought I knew the story, although I obviously haven't watched them in a while. After I got through *this* series (on Blu-ray), I seemed to be a bit disoriented and - yes - disappointed. To paraphrase a GWB Secretary of Defense, there were things I knew I knew, things I thought I knew, things I didn't know I knew, things I knew I didn't know, and things I absolutely didn't know. It made me appreciate the *Star Trek* series even more than I already did. Then again, maybe all the progress in video production and display, e.g., Blu-ray, flat-screen TV's, etc., has magnified the pimples and pockmarks of past portrayals.Just a few things I remembered differently, perhaps incorrectly due to the passage of time: the portrayal of the time Luke Skywalker spent with his aunt and uncle (didn't remember it like this); the light saber duel between Luke and Darth Vader (it seemed strange); Luke's introduction to Yoda; the bar scene with all the alien creatures (not as fascinating).I could be wrong; my mind may have meshed and melded these scenes with those from other episodes. However, I cannot escape from the idea that I may have been hoodwinked and lured (perhaps not by Amazon, but by 20th Century Fox or Lucasfilm or George Lucas himself) into a purchase of something that is, like many purported antiques found to be fakes, an unreasonable facsimile of the original.On the other hand, I enjoyed getting reacquainted with all the fascinating, unique, timeless, and humorous characters, including R2-D2, C-3PO, Chewbacca, Yoda, the Ewoks, and Darth Vader (you've got to admit that sometimes you laughed at some of the things Vader said and did).All in all this trilogy is a less-than-satisfying regurgitation of a self-proclaimed classic. It made the recent Star Trek prequel all the more satisfying to me, as well as my recent TV series acquisitions, Battlestar Galactica, and Firefly.Although I had not seen even one episode until I purchased it recently, Battlestar Galactica has become one of my favorite TV series (alongside Stargate SG-1). Even so, like Stargate, it got a bit convoluted and plodding in its later episodes. Paraphrasing a now-deceased friend of mine, they finished those series a long time before they quit.Firefly has also earned a spot in my list of favorites. Though a bit off-beat and short (having been abruptly and inexplicably terminated by its parent company, to the utter consternation of its fans), it has a captivating premise and intriguing character development, and the roles couldn't have been cast better.Check these series out, especially if, like me, you were disillusioned by Star Wars Episodes IV-VI.	3.0	Not how I remembered it.	2012-04-10	4	3	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1RHI7QGEZ2Y0J	Amazon Customer	"Well, the long anticipated DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy has arrived. George has altered the films more than he already did with the Special Edition, but the changes aren't so bad.For starters, the now infamous Cantina scene with Greedo and Han has been changed again. Now, rather than Greedo shooting first (as it was in the Special Edition), or Han shooting first (as it was in the original), they fire at the same time.Also, the fugly emperor in Empire Strikes Back was replaced with Ian MacDirmid, who played Palpatine in RotJ and the Prequals. Some unnecessary dialog has been added, and lessens a little of the suprise with Vader's Revelation in ESB, but otherwise, the addition isn't quite so bad. Boba Fett's dialogue has been re-recorded,, but it's barely noticible.In RotJ, the changes are once again negligible. The actor who played Anakin at the end of ROTJ is replaced with Heydin Christiansen. Otherwise, I didn't notice any changes.The fourth DVD contains a feature documentary about the making of the Star Wars Trilogy - no, not a Featurette, like you're used to, but a full feature that's about the length of a film. The documentary ""The Empire of Dreams"" plots out the full story of the making of the Star Wars films. The documentary is very insightful and entertaning, as are the other feature documentaries on the DVD.In conclusion, I firmly reccomend a purchase of these DVDs.

I must say, TESB is my favorite, but I love them all.These CD's have positives and negatives.  It would be nice if us, the paying public could, if we so chose, get the ORIGINALS ... I am sure there are lots of use out here who would pay an additional 10 bucks, just to have a copy of the film that we saw when we were younger.  IF for no other reason, to be able to see it in its original setting/score.However, my tapes were getting crappy, and I have rebought them from time to time since everyone in my family watches them fairly reguarly.  SO, having a copy on CD is nice.  And there are aspects of the new version that are pretty good:  For one, I can't remember seeing the film looks so shiny.  Some of the scenes do get enhances with more spaceships flying around... and it is nice to see the detail that even good VHS would not show.All in all, it is a very nice package, and I will mention that the DOCUMENTARY is one of the best I have ever seen, as far as interviews and behind the scenes.  Very good indeed.  I only subtact ONE star due to the fact that the people should be able to have a copy of the original, but I am really only quibbling at this point and five stars it should really get.

Where would it end?  Why not cut out the muppet Yoda completely and add in the CGI Yoda instead?  Why not rerecord all of Obi-Wans scenes with Ewan McGregor?  George Lucas should release  either the original movies (not special editions) on DVD or just the special editions on DVD without the redubs and add-ins.

So, you can't even enjoy the fact that the Rebels defeated the Empire.  I always just turn it off after Darth Vader dies, and cry myself to sleep.  They changed the music too.

The packaging is well done (and matches the Episode I packaging) and the overall film quality is quite good.  Each film has been re-mastered and these are the &quot;Special Edition&quot; releases that were brought back to the theaters in 1997 with the added scenes and CGI.  I also like the fact that Episode IV's (a new hope) packaging describes the fact that this episode takes place 30 years after the Phantom Menace...nice touch.  What was cool was that you got a brief sneak peek at Ep II (which has since been released) at the beginning of a New Hope.Out of all the films, I'd say Episode VI-Return of the Jedi is the weakest.  This is a must-have until the original trilogy is re-released on DVD (which George Lucas has been heard saying won't happen until AFTER Episode III is released...and that will be at LEAST 4-5 years since filming won't even start until June 2003!).	4.0	Belongs in everyone's movie collection	2002-06-04	0	0	0

That being said, I do spend some of my money on movies that I have as favorites.

I can tolerate *some* of the changes that George made to the films to punch up a few things that just weren't up to snuff in the late 70s and early 80s, but other things I don't like.  These are films I like to watch at least 2 or three times a year so I want to make sure I enjoy them as they are presented.  I rented the new Blu-Ray versions from the video store prior to purchase.All I can say . . what a disappointment.George Lucas has taken the original trilogy and pumped up the color saturation to the point where they are bright, glowing cartoon versions of their original negatives IN SOME SCENES.

My DVD collection is finally complete.  The films have never looked or sounded better.  I've seen all of these films multiple times, and I'm seeing details that I've never seen before.About the changes:  Big deal!  Be honest, does not seeing cheesy footage of a landspeeder or a dog-fight (having been replaced digitally) really ruin your precious childhood memory?  Does seeing Greedo shoot first really spoil the entire experience for you?  I was 11 years old when I saw the original ""Star Wars"" in the theatre.  It remains, to this day, the greatest time I have ever had (or will ever have) at the movies.  No motion picture experience will ever top the thrill of seeing the original ""Star Wars"" for the first time.  Does seeing an ""altered version"" in any way diminish that precious childhood memory? Not in the least bit, because 95% percent of it is exactly the same movie, and the changes that are there are actually improvements.  This IS the Star Wars I grew up with.So, to all those naysayers out there, the ones who've given this trilogy 1 star, the ones who say they won't be buying it, the ones who are still complaining about Jar Jar Binks (5 years after the fact), why did you show up at the video store at 10 am sharp on Tuesday morning (or worse yet, at 1201 am on Monday night)?

It is actually very easy and takes no time (you just have to show all the 1 star reviews, then 2 star, etc.). Anyway, here's the breakdown:1 star reviews: 183, 2 star reviews: 36, 3 star reviews: 67, 4 star reviews: 78, 5 star reviews: 498. Total number: 862.Calculation: (1*183)+(2*36)+(3*67)+(4*78)+(5*498)=3258.3258/862 = 3.779582366...I'm giving it one star because I too would like the option of having the original and the &quot;special editions&quot; in one set. After this review the average would be:3259/863 = 3.7763615295...So, 4 out of 5 is just about right, Skullchrist; no rating manipulations.	1.0	Rating manipulation -- avg = 3.776	2004-08-05	16	9	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A30I914E6123	"anakinjmt ""huge gamer"""	This trilogy is, by far, one of the most popular and influential trilogies of all movie history. A New Hope especially pushed the envelope. So many things were created out of A New Hope that now are a standard in Hollywood. Industrial Light and Magic, a small company George Lucas, creator of Star Wars and director of 4 of the films, created to make some special effects never done before. Now, ILM is the special effects company for most movies requiring extensive special effects. But the special effects is only a small part of it. Also, aliens in movies now tend not to look so humanoid. Star Wars changed that. Add to that the incredible music done by John Williams, and the intense story and great character development, and what's not to like? This trilogy is one of the great trilogies of Hollywood, right up there with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Matrix trilogy and the Back to the Future trilogy. And, probably the most amazing thing about these movies, is these movies are still watched and hailed by millions all over the planet. How many other movies made in the 70s are still watched with great entusiasm today? How many other early to mid 80s movies are watched with vibrant excitement? Answer: very few. These movies, though, were made in those times, and are still thoroughly enjoyed in every way. Oh, and to all those that want to watch I, II, and III before seeing IV, V, and VI: I highly recommend seeing IV, V, and VI before seeing I, II, and III. Jokes in the prequels will refer to things in the original trilogy, and lots of connections will appear in the prequels helping you understand the first three movies. And, the big surprise at the end of V won't surprise you if you've seen the prequels first. Trust me folks; these movies will be enjoyed for many, many years to come.	5.0	One of the best movie trilogies ever	2004-09-14	18	8	10

I only suggest this make because I already know it works, and while I'm sure that most Panasonic, Pioneer, JVC, etc brands will work just as well, my experience is with Sony, so that's my recommendation.Obviously the more expensive the video capture card, and the more powerful the computer then the better the quality of your creation, and obviously you'll need a decent VCR (preferably one that can output component video and dolby 5.1 audio) in order to get the highest quality playback for the capturing process.So okay, this will set you back between $100 - $1000 depending on what you already own, but if you can't just press forward to get past the scenes you don't want to see then I suppose it'll be worth it to you.So there you go - if they don't have the original versions of these movies on the DVDs, then why not make your own.  You do have the right to make a backup of your original tapes, and as long as you're not circumventing any form of copy protection, this is perfectly legal under your DMCA fair use rights.	1.0	An Alternative...	2004-09-07	18	8	10

I detected no unecessary darkness or brightness.  The sound was also noticeably improved with most dialog being exceptionally crisp.  I would have liked to have had an isolated music track, though, although I suppose I can always just buy the soundtracks.Most annoying was probably the length of animation in the menus before it lets you do anything.  Luckily, you can hit the Chapter Forward button on your remote to skip most of these sequences...a bit of an oddity as most DVDs won't let you do that.  After watching the bonus disc and then Episode IV, I was already tired of the menus and ready to be able to just pop in a disc and watch the movies without a lot of thumb twiddling.The inclusion of so many TV spots and trailers was welcome...I LOVE trailers.  I could have done without the video game content...better in my mind to have included a disc of related spin-off material.  A couple of the better DROIDS cartoon episodes...or an Ewoks TV movie or two (hehe)?  Or actually, any of the specials that ran on TV shortly after Episode IV was released!  Entertainment Tonight spots.  MTV News.  There are dozens of historically interesting clips that fans might like to have had.  Toy commercials could have been a neat addition as well (surprised that there was no stand-alone documentary on the licensed toy phenomenon that Star Wars helped launch).As far as the movies go, they were transferred well, look and sound great, and one can see how well this first trilogy dovetails with the second.  But if you expect gobs and gobs of bonus features, they aren't here.Assuming that there will at some point be a ""complete"" boxed set of all 6 movies, this set is a very good ""meantime"" collection to satisfy Star Wars fans until that happens."	4.0	Satisfies until the next boxed set arrives	2004-09-28	2	1	1

However, it works very well so I'm going to stick with it.  Anyway, this review is not going to be like most of the reviews that I do in the sense that I'm not going to focus on reviewing the films themselves (I think that you can find my reviews on the individual films, but I'm not sure).  I'm going to focus on the release itself and the technical aspects and the extras.""This will be a day long remembered."" -Darth VaderSo we finally have the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD.  This is something that people have been waiting for ever since the DVD format was introduced, and now that we have it, is it worth it?  Do you even need to ask?!  These movies have the distinction of being a cultural phenomenon, something that few films ever achieve.  At most, there is one film/set of films per generation that achieves this level of popularity (Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is currently the best contendor for our generation's phenomenon).  They were a smash hit back in 1977, 1981, and 1983 (I think those dates are correct), and they were also technological marvels.  The stories have withstood the test of time like few movies can, and while the special effects are beyond outdated (watch these films after watching one of the new ones), it does not matter at all, because even though the effects are important in this movie, we will always love them no matter how outdated they look.  Speaking of the new trilogy, I must say that while I really liked Attack of the Clones (and can't wait for Revenge of the Sith), and marginally enjoyed Phantom Menace, these movies are far superior despite the advances in technology that abound in the prequel trilogy.  Also, I look at these movies differently now that the prequels are out.  Before, when I'd watch these, I knew that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammil), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) were the main characters and Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) was the villain.  Now, I see Vader as the main character (despite being the antagonist) and the rebels, while they are important characters, are not the focus of the film.  The two trilogies are best put as the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd/Hayden Chritenson/David Prowse/James Earl Jones/Sebastian Shaw).""You've never heard of the Millenium Falcon?"" -Han SoloFor the two of you who don't know the story of the trilogy (you must be living under a rock on Mars or something), basically, there is a Galactic Empire that is extremely oppressive and is run by two dark Jedi, or Sith.  There is also a Rebel Alliance, who's purpose is to overthrow the Empire and return the galaxy to a state of peace and democracy.  They are soon joined by Luke Skywalker, a farmboy who has the potential to become a Jedi, and Han Solo, a scoundrel and an amazing pilot who has a price on his head due to a botched smuggling operation.""I can change him back."" -Luke SkywalkerAs for the extras, we get great trailers and teasers all the way back from 1977!  There are multiple featurettes and documentaries, including one about the upcoming Episode III, as well as Empire of Dreams, which is apparently the most comprehensive Star Wars documentary ever made.  I have not yet watched the whole thing, but I've really liked what I've seen.  As for the changes, some of them are good, some are not.  I am going to say this right now: THESE ARE GEORGE LUCAS' MOVIES, AND HE CAN CHANGE THEM IF HE WANTS TO!  Having said that, there are some things that I don't like.  The added some stuff for humor, but it really fell flat most of the time (like when Luke, Obi-Wan (Alec Guiness), C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) go to Mos Eisly in A New Hope).  Also, I understand why George Lucas changed the Han/Greedo scene.  He wanted Solo to be a reformed scoundrel, not reformed murderer, so that's why Han no longer shoots first.  However, Han's dodge looks so awful, I wish it had been left as it was.  Other non-storyline changes mostly involve music in Return of the Jedi, which, while I like the old music, it does not take away from the story.  My favorite change would be the addition of Ian McDiarmod as the Emporor in Empire Strikes Back.  McDiarmod was always in RotJ, PM, and AotC, so it fit for continuity, and the original emporor in ESB was just bad.  They also overdubbed Boba Fett's lines with Temuera Morrison, who played Jango Fett in AotC.  The story is that Boba is a clone of Jango, so it makes sense for continuity.  Even though I am in favor of this for continuity reasons, I think that Jeremy Bulloch, the original Boba Fett, sounded more menacing.  The other continuity change is that, instead of Sebastian Shaw playing Anakin's ghost, now we have Hayden Chritenson.  I also liked this solely for continuity reasons.  All other changes from the special edition are still here.""She was very beautiful."" -Leia OrganaI am now referring to the picture and sound.  Star Wars has never looked or sounded better (with maybe a few exceptions here and there).  THX did a great job cleaning everything up.  There were a few places that could have been better, but the film is very old and worn, so it doesn't get much better than this.""The force will be with you.  Always."" -Obi-Wan KenobiIn conclusion, this DVD set is definitely a welcome addition to anyone's collection, whether they are a die-hard fan or someone watching the films for the first time."	5.0	The Force Is Strong With This One	2004-10-27	13	8	5

Now, instead of bringing back that awesomeness we get to see a wierd CGI alien lady sing and dance awkwardly in Jabba the Hut's palace.  Because that's what I want to spend $50 dollars on.  Wait. No I don't.  I read a review once that I'm starting to believe more and more these days.  It said that Star Wars was great in spite of Lucas, not because of him.  The reason the movies don't get better as your go IV, V, VI, I, II, III instead they get worse, is because after the initial sucess of the first movie or two, the studios have gave George so much 'artistic license' that he was free to make crappier and wierder movies every time.

Well it was filmed in 35mm and digitally transferred for digital projection for DLP when released in 1999.Only Star Wars episode 2 and 3 was filmed in digital HD.Also the original I think the original episode 4 should be released in Dolby Stereo 6channel with mono surrounds as that is how it went out for 70mm road show release! Also the 35mm Dolby stereo release and mono release as each version had different sound mixes crated for each release in the cinema as some cinemas didn't have Dolby installed and was only running mono so three mixes was created for 1977.Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, should each be released as Dolby Stereo 6channel with mono surrounds.The original three wasn't mixed with stereo surrounds very few 70mm Dolby stereo release prints ever had stereo surrounds only a few handful was ever produced from 1978 to late near to 2000 when regular 70mm retired from cinema.Its no good fooling me or the rest of the smart fans, Lucas we or most of us know what to look for and listen for so the game is up! If you in anyway manipulate the originals you will loss big time the fans and the respect!If I find anything not original and I don't want Dolby Stereo 4.2.4 matrix ones like that DVD edition scam of few years ago, that was uncalled for and you know!I don't want to listen to any sly new sound effects slipped into the original Dolby film mix!Also if ever released dtsHD Master Audio, I will not even bother touching it!The sound of STAR WARS was born with DOLBY STEREO not dtsHD Master Audio! Use Dolby's own Dolby TrueHD its good format and if it wasn't for DOLBY which is half the sound experience then STAR WARS might have only done modest box-office?Remember the original fans will be looking and listening for any sly scam tricks!I think there should be isolated John Williams score in Dolby TrueHD6channel on all versions original theatrical release and do what the hell you want with the GCI versions I don't care to watch them that much.Audio commentariesExtras taken from the CAV THX laserdisc box set and many more extra like still pictures in fact the whole library!!!	2.0	The sound of STAR WARS was born with Dolby	2011-01-10	8	7	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2E2R8N7UMTLJF	Andy Wilson	STAR WARS in general is a great story. On the other hand there are only 3 good Star Wars movies [so far I haven't seen Episode III yet]. I was dissapointed at Episodes I and II cause there are movies but they are not cause I'd say 80 percent movie is computer animated or CGI.  The Original Trilogy is timeless classics, in other words they don't make movies like that anymore. I don't mind the VHS but I wish they would release these and the original version on DVD cause VHS is a old format[but yet it is a classic format] and STAR WARS trilogy is a DVD worthy movie.	5.0	The Only 3 Good Movies Out Of The Star Wars Saga	2003-03-08	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1NE04R5NPMIAS	"A. Neira ""Wildcat28UA"""	I for one enjoy the changes. I love Episodes 1 and 2 and making the connections to the last three episodes is awesome. Remember the last three episodes weren't actually finished in 1983 (when ROTJ came out). George never intended for the movies to look that way. Sure nothing was wrong in them except for the, what we call now even though it was not back then, poor graphics. Remember Hayden is not only the Anakin from episode 2 he is now the Anakin. Yeah sure I understand that some people take offence to the changes who grew up watching the last three episodes as kids. I would really hate it if someone changed LOTR by having a different actor play Frodo or something, but it makes sense for Episodes 4 through 6. I like the final scene change with Hayden as Anakin. It reminds you of how he used to look like when he was good before he turned to evil. And Ian (the emperor) did play in ROTJ so it makes sense for him to overtake that puppet in ESB. I dont believe that the voice was changed though. In the ending credits it still had that actor's name (not Ian) as the voice of the Emperor. If people do not like these versions then well that is too bad. You would not have complained if these are the versions you first saw (I have seen the originals) back in 1977. See these are the versions of the movies that were in George's mind back in 1974 (or maybe before that) when he started on this saga (minus Anakin at the end though and Boba's voice). It would have been better if Padme Amidala was put in to persuade Luke that there is still some good in Anakin and then persuading Anakin to help Luke when he was getting ... well electricuted ... at the end. Then it would have made more sense when Hayden turned up in the end probably with Padme in his arms. But unfortunatly there was no way to do that and it would have looked too awkward if attempted. Get serious though ... these are George's movies ... what he did was not a crime and people should take the prequels into consideration and be open minded that the 1980 films were not the ones supposed to be shown. Maybe he should have waited until the first three were completed to release the final three, but he did change movies forever, you cant forget that. All I have left to say is too bad we will not see Ep. 7 through 9 ... that would have been something eh? Oh well. Just wait until Ep. 3 ... I think it might just change people's mind. Or I can at least hope.	5.0	A true masterpiece	2004-09-27	13	5	8
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1Q5MFD1F5E0Y4	angel1801	I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars movies since 1980 when I collected the ESB trading cards when ESB came out. I have also watched the two prequels on DVD as well. I have longed for the original three movies to come out on DVD. So they finally did. I brought my copy of it from a retail (not amazon.com) store on its first day relase. I last watched ANH, ESB and ROTJ on cable TV back in May 2001. I did notice the additional scenes and re-edits since I last watched them, but they did not reduce the joy of watching them one bit at all! I know some do not like the additional scenes and re-edits, and I can understand that, but remember almost all of the movie run time (about 387 minutes) is still from the originals. So you are still getting (IMHO) the feel and spirit of the movies as they were originally made. And thank George Lucas for at least offering us this box set. Who knows, he may finally relase the 1997 versions or the 1977-1983 versions some day, so be patient!	5.0	Star Wars DVD Boxed Set	2004-11-11	11	5	6

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A36CV4TMBGEKA9	Angel L. Reyes	"First, to the reviewer below me....if you think ""Star Wars"" is a war-promoting film, than you better get your senses straight. ""Star Wars"" was not meant to depict war as realistically as ""Saving Private Ryan"" did. It's a pure fantasy-driven film, nothing more. Plus, with scenes like Luke nearly dying in the Hoth battlefield, I don't think it portrays war in a bright picture either.As for the DVDs: well, what's already been said here that isn't true? Lucas just had to tamper with the original trilogy so that he could tie in the elements from the vastly inferior prequels (um, shouldn't he have done the reverse when he was making the prequels?!). No matter what anyone says, these changes ARE distracting and take away from the story.I'm very disapointed with the Amazon reviewer (and to anyone who defends the dvd set)who said the changes were ""minor"" and for fans of the originals to just get over it. What frightens me most about the release is how Lucas is so adament in burying the original films from existance. This is more than just debating on whether Greedo shot first; this is Lucas rewriting history, butchering the content either to fulfill an ego or profit. Erasing Sebastian Shaw's image at the end of ROtJ with Hayden Christenson is akin to the way Russian communists erased political enemies from photographs: ""Oh him? He never existed.""I agree with everyone else that Lucas can do what he wants with the original trilogy, as long as consumers can have access to the original films just as they were. Frustratingly, Lucas won't even give us that option. Thumbs down on this release."	1.0	Butchered Classics	2004-09-25	40	33	7

After seeing the quality of these movies at a friend's I went out and bought them. I am a huge Empire Strikes Back fan and the price is worth it just for this movie. Lucas did an incredible job restoring ESB and ROTJ (but not Star Wars) to the point where it looks like these two films were shot yesterday. There is a HUGE difference in sound/picture quality between VHS and DVD, I felt like I was 6 years old again watching Empire for the first time. I'm actually happy with the changes as it will make older trilogy fit in better with the new trilogy. I give Lucas two thumbs up for the amount of work he put into improving these movies.

This is not on DVD. The Star Wars Trilogy Limited Edition has an audio dialogue with Lucas and the stars of the movie among other crew members that plays with the movie. However, there is no video footage in the release.I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE the Star Wars movies on Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes Store. Apple which recently changed its name to Apple Inc., the maker of Macintosh computer operating systems, iPods and now Apple TV -- formerly the iTV device runs a great music and video download store.Packaged media formats like VHS, DVD and upcoming BluRay Disc and HD DVDs with higher capacity storage for recording and playback of better quality high definition video (hi-def video) are great and all but the future also holds video on demand services and iTunes is the leader.I would love to play the Star Wars movies on my iPod or TV using Apple TV.

George Lucas didn't have the money or technology for flashy special effects, so he relied on a solid story, and (for the most part) good acting.  That is why his movies are as popular as they are.  It is not because of special effects, and there is just no need to put in new scenes.  Even if they weren't that good, it would be understandable if Lucas wanted to put in scenes he had to leave out in '77.  But these are new and unneeded additions.  My personal opinion is ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""I wouldn't even care about this release either, if Lucas was offering the originals as well.  But since he decided to pursue this holy quest for the ""perfect"" Star Wars, I have decided not to buy this dvd set, and to let my friends and family know not to buy it."	1.0	George Lucas is psychotic	2004-09-15	37	23	14

They are the pillars of sci/fi flicks, the ""holy trilogy"" as Kevin Smith calls them.  They are three of the finest flicks ever to be made.  However... I here that now you're only going to be able to get them on DVD with the special edition crap that George Lucus added in.  I pray this isn't true because the fact is that the added scenes ruin the films completely...  Maybe they are being true to Lucus's vision or whatever... but what gives him the right to go back and change his films?  At the time he made them I honestly doubt the studio would have given him full control to add in all these things... perhaps he didn't have the technology or he would have added them in... BUT... that's a good thing.  Did you know that in Jaws the shark was supposed to appear throughout the whole movie... only because of technological setbacks did they make the film so we only see the shark in the final battle... If Steve went back and added a computer animated Jaws into every seen (like lucus has done with all his new computer additions) then the movie would be horrible... it would lose everything that made it great.  The special effects in the original star wars are great... they might not look completely real... but since they're all congruent we don't notice... we get lost in the film.  With special editions we get cool model footage mixed with fake-looking computer animation.... CGI looks fake!!! No matter what it always will.. the old school effects looked real... why ruin them?  The whole idea offends me and if this is the only way we can see these flicks on DVD then I prolly won't even by them.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3VJEKFARKBO8K	Anonymous	"I have to tip my hat to Lucas' marketing savvy. While the ideal release of these films would have gone EVEN further than the Alien Quadrilogy, Lord Of The Rings Extended Editions, and the forthcoming 10-disc Matrix treasure chest, Lucas is going to toss this relative 4-disc pittance of a release...for the time being. Given the history of the original trilogy, the impact upon popular culture, the colossus of its fandom, all you're going to get is the jerked with (oops, ""enhanced"") editions of these beloved classics. Could he have packaged these with BOTH the original AND rejiggered versions? Of course he could have. Even Spielberg came to his senses and included both versions at the last minute (allegedly - I think it was a genius ploy all along) of ""E.T."". But not Lucas. What kind of idiot is he? You would think after the damage the saga has taken as a result of the horrific prequels, he might consider engendering some good will with the fans and give them an orgy of bonuses and goodies. Think again. What I suspect is going to happen is that this box set will go ahead as planned and be released as is. It will reap an enormous windfall for Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox video. But then, in a certain amount of time, probably already determined in the corporate headquarters, a new campaign will be launched: ""Due to overwhelming demand, the original trilogy will be released intact, complete with new commentaries and bonuses"". And the fans NO DOUBT will line up and buy them ALL OVER AGAIN. Genius. One would be a fool to think this plan of action has not been AT LEAST bandied about. Just don't be surprised when it all goes down... Oh, and let me not fail to mention the nascent technology in the next year or two: High Definition DVDs. Yup, after you've shelled out for however many incarnations Lucas decides to rob you blind for, you WILL buy them all up, all over again. You will line his pockets to make even more horrific films. Rumor has it Lucas IS going to make ""episodes"" 7, 8, and 9. After all he's done to sink the franchise, I hope he and his films end up in the wastebasket of spectacular failures that he's driven them to.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	Many Sci Fi buffs tend to treat the Star Wars trilogy like it was the second coming. It was a ground breaking effort on the part of George Lucas but not exactly a world shaking revolution.These films put to  death the theory that all science fiction films must be &quot;B&quot;  grade. They were big budget, hi tech, well directed films with some  excellent performances. Star Wars launched the successful careers of so  many people that they are impossible to list.The first film,  &quot;Star Wars&quot;, takes us through Luke Skywalker's discovery of his  destiny. He finds an old Jedi Knight, Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, who takes it on  himself to train Luke in the ways of the force. Unfortunately Ben and Luke  get drafted by Princess Leia in an attempt to save her and oppose the evil  emperor and his second in command, Lord Darth Vader.  They are aided by a  smuggler/pilot, Han Solo and his copilot Chewbacca in the fastest ship in  the cosmos, the Millennium Falcon. Some heavy duty action is had by all  when Leia is rescued, (losing Ben in the process) and the emperor's death  star is destroyed with only moments to spare before the rebel base was to  be obliterated.The second film, &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, disappointed me at the time because of its open ended finish. I  have since forgiven it for this.  As with the first film, the second  starts by skipping some of the intervening background material. So, we are  left to catch up to the plot by ourselves. We find Luke Han and Leia in a  new rebel base on a frozen planet. During an isolated scene where Luke is  captured by a snow beast we find that his Jedi powers have developed a  little more and that the friendship between he and Han has grown even  stronger. But not to the point where their rivalry over Leia has  abated.The empire locates the rebel base and they all have to turn  tail and run. Yes, we discover that the destruction of the death star at  the end of the last film was nowhere near the end of the empire. Everyone  bugs out in an orderly fashion except Luke who heads off to find a new  master, by following the instructions of the now spectral Obi-Wan. Han,  Chewy and Leia find that the Falcon is in need of repair and have to limp  to the nearest port of call.Luke finds the memorable Jedi Master  Yoda, and starts his training. Meanwhile the falcon's crew is in trouble  after Han's friend, Lando Calrissian, involuntarily betrays them to Darth  Vader, resulting in Han being frozen in carbonite. So it's Luke to the  rescue. The problem is that this was Darth's plan all along. Thus we get to  see Luke, fencing with Darth. Luke loses his hand but gains a Father. Both  against his will.The final film, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;,  was excellent, except for the ridiculously cutesy Ewoks.  We have to do  another leap forward to catch the plot which has moved to the point where  all of Han's friends are involved in an attempt at his rescue. Han has been  sold, as a wall decoration, to Jaba the Hut, a type of Mafia boss in the  shape of a giant, fat, salamanda. Luke arrives and impresses the hell out  of everyone with his new Jedi powers. With a little help he saves everyone  and the movie moves on.The empire is building another death star  and the rebels have a plan to destroy it. Of course Han, Luke, Leia, etc.  are all critical to the success of this plan. They must land on a tropical  moon to disable the force field that protects the half built deathstar. In  the process, Luke is voluntarily captured and tries to turn Darth, his  Father, away from evil. We get to see another great dual between the two of  them.  This time the emperor is on the side lines cheering them on whilst  trying to turn Luke to the dark side of the force. Luke is made of sterner  stuff than that though.Meanwhile the rest of the gang have run  into the improbable Ewoks. Fuzzy, teddy bear like people who seem unable to  walk without waddling. Strangely they turn out to be useful allies, in the  capacity of scouts, diversions and pesky warriors. The force field is  eventually brought down and the rebels attack only to find that the death  star is not nonfunctional after all. If it wasn't for Darth Vader turning  against the emperor at the last minute, in order to save Luke, all would  have been lost.Many people have been awaiting more movies in the  series. A number of good follow up books have been written, Timothy Zahn's  efforts are especially good. However, Lucus has decided to go back in time  and produce some prequels. We will see a young version of Obi-Wan as the  hero. It should be good.	5.0	Country boy makes good.	2000-05-22	4	4	0

So for movies that have taken 25 years to make (begun in 1976 and finished in 2004 - unless George Lucas is still ""not happy"" with the current results) these movies are quite average by 2004 standards.I suppose as computing power gets more powerful in the coming years George Lucas will replace the whole thing with flawless digital characters.  George Lucas has joined the Dark Side...more machine now than man.By the way,...when the Death Star blows up at the end of episode IV, all I can think of is the Klingon moon, Praxis, blowing up at the opening of Star Trek VI.

Updated my rating from 2 stars to 1 star due to the additional changes; in particular the yelling Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi...I couldn't stand a lot of the changes made to the original trilogy. But I think I can figure out why he doesn't heed the requests for the originals. The product he created from Return of the Jedi on is meant to appeal to children and hard core morons whose brains probably didn't develop much past childhood (and probably to make his wife happy or something stupid like that). He succeeded in attracting the audience he targeted. The people that fell in love with the originals are a demographic that he's determined will not make him as much money. A strategy to create a massive new fan base that will keep the dough flowing well into the future will fail though. The prequals lack the originality, substance and quality (due partially to the originals having actors that could actually act and dialogue that didn't suck) than the originals and will not have the same lasting effect. I've tried hard to like the changes made to the originals. Han Solo shooting first helps make his character more fascinating as he transitions from kind of a bad guy to a good guy. Now I think he's a giant d-bag.	1.0	Why Lucas gives a flying donkey about the originals	2011-08-04	17	12	5

I understand however, the valid argument from both sides regarding the 1997 digital [CGI] re-issues.  In most cases, such intrusions on the original work of any film would be unwelcome.

If you just enjoy watching Star Wars movies, then this is a good buy.  If you live the Star Wars movies, then goodbye.I watched the original Star Wars triology when I was young.  As a parent, I have enjoyed watching the newer series with my children.  Having just watched Revenge of the Sith my daughter, I wanted to get the triology to continue the story.  I'm glad I did.

However, some people are so fanatical about them that any slight additions or improvements to them is sacrilege.  Folks, this is the best scifi fantasy film of all time, but it's still just a movie.  The best thing about these movies is the improved picture and sound.  I tried viewing my old VHS tapes and they looked terrible after watching the rerelease back in 1997.  The new scenes  between all three movies probably clocks in at under thirty minutes so it's not really messing with the pacing and feel.

At anyrate the world of Star Wars that George Lucas created is in a class all its own. However it is his world, he didn't write it and create it and flim it for you or me, he did it for himself. If we all watch it and loved it great, if not so what, it was a story he wanted tell. I have seen so many interviews with the man where he says he was never truly happy with the way the original movies turned out. technology has advanced and now he can go back and do it his way.

I refuse to pick at each one for technical flaws, character/creature flaws(Ewoks seemed outta place--- too cute and fuzzy for some film goers and critics), story plot, what Lucas did or didn't do (if he altered them or not from the originals) or any kind of flaws that so many fans and non-fans alike have done. WHO CARES !!!... So many directors and film creators have revised or re-edited their own classics with newer technical effects or director's cut versions, deleted scenes, etc. and have really botched the job or decision making and end product that really stick out like a sore thumb! I have seen all the different versions of these releases of Star Wars Trilogy over the years (from original to re-released to re-whatever). They too are spectacular in their own unique versions. Do I wish that Lucas had given us the option to have released these dvds with their original-original theatrical releases. You bet! (but then it probably would have rendered this new trilogy package at a costlier or premium price range)! Also, the bottom line is that these are Lucas' own master creations and films and he can do whatever he well pleases (and he has)---much to the chagrin of some viewers and critics. The end is that he has not done something that is so blasphemous (like Ted Turner colorizing old classic films----that WEREN'T EVEN HIS)...As for the technical aspects of this dvd trilogy release, not enough or maybe too much has already been said about the praise as far as the overall picture quality and THX surround factors go. Seeing these films on dvd in my lifetime for the first time is a technical video marvel to enjoy and not chastise George Lucas or his ILM company. My copies don't have any of the flaws like ""drastic color changes"" within a scene, or a disc freezing up or skipping, etc. I'm sure there are an x amount of copies around with these flaws as stated by some owners (no dvd release on the manufacturing end is completely perfect)!Just kick back and ENJOY this latest release on the DVD format !"	5.0	Stop Yer Whinin'	2004-09-23	14	6	8

Your ""beloved"" originals and your ""hated"" re-release are still the same bleeping movie and there is no reason to hate it just because it isn't a carbon copy of what you remember from your childhood.In other words: GET OVER IT.

Stop whining, and if you can't stop, then go watch your originals on VHS and leave the rest of us TRUE fans, the ones that love the movies for what they ARE, alone.

The problem is, the new blu-ray release of Star Wars does not include original version of the first three movies published (VI-VI), and like many other fans I cannot decide whether do be more disappointed or annoyed.Other fans are entitled to agree or disagree, I just want to express my frustration and that such frustration should be reflected in the overall rating.Of course the copyright holders can do what they want - but I am among the many people who prefer the original releases in the case of Star Wars, and I agree with other critics that the later ""adjustments"" do not add anything, but rather serve as downgradings of the overall quality of the original storytelling.But whether one likes or dislikes the revised editions is not so much the matter here. The real issue is: The theatrical releases are very much in public demand, and furthermore, as a general rule, making original releases de facto unavailable is really, really bad form. (Star Wars IV-VI original versions are availavble on DVD - but that's a bit irrelevant now that fans will want blu-rays, much as when the originals were only out on VHS, and not on DVD).Another movie where the original (first) theatrical release never became available (at all) is ""Apocalypse Now"". I have wanted to see it again for some 25 years - but I want to see the version I loved and nothing else. So I must abstain.The creator of something - anything - has the right to change and revise his/her work - but trying to sort of completely overwrite the original release is slightly suspicipus, and certainly seems rather dumb. Original work that had an impact sort of gets a life of its own - so it might be argued that artists who regret their original or early work should never have gone public in the first place - or at least that such regret should not make it possible for them to take away that others have come to enjoy. Goethe rewrote ""Faust"" several times - wherefore the two versions usually performed are the first or the last. They are both ""the right version"" but in different ways; one for being the original work, one for being the final revision.Those who buy this blu-ray version of Star Wars: I wish you much enjoyment :-)But the joy is not for me. I would buy a box with blu-rays of the theatrical AND the ""revised editions"" - and I would buy it in 2D as well as 3D releases.

I was very excited for the special editions when they were released in the 90s, but let us face it, George Lucas has lost his touch.  He relies to heavily on ILM, which has very low grade technology, especially when compared to Weta Digital (the special effects creators for Lord of the Rings).

For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.

I understand old schooler's don't approve of any changes to a classic. I saw Star Wars in 1977 and what has been lost over the years of grainy video tape is a crime. I've awaited this release for a long time! Widescreen binging in lost elements but the colors so vivid the red light reflecting in 3PO's coverings on the Blockade Runner, lost to video tape. The print is clean and clear an obvious miss at cleaning up the effects was in ""The Fighter Attack"". The blocks around the Tie fighters were not removed in this sequence one reason for the 4 stars, other is no deleted scenes. The deleted scenes are every where so why not include them in the collection. The set is well worth the price even if you pay the MSRP of $70.00. If you do not have a Surround Sound system don't worry the sound has been cleaned up as well. Leia finaly gets to shoot a laser rifle instead of a 9mm in the swing to freedom. The sound was fixed after all the previous releases where the sound of the blank round was left in the sound track. Any Star Wars fan will wan't this collection, I haven't seen such a clear great sounding copy since 1977 and it has been a long wait guess that makes it that much sweeter. By all means hold onto your laser discs and pre- special edition VHS they will be worth money. Lucasfilm should have included a second track to watch it old school and earned a 5 star fom even the most hard core fans.

In this Special Edition you can see better some of the goofs, but others have been corrected, like Obi-Wan's light  saber going white in the final duel with Vader.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2WFNZWC8O6O1J	Atticus	THE STAR WARS movies are amazing.  The sheer imagination that went into them is spectacular.  The original film, A NEW HOPE, topped the charts in '77 and is still, today, the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time, and with good reason.  The original STAR WARS trilogy is one of the top three trilogies of all time, and are a must-see for the whole family.The bonus disc: This bonus disc is the best bonus disc I've ever seen.  The main feature, a documentary called EMPIRE OF DREAMS, is spectacular.  It's the greatest, most comprehensive look at the making of these magical films.  The documentary is accompanied by 4 15-20 minute featurettes, trailers, stills, ect.The films:A NEW HOPE: The film that started it all.  It's amazingly acted, directed, and the script is engrossing.  It's really hard to discribe all three of these films, and that's really all I can say about this one.  You have to see it to believe it.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK: This film has to be one of the greatest sequels of all time.  Most sequels to successful movies are just rehashes of the original, the work of a director trying in vain to recreate a masterpiece.  EMPIRE is one of few exceptions.  This sequel carries on the fight of the brave Rebels against the evil Empire.  Things go darker this time around, though it's not hellish like the second INDIANA JONES film.  The heroes lose a lot, and it leaves you hopeful that things will get better, though wondering how that could ever happen.THE RETURN OF THE JEDI: This might be one of the greatest climaxes of all time.  Great fights, chases, heroes and villains, and weird aliens, like the furry little Ewoks.  Everyone reprises their role (thankfully), and you finally get to see the Emperor himself, and trust me, he doesn't disappoint.  This is a great wrap-up to the amazing trilogy.The quality: George Lucas adds to his visual stunning in this trilogy with new second-long shots of aliens and enhanced picture.  This really ticks some people off, but I think it adds to the films without really changing much.Overall:Great!  I recieved this box set a few years ago, and have simply adored it since.  If you're a STAR WARS fan, this set is a must-own.  And if your not a big fan, even if you don't buy this set, you should still watch the movies.  Highly reccommended.	5.0	Amazing films!

STAR WARS WAS THE FIRST GREAT MOVIE I SAW.  WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT MY DAD TOOK ME AND MY BEST FRIEND (at the time) TO SEE IT.  MY FRIEND WAS BACKWARDS IN THE SEAT LOOKING AT THE REEL ROOM;  I WAS HYPNOTIZED BY THE SCREEN.  SOON AFTER I HAD ALL THE SOUND TRACKS, POSTERS, AND FORGIVE ME ME IF I AM WRONG THE BBC RECORDINGS (or PBR are they not the same).I ALSO REMEMBER A PHENOMENAL DOCUMENTARY ON PBS (not pbr)(either ""new hope"" or EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) MR LUCAS SAYING ""UHM"" ALOT.  DAD GOT PISSED BECAUSE BECAUSE I STARTED MOCKING THIS GUY THAT WAS SAYING ""UHM"" ALL THE TIME.  ANYWAY THIS TOOK ME BEHIND THE SCENES.  IT WAS NOT LIKE ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"".  THIS WAS A REAL BEHIND THE SCENES.THEN THE REMAKES CAME OUT.  SEVERAL YEARS LATER.  TOOK A GUY THAT THAT HAD NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. GUESS WHAT HE DID.  TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT THE REEL ROOM.  I LOOKED AT THE SCREEN.  STILL ASTOUNDED, BUT NOT AS IMPRESSED.  SOMETHING HAD CHANGED.  THE EXTRA STUFF WAS ADDED ON TO IMPRESS.  ALL IT DID WAS DETRACT FROM A FANTASY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE GET GO.MR. LUCAS PLEASE GIVE THE OPTION OF WHICH MOVIE TO WATCH.  I PREFER THE ORIGINAL, BUT I COULD WATCH REMAKE.  GIVE US (the people that grew up with you) THE OPTION OF WHICH VERSION WE WANT TO WATCH.  MAYBE WE CAN COMPARE THE TWO, AND SEE WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE.  I CAN ASSURE YOU, WE WITH WERE WITH YOU THE WHOLE TIME.PLEASE PUT THE ORIGINAL, AND THE REMAKE ON BLU RAY.  I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ORIGINAL ON HIGH DEF WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS.OH YEAH.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1EXF08KJSF9KL	Audiophile	As much as I love the original Star Wars trilogy, I absolutely refuse to buy Star Wars on Blu Ray until the original unaltered theatrical versions are included.  I don't even care if the altered versions are the main features on the discs, but just as long as there is a special feature or some way to watch the original theatrical versions.  It appears George Lucas ignored the large majority of his fans who share my preference, but hopefully Disney or someone in charge will read this, and for once, listen to fans (who are willing and able to pay consumers, might I add).	1.0	Listen to your fans!	2013-09-24	14	13	1

It's a classic, with romance, adventure, comedy,  suspense and something more.  This collection is for the entire family,  kids love it and so do grownups. These movies take you to a place where you  become so attached to the feelings of the actors that when something  happens to one of them, you can feel it too. This is a collection that your  grand grand kids will thank you for having it at home. I consider myself a  movie fan, I have seen them all, but only a few of them are in my private  movie library, and the Star Wars Trilogy is my proud and joy. Get it!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A28KO11TB7OX1J	Austin Ratner	"I bought this because other fans said the original versions of the Star Wars movies in this set were 'good enough' in quality (I have no idea what a ""non-anamorphic transfer"" is or what an ""anamorphic"" one would have been).  What I know is that I wanted to show my kids the original versions of the movies, without the Shmoo version of Jabba the Hut in Star Wars, without the cartoon Bespin ships added to every frame in Empire as if to distract purposely from the dialogue and make you think about George Lucas's cerebral infarct instead of Leia and Han's characters, I wanted the version of Jedi without the Who Framed Roger Rabbit re-edit of Jabba's palace, without Boba Fett sounding like the spokesman for Outback Steakhouse, without the world music cartoon city ending and Hayden Christensen's ridiculous seventh-grade face sullying the honorable images of Alec Guinness and Yoda.  I wanted the original versions, but the ones in this DVD set, anamorphic, non-anamorphic, antibiotic, or anaplastic, look like they came from the WUAB vaults to air on John Lannigan's Prize Movie circa 1980.In other words, even to a non-technophile like me, the versions pretty much STINK unless you sit far away from the TV or take off your glasses.  That said, my kids can't tell the difference, and the grainy, dated look doesn't bother me as much after one or two viewings.  The edited versions look great of course, except for Lucas's computer animations which are less realistic looking than his 1977 effects (which used real light) and less persuasive generally than 1950s Disney animation.  I continue to wonder what type of cerebral infarct George Lucas has suffered."	3.0	Contains originals but quality is pretty bad even to a non-technophile	2010-06-11	5	4	1

Since it's release I have had the Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) in my shopping cart no less than 5 times. I saw Star Wars when it first came out at the drive-in when I was fourteen. Today my oldest turns 21 and I still can't get the original version in DVD format, I'll be a grandmother before Lucas is done! If these DVDs were only cleaned up and the sound enhanced, I would have bought them in an instant. Unfortunately, Lucas has other plans for his films. Some have stated that introducing new effects and characters aides in the continuity of the other films, I disagree. In my opinion the ""Old School"" look of the original films enhance the experience. So, here I sit holding on dearly to my old VHS originals and waiting for Lucas to remember the fans who fell in love with them and would pay plenty to have them on DVD. Who knows, maybe that is just what he is banking on? O.K. I'm taking the box set out of the shopping cart, or maybe I shouldn't..."	2.0	From Fourteen to Grandmother?	2004-11-17	35	26	9

I find this to be the biggest problem with the movie industry. Lucas's vision to blend the two films together is understandable but I refuse to watch these films with the added enhancements. I enjoyed the original films and even moreso since the prequels have been released. George Lucas has a very creative mind thus giving us Star Wars but why mess with something that was classic? That redefined how we view films today? Call me old-fashioned but once a film that is as well loved and respected and revered has been released to the public - embraced by the public, I think Lucas should show some respect to the fans who were and are still loyal to the original films that were released without the enhancements. From reading the reviews - I am very glad to know that I have not wasted my money on Lucas's ""vision"" of how the films ""should"" be versus how they were then. I own the original films on VHS and prize them more than the box set that was released just recently. Plus, I've seen the A&E; documentary on the making of the films so - no loss there either.Another point is - directors should respect the work they do and not emhance or modify what they think needs to be modified. Spielberg has yet to enhance or modify anything. Some directors I guess realize that your best work is the work you do with the tools and equipment you have at the time that you have them. There's no going back to change this or change that.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ALRX38DTE2TCU	A viewer	1. This is not real widescreen. GOD what a dissapointment this purchase was! I knew that this edition had added CG effects, some of which are good and some ridiculous like the singer in Jabba's house, but decided that I could live with that. The real problem is the picture-format!! The top and bottom of the picture in all three movies has simply been masked, to suit widescreen TVs.In RETURN OF THE JEDI, look for example at the chapter index picture of Jabba's fortress with a frog creature in the foreground, and compare it to the picture in the film. How enjoyable is it to see a panorama landscape view with a fortress in the distance with the top cupolas chopped off?? It is AWFUL!!! Furthermore the color nuances are all gone in this scene, it's all reddish!!And how enjoyable is it to see tops of heads chopped off?? It is AWFUL!!!Why do they have to mask the top and bottom of the picture??? If they hade left it whole, a widescreen TV would still not show the top and bottom because it would not fit, so it wouldn't make a difference! But on a normal TV it does! Furthermore, widescreen TVs are not actually that wide, so they still show black stripes at top and bottom with this edition!This proves that superficial proportions of the picture is more important than the actual content and integrity of the art. IS Star Wars art? Well, I respect George Lucas for his vision and work, but a real artist would surely not treat his own work in this abusive manner.(The widescreen editions of the newest Staw Wars films, part I, II, and III, is a different matter. They are complete in picture. They are great.)2. The Bonus Disc doesn't satisfy real fantasy fans. Where are the detailed pictures of all creatures and original sculptures? Phil Tippet's Rancor? The frog creature ouside Jabba's nest? The chessboard creatures? The new long-necked dinosaur creature at Mos Eisley? Those are the kind of things we want to see up close!

The problem is that in the earlier episode illustrating Vader's transformation to evil, he is depicted as personally responsible for mass murder, in the killing of the Jedi. In this context, it seems a profound moral flaw in Lucas' story line that someone at that level of evil should be considered capable of being redeemed at the end even he turned to cast his boss the Emperor into hell. Lucas lost me at that and, as someone who was quite transfixed by the first and closely watched them to the end, this was far more disappointing than the revisionist ""Noo"" that seems to have crept into these final revisions. That being said, I still have my laserdiscs for the originals of the original trilogy and am purchasing the blu rays for the system I have now."	3.0	the real problem lies in the evolution of the films	2011-09-03	6	1	5

With all the changes they are still the essence of what once was.  Lets face it, you still want to sit forward on your seat and go ""WHAT?!?!"" when Darth Vader says "" NO, I am your father"".  Its classic moments like this that make Star Wars great.  If lucas wants this to be what is remembered then i guess thats what it is.  If he feels the need to relese the orginals then great.  But either way we should be happy at all that we got them on dvd.  The picture is astounding.  Simply put it doesn't look like it was shot in 1977.  And the sound, lets put it this way, i love to hear the tie fighters blasting right behind me and the huge BOOM of the death star exploding.Everything about this new release is great.So onward to Episode 3.

Like many other fans, I can watch those 3 movies and can pick out just about every ""special edition"" change that George Lucas made and know how it was like before (and yes, I have an old set of the VHS tapes too). Though I didn't agree with some of the changes, I do like many of them (I chuckle when I see that herd of Banthas in ROTJ) and it is just a wonder to see these films on DVD, with the amazing sound and updated special effects.I know many people felt betrayed by the changes, but in the end, Star Wars belongs to George Lucas and if these new versions are closer to he wanted to achieve, but couldn't because technology hadn't caught up with his vision, then I guess I'll have to accept that these are the versions that we are meant to see at this point in time. Besides, we've had nearly 7 years to absorb some of these changes, so I guess if one is grieving the old movies, I am now in the acceptance stage.The bonus material DVD is an absolute treat! It made it even more worthwhile to buy the set. (I have to admit that I've watched the Episode III material several times already....)The audio commentary is a bit dry sometimes (A couple of the speakers, including Lucas, are a bit too monotonous and drag on a bit). Carrie Fisher is easily the best of the group.

Even now, thirty-four years after A New Hope's release, thiry-one years after The Empire Strikes Back's and twenty-eight years after Return of the Jedi's. Some people complain about the special editions, but these same people will go out and ignore the regular version of a movie just to buy the Director's Cut.What's the real difference?So Lucas didn't direct Empire and only directed second unit on Jedi - he created the Star Wars universe. It's his to play with.Enough about that and onto the DVDs themselves. I personally chose the four-disc set (from 2004) over the six-disc, Limited Edition version (from '06) because I don't need the originals. There's gotta be a billion places on the internet I can find them, and I just want to enjoy what is considered the ""current"" version (by Lucasfilm). Don't get me wrong, though, I too don't like that Hayden Christensen was superimposed over the origial Anakin Skywalker, but that one minor detail isn't gonna stop me from watching the movie, neither are the oddly screwed up lightsaber colors or Ian McDarmaid in Empire (this change I like the most, actually).Plus, I love the bonus disc. It has one of my two favorite Star Wars documentaries (Empire of Dreams).All-in-all, whichever set you choose is your preference (and later this year, we've got the Blu-Ray set coming), so I'm not gonna just yell at you and say ""buy this set, dammit!"", and all I really can say is ""make up your mind""."	5.0	The Three Greatest Films of All Time	2011-02-05	3	1	2

Keep color correction, grain reduction and other enhancements to an absolute minimum (preferably none at all). While you're at it, find the original six channel soundtrack released in theaters (or the two channel... how about both?) and properly remaster it into a lossless surround format without ""enhancing"" it. I want to feel that magnificent brass theme rip my face off at the opening moment of the first film and hear the perfectly transparent string section soar during the beautiful final scene of Empire. I want to see the exact same movie that audiences were awed by in 1977. No more, no less.  And you know what? I would pay the price of this set many times over for it because they are that good.Unfortunately this is not the movies we're getting here and not the set I will be purchasing. These are the Special Editions that contain a plethora of changes made by George many years after the movies were released. Among other things, they attempt to bridge the gap between the original trilogy and the hugely inferior prequel trilogy (made years later) by inserting garishly out-of-place special effects, additional scenes, replacement actors and the infamous Han Solo ""kid-friendly"" character change. Listen up, George: Only a lossless version of both the film and the soundtrack, taken from the highest-quality source material possible, can recreate the excitement of having seen these movies in a theater.

Hatrick ""horror buff"""	Probably the most famous, if not greatest movie trilogy ever made, this collection (essentially a slim-downed version of the earlier 2004 box set release) is a must have for any Lucas/StarWars/scifi buff, fan or dabbler. For me, though, what makes the set great is the inclusion of both original and enhanced theatrical releases, but not for the usual reasons given. You'll find no whining protest about sacrilege to movie icons here, the special editions are fabulous, as they were when originally released. George Lucas spent time and money to make his films finally fit the vision he had always had in his mind, and in doing so ties all six Star Wars films (all excellent, by the way) into a homogeneous whole. For anyone of a creative nature, it's not hard to understand the desire to make something as good as it can be, and Lucas succeeds. The films are stunning, even if a bit dated, which is, I guess, the reason why some many 'hard-core' Warsians love them. I was 19 when the first film came out, so I didn't 'grow up' watching them, so maybe there's a whole reverence thing that I just don't get, but, hey, it's Star Wars!! The packaging matches the Episode I-III box set (which is equally as enjoyable), and while some original bonus content may be lost, it won't really matter in the long run.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A16NK4WD84MNK8	Barry Robinson	Ok, so this a controversial dvd set. Lots of people love it, many people want the original movies on DVD. This is my opinion after seeing Revenge of the Sith. Some of the changes made are very nice, others kinda unnecassary. The changes made in Jabba's appearence are nice. He now appears as he did in The Phantom Menace giving a bit more consistancy to the sage. Lightsaber blades look better than ever, especially in A New Hope, Obi-Wan and Luke's sabers are a brilliant blue throughout, not appearing white at points like in the originals. I honest to God dont care if Greedo fires his gun first. It shows Han can stay calm and blast his enemies even when a blast hits inches away from his head. This is a two second scene that to me has no real impact on the saga. A couple other minor tweaks have been made, in the Death Star, words on a control panel no longer read POWER and TRACTOR BEAM, but instead have been changed to some Star Wars dialect, not English for sure, this is acceptable. Ian McDiarmid has replaced the old actor in Empire with slightly altered dialog informing Vader of Luke's true identity, I really like this change. The Jedi Temple and the Senate can be seen on Coruscant in the ending of Jedi and even though it is reletively short, the addition of Naboo to the ending of Jedi is one of my favorite scenes, for continuity purposes. THe addition of Hayden Christinsen is also a favorite of mine, I thought he did a great job in Sith and think he deserves his appearence. Obi-Wan and Yoda both appear as they did when the died, Anakin should too. Because essentially, Anakin died when he became Darth Vader, as Obi Wan says in A New Hope. I am a fan of both the Original trilogy and the Prequel trilogy. I believe the changes made are overall good for the movie's continuity and its fun to see some new stuff, as well as the old stuff digitally remastered, again. The dvd's truely look and sound fantastic. Honestly, I do wish Lucas would release the originals unmodified on DVD so everyone could be happy, but I've got my 1995 VHS tapes still, so I'm holding out fine. I love theses new versions much more personally. Check them out for sure along with Episode I and II on DVD, those are great as well.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AE2G6FAHRHXJE	"Bart Simpson ""Dvd-Pro"""	"In its original theatrical release, George Lucas' iconic ""Star Wars"" (1977) made a big impact that continues to reverberate. That movie was followed by the cliffhanger sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), and the third film in the series was ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983). After tinkering with the three movies a little, Lucas released new theatrical versions in 1997. Now, tweaked versions of the 1997 films have been released as a four-disc DVD set under the collective title ""Star Wars Trilogy,"" marking the first time any version of these three films has been available on DVD.The 1977 movie commonly known originally as simply ""Star Wars"" has been retitled ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope,"" and ""Star Wars V"" and ""Star Wars VI"" have been incorporated into the titles of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" respectively. The retitling came about in connection with a trio of prequel films that began being released theatrically in 1999, and the numbering scheme indicates where each movie fits into the epic story's chronology.I've always found all three films in the Star Wars Trilogy to be great, and they form a unified whole. I wouldn't characterize them as science fiction I would describe them as pulpy space fantasy action adventure movies. They are set in some distant galaxy during a civil war, and we side with freedom-fighter rebels who are battling the evil Galactic Empire. I would say the ""Trilogy"" is an elaborate coming-of-age tale where we follow the maturation of an idealistic farm boy named Luke Skywalker.On his adventures, Luke teams up with daredevil smuggler Han Solo and plucky young Princess Leia, But Lucas has packed the ""Trilogy"" with a host of quirky characters, including a pair of delightful androids called C-3PO and R2-D2. And I think the movies' chief villain, Darth Vader is one of the most memorable in all of cinema.I've always found it intriguing that some inhabitants of the galaxy embrace the belief that there exists a mystical energy called the Force. There are certain beings called Jedi who seemingly derive special powers from the Force and use them to bring about good. To me, Alec Guinness gives an unforgettable performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a wise old Jedi who mentors Luke. Young Skywalker also receives training from another Jedi, the diminutive Yoda. But the Force is not automatically a source of good: it has a corrupting Dark Side that can result in evil.Each movie in the Trilogy is contained on its own single sided disc, and as far as I am concerned, the three feature films all look and sound terrific: the colors are vivid, the picture is sharp, and the sound is clean. The DVDs provide feature-length audio commentary tracks for all three movies. George Lucas, actress Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt, and visual effects expert Dennis Muren are heard on all three tracks, and these four commentators are joined by a fifth, director Irvin Kershner, on ""The Empire Strikes Back."" I found all three commentary tracks worthwhile, and I particularly enjoyed listening to Lucas and Kershner. Burtt gives more details about the sound than I really want to know."	5.0	A great boxed Set	2005-07-26	3	0	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A34FV327JWDP7Y	"BATRON ""RON KRETSCHMER"""	There is a division among Star Wars fans about whether the revised newer editions are terrible and outrageous tamperings or if they are great additions to the remarkable cannon that has become a cultural icon.  The bad news for purists is that the new DVD set has more tampering and some of it isn't very good.  Han Solo still shoots second in the cantina and it appears in Empire that poor Darth Vader is aware that someone named Skywalker is in the Hoth system but is completely oblivious to the fact that this Skywalker might somehow be related to him.  That nothwithstanding, the DVDs are in better shape than the old videos you used to watch religiously and the whole of the works are not so disturbed that purists can't enjoy the other aspects.  Not much more has been cleaned up since the special edition videos were released, but the sound quality on the DVDs is much better [in most scenes].  The extras disc is absolutely loaded with documentaries, commentaries, demos and other expansive treats.  The extras on episodes 1 and 2 were exhaustive and compelling and they still pale in comparison to the volumes of interesting features packed into the 4th disc.  Overall, this compares favorably to last year's release of the Indiana Jones trilogy.  It is well worth the money and worth finding space on your shelf for.	5.0	STAR WARS ON DVD AT LONG LAST	2004-11-19	11	7	4

To give the fans the respect they deserve for making this franchise as big as it is, and to do right by all the people that worked hard made these films great against all odds, Lucas should do the right thing and sell (for massive profit!) a proper bluray transfer of the REAL films, and I don't mean as a half-assed special feature on the 2nd disk either.	1.0	Defaced Edition	2011-03-29	13	9	4

Today Amazon is selling this set used at $93.99 + $3. And new the cheapest available price is $209.50 + $3!You should know that on my 50 inch TV the theatrical version does not fill the screen from side to side. This is because the DVD image is in a very old format (it is not anamorphic). So, I need to zoom the image to get the picture to fill the screen. This expands the film grain and dirt (which wasn't cleaned up very well on this release). Bottom line; on my large TV, these movies don't look very good.Are the theatrical versions worth it at these prices? It depends how badly you want it.

I have been waiting since I bought my dvd player years ago for the release of these onto dvd. I am a star wars purist. Though the original versions may not have had the super realistic special effects, they had something that the new ones are lacking entirely.....SOUL!!!! I remember when I was young cracking a tear at the end of Jedi as all of the Ewoks and Charactors danced around........I can still hear that SONG!!!! To my horror, when Jedi ended, this version was a dry as toast. No heart at all. What a stupid thing to do to the end of a one of a kind trilogy. And how stupid to put young Anikan in there instead of the old Anikan that we were used to. And then to keep Obi One as an old man.......it just makes no freakin' sense. STUPID. Just to push his rewrite of the story..........and George, if you happen to read this, I really hope your third Star Wars coming out in May of this year is a hell of a lot better than the other two new ones, as they just do not have it. I will give you a hint, try a little less special effects, and a whole lot more story and charactor development. The first three Star Wars were all great movies that tied in perfectly with the previous films. The new ending of Jedi tore that continuity to pieces. They are only cheapening the entire Star Wars franchise by doing these stupid changes. It seems that Lucas is loosing touch with what made Star Wars such a great movie to begin with.	1.0	Extremely Disapointed	2005-02-23	19	13	6

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3I0I917VF3LKG	beatfan	"Like so many of the reviewers here, I was very excited to get the Blu-Ray set of the Star Wars trilogy. Luckily, I had not yet unwrapped the set but went online to read the reviews. What I found out blew me away. After watching a few of the new scenes on YouTube, I took the Blu-Ray set back to the store and never looked back. At this point, I am hoping to find a way to get a glimpse of the original theatrical versions on the bonus discs from the earlier DVD release and could care less if the quality is bad.What I don't understand is how someone--an artist--can have such a complete disregard for his or her work. It's one thing to keep improving something while still preserving the original, but it's another to try to destroy that original, along with the growth, nostalgia and connection that it created in exchange for something of less value and quality. It's like life: you are constantly growing and developing and may end up being the person you always wanted to be. But as flawed as your past may have been, it's an integral part of you that made you who you are today, and you can't just disregard or pretend like it didn't exist.If a famous painter got up one day and decided he didn't like the way his famous masterpiece turned out, would he remove it from the museum, redo it and then tell the world that that's the only version they would see from now on? No, because then his fans, who have loved the painting for so long, would not look at it the same way again and instead would resort to finding the original image in any way they could. This is the case with the original trilogy.Overall, I have come to the conclusion that Lucas is really a poor, tasteless director with no artistic sense or integrity. When the original trilogy came out, there were other decision-makers involved in the making of the movies, and because of their advice, which I am sure included the vetoing of some of Lucas' decisions, the trilogy was a success. On the other hand, once the creative control went back to Lucas, the quality started diminishing. We saw that quality in the horror that is the so-called prequel trilogy, as well as the continuous changes that are always being made to the original trilogy. Has he ever received an Oscar for his work as a director? I don't think so.For me, the biggest problem with the current so-called ""original trilogy"" version of Star Wars is not the audio or color tweaks, not the insertion of deleted scenes or improvements to CGI, but the continuous effort to shove the prequels down everyone's throats. All this tying-in between the six movies has really gotten out of hand. As much as I dislike the new changes (dragon call, Greedo, Ewok, etc.), I really can't stand the replacement of Shaw by Christenssen in ROTJ. That, right there, is the worst case of tampering with the past. Though the ""no"" is bad enough, I am now reading something about the de-masking of Darth Vader, where, once again, Shaw's face is digitally altered to include no eyebrows and a closer resemblance to young Anakin. That's all, brother.George Lucas can go on and on about how these Star Wars films are his, and how the franchise is his creation; however, viewers are the ones spending the money (well, not anymore) and investing their time in this series. And if Lucas keeps on going at the pace he is now, he will wind up being the only one watching them."	1.0	So Long Star Wars - May the Force Be With You!	2011-09-28	19	12	7

I've often wondered why Lucas wasted all that money and effort on this one scene; the scene prior to Han Solo and company blasting off from Mos Isely in Episode 4 - A new Hope. The scene was redundant the CGI just plain awful.And what was wrong with Darth Vader's line in ""Empire Strikes Back"" where a dejected Vader says to his staff ""Bring my shuttle"" after Luke rejects Vader in on Bespin. Why did Lucas, for no apparent reason, hire someone who doesn't sound very much like James Earl Jones to speak the one line ""Alert my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival."" The line adds nothing to the scene.Episode 6 was just plain silly even in the theatrical version and should have served as a warning to the fans of what was coming in episodes 1 - 3.I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning. I've spent a small fortune buying every new release of the original trilogy from the original release on VHS tape, (which my son wore out) to multiple wide screen versions on VHS in a variety of box sets, to at least two other box set releases on DVD.Here is where I draw the line. That's it George, you've seen the last of my money if you don't release the theatrical version on Blu-ray. Oh and I don't care what version the ""prequel"" trilogy is released. I got suckered into Episode 1 and was disgusted with Episode 2 and refused to buy Episode 3. So Blu-Ray is not an option here.Well, at least Peter Jackson leaned a valuable lesson from George Lucas. His extended versions of the Lord of the Rings was worth buying. I am waiting for the extended editions to be released on Blu-Ray. Until then, the DVD version will do for now on my upconverting Blu-Ray player player."	1.0	"""Jabba, you're a wonderful human being"""	2011-01-15	18	13	5

Then, the fullscreen editions were released, followed by the widescreens (yes, these two sets could have been released at one time, I agree).GL didn't force you to buy the Special Edition VHS's or see them in the theaters.GL didn't trick you into buying either or both of the two DVD releases.

The added special effects were not bad, but they were not really needed. Rumor has it, George Lucas want to add the ghost of Hayden Christiansen (young Vader) anlong side the ghost of Yoda in Return of the Jedi, and in my opinion that is going way to far.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2UN3THZG5FOUR	B Gallagher	"I can't resist - I must add my two cents:Like many others, I grew up in the seventies, and my life was changed when I saw Star Wars in the theaters (many times).  I haven't decided yet if I'm going to buy the new release, I probably will, but it's extremely irksome to me (if not downright painful), to watch a masterpiece get defiled this way.I guess I don't have a problem with them cleaning up the picture and subtly enhancing some of the effects that are ALREADY THERE.  In fact, I don't have much problem with anything except the Mos Eisley scene, where the most radical alterations can be found.  In the original version, the city had a kind of appealing desolation about it that made it feel like a kind of Tombstone Texas in space.  Now, with the new version, it is populated - in fact SWARMING with CGI creatures.  The problem with CGI is that no matter how ""realistic"" it is, it still looks like CGI.  So instead of everything on screen being real, now we are sitting there thinking ""Wow, look at all the cool CGI creatures"".  Not for a moment is it believable - not for one moment are we convinced that what we are watching is real.  Instead of immersing us in the story, CGI jerks us back to reality and reminds us that we are watching a movie.  I believe that some day, maybe 10 years from now, we are going to look back at all the CGI and say ""what were we thinking!""  It's going to become as out-of-style as 70's pointy-collared polyester shirts.But I can point to the exact moment in the new version when it fell apart completely.  As our heroes are making their way through the streets, we see a Jawa riding on the back of some big lizard thing.  The lizard thing rears up, the Jawa slips off its back and as the Jawa is swinging from the reigns, it yells ""Wheeee!""  ""Wheeee"" ?!?!?!?!????????  My God, George, what made you think that was a good idea.  First of all, there was always something sinister and a little creepy about the Jawas.  In the original they were never used for comic relief.  Jawas are smelly, greedy, mysterious, even dangerous little creatures - and they don't say ""Wheee""!  By inserting that one little cute exclamation, the entire movie falls from being believable to being UN-believable - it's like a pop-up ad that reminds us ""YOU ARE ONLY WATCHING A MOVIE - LOOK, HUMOR!""  It is so blatant, tactless, contrived, un-subtle, obnoxious and out-of-place that if I didn't know better, I'd think someone was INTENTIONALLY trying to yank us out of the movie experience.The reason Return of the Jedi doesn't work, is that, for some reason, George Lucas became cute and slapstick.  Over time he began inserting more and more cuteness and slapstick into his movies.  But the original Star Wars, episode IV, had very little of that - and what it did have was believable in the context of the story.  And that is what makes a difference between a masterpiece and just a movie.  Every film masterpiece has one thing in common:  all aspects are believable and realistic within the context of the story.What George Lucas has done is add UN-realistic details to his one and only masterpiece.  Now, we can't watch the movie without being rudely reminded that we are watching a movie.  NOW, Mr. Lucas, you no longer have a masterpiece.  All you have is a pretty good movie.  And it's incredibly sad."	2.0	Here's the problem with the upgrades:	2004-09-07	47	37	10

I have a high-end home theater (CRT Front projector with 120"" screen) which is themed after Star Wars.For many years I have been suffering with the Special Edition Laserdisc versions of these movies. The quality of the Laserdiscs is hard to take when projected on a 10 foot screen. Well, my kids and I fired up the new Star Wars ANH DVD last night and it was SPECTACULAR! Oh my god what a difference in picture quality! It made watching the movie enjoyable again (and I've seen it probably 50 times). The audio appears to be very similar to the S.E. Laserdisc version. That is, lots of boom added.The ONLY thing that distracted me in the movie was where Princess Leia's dialogue was dubbed. I never noticed this in the LD version, but it was quite apparent in several scenes on the DVD. For example, when the bad dudes are about to blow up Leia's home planet, you can hear where they dubbed in some chick with an English accent! Besides the accent, you can clearly hear a change in background noise before and at the end of the dub (almost a ""click""), and the tone of her voice is different (more treble I think). I never noticed this on the LD, so after the movie I checked the LD version. Guess what? The English accent is there too, but I never noticed it because the other audio clues are not present. I noticed this dub in at least one other scene on the DVD.So what's up with dubbing Leia with someone with an English accent? How stupid is that? If there was an audio problem, why didn't they just get Carrie Fisher to dub it herself (or at least someone that sounded like her)??? George? Are you listening? I gotta know! Maybe it's in the bonus material.Oh, and Lucas' digital ""enhancements"" don't bother me a bit. So, nyaaaaa!Anyone want to buy a Laserdisc box set?

You can view this ""full-size"" on your 16x9 TV by setting your DVD player's HDMI output to 3x4/pillar-box if necessary, and then setting your TV to ""zoom"" so that the screen is filled side to side with the picture. There will be slim black bars on the top and bottom, just as there are on anamorphic DVD's with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.Even with the zoom in effect, the picture is crystal clear and the color great. I'm using an upconvert DVD player with HDMI output (1080p), and a 50-inch plasma HD television.  Some have said in reviews that the picture quality is poor, even ""VHS quality"", but that's totally false. I've read that the originals here were taken from the laser-disc masters done in the early 90's; well, they look great however they were sourced. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo (as indicated on the package) and sounds excellent. I get some center-channel and sub-woofer action as well as the stereo music and sound-effects on my system.If a blu-ray/HD version is ever issued, that will be great and an improvement; but this is the only way to get the original films on DVD at this time, and they look great, so this set is essential for fans who saw these movies in theatres when they were released between 1977 and 1983 and want to see them once again in their original glory."	5.0	Original and Special Editions Trilogy - Definitive	2009-06-18	141	125	16

I love the original Star Wars trilogy so when I bought my Blu-Ray player I knew I had to get this set of Blu-Ray discs. I am just blown away how good the picture quality is for a 35 year old movie. How they made it HD I don't know but it is. I would suggest you buy this set if you are a fan of the movies. It is well worth the money.	5.0	The picture quality blows me away	2013-01-11	3	2	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1DB4U8ISVULVE	Bill Smith	"This review is of the Star Wars ""The Original Trilogy"" box set released on BLU RAY (blue cover of Darth Vader head). Because the Amazon reviewing editors are Short Bus Riders and can't think their way out of a paper bag, they have mindlessly collected ALL reviews of the Star Wars Trilogy in ANY format, even VHS, and piled them all in one place to needlessly and endlessly confuse things and make it hard to figure out what is being reviewed. So here you will see reviews of the original special edition trilogy released on DVD, and the 2008 DVD box set trilogy which contained the special editions WITH the bonus disc UNALTERED versions of Star Wars, Empire and Jedi, VHS versions and now the Blu Ray versions. So I don't know who is dumber, Amazon or Lucas.I assume this box set release is simply the same as the Star Wars Blu Ray box set versions which contain all the movies plus 3 bonus discs of material. This box set is deceiving because it does not tell you these are the CGI enhanced and altered Special Edition versions. It also does not contain any extra materials either. The ONLY release of the original theatrical movies on DVD are on those 2008 DVD versions as bonus discs (released individually and as a Trilogy set). THERE IS NO RELEASE OF the UNENHANCED UNALTERED ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS ON BLU RAY. Lucas apparantly claims the Special Editions ARE the definitive versions, and won't release the original theatrical versions on Blu Ray.Still the BEST way to see the original theatrical unchanged verions of the original trilogy of movies is on the massive Definitive Edition Laserdisc Box set released around 1992 or on the later released CLV ""Faces"" edition laserdiscs released in the mid 90s. That is why I have hung on to those laserdisc versions. They are 450 lines of resolution (vs the 240 line VHS version) and look spectacular on any display that shows standard definition well (such as Sony CRT tube TVs). Yes, the Blu Ray versions look fantastic for the most part and are the best way to watch Star Wars on a big screen hi def set. But they aren't the original versions of the movies.Amazon, why don't you clowns quit playing grab ass in the break room and get to work with sorting out and properly cataloging these reviews so reviews are ONLY of the specific PRODUCT and quit mixing all these reviews together you lazy jackwagons."	3.0	This is the original trilogy of movies, but NOT the original theatrical versions of the Trilogy	2011-07-20	0	0	0

I sold my copies cheap at a garage sale recently, because I could no longer stand to watch them. If the original movies were released on DVD, I would probably buy them. I loved those old movies without the added musical numbers, CGI characters, extra sound effects, etc., etc., etc. This version was a disappointment because all of that new stuff is so distracting that it takes away from the gentle spirit and lovable goodwill of the original theatrical releases.	1.0	Not It	2006-09-22	128	116	12

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AIMR915K4YCN	"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby"""	I loved the &#34;first&#34; STAR WARS (aka: EPISODE IV- A NEW HOPE). I saw it in the theatre in 1977 and couldn't believe the realistic space scenery! I was enthralled by Darth Vader and still consider him one of the coolest villains ever. Of course, I was a kid back then. I fell hook, line, and light-saber for the whole phenomenon. Today, I have to look at what I loved about the original trilogy, as well as what I hated. STAR WARS Episode IV- A New Hope- I love the wide-eyed wonder of it. I love Luke as a kid who stumbles into the greatest adventure of his life, quite by &#34;accident&#34;. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as the rogue space-pirate type anti-hero guy. He's a cool foil for Luke's cream cheese goodiness. Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher as the damsel-in-distress turned warrior was deceptively ahead of her time) is the perfect middle ground between the two male heroes. I loved them together as the flies in the empire's ointment. George Lukas drew from his childhood dreams, fantasies, and saturday afternoon movie serials to fashion a classic in it's own right. Episode IV stands as a milestone in not only special effects, but in sci-fi storytelling. It took something that seemed &#34;out there&#34; and made it accessible to folks like me (the non-sci-fi bunch). I loved Obi Wan (Alec Guinness). I loved The imperial ships, the death star, the land speeder, the Millenium Falcon, the sand people, the jawas, R2-D2, C-3PO, the goofy saloon scene, and even Leia's hairdos! I loved the whole bloody thing! I just can't find anything to hate about this first SW effort of Mr. Lukas.  -2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; Luke's landspeeder is more realistic, as it's underside has been cleaned up. lightsabers look much better! Mos Eisley revised to make it look more like a bustling hub than a ghost town! Unfortunately, Greedo still shoots first! Scene with Han Solo and Jabba The Hutt restored and vastly improved over 1997 version! Jabba looks more like himself, less like a mutated tadpole! Space scenes even more boffo than before! Scene with Luke's friend Biggs is restored! Deathstar explosion is extra cool! Then, in 1980 came Episode V- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. No George behind the camera, and yet it is a great movie! Darker and far more ominous than it's predecessor, TESB features a growing, maturing Luke, a deepening (though guarded) chemistry between Leia and Han, and a gloom that slowly rises to ultimately engulf them all. This is my personal favorite SW flick. I love the ice planet Hoth, the snow monster encounter, and those beautiful imperial walkers! Vader is an unstoppable evil, bent on Luke's either joining him or being destroyed. The secrets revealed between them are legendary. Luke isn't as much of a boy, he's a young man. I love the dread and anguish in this installment. It makes it all seem real and inescapable. 2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; Probe droid looks better. Snowmonster has added scenes where it's eating Luke's TanTan! Snowspeeders no longer look &#34;cropped in&#34;. Imperial walkers look better too! Cloud city looks like it's actually there rather than an added model! Hologram of the Emperor changed from the goofy looking person in the original to the real guy (Ian McDiarmid)! Then, there's Episode VI- RETURN OF THE JEDI- I have mixed feelings about this one. I love the space battles. I love the speeders roaring through the forests like giant, fuel-injected mosquitoes. I love Jabba The Hutt's bulky nastiness, and Leia's bikini! I love Vader and that super-turd, The Emperor, of course. I love the plot and the way things turn out. However, I absolutely hate the stiff, nearly robotic way that Luke, Leia, and Han trudge through their scenes. The chemistry seems lost and Luke's Jedi-guru-I-Am-Buddha thing grates my last nerve! Then there's those cuddly, buy-me-at-your local-wal-mart Ewoks! I hated them in the theatre in '83, and I hate them now. Their part in the movie went on and on. I wanted the imperial troops to take most, if not all of them out! I hate the teddy bear planet! Die, Ewoks! Die!! There, I feel better now. My 8yo son loves the Ewoks though, and maybe that's the point. He's not old and jaded like his old man. Anyway, I still consider ROTJ to be a classic, just not as good as the other two in the trilogy. 2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; The Rancor has been cleaned up and looks fantastic! It looks like it's really after Luke, like it's really there, instead of an added claymation toy! That stupid-looking singer (you know, the walking belly with lips) in Jabba's lair has been replaced by a CGI version. Jabba's sail-barge looks great now! No longer a groaner! The pit-monster has been given a huge maw and extra tentacles. It looks menacing and hungry! The interior of the second death star is awesome! Watching the rebel ships fly through it now is even more thrilling! Like everyone, I've been waiting for these babies to be released on DVD! They are worth the wait! Lucas knew what he was doing afterall. To be able to own them all like this is something I've looked forward to for years. The Star Wars trilogy is essential viewing for anyone who has a child's heart and an imagination to match. I get a little less crusty every time I see them. I enjoy that far off galaxy and can never wear it out...	5.0	A Love / Hate Relationship...	2004-06-04	9	5	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1U2KLNT1TJEUF	biped	"Well, I bought the STAR WARS Trilogy DVD and I just got through watching all the movies, special features, commentaries, etc. And it was lots and lots of fun.The image and sound quality are top notch, of course. These movies no doubt look and sound better here than they ever have before.As for the changes made by George Lucas: they're jarring, but most of them I think I will get used to. A few tweaks here and there aren't really all that bad -- I like the shots of the different planets celebrating at the end of RETURN, along with the new music that replaces that awful Ewok chant, and it's nice to finally get to meet Biggs right before the big attack on the Death Star. I'm even beginning to accept the addition of Hayden Christensen as Annikin alongside Obi-Wan and Yoda at the end of RETURN. And I don't mind the original bug-eyed Emperor in EMPIRE being replaced by Ian McDiarmid, because he didn't match the character in RETURN anyway. (One thing I still can't figure out -- why does there seem to be a crudely-drawn black spot next to the Emperor's right eye during his final scenes in RETURN? It looks as though it's masking something, but what?)Some of the additions were unnecessary -- I really didn't need to actually see a hand-puppetty-looking worm coming out of that hole that Boba Fett falls into on Tattooine during the scene on Jabba's barge. Nor does seeing a herd of Banthas, or stormtroopers riding around on digital beasts, add anything to my enjoyment of the movies. Most of it is just George Lucas' irritating tendency to forever tinker around with his creations. However --Some of the changes that particularly irritated me are:1. Greedo still shoots first, although they made the time between his shot and Han's shot shorter -- but who cares? I liked Han better when he just pre-emptively shot first. That totally fits his character at the time.2. The scene where Jabba confronts Han before the Millenium Falcon takes off is all wrong. Jabba always struck me as a creature who is naturally too huge and bloated to be very mobile -- as in RETURN, where he lounges authoritatively in one spot and everything and everyone comes to HIM -- and it just looks dumb to see him bopping around like this.3. The rebel fighters heading toward the Death Star are digital now. I liked the old ones. George -- I LIKE seeing how the FX guys conquered challenges using the resources available at the time and managed to produce great effects that STILL LOOK GOOD.4. Boba Fett's voice is now the voice of the actor who plays Jango Fett in CLONES. So how come the stormtroopers don't all sound like him too?5. The dancers performing for Jabba the Hut do a digital song-and-dance sequence now. It's pretty bad -- like something out of a third-rate Pixar movie.I'm sure I'll think of some others later, but you get the idea. The changes are there, and we're stuck with them, so we might as well get used to them. Although this is why I wish the DVD's came with both the original versions and the ""special"" editions.The commentaries are pretty interesting for the most part. Lucas, Dennis Muren, sound designer Ben Burtt, and Carrie Fisher appear on all three, with the addition of director Irvin Kershner on EMPIRE. There aren't many dead spots, but that's mainly because Burtt goes on and on about how he obtained various sounds from dumpster lids, movie projectors, and whatnot. It's interesting in small doses, but he goes on about it too much during scenes where I would like to hear commentary from Lucas or Muren. Kershner is a genial old guy who seems genuinely enthusiastic about his part in the STAR WARS saga and it's fun to listen to him, even though a lot of his commentary is simply him excitedly telling us what's going on as it happens. Fisher pops in now and then with a few anecdotes.Lucas' commentary contributions, of course, are the most substantive, yet he frequently made me want to throw things at him with his constant griping about how unsatisfied he was with various shots and how this or that could've been done better digitally. Before it was over I was thoroughly sick and tired of the word ""digital."" I feel that, like myself, a lot of the people watching these movies, who have loved them for decades, are entirely content with the way they look and how the FX artists of the time were able to solve certain problems and present incredible special effects that, as I said before, STILL LOOK GOOD even after the advent of CGI and other advanced techniques. I wanted to hear how these movies were made, not how much better they could have been made today. Lucas, however, seems totally oblivious to this and often speaks in a regretful tone during the commentary, which is a real turn-off. He just doesn't seem to get the fact that these movies are so popular because of what they are, not because of what they could have been.As for the additional disc of special features, there's a wonderful documentary about the STAR WARS saga that lasts around two-and-a-half hours. There are also three featurettes of interest, especially the one which features the likes of Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson talking about the effect STAR WARS has had on them. In addition to the usual trailers, TV spots, etc., there's a preview of Episode III that shows Hayden Christensen and Ewen MacGregor practising what promises to be a major lightsaber dual between their characters, and the construction of a new Darth Vader costume. The video game preview is interesting too, and contains more of Christensen going through his moves for the benefit of the game designers.An Easter egg which can be found on the ""Video Games And Still Galleries"" menu features some outtakes along with the DVD credits. It's not very long and it seems as though more of this material could have been dug up for the DVD. (You can access it by punching in ""11"", which activates a light next to R2-D2, then ""3"", and then ""8"".) The still galleries contain photos from the discarded sequence in which Luke hangs out with his friend Biggs Darklighter at Tosche Station in Anchorhead (surprisingly, Koo Stark was in this scene as well) which makes one wonder why Lucas couldn't have included these scenes on the special features disc as well. One possible reason is the fact that a special, SPECIAL set of all six films is already being planned and they're saving stuff like that for it. Which means, I guess, that I'm going to miss out on it because there's no way I'm buying these movies AGAIN.Well, that's my disjointed review of the new STAR WARS DVD set. All in all, despite its flaws, it's definitely well worth having and is a huge amount of fun for the Star Wars fan."	5.0	A Must-Have For Star Wars Fans	2004-10-12	17	10	7
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AHCVWPLA1O4X8	bixodoido	Well, most of the world is still waiting for this classic trilogy to be released on DVD, and will likely be waiting for a few more years.  Until then, we have to content ourselves with this VHS Special Edition release.  The DVD release will mark my 4th purchase of the trilogy, and I have to admit that I don't regret buying these movies 3 times already one bit.  They are just that good.This epic tale of the saga between good and evil is every bit as entertaining as it was 25 years ago, though the new added scenes (for the most part) have not improved the films much.  Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and especially Yoda and Darth Vader have become household names thanks to this great trilogy.  As far as epic scope and storytelling grandeur, there are few movies that can rival the Star Wars trilogy.George Lucas forever revolutionized the film industry with his release of Star Wars: a New Hope (in 1977).  Every so often, a film is released that forever changes the world of cinema, and Star Wars was such a film.  This movie, along with its sequels The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi (all 3 included in this release), was very deservant of all the credit it received.  Say what you will about the new films--there are very few people who don't have a special place in their hearts for the original Star Wars trilogy.	5.0	The best release (so far) of these immortal movies	2003-06-23	5	2	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A18TIOVIX2AKRA	"BJA ""Iceman"""	"I think George Lucas has every right to tweak his films, but it has the effect of fans looking for what's been changed.  This leads to paying very close attention to the films and the remaining visual effect errors just pop out at me in Episode IV. I know in 1977 it was the best they could do, but today, it should be quite simple to fix the shots of TIE fighters with boxes around them.The other scene that jumps out at me is Luke practicing with his light saber on the Falcon.  When he shuts it off while on-camera, it just doesn't flow right.  It never has, and after watching the documentary on the Light Sabers, I can see why it may be nearly impossible to ever fix this shot.  But I can see no excuse for the TIE fighters not being re-done.I don't know how it is that I can see these visual effects errors but Lucas hasn't noticed them.As for the changes made since the '97 Special Edition:Episode IV: Didn't really notice any.  I've heard the Solo-Greedo shootout was tweaked, but it's not that obvious to me.In Episode V:1. Re-dubbing Bobba Fett's dialog using the actor who played Jango Fett in Episode II:  I liked this change.  It makes sense that since Bobba is an exact duplicate, he should grow up to sound just like Jango.2. Replacing the Emperor:  I like the idea of having the actor we've seen in Episodes I and II doing this bit, but the dialog just doesn't sound quite right.  Maybe I'll get used to the new lines, but the old way flowed much better.  The Emperor telling vader to ""search your feelings"" just doesn't sound right to me, I don't know why.In Episode VI:1. Having Hayden's image come up at the end is a very good change.  Since the character's apperance prior to donning the Darth Vader mask has been established now, where when the movies were made, we didn't know what he really looked like before he fell to the dark side."	4.0	Episode IV visual effects still a bit rough???	2004-09-27	4	1	3

I remember an interview in which he said, ""Instead of doing 'Isn't it terrible what's happening to society?' movies - which is where I began - I wanted to create a movie where people could escape for two hours.""  (I hope I got the quote right.)Individually, the movies might not be all that great (although The Empire Strikes Back stands out), the reason (IMHO) they're released as a set is because you need the whole trilogy (actually, both trilogies, but we'll have to wait for that) to see the whole story.It is the ultimate fantasy/escape movie series.  It succeeds on every level in that respect.  It's not meant to be as cerebral (or as ""If it's not incomprehensible, it's not art"") as, say 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There's really nothing to be read into these stories.  Just sit back and enjoy the action and the special effects.  (And remember how many Oscars these movies won!  The original ""Star Wars"" [now ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope]"" was nominated for Best Picture!)As for the Special Edition controversy: considering what Lucas had to work with in 1977, he literally worked miracles in optical and sound effects.  But it still wasn't what he really wanted.  With the SE, we finally got to see what Lucas fully intended from the start.  (Okay, the new crowd scenes in ESB and ROTJ looked a bit forced - no pun intended.)

And to top it off, no one has ever thought to touch his movies with CGI nonsense. Why?

The only problem is, nothing he adds makes the original stories any better. Why?Because it's all unnecessary. To a pixel.A good chef knows restraint. Lucas knows no restraint. And so he has ruined the original movies. He has turned Han Solo into a hack instead of a bad*ss, he's made Vader a petulant whiner.

If you are looking for the prized original theatrical versions, then I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  While very good, this set has all the George Lucas, often strange, alterations to the originals.  I don't know what Lucas was smoking when he added half of this stuff.  He is one weird dude!  How many times do you have to play with the Han vs Greedo scene?  I've seen at least 4 different iterations of it.  Why George, why???  It is hands down the stupidest alteration to a movie I have ever seen and it highlights perfectly the bizarre nuttiness that is George Lucas.  Don't get me wrong, some of the alterations are quite good.  The ""opening up"" of the Cloud City made perfect sense and it's great.  More windows and views of the skyline.  The changes to the X-wing battle in episode 4, for the most part, are great.  I'm good with changes that make sense and enhance the movie.  Others, well.......  let's just say that some of them are ridiculous and and add nothing to film.  For instance, Mr. Lucas became obsessed with Darth Vader requesting his shuttle in Episode V.  It went from ""Bring me my shuttle"", to ""Bring me my Star Destroyer"", to ""Alert my Star Destroyer of my arrival"", and so on.  Why?  Who knows, it's part of the lunacy of George Lucas.  So, if you can stomach these things, you will love this set.  The picture and sound are out of this world."	4.0	Excellent Blu-ray quality.	2014-04-26	19	18	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A18QA3A3UYWFU9	Blade	"You can either take it or leave it, but no matter what you may believe, Star Wars will always be Star Wars. I have seen ALL the films so far (Including the untouched versions of the original trilogy) and enjoyed each and every one of them. (My favorite being ""The Empire Strikes Back"" out of them all) Truly, I am very glad to finally see these classic gems on DVD and revealed the way they were meant to be when they were released. Of course the purists will not be interested, considering the fact that they grew up watching them in the late 70s and early 80s. The reason why George Lucas had updated these movies in 1997 was due to the fact that he had a limited budget and very little time at the time they were originally made. Obviously, if this had been differently, nobody would be complaining... PERIOD! The changes BARELY affect the films negatively and they are still watchable for ANY SW fan, young or old.I myself am one of those for the changes due to that they help fix many of the bugs and glitches in the movies. One being the transparent cockpit of the ships during the battle for Hoth in ESB. Another problem was the white and yellow boxes, which would sometimes appear around some of the star ships. This error has been fixed in the DVDs and I am glad because to me it REALLY got distracting at times. (The same goes for that funny orange blob below Luke's landspeeder on Tatooine)However, there are also some of the changes seen in the 1997 Special Editions that weren't really necessary at all but fit into the movies okay. One was with the Greedo shooting first in Episode IV, which didn't exactly look as realistic but luckily in this DVD version it has been slightly fixed up a bit, still making Han Solo look like a badass. Then let's not forget Jabba-the-Hutt, who looks A LOT more convincing and familar just like how he is in ROTJ, rather than his original makeover as a slithering piece of turd in the 1997 version. Also, it's excellent that they replaced the so-called ""monkey eyed"" woman with Ian McDiarmid (Who plays Palpatine and the Emperor in the prequel trilogy and Episode VI) it gives a hint of continuation to the prequels with the slightly altered dialogue. Another fix was the part with the Emperor's scream in Episode V as Luke chooses to plummet to his death. Yes, it has been edited out (as it originally was in the 1980 version) and I'm glad they did this because it doesn't make sense to have Emperor Palpatine's voice coming out of Luke's mouth! The same scream was also used in Episode VI when Vader throws Palpatine (AKA Darth Sidious) down the beam cannon. In addition, the black circles around the Emperor's eyes, has also been removed, making him look even more menacing and nightmarish than ever! As for Hayden Christensen replacing Shaw as Anakin's ghost, I didn't mind this at all. (Again, it gives a sign of continuation) Finally, the lightsaber effects for ALL three films, has been enhanced and even the Obi Wan VS. Vader duel looks more epic than ever with all the added in flashing effects and sound!The DVDs themselves are in their best picture quality (It looks almost as new as the quality in Episodes I & II), and the 5.1 Dolby Digital EX sound transfer has never sounded better than ever! (Of course you also get the choice to watch them in 2.0 Surround Sound) When I first opened the package and popped in the first disk, it felt like I was watching the movies all over again for the first time! Never have I seen Star Wars like THIS! I do agree that we should've also gotten the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 releases because it would have been nice to reflect back on how they were originally made. (Without the added CGI effects, scenes, etc.) This would also appeal to diehard fans of the series. Sadly, George Lucas doesn't want to put them on DVD. (For now, at least) However, we do get to see BTS footage for Episodes IV-VI (including a bit of a sneak peak at Episode III) and the original theatrical trailers/T.V. spots.For those who are against this release, I would have to disagree because this is the best [and ONLY] DVD experience of the films you will be getting for now. Honestly, I don't see what the problem is and I would've bought this set whether it was the Original or Special Editions, because it clearly makes no difference unless you have nothing better to do than to waste your time obsessing and whining about it. After all, the special effects, added scenes, and altered music/actors are NOT the only elements these movies are about! It's also the wonderful storytelling and acting, the many different planets and creatures that inhabit them, which George Lucas introduces us to, & the beautifully composed score by John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra that will always be there! Just buy the set, pop in your favorite episode, pop a little popcorn, sit back and enjoy the movies with an open mind. I'm very glad that I bought this set and am now waiting patiently on the theatrical release for Episode III which will be coming May 19th! Once that one comes to DVD the following year, I will finally be able to own all six episodes!""THE FORCE WILL BE WITH YOU ALWAYS..."" -Alec Guiness as Obi Wan Kenobi"	5.0	No matter what anyone says, it's STILL Star Wars...	2005-03-04	20	16	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ	Blahblahblah	"It turns out that Lucas was never as talented as anyone thought he was.  The only reason why the original Star Wars films turned out to be a fun trilogy is because he was prevented by either budget or special effects limitations of the time period.  Otherwise, the films would have turned out to be the overblown messes his latest trilogy is turning out to be.  The evidence?  The so-called special editions of his original trilogy.The worst offenses of these retooled films arises when Lucas creates new scenes which largely consist of Jar Jar Binks level comic relief.  The second worse offenses consist of unnecessary CGI characters added to pre-existing scenes which are glaringly obvious and look completely out of place.  The least of Lucas' offenses consist of touch-ups on old special effects which, in a few cases, are actual improvements.  But even then, Lucas manages to screw up, especially at the end of A New Hope when the original exciting scene of the Death Star blowing up is replaced by an extremely lame burst of light.ILM has fallen too much in love with having actors perform in front of blue screens with obviously computer-generated characters.  At least in the ""new"" scene of Han Solo conversing with Jabba the Hutt Harrison Ford actually got to perform on a real set, but Jabba himself looks extremely pathetic in comparison to the animatronics version seen in Return of the Jedi and, furthermore, is much smaller in size.  This scene did not make the first release of A New Hope because they did not have the technology to create Jabba, but in retrospect this was a blessing.  Jabba comes off as a joke when seen walking beside Han and demanding his money.For those who have only seen the retooled ET on DVD, Spielberg's changes (e.g. replacing the government agents' guns with walkie-talkies, and cleaning up the kids' dialogue) are far less ridiculous or a kick in the fans' teeth in comparison to the changes Lucas made.  Lucas and Spielberg really need to leave their old movies alone.  I dread to think what would happen to THX-1138 (a happy ending complete with a Busby Berkley muscial number and guest appearances by a computer generated Elmo perhaps?)."	1.0	"Beware of ""Special Editions"""	2004-07-10	32	21	11

Just as many other ""Theatrical"" vs ""Director's Cut's"" are offered from studios like Fox.BUT, Lucas doesn't want you to have them. -- Interesting that someone who fought against colorization of black & white classics (as cinema revisionism) seems unable to recognize his own revisionism, to one of the most significant collection of (sci-fi) movies ever created in the annuls of film.I'm glad to see so many others upset about this very issue.. but Lucas started a trend with other filmmakers (on DVD), which is a tragedy - to not see corrected in the era of Blu-Ray.I'm thankful that Blu-Ray has delivered to me, the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL versions of films like: Blade Runner / Close Encounters / Star Trek: TMP / Eyes Wide Shut / ...and I understand that the new Superman Box-set coming out is FINALLY going to have the ORIGINAL ""Superman: The Movie"" cut.HOWEVER... Up till now, I've still been DENIED on Blu-Ray the ORIGINAL versions of: Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"" / Milos Foreman's ""Amadeus"" / Russell Mulcahy's ""Highlander"" / Steven Spielberg's ""1941"" / Barry Levinson's ""The Natural"" / and I hear John Milius is putting together yet ANOTHER Director's cut of 1981's ""Conan the Barbarian""... Are we STILL NOT going to get the original theatrical version of that one as well???And what's up with that new extended version of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" - Don't tell me that's the director's original intended version.  I don't think Sergio Leone would approve of excised footage being put back into his classic - SINCE THE ORIGINAL AUDIO WAS MISSING, and had to be re-recorded by [God love them] Clint and Eli (and someone else sitting in for a deceased Lee Van Cleef)... which is soooo jarring considering that the [living] actors simply sound like a parody of themselves 40+ years later.

Literally.  I was 2 when ESB came out.  These movies have seeped.  And I got to say, I don't see the big deal about Lucas messing around with the originals.  If you don't like the special editions, or these new special special editions, then DON'T WATCH THEM.  You can still buy the originals on VHS for cheap on eBay.  If you're one of those people who like to whine that VHS doesn't count anymore and you absolutely must own everything on DVD, well...what will you do when the next thing replaces DVD??

But these changes didn't effect the story the slightest bit! Some of the hard-core fans seem to forget, that most of the changes were VISUAL and TECHNICAL, and what is wrong with that? ... Now it's 2004, and once again George Lucas has made improvements to the trilogy - and this time he has made them for the long awaited DVD release. ... Well, has he changed anything in the story? No. He has made no changes whatsoever! He has given the (faceless!) bounty hunter a new voice and Anakin Skywalker a new face - Hayden Christensen's face - at the end of ""Return Of The Jedi"". And the sound and picture quality has once again been digitally remastered.The above-mentioned hard-core fans have absolutely no reasons for their anger and disappointment. ""A New Hope"" hasn't changed, nor has ""The Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Return Of The Jedi""  - it's still the same trilogy. NOTHING in the story has been changed - absolutely nothing.

I just wanted to finally own some copies of the original movies, and this seemed like the most economic way to get all 3 on disc. The thing is horrible, and so unlike the original series I felt like I was watching another movie. The retouched HD/Blue Ray or whatever gives it a 'made for TV' look, and the special FX are awful. (Tauntauns running look like they were animated on South Park). The packaging is cheap and the presentation is hurried. Ugh. Just not worth another minute of my time.

Yes, after so many years, the original trilogy needed some cleaning up, but not a complete gutting. The fans who grew up watching them in the theater (and later on VHS) deserve to see the movies as they were originally shown. Having Greedo shoot first was one of the worst ideas in movies, EVER. It completely changes how Han Solo is portrayed, going from the cocky, arrogant, yet likeable scoundrel to an ""oops, my bad"" moment.The other changes are just as bad. Having Hayden's ghost at the end of RoTJ was unnecessary. All the pretty space explosions, unnessary also. As other people have clearly stated, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!

Let's all be honest...the new Star Wars movies (Attack of the Clones etc..) are okay, but if they did not have the Star Wars name attached to them, they would not even be worth a mention.  So, why do we have to see them interposed into the originals.  First, Boba Fett used to be cool, but his new voice (that of the gentleman in the new movies) is so distracting I found myself screaming in frustration....nothing, however, could top the replacement of the Anakin Skywalker's ghost at the end of Jedi by Hayden Christiansen (sp?)'s likeness.  It is an utter travesty.  If I were Luke Skywalker, and had just seen my Father die, and then seen this image, I would wonder who the heck this young dude was?  I think Mr. Lucas should remember that these films are for us,the fans..if he wants to experiment he should do it on his home copy, not on the copy that we all have to own.

I feel they are actually better in that way.  Id also like to note on the comment that the classical composers mozart, etc. didnt go back to improve their work.  Well, sorry to bust that reviewers bubble but those composers went through several incarnations of their masterpieces before arriving at what we all recognize today!!

George Lucas will remain one of my most despised directors of all time.There was a time when we all believed that George could do no wrong.  He had brought us one of the most incredible stories to ever play out on the big screen.  It had all the action, drama, suspense you could possibly want.  It brought out a whole generation of fanatics.  Star Wars brought a smile to a persons face just to think it.  Think about how many times you have seen the trilogy.  Did it ever get old?  Did you ever stop marveling at the sheer magnitude of it?  Did you ever stop loving it?Did you feel that same sense of joy and wonder watching the ""Special"" Edition?  Was anything lost with the new CGI?  Better yet... did you really feel that everything was right with the world once you saw that Han didn't shoot Greedo first?  Did you even care?Do you think George Lucas cares what you think/feel about ""his"" movies?  Short answer... No.  The man has said as much in his interviews.  He doesn't care what fans want.  He doesn't care that we made him his money.  He doesn't care that we like the originals more.  He doesn't care about anything except his precious money.For those of you who fall for his ""vision"" spiel.  Take a look at the latest two installments of the Star Wars universe.  That's his vision.  Aren't you glad he didn't have CGI available for the original trilogy?Write it down... In less than two years the original versions of the film WILL come out on DVD.  Lucas will say that it's for the fans, but don't believe him.  This is a ploy.  He knows that if he brings out the originals first people won't buy the ""Special"" Edition.  If he brings out the ""Special"" Edition first then people will jump on it for the love of the series.  Then he'll bring out the original because many of those same people will buy it again.Don't fall into his trap.  Wait... it will come.  I'm just glad that I have my originals on VHS still.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWMXF7FDATJC1	Bradley D. Percell	Everyone knows the characters and probably what happens in all three of these movies, and if you don't I guess you've been in a cave or in a coma.  These movies-Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of  the Jedi- are quite simply put, my absolute favorite movies of all time.  Don't automatically assume I'm some Sci-fi fanatic or weirdo either.  In  reality, I don't care for most sci-fi stuff.  I can't really put a finger  on one specific reason I love the Star Wars trilogy so much, but I think  one of the main reasons is it brings me back to my childhood in a lot of  ways.  I was nine when the first one came out and it was love at first  sight.  So many memorable scenes and characters.  Too many to mention here,  certainly.  Like most kids, I wanted to see the good guys win and win they  did.  Darth Vader is one of the most memorable screen villains of all time,  too.  He's not sleezy and sadistic like so many of the one-dimensional bad  guys you see today.  I hate to say too much about the movie because I  wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it(if there is anyone  out there who hasn't seen it!)  Let me just say that if you have  intentionally not watched this movie because you don't think you would like  the space stuff, just give it a try.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1PS4EZLXYMNPF	"BRADLEY R HUTSON ""hutsman"""	"As a lifelong fan of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trilogy (I was 5 when &quot;A New Hope&quot; hit theaters in 1977), I am greatly distressed that the original versions of the films will not be present on the upcoming DVD release. For the reviewer who was implying that those of us complaining about the originals not being included might be a bit dense, of course we all KNOW that the VHS video release in 1995 stated it would be the last time they would be released. However, let's be reasonable here. DVD was in the infancy of its' development at that time. Many of us would love the opportunity to have the original versions on this new and improved format that will last a lifetime, unlike VHS. Denying us that because of a statement that may have been made prematurely is simply not fair. And for those who say, &quot;so just burn your original VHS trilogy onto DVD's if you want them so badly&quot;, let's be honest here. That is NOTHING like having an official studio DVD release, and you know it! All of the VHS imperfections and fuzziness will still be present on such homemade discs. Now that I'm accustomed to viewing films on DVD, trying to watch a VHS tape today is a most painful experience, indeed. Aside from the convenience of being able to skip around to different sections of films instantly, the biggest joy of DVD is the unparalleled picture clarity and crispness. A homemade DVD transfer of the VHS original trilogy would be nothing more than a normal VHS version with chapter search that will not deteriorate any further than it already has. That's not exactly what we want, obviously. One could reasonably expect George Lucas to have a bit of compassion and make an exception to the 1995 ""one last time"" statement in this case, right? After all, it was his fans (a.k.a. ""Us"") supporting his efforts that made him what he is today. What better way to thank us for that than to provide what we want most: The original versions of the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy in crystal clear, re-mastered prints on studio DVD's that we can treasure forever?For the reviewers who've been knocking the prequels, let me address that for just a bit. Episodes I and II are fine films in their own right, and I'm not here to bash them in the slightest. I enjoyed them at the theater and own both of them on DVD, and will be one of the first ones in line to see Episode III next year. However, step back and let's be honest here. How hard is it to create this incredible universe we all love so much with a bunch of computers? Most of the acting is done around NOTHING, and the backgrounds, ships and enemies/aliens are added later. That is a far cry from the originals, folks. Every ship or vehicle you saw, every explosion, every alien and droid, every single THING that wowed you in the theater was an actual model, prop, actor in costume or puppet being filmed. Talk about a labor of love! Despite the limitations imposed by the time period of their creation, the originals are much more impressive to me than the prequels. I don't mind the &quot;special edition&quot; enhancements to the original films, and I don't lose any sleep over them as it sounds like some reviewers do. I just would have greatly enjoyed the OPTION of still being able to view the original versions on DVD too. I know from what I've read here that MANY fellow fans agree with me on that.George Lucas may feel like his original trilogy is an &quot;inferior, unfinished product&quot; that is not worthy to be seen anymore, but he is imposing his personal feelings on all of his fans who feel differently. I'm sure we all agree that he has absolutely NOTHING to be ashamed of with his original films. So what if they don't look as good as what can be produced today, and have a few visible imperfections? We don't mind that! I'm telling you, if some of those &quot;problems&quot; hadn't been pointed out to me by George Lucas himself in his VHS interviews, I would NEVER have noticed them. Mr. Lucas's original films are works of art that showcased special effects no one had ever accomplished before, and they looked pretty darn good to me. If you're reading this Mr. Lucas, I'm asking you nicely: PLEASE consider changing your mind about releasing the original versions on DVD! SO many of your loyal fans want this!Moving on, let's talk a bit about the &quot;Special Editions Only&quot; DVD box set that WILL be released next month. It has a nice lineup of commentaries for each film and there is a bonus disc containing a wealth of behind the scenes materials. Both of those features will be very nice touches and are too good to miss. However, the one thing I REALLY wanted (aside from the original versions of course) was a deleted scenes section. It could have included the &quot;Anchorhead&quot; scenes from &quot;A New Hope&quot;, the additional ""Wampa"" scenes in the rebel base from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and the &quot;Sandstorm&quot; scene from &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; I've seen still shots from these scenes and have read their dialogue, but it would be so much nicer to actually get to SEE and HEAR them. No dice, though.In summary, I give the DVD box set three stars. That is not because of problems with the material that IS included, but because of the content that IS NOT included that I feel should have been. Despite that, I have no intention of boycotting this DVD release. The special edition versions of the original trilogy on DVD will definitely be worth owning, especially at such a reasonable price level. Don't boycott the set just for what's missing. Remember, George Lucas doesn't need our money at this point. He already has all that he will ever need. Maybe instead of bad-mouthing him and claiming you're going to &quot;hurt him in his wallet&quot;, you should try the simple approach of politely appealing to him to provide you with what you want? If you refuse to buy this box set simply to try to &quot;punish&quot; him, in reality you're only punishing yourself.Ok, I'm coming down off the soapbox now.

People who grew up watching these films--multiple times--have screamed for George to release the originals with great picture quality.  For some reason: he refuses.George Lucas' comments over the years have led me to believe he sort of resents us.  It's perfectly alright to release the films as shown in theatres, only with a more vibrant picture.  But why the resistance?Simple: the original trilogy was not Lucas' vision.  He stated so in a press release.  What made him so much money is not what he really wanted.I have often stated that George Lucas owes his success to the Star Wars films because of the many forces pulling at his sleeve.  He was at constant war with the studio and other executives within, as to what the picture would be; and how it would look.  Because he made compromises in key places; because Lucas was not the last word, the trilogy became the success it became.  As he gained more control, the storyline began to decline.  The last film: ""Return of the Jedi"" was a subpar story, with great special effects.  Only the storyline concerning the emperor, Vader and Luke saved the film.The Ewoks basically being the primary force which destroyed the empire was simply ridiculous.  Oh yeah: the whole thing was a metaphor for Vietnam!  Lucas stated it plainly. Huh?  Yes: his movies showed us how a less advanced culture like the ewoks could take down the powerful empire.  Like the Viet Cong took down the USA.At that point, I was glad he was ending it; and I left hoping that was the end.  Decades later I knew what was coming.  And it was terrible.So buy this if you must; but George Lucas shan't receive another penny of my money--for various reasons.

Besides, I hear-tale that he was impressed and inspired by his Buddy's Indiana Jones boxed set.  But my personal theory is that he is running low on movie-making funds and he decided to release it early so he can pour more money into his next flop* erm I mean film.Now then, YES I HATE the new additions.  YES I will buy this set. I think mainly because I waited too darn long not to.  Besides, the most UNFORGIVEABLE thing that he has truly done...was the Greedo shooting first, thing.  You know it wasn't so much the 'shooting first'....except that the technique his team employed was ridiculously child-like.  It was more like an amateur, Macro-Media, Java, Flash, hack.  I mean, cutting out a still-frame and moving slightly looked unrealistic and just down-right hokey!  I can only dream that he's fixed this in this supposed new set.Now, as for the old glory films that were the trilogy, I am not worried that I shall never see them again for I have 2 options left to me.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3LQITX6AGGJNH	BrandonTron	"The blu-ray format really sharpens these movies up and brings out sharp details in the backgrounds that were never noticed before. They altered a few things from the last DVD set release. For example, they changed Boba Fett's voice to the same one as Django Fett, they made Vader yell ""nooo"" at the end of Return of the jedi, and they added some visual details that were not present from before. Overall the changes add more positives than negatives, and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesn't. I thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh, and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy. For those that don't like the changes, I think Disney will release the movies in original unaltered formats someday.

The special effects still hold up well today and the story is great.  Every single one of the characters are likeable.  There is really nothing i can say about this movie that hasn't been said before. 3 best parts 1. The gun fight that han solo gets in leaving the mos eisley spaceport 2. The battle of yavin 3. The whole Cantina scene. this my second favorite movie of the original trilogy.Empire Strikes Back: Meet more awesome characters, special effects have are even better. Story is even better than ""A New Hope"".  You get the new mind blowing planet of Bespin which is such a beautiful city that you won't see anything like it in another film.  3 best parts 1. The lightsaber duel between luke and vader 2. when han solo opens the door in bespin and shoots at vader and vader blocks it 3. the battle of hoth.

After all, they are HIS films.BUT they don't look as good as they could, especially the space fighting scenes. As I'm watching Episode 4 everything looked good until the Millenium Falcon makes it's escape from the Death Star.When Han and Luke start ripping into the four imperial TIE-fighters you can still clearly see matte boxing around the fighters.I don't understand how the ""boneheads"" at ILM could have missed this. What, were they so ""jonesing"" for Starbucks that they just said ""ah, screw it,we'll just release the ""ultimate edition"" in 2006, and all the Star Wars suckers (myself included) will shell out more bucks and buy it again. Shame on you Lucasfilm bastards for screwing the fans. Also, our friends (the matte boxes) pop up again in The Empire Strikes Back. Check the edges of the asteroids and you will see what I mean. It looks like they half-ass tried to erase them, but they are still visible.I truly just don't get it. Why clean up 98% of the film and not the whole damn thing. I haven't watched Return Of The Jedi yet, but I'm sure I can find this blatent neglect again. Overall, the films look pretty damn good, but these are not the be all, end all of this classic trilogy. Mark my words, there will be some kind of ""Ultimate Edition"" release after the theatrical release of Revenge Of The Sith, probably in time for Christmas 2005 or 2006. ILM is lame for this blatant oversight, and they are definitely not the best special effects house on the planet Earth any longer. John Gaeta and his crew (The Matrix trilogy) and WETA (Lord Of The Rings trilogy) have surpassed you guys. Any doubt? Then check out the grade B effects for Van Helsing and you'll see what I mean!

Lucas wanted to milk this as much as possible on the big screen. I saw it on the big screen in 1977 when I was 8, I saw it again in 1979 when it was  re-released. I saw it in 1981 when it was re-released again!That gives you  an indication about how extradordinary this film is.  People just kept  coming back for more.It was like a roller-coaster ride. You had to get back  on for more!It defined a generation.It was like the hula-hoop of the  1970s.2001:A Space Odyssey had changed the way audiences looked at Sci-Fi  as far as effects, and Star Wars had carried the torch lit by Stanley  Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  I can still remember that awesome  opening when the little blockade runner whizzes passed the screen and then  here comes the ultimate weapon of the EMPIRE----THE STAR DESTROYER!This was  a cinema experience of the 1970s that I can say I experienced as it was  happening for the first time. I am glad I got to exeprience this one on the  big screen for the first time in its virgin run in 1977!I have since seen  this one remastered for re-release in theatres, remastered digitally for  VHS, THX remastered for VHS, and finally THX remasterd in a Special Edition  format with CG scenes added and outtakes put back in(God, do I feel old!).	5.0	Best Sci Fi Ever!	2000-06-26	0	0	0

Johnson	We all knew that when they released the THX Star Wars Trilogy back in 1995 that that was the last time we'd see the original versions.  That release funded the restoration and changes made for the Special Edition.  So if you want to be purist, watch it in its original crummy quality on VHS, or be total geek and get the LaserDiscs if you want better video quality.  I for one am excited to see the special edition on DVD.  The changes and improvement relieve some of the hoakiness and cheapness of the theatrical versions.

Making changes (adding or cutting) is akin to blasphemy as far as I'm concerned. Furthermore, being of an age that allowed me to see 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' during their original theatrical release ('77-'83). I cringe at the thought of watching what Lucas has done.However with that said I have to admit the 'Star Wars' trilogy as it is still demands enough loyality and interest to persuade many to acccept them as offered. I'll await the release of the original versions scheduled for DVD release later this year.	4.0	"""Help You I Will""  ~  That Means You Mr. Lucas"	2006-06-13	7	5	2

In others, it disappoints.The Good: the Original Trilogy on DVD! And way better than the pirate copies I bought in China! The image quality cannot be beat: crisp, with vibrant colors. I watched it on just a standard TV, and I was still blown away. It was like seeing them for the first time. The bonus disk has a pretty good documentary on the making of all three films, as well as a good (but not exhaustive) selection of film and tv spots.The Bad: The documentary, while interesting, still seems thin, and doesn't go into a lot of detail. Even casual Star Wars fans (are there any left?) will know most ? Is there some ugly secret out there? Everyone seems to toe the company line in their statements. Also, it is overwhelmingly weighted towards the techno-geek aspects. Similarly, just as with the Prequel Trilogy DVDs, the commentaries on these films are a complete, soul-numbing waste of time. Carrie Fisher makes a polite appearance, and occasionally is allowed to say something interesting. Do we get Carrie relating humorous anecdotes? Once or twice. Does George tell us what was going through his mind in certain scenes? Nope. What about the changes he made, even from the Special Edition? Uh-uh. Do we get the sound guy droning endlessly about where every single sound came from? Yeah. WHO CARES! One or two of the most interesting sounds would have been great. Instead, during a changed scene, we get no explanation of the reasoning, only droning about sound and special effect shots. It's interesting to write this off to George's technophilia, but I also suspect that the man just doesn't feel like he owes anyone an explanation.  Honestly, worst commentaries I've ever heard for a set of movies where large numbers of people might conceivably listen to the commentary. Compare these to the commentaries on the Lord of the Rings DVDs, and sicken yourself.The Ugly: Sometimes the sound doesn't seem mixed right. Often, I can't hear the soundtrack because the sound effects are mixed too high. Frustrating. Obviously, the changes made require mention. Honestly, the only one that bothers me is the Han/Greedo Self-Defense travesty.  But purists will hate the inclusion of Hayden in ROTJ (it doesn't make sense, but is inoffensive), as well as the modification of the Emperor in ESB (this one I like).Bottom line: Lucas continues to chip away at his legacy, seemingly out of spite or some kind of self-destructive urge. Still, these are the best versions of the movies available. If you ever loved them, get them. Of course, if you don't like these version, just wait a year or two.

The new special effects I think will work when you see them, many people are complaining, but I think they will turn out nice. It is also a treat to have these on DVD and thats really cool. I also think that there will be more DVD editions of these film in the future. Lucusfilm and 20th Century Fox can make more money that way. I think that they will do what they did with each of the Alien movies (oh thats another great sci-fi series to check out!). Once ""Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith"" arrives on DVD and video Fox will release an Alien Quadriolgy type boxed set for these films. And also release them sepertly. This mega boxed set will include ""Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace"" regular and special edition, ""Star Wars: Episode II- Atteck of the Clones"" regular and special edition, ""Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith"" regular and special edition, ""Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope"" regular and special edition, ""Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back"" regular and special edition, and ""Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi"" regular and Special edition. The regular version would be the origional cut that was in the theater back in the 70s and 80s and nothing new added, and for the prequel films the origional version from the 90s and 00's. Now for the special editions, not the new movies from this set but the 1997 special editions, they are not on DVD either so they can also be included, as for the prequels they can just add deleted scenes since the effects are amazing already. Then add lots of features I know they have but just waiting for another addition to release them. So when you buy this boxed set and the ""Alien Quadtiolgy"" type boxed set you will have all three additions of the origional films. Then like the Alien films from the mega boxed set they were all released sepertly, as Collector's Editions, so then all 6 Star Wars films will be released under that title and everything is put to rest! Thats what I hope will happen but that might not be for years and years so i'll keep my fingers crossed!Other classic Sci-Fi films:""Alien"" Series""The Matrix"" Series""Star Trek Motion Picture"" Series""Back to the Future"" SeriesOh also when your out buying the Star Wars Boxed Set make sure to buy ""THX-1138"" Lucus first movie and it to is remastered and special effects special effects are also new so make sure to pick that up as well and its classic sci-fi so pick that up as well."	5.0	"""Star Wars"""	2004-09-18	3	2	1

What we now have is something that is created for the young padiwans of today. Mr. Lucas has obviously turned toward the ""dark side"" when making the desision to ""re-do"" the movies (or it was a massive brain fart).Those of you who like the ""newer versions"" so be it. But beware they are looking more and more like micheal jackson's face if you know what I mean. Pretty soon you won't want to look at it after all the changes.Those of us that would like to have those movies (that we saw way back when), are not whining but merely requesting to have them on DVD and see them again as they were.I still purchased the newer versions and did like them, but was disappointed some what because they were just not the same. I, II & III in my opinion were very good. It's understandable that you wanted IV, V & VI to look more in step with the newer technology movies but....I know this is grotesque but think of micheal jackson....it's the same feeling when I watch the revised versions.Mr. Lucas, how about putting the ""real originals"" out on DVD."	1.0	What was he thinking!	2005-07-22	9	8	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2B2QQ05PHVRKT	Brian Himes	While I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I have to give the thumbs up to Steven Spielberg for taking the high road when it comes to one of his best loved films: ET. While for a new generation and for gentler times Spielberg redid some parts of ET. However, when it came to releasing the film on DVD, Spielberg released the original version as well as the new version. For this, and this alone, Mr. Spielberg has risen in my estimation of a film maker with true integrity.Not so with Mr. Lucas. The versions of the Star Wars trilogy on DVD are not the original versions but tweaked versions of the 97 Special Editions. While some of the effects have been improved over the 97 counterparts, the overall effect is jarring. The picture quality is staggering and looks spectacular. The sound is even better, with the exception of the obvious errors in Star Wars (No I will not call it Episode IV: A New Hope).Against my better judgement I purchased this set, and I will enjoy it for the special features. The sad fact is that the REAL Star Wars Trilogy is still only available on VHS, Laser Disc and bootleg DVD. If you love the original versions, save yourself the money and don't buy this set. Instead, go to [...] and join the battle to get the original versions on DVD.	3.0	Spielberg: 1 Lucas: 0 (and counting)	2004-09-21	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AMH06JQ6EP5RT	Brian Jones	I have  seen so many complaints about the changes I had to speak out.  I love the newer versions and actually agree with how and why Mr. Lucas did what he did.  The sounds are wonderful, i have surround sound and it drives my neighbors crazy. The picture is much crisper and cleaner and just so easy to watch. The changes everyone complains about is so wasteful for such a great series.Of course its better to have a young Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi then the older man.  Through out the whole first series they mentioned how Anakin essentially died when he became Darth Vador. Even Obi-wan tells Luke that Vador killed his dad. So why would he be there one with the Force as an old man? Sure Luke saved him as an old man but his true jedi self died when he was young so it makes so much sense for the changeThe Greedo shot is the funniest arguement i heard so far.  in the original, Han Solo shots greedo(bounty hunter for Jabba). In the new version, Greddo shoots first but misses(at close point range) then Han shoots.  I agree with Lucas that kids as well as adults enjoy this movies and having Han(Our hero remember?) look like a murderer because he was in a bind is not a cool thing.There was also a inclusion of Naboo at the celebration in return of the Jedi which i loved.  Naboo played such an important role in parts 1,2,3 that it also deserves to be shown celebrating.There are a few other changes but none should take away from the story. I do have the orignal tapes that i will keep just to have but i will always watch the new versions. I even got my wife hooked on the series.  its a must buy!!p.s.  To all the fans that REALLY think they own a movie because they brought a ticket or some merchandise please relax.  It is HIS movie because we did not help fund it when he had his dream of a Star Wars.

Peppard	Well, let me start by saying that I, like many other people out there, am very puzzled as to why these movies have not been released on dvd yet. These movies are without a doubt my favorite of all time. I have been a long time fan of star wars since i was about 4 or 5 years old. I grew up with it and it is such a wonderful timeless story. I just wish that George Lucas would please put these out on dvd within the next couple of years. Especially, since episode I is now coming out on dvd. That looks to be one heck of a good dvd from what i've seen and heard so far. I will definitely buy it. From what i understand though, George's plans on bringing the original trilogy to dvd will not be until the first 3 episodes have been out in theaters and then on dvd. I got this information from dvdfile.com. He says that the original movies are vintage material and will take more work on dvd releases. What i wish he would do is go ahead and release the original trilogy in its original form(not special edition). They would not have to have any extra special features. If they were just the movie with a chapter selection that would be fine with me. Then, in 2005 or 2006, whenever all the movies have been out, re-release the original trilogy in the special edition along with the other 3 films in one big deluxe box set. Believe me, I would probably buy that also. I don't think that sounds like too much to ask. But, I know that Lucas is a perfectionist and doesn't like to do anything half-way. So, maybe it would be worth the wait until he releases them all together in one big jam packed set full of endless features. To wait for that though, is easier said than done. In any case, I anticipate the release of them to dvd, whenever that is, very much. I will continue to love these movies as years go by and will enjoy the next episodes in the series as well.	5.0	I hope these will be out on dvd soon...	2001-10-12	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2HA8DGJZFUGT2	Brian Lowery	"I wonder what George Lucas would say if Michael Curtiz and Howard Koch were still alive and decided, ""Let's redo the ending and have Bogart and Bergman end up together after all""? I think he would be appalled at the thought. That is how I feel at some of the changes made in the re-release of this trilogy. These are films that I grew up with. They are, in certain ways, a part of my culture.I don't have a problem with ALL of the changes made in this set. Hayden Christiansen replaces Sebastian Shaw? No problem. It is a natural part of continuity and does not affect the plot given the prequels. The new songs. Whatever! I didn't care for the songs from Jedi to begin with. Enhanced effects and explosions. Awesome! New voices for the stormtroopers and Boba Fett? Hmmm, I'll let that slide. But there are two things that I will neve forgive Lucas for, and they are...Greedo shooting first - May not seem like a big deal, but it is. It softens the character of Han Solo. When Han took the initiative and shot Greedo under that table, he established himself as a character that could conceivably go either way. He could be a bad guy or a good guy. He could be both. The character of Han Solo would never let ANYONE shoot first. He is a survivor, and he survives by being a rotten scoundrel. John Wayne never shot a guy in the back in one of his films. Clint Eastwood would do it in a heartbeat. Han Solo is Clint, not Duke.Jaba and Solo meet in the hanger - Another scene that softens both Han and Jaba. Are we supposed to believe that Jaba would let Solo go when he owes him so much money? And if so, why is he so hell-bent on hunting him down only a short time later? What changed his mind all of the sudden? The whole scene is weak and makes Jaba look inept and Han look like a blubbering wuss.Sorry George, but you destroyed my movie by going just a little bit too far. You can play with effects and do a few continuity shifts, but do NOT mess with my favorite characters because you want it to be more kid-friendly."	1.0	Two reasons why I will never own this set...	2005-05-28	63	49	14

Let's not get all huffy about the fact that it is the ""Special Editions"" and not the ""original"" editions. The incredible pettiness over this issue is a true testament to the incredible works of art the Star Wars films are. Especially the pettiness over the ""New Trilogy"". You will see reviews that scream ""WHY DOESN'T GEORGE LUCAS LISTEN TO THE FANS?!?!?!?!"". The answer is quite simple; the fans are not the artist, Gerorge Lucas IS. He makes these films with the hope that we enjoy the quality and scope of his amazing space fantasy. I believe you will enjoy the quality and scope of the epic tale of Star Wars: Episodes IV-VI. This is a story that has been told and re-told for over 25 years now. Only a REAL MASTERPIECE could endure for so long. Many critics cite these movies as breakthroughs in technological advancement in film. This is true, but it often overshadows the incredible story of a farmboy turned hero. It is a story that paralells many stories throughout time. A farmboy hero (Luke Skywalker), his trusty and loyal side-kicks (R2-D2 and C3PO), and old and wise wizard (Obi-wan Kenobi), a pirate (Han Solo) and his first mate (Chewbacca), a princess (Leia Organa), an evil henchman (Darth Vader), and of course the evil castle (The Death Star).

They special edition Star Wars movies were just as good as the original editions. So what if Greedo shoting first, so what if music from RTOJ was changed (buy the original edition soundtrack), and Luke did not scream while falling from Cloud City. He shouted &quot;NEVER!&quot; to Vader, like he'd rather die than turn to the darkside.I can see where some of the changes effected the film, but Lucas is an artist, this is his masterpiece, and he wanted to change what he wasn't proud of. I say this because I am a fellow artist and no matter how good other people may think of my work, I will often feel the need to change one or two things until the masterpiece meets to my expectation.P.S. George, I intend to own OT on DVD, but I am waiting until Episode III is done. Then I am hoping for a six-pack collectors edition.	5.0	S.P.E.D./O.E.D. It's all good!	2004-07-30	15	2	13
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GB1Q193DNFGR	Bruce Lee Pullen	&quot;May the Force Be With You Always&quot;Obi-One KenobiGeorge Lucas's unforgettable Star Wars is one of the most influential, mythically engaging, and highly enjoyable science fiction films of all time. Though it  can be said that Lucas borrowed cinematic ideas from Akira Kurosaka (Hidden  Fortress), Howard Hawks, and John Ford (The Searchers). Does Star Wars  really deserve to be called too simplistic or underserving of all it's  popularity? NO NO NO! , Star Wars is modern film myth that has engaged its  fans in its timeless tale for the last 23 years. What the Star Wars Haters  need to realize is that we the fans find this wonderful myth of good, evil,  fate, and destiny to be one of the most enlightening and blissful voyages  that the movies have ever given us. Star Wars is a tribute to the power and  expressiveness of the movies. What make Star Wars so superior to the  numerous clones that followed it is despite its magnificent special  effects, that defined a new age in Sci/Fi, the film's characters, mythos,  and epic story are what made Star Wars so universally accepted and beloved  around the world. Not only have the characters of Luke Skywalker, Darth  Vader, Han Solo, and R2D2 become permanent parts of movie culture. The  simple yet important moral that good will eventually overcome all evil no  matter the time, suffering, loss, or failure involved makes Star Wars the  modern equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. It tells it's tale simply and  elequently. It moves us with its images and people. It takes us to a time  and place that will never leave the boundries of our memory. Star Wars is  joy to behold, and anyone who feels otherwise is too stuck up to see the  beauty of a universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.

It was a cleaner, more polished version of his original smash hit.  It was still a good song, but something was missing.  It just didn't have the 'Feel' of the original.  Less sorrow, less ferocity.  Del Shannon felt his original 1961 version was too gritty, and he could catch a bigger audience if he just cleaned it up.  He was wrong.  By re-recording it, he had changed the song.  Purists, and fans of the golden era of Rock n Roll wouldn't go near the re-recorded version of 'Runaway'.This is how I feel about The Star Wars original trilogy.  The Special editions are altered versions of the originals.It is not the same series of classic films.

The CGI has added a enhanced atmosphere and has added greatly to the visuals of this trilogy. What I can't understand nor want to, is the fact that Lucas has changed parts of these movies for the WORSE ! There are at least five or six addtions/changes made from the original versions that make this trilogy embarrissing to watch. The one change I really do not understand is the end of ROTJ. Why did Lucas remove the fun and triumphant Ewok victory song for the lame and cold feeling classical peice. To me the end of the series is ruined by that change. When I have children that are old enough to watch these movies I am going to have to dig out the old VHS versions for them to watch. This trilogy IS NOT the Star Wars movies you know and love. This trilogy is a edited version of the orginal story and it is painfull to watch.

THESE ARE NOT THAT STORY. I have copies of the correct story on DVD and while I'd love to see it in HD, these aren't it. Cleaning up things here and there are fine. I LIKE the idea of better looking light sabers. I LIKE the idea of a cleaner looking picture. I'll ACCEPT the idea of cleaning up makeup lines as 60 inches of 1080p might bring to light some distracting makeup effects. What I won't pay for is changing the story I grew up with. Hans shoots first. We don't need Jabba in The New Hope. The original death star explosion was AMAZING.I recently purchased The Last Starfighter on Blu-ray and have watched it 5 times already. The picture is amazing! The story is the same and the effects still work. When it's a great story, it doesn't need to be changed.Yet this is the same director that raped Indiana Jones in the last movie, so I'm sad but not surprised.	2.0	Changing the story... changes the movie.

However, it would have been nice if some of the deleted scenes, like the approch to the ships in the sand storm in ROTJ were put back in.

To be able to replace them at an affordable price is of high priority importance.  This set is great for the next generation of Star Wars fans, and at a great price.If you are a classic lover, get the box sets with IV, V, VI on the bottom and Luke and Darth with clashing sabers.

On the evidence of today's viewing and the fabulous 2.5 hour main feature documentary this is a must have for any Star Wars fan.Just one complaint from me (hence not quite a 5 star - I'd have given it 4.95 if I could): by George's own admission and that of many others this is a 'space opera'. So why do DVD producers continue to almost complete ignore the composer of Star Wars and focus only on the librettist, production and techno-geeks (God bless 'em all!)?	4.0	Book your box at the Space Opera	2004-09-20	8	2	6

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	Well George Lucas edited the movies. I'm sure no director ever edits the movies and make them something other than what we saw at the theater. Come to think of it I can name you a great number of Director's Cuts. So why should this be different? Granted I too wish that they included both the original and modified versions. All I can say is that I'm ecstatic this is finally coming out on DVD. It is still the best Trilogy to me and it has tough competition with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Ring trilogies.I enjoy the new releases but the magic of the original three movies can't be beat. When I saw the original Star Wars at the theater in 1977 it was not Chapter IV A New Hope. It was just Star Wars. In fact I went to see it fourteen times. It was the best thing I had ever seen. I even bought all the Star Wars toys I could find even though I was an adult. Am I complaining about more movies or editing? No, quite the contrary. Why would I complain about Mr. Lucas making five more movies to carry on the saga? You can bet I have pre-ordered my set.You will not believe how crisp and sharp the picture and sound quality are in these movies. They did a magnificent job of transferring these to DVD. So many extras, where do I begin? Deleted scenes, cast interviews, bios, documentary, directors comments, and more. This set is so chocked full of goodies you will think it is Christmas. The documentary about what George Lucas went through to make these movies is incredible. His sacrifice has made millions happy. There is some interesting information on all the companies he helped form to make these movies possible.

I saw it Opening day, the second showing - I missed the first show because the line was too long, so I saw Cross of Iron first.I still have my &#34;May the Force Be With You&#34; button they passed out and would like a version of the movie that matches my experience EXACTLY.	3.0	"Pre-""Episode IV"" version would be nice"	2014-07-06	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3H6MU5GAI39J8	Canuck Cutter	The DVD's are alright.  Nothing amazing there.  The main thing is that it is nice to be able to watch the good Star Wars movies without worrying about the wear and tear on my copies (though it is somewhat disappointing to see that only the new edited versions are on the discs and not the originals as shown in theatres during the original release).  That is really about all it offers though in my opinion.  If you are a real die hard fan and can still watch the movies today then I would recommend picking up a copy.  If you're more of a lay fan then I would wait it out a few years and get the full box set of all six films (even though the last three likely aren't going to be quite worth owning).The extra disc is kind of nice.  Though for most die hard fans you have probably heard about or seen a lot of those materials on many web forums (not in their DVD form of course).  The demo for the Xbox is rather entertaining, but of course limited to those that actually own the Xbox.  The other main extras are of course the various commentaries.  If you find those interesting then maybe its worth the buy, if you tend to never bother with those, then again, perhaps wait for the full box set to come out later.Incase he ever reads these reviews again, to the fellow that was wondering why it took so long to release these onto DVD, all I have to comment is, try working in the industry for a while and you might understand.  Post production, marketing, business plans, etc., they take time (until you work in the industry you will not properly understand how long that can be sometimes).  Furthermore, the motivations of corporations/people may not always be clear to the masses.  Their is a method to the madness though (even if it seems like lunacy to most...and sometimes it is lunacy and companies go bankrupt...however I don't see that happening to Lucas Arts or ILM anytime in the near future).	4.0	Not without its charms	2004-09-07	1	1	0

"....OK, i'm not sure any review is going to dissuade or convince someone to buy this set...you're either gonna do it or not. But if you do you won't be dissapointed, Star Wars hold up well in my opinion, the story is the best of the three, great action, interesting characters (losing Alec Guiness hurt the series as a whole imo, he was in a way the heart of the film). 'Empire' has aged even better, and although i expected to be dissapointed by 'Jedi' it wasn't as bad as i remembered and is still head and shoulders over the last two ""pre-quels"". (although i still hate the whole 'cute' factor which came about with the furballs) The extras are worth checking out...once. But i'm docking a star for the tweaking Lucas has done on these films...STOP IT! Leave them alone!

These are the best movies ever and they've just been slightly changed to fit with the prequels better, which is fine with me.  I'm really getting tired of hearing people complain about how the movies have been changed from the originals.  You know that all 6 movies will be released together in about a year when episode III is put onto dvd, and maybe that set will include the original versions, who knows.  The best thing to do would have been to release dvds that allowed people to choose scenes they wanted, so if they wanted to see the movies the original way or with the new scenes, they could.  Everyone should just stop bashing this set already though, because the 3.5 star rating is making these movies look bad, while they are really the best ever.	5.0	Best DVD you can buy	2005-01-22	10	2	8

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2FTHCGH06O4Y5	Caraculiambro	When I was younger I was an ardent fan of Star Wars, and I was eagerly looking forward to finally owning the original trilogy on DVD.Yeah, it may have taken a while, but they have finally been released!When the set finally arrived in the mail, I couldn't wait:  I stirred myself a large glass of Kool-Aid and unwrapped the handsome box.  Unfortunately, in my excitement, I spilled the Kool-Aid all over the package and the DVD's -- and the couch.Now, not surprisingly, the stupid things do not run properly.  They skip and freeze, and at times will hardly play at all.My (former) friends have cautiously suggested that all this was largely my fault.  Nevertheless I am skeptical.  I cannot help but suspect that LucasArts had something to do with this.Why didn't they include Kool-Aid protection on the disks?  Why was there no warning about not handling Kool-Aid around the disks?  Why is it only now that I am learning of the effects of this otherwise innocuous beverage on their flimsy product?In fact, the more I think about it, the more I think it's possible that the disks in fact CAME SHIPPED with the Kool-Aid already on them, and that in my anger I'm just mixing things up.  But why LucasArts would ship their new Star Wars disks out all sticky and red is beyond me.  Perhaps to sell more?I don't know.  So all I can do is discourage you from buying it: the disks are coated in a mysterious red, sticky substance (God only knows where from) which seems to be impeding their proper operation.	2.0	the disks are red and sticky!	2005-03-07	39	9	30
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A11SPSEM08VIXX	"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that..."	Too many of you people...way too many of you people have grown so cynical and jaded that you can no longer see your own hand in front of your face. I am sick and tired of hearing such nitpicking on something that is just good clean fun. For crying out loud you people act as though you had just undergone botched surgery in a  Mexican prison. It's just a fun bunch of films that I had fun watching when I was 7, 10, and 13. It was fun to see them again and I am very thankful that George Lucas was able to contribute to myself discovering I should be an artist. I would tell you people to grow up but that would be a mistake. You have grown up too much and are far too critical. Watch the films with some 7 year olds and see if they talk and think as you do. I doubt it. I am ashamed to see what you have written about these films. It makes me sad.I have more to say...I have a theory that the harsh cynical critics. You know who you are. You actually still love these films, even in their slightly altered forms and you get as silly as a schoolgirl when you watch them. These feelings that are linked to youth embarrass you and you feel conflicted therefore you consciously or unconsciously criticize the films, nitpicking at everything, writing reviews, telling George that he is out of his mind. This is all so that you can still be a part of the discussion and still exist on the fringes of something that is important to you. Of course when I see films that I do not like or I see something from my youth that no longer interests me I just move on. You won't find some big hoopla, and long winded convoluted explanations about what is not exactly to my liking. It's Georges film and he can do what ever he wants. You want something different go make your own fool film. As far as sound quality goes I felt that all 3 sounded amazing. I am using a good Bose system with 5.1 sound. Perhaps your ears are damaged in one frequency or another. Perhaps your system sucks, or you have it hooked up wrong, or your rooms acoustics suck. Or your DVD player is broken. Or you just lost that part of childhood that let you enjoy these films without being so critical and that makes you mad and you don't know why so you blame the messenger rather than look long and hard at yourself.	5.0	The best time I have had with films in a long time.	2004-09-22	26	8	18

Why can't George use new technology to 'improve' the look and feel of the older movies?  In the original Star Wars(EP IV), did you really like watching a fake plastic globe blow up with sparklers? Sure the orginal effects are sentimental, and mark that ERA in my mind when I was 9-10 years old when I first saw Star Wars. Not being able to recognize the movie as I saw it when I was 9-10 years old, has some impact, but not as great as the enjoyment I get when I see things like the extended assault on the Death Star in ""A New Hope."" As our other fellow reviewer stated, ""It's great to see the X-wings soaring around at break-neck speed like we always knew they could, and we get marvelous new angles of the Death Star's variated surface.""The more important issues to me are the ""Han Shoots First"" and actually revising the movie.  Han wasn't always a good guy.  He was a smuggler that eventually 'came to the good side' at the end of EP IV... So revising the movie later makes no sense to me... As far as adding/improving/replacing the special effects: I miss some of the sentimental value of watching the older effects as a kid, but overall applaud that GEORGE LUCAS CARES about these movies and spends lots of money to 'improve' them.  He really doesn't have to do a lot of what he did, i.e., he is more concerned about telling his story than making more money.  I just wish the dialog in this movie was a little more involving!  I'm looking forward to purchasing this trilogy, however, I just hope episode III is more like episode V (The Empire Strikes Back).  Episode I and II were mediocre in my opinion.

Lucas takes advantage of the  situation and creates some extras and adds deleted scenes that were not in  the original movie.While adding a few seconds here and there, it  provides small changes, but do not add or subtract away from the story.  Star Wars is the greatest affected by the changes (even though Return of  the Jedi has a completely different ending) and Star Wars fans will eat it  up.The picture quality is excellent for a VHS tape and sound is very  good.  However, tape just doesn't have the &quot;sparkle&quot; of DVD, due  to it's lower resolution.  The colors will always look a little washed out  and grainy to the disc.  Also, the pre-movie stuff (interviews, behind the  scenes stuff) should be taken off or put on another tape.  Do I really want  to sit through 15 minutes of Lucas ranting and raving the second time I see  the tape?If you haven't gotten this series yet, now is ther perfect  time.  With Lucas' THX technology, this is a great tape and it's  WIDESCREEN!

If you don't watch the movies often(the older versions, ect), you won't notice anything. If you are a person that watches all 3 of the oringinal movies 1 once everyday, you will notice changes.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3CJNU5XK2329P	C. Balslev	Does this guy George Lucas know how to make his money? Yep, for  the fifth (or even more) time he releases his classic trilogy of the Star Wars saga.  The new edition contains the Special edition of all three movies. Besides  that it contains a 10 minute sneak preview of &quot;the making&quot; of the  upcoming film, Episode 2, which is the only selling argument from my point  of view. I will bet that Lucasfilm wants to earn as much money thay can on  these movies they can', before the costumors demands a version of the  movies on DVD. And I believe the DVD versions are only a few month away.  But for the die hard fan this re - re - re -re -re release is a must. The  movies comes with a totally new cover in pan scan and widescreen.  George... we want these movies on DVD, not on VHS.  I give this re-release  five stars, because VHS is what it is. If this had been the DVD release,  and the movies only contained this. I wouldt rave rated it 1 star. The  audience is listening.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ASD4MM5R8RPBI	Cbarbee	I got this box set knowing that the dvd was non-anamorphic, But fortunately, If you're watching this on a computer or an HDMI TV, then you could zoom in to a better format (though the subtitles would be cut off). I also knew that it was a bonus feature.  Other than those drawbacks/nitpicks, this is a satisfying box set. It DOES have the original versions of the trilogy despite it's controversial format. I DO agree that the original trilogy should be in an updated format, but if you can cope with or solve (via zooming aspect ratio) the format, you will be satisfied with this box set.	4.0	Return of the Unaltered Trilogy	2011-12-25	3	2	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1ER8FS19S0XY5	C.B. Derrick	As a kid of 6 when this movie first hit the movie palace, I was taken aback - and still am when I think of the memories that were spawned from this film and the two original sequels. Over the years, I returned to see this film time and time again -- marveling at it's ability to still captivate after so many viewings and so many years; not to mention its impact of pop culture, filmmaking and merchandising.Star Wars became more than a movie phenomenon, it became part of the public trust. However, when George Lucas decided to return to his so-called well of imagination for the notoriously divisive and no doubt reprehensible Phantom Menance, he forever marred the earlier works - completely. One truly can no longer appreciate the original three films, because of the near butchery of the magic done by Episode I. I'll even wager that the Episode II: Attack of the Clones does more to denigrate the Star Wars trilogy.And let's not forget the incessant tampering that Lucas has continued to do with the original trilogy when he re-released them back in 1997. I'm so glad that I have the THX laserdisc boxed-set, so I can see these films as they were first introduced to the public, not some retooled pieces of digital wizardry that they have become. Can anyone truly justify (with a straight face) the re-edit that has Greedo shoot at Han first? Or how thoroughly ananchronistic the CGI Jabba appears? There is even rumor that Episodes IV-VI will be rejiggered again when they finally appear on DVD.If one doesn't leave a work alone can the subjective rating of that work remain constant? One could argue the continual tampering lessens the overall quality of the original.Star Wars circa 1996 was a classic film, now... I don't know what it is, perhaps the continual workings of an obivously misdubbed, misguided and spent creative spirit.	3.0	It's Quality is In Doubt	2002-02-25	6	3	3

Overall the movies are great, the remastered versions are visually spectacular.Unlike some reviewers here I did see the orginals in the theaters and I for one miss them.The added scenes and music I find distracting, they are easy to spot, I believe that one that has not seen the orginals could spot the changes, to me thats not good. Lucas it seems has tried to make parts of the movies more child friendly, example the music in Return of the Jedi and the addition of background singers with a comic flare.I would not hesitate to trade this set in for a set of the orginals, they are the true classics.	3.0	Is new better?	2004-09-24	17	11	6

As for the change of Anakins in Jedi, listen to Lucas' commentary on that scene before you start complaining. Besides, no matter how much you whine and throw a hissy fit over the changes Lucas makes to HIS MOVIES (I feel I have to emphasize that) he won't listen. These are the versions he wants to make available. He wants to tie these in with his prequels. If you want the original versions, go buy one of the many bootlegged laser discs turned DVDs of them.

The reason (I believe) Han shoots first is to show kids that it was in self defence, and that it's wrong for a good guy to shoot first and kill them if not in self defence.The Jabba scene in ANH is WAY out of place. For one the ROTJ Jabba is far bigger, and remember when Luke said the Falcon was a piece of junk? Well now that we have viewed the Falcon before this scene, it won't have the same impact. There are many other stupid changes in ANH (Like when Han chases the Storm Troppers they go into a dead end, or well, they did, when they see hundreds of other Storm Troopers doing something.)The Empire Strikes Back - despite being the worst of the original trilogy, has the less editing in it. The only parts that made me mad is taking out the ""You're lucky you dont taste good R2"" quote and the dialogue changed in the Vader/Emperor discussion. Other than that the changes were good.The ROTJ has the worse editing done. The Jabba the Hut music scene - I won't even acknolwedge it's DVD existence. And you all here about Hayden appearing as a ghost at the end and the crappy little shop of horrors sarlacc pit, so I am going to stop rambling on.Think about it, if one day Paul McCartney decided he did not like John Lennon's voice and decided to redub them all and destroyed all John Lennon (singing) CD's from existence, there would be a riot.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AK091BFCPVBY9	ceeb	"Made obvious by other reviews here, a fragile piece of childhood nostalgia has been utterly disregarded and destroyed by the creator that bestowed it.Frankly, I lost all hope (pun intended) after Return of the Jedi, so there wasn't much to live up to with this DVD release, my youthful excitement and admiration wholly betrayed by the time ROTJ's end credits rolled back in '83. It was clear by then that Lucas had lost his center and had become an pusillanimous, arrogant megalomaniac, which he holds fast to this day. This is the same guy that made THX-1138 and American Graffiti? George, we hardly knew ye.Let's consider a few points:1. Star Wars (one of the worst movie titles ever, by the way; makes Star Trek sound like a William Faulkner title) was a landmark for its time. It hasn't held up very well over the years (nice 70s haircut there, Luke), but should be left alone and appreciated for its time and place, and for restoring the fun and mythology of old cinematic Republic Pictures-style serial storytelling during such a lost and cynical decade.George's claims that he didn't have the technology back then to ""make the films he wanted"" makes absolutely zero sense when considering his ""new and improved"" changes for the money-grabbing theatrical '99 re-release and this so-called official DVD version. For example, if he wanted to emasculate Solo, ruin his character arc, and have Greedo to shoot first (and miss at close range, amazingly) all along, he would have filmed it that way in '77. No special effects required, no CGI needed. Just two guys with prop guns in the middle of a soundstage. Why didn't he? Because Lucas hadn't yet lost his noggin to empty adulation, fame, and fortune, or felt compelled to pander to children as he perceived them (give them more credit than that, please). I'm just glad I secured my DVD copy of American Graffiti before Lucas decides he was too harsh on Terry the Toad and edits out Steve's car getting stolen.2. The Empire Strikes Back, easily the superior film of the entire series--I won't even qualify the two recent stunningly bad efforts--beautifully combined pathos, darkness, high adventure, mystery, mythology, classic battle sequences, and real character development; they even (barely) pulled off disguising Sesame Street's Grover as a gnarled little condescending Leprechaun-mongoloid Jedi master (wax on, wax off). And Leia is Luke's sister? Whoee! Holy make-it-up-as-you-go-along, George! But OK, we'll go with it, incestual implications aside. But you better justify this later (which he never did).Glaring story problems notwithstanding, let's now remind ourselves that ol' Geo didn't actually direct ESB--it was helmed by Irv Kirshner. I wonder how Irv feels about Lucas tinkering with his movie. Hm.3. Onto Return of the Jedi, where it all went horribly wrong and Madison Avenue took over. I could write ad nauseum (if I haven't already) about the ridiculous plot, character, and stylistic decisions, but I'll only touch on a few unfortunate standouts for those with short attention spans, including myself. Apparently Geo decided to alienate the relatively sophisticated audience of Empire and pander to the lunchpail and paint-by-numbers crowd with Jedi. Let's see... Crack elite stormtroopers with sophisticated miltary weaponry and tactics being thwarted by spear-wielding teddy bears? Nice. (By the way, in the original version, they were supposed to be Wookies. Thanks for your input, Mr. Spielberg.) Vader, arguably the best sci-fi villain ever conceived this side of Ridley's Alien, is reduced a blubbering sap who looks like the bastard brother of Archie Bunker, while David Prowse gets the shaft over an ego rift. How about finally seeing Jabba the Hut? Oy. Pizza-the-Hut in ""Spaceballs"" was more menacing, not to mention more interesting. Then there is the ludicrous Emperor-fights-Skywalker outro, where the ol' wizard can't even get his lightning fingers to close the deal. This guy is the personification of the dark side of the Force? Get this geezer some Viagra. ""Now I'm REALLY going to kill you, Luke! Really, this time, I'm not fooling!. Okay, so I was joking. But this time, I'm not! Take that! No? Ah, this eleventh jolt should work... Darn. Hold a second, don't move..."" Yawn. And Vader, whose pure evil up until this point would make Asmodeus blush, suddenly sees the light, has an epiphany in 22 seconds, and turns into Albert Schweitzer? Total character and audience betrayal.The rest is history, and it's not worth mentioning.So give it up fanboys and fangirls, save your money or Xmas gift slot and turn your wistful gaze to Mr. Jackson if you want fantasy filmmaking integrity. He's the real New Hope. Despite it's flaws, Lord of the Rings should make George Lucas eat his heart out, if it hasn't shrunken too small to suffice as at least a dry hors d'oeurve.Go away, George.

Also, like many others, I've been disappointed with director George Lucas' seemingly constant tweaking of the content of these classic films. When the trilogy was re-released in 1997, my friends and I went to see it for the experience of watching these iconic films in a theater again, not so much to see what new tricks Lucas came up with in his California lab.So to hear he has made more changes to these movies does not impress me. Still, this is the Star Wars trilogy, the films I saw as a pre-teen that, it's not going too far to say, blew my mind and set a very high bar as far as what science-fiction in motion pictures could be. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the three, maybe the best middle chapter in any film trilogy. While this project has always been intended as a money-making machine, you can really smell the commercialism encroaching in the third installment, ""Return of the Jedi,"" with its kid-friendly Ewoks. Still, these three movies are a monument to filmmaking, and it's nice to finally have them in DVD format.In my opinion, ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" are terrible movies, especially compared to what went before. The seamless interaction between man, alien, and machine that made the first trilogy so magical is lost, and the actors just don't have the rapport that gave a dose of humanity to all the special effects the first time around. If I had Lucas' ear, ""let someone else direct"" would be my advice. Lucas seems determined to make sure everyone knows that he's captain of his ship, though, so I doubt the third movie will be any better. So, George, you created a masterpiece, finally made it available for sale on DVD, and I've bought it.

Unless you are related to George Lucas, stole a copy, downloaded an illegal version, I doubt that you have actually seen what this DVD special edition will have.  Get a life, and a clue!  According to Lucas's interview, these DVDs are intended to be his true vision of how he wanted to make the movies.  He had neither the finance nor technology to make the movies as he had them in his head some 25 yrs ago.  If he did, not only would he have told the stories in the manor he did, but he would also have had the special effects ""tweaked"", as one of you put it, exactly how he wanted.  Get a life, and give it a rest.  Wait until the movies come out next month, then cry and complain all you want.  Until then, chillout!  You have NO idea what is going on in his head, neither do I.  What he did was amazing all those years ago with the 3 movies, especially Star Wars, considering what was available to him at the time.  If he could do now what he could have done back then, he would have.  Just because he is adding these new ""gimics"" as others of you have said, does not mean it should take away from the story.  It merely adds to what is already an incredible story and movie.  To that end, I think its about time he got around the releasing these on DVD, they all great movies should be viewed.  For those of you thinking Lucas has no sole, think about what he is trying to do with these ""new"" movies.  The story will still be there, but now it will be told an even better way.

In 1977 a 6 y.o.'s imagination was fired up in a way that nothing before or since equaled - without any of the vaunted effects or scene butcherings that Mr. Lucas now thinks are so integral to the film that he wants nothing to do with them. For Lucas to say that it's too expensive, too much trouble, and something he's completely uninterested in to remaster the handful of scenes it would take to give the *fans* what they want is the heighth of creative death. He no more understands why he has the money to masturbate with than he understands why the Greedo scene isn't just one scene but an entire character's butchering.All it would take is releasing a 8 DVD set with both the ""director's cut"" and the theatrical release to make *everyone* happy, and even make Mr. Lucas more money than he already has.I only hope my VHS tapes hold out long enough for my infant daughter to see, because whatever Mr. Lucas thinks he's doing for the kids, isn't."	1.0	Things like this don't give me much hope for Ep III	2004-09-18	7	4	3

I only bought this version because it contained the original, unaltered movies as well as the newly bastardized versions. Well, the unaltered versions aren't remastered at all, they're straight transfers of the Laserdiscs. Which is extremely low quality. If you have a 16x9 TV you'll have to use the zoom feature to fill the screen, just like with a laserdisc, and the subtitles for Greedo and the other characters are BELOW the 16x9 viewing area, in the black bar that would normally be on the bottom of the screen when watching on a 4x3 standard tv set.This is not what I paid $60 for.	2.0	Only reason to buy is the original unaltered versions.. which are poor quality.	2010-12-08	8	5	3

The only issue I have with this version is the inclusion of the new scenes that George Lucas added in the 90's.  They have a tendency to ruin the aesthetic of the movie for me, as I find myself pointing out which scenes are clearly CGI'd and which are the original backgrounds/sets.  They should have included an option to watch the film without those additions.However, these are still classic movies, and anyone with a nice television who enjoys (or hasn't seen) Star Wars will enjoy these BluRay copies!	5.0	Great Great Version	2014-01-24	2	1	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2QF4KLJCYZPEA	Charlie	I would have to say that Star Wars has one of those fan bases that will stay strong na matter what. It's in the top five there with Raider fans(who still DRESS UP and then walk in public to see their team CRUSHED by their RIVALS) and Star Trek fans. But you have to wonder, why all this animosity towards Lucas? Lucas is living a filmaker's dream. He's taking a movie which he had a hard time making not being able to do everything he wanted and now with his own studio can do them the he wants. And he listens to fans and tries his best to please them without letting them run over him, unlike some companies i.e. Marvel Comics who doesn't allow their characters to be used in The Sims game. I say, if he wants to tweak the movie, good for him. Let him do it and lets enjoy it. The changes he made aren't bad, they don't do anything to hurt the movies original quality. I believe if Star Wars opened today, it could still be a top box office hit and finally bump Titanic off the top. Besides, all you guys who have the original on VHS, just think how valuable those will be in a few years from now. Sounds good, huh? So all in all, Lucas is living a dream and supporting his fans and you guys and simply biting the hand that feeds you. You should be ashamed.	5.0	A Filmaker's Dream	2005-02-04	14	5	9

Even you hardcore fans that hate the added features must admit that. I remember back in the 80's when I was watching Star Wars on VHS how grainy it all seemed at some parts. For the most part I hated the added special effects, well I hated them all except one. Let's face it, the added scene in Jabba's palace with the aliens singing Tina Turner type songs was not only unnecessary, but downright retarded. That one, more than any other really p*ssed me off. But the one scene that I really didn't mind was at the end of Return of the Jedi, when they showed the celebration carrying on through the rest of the galaxy as opposed to just on Endor. However, I didn't approve of the addition of Hayden Christenson as the image of Anakin next to Obi Wan and Yoda.

But that is probably my memory as well as the fact that the movies appraently have been changed somewhat in the many years since I last saw it. Th eonly reason I'm getting them now is because my daughter asked to see them and we can't find them to rent anywhere.We had great difficulty playing disc 1 (Episode IV) on our Samsung BD-P3600 player. The Blu-Ray player is current on firmware and was purchased in early 2009. It is a Profile 2.0 (BD-Live) capable player with 1GB of internal storage, which means it meets the highest available specification of the Blu-Ray standard.What I found was that we had to disconnect out Blu-Ray player from the Internet so that it would play. Even then it was a struggle.When connected to the Internet, the Blu-ray player would simply, after a lengthy pause of performing some operations on the disc, announce that the disc was invalid and could not be played.When disconnected from the Internet, I once got a message that my firmware was outdated. Another attempt I got a directory listing of files/folders on the disc.  Then a few times I finally managed to get the disc to load (after an even lengthier interval) and we could play the movie. Even then, once we had no sound, once we could not fast forward without the movie breaking up and becoming choppy.Another annoying ""feature"" of the player/disc combination involves a memory of where we stopped the disc even when we remove and re-insert the disc into the player.We had none of these issues with disc 2 (Episode V) of the set. Nor with any other Blu-Ray discs we play. I have come across mention on Samsung forums that there are other titles that exhibit the same annoying issues.

The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ...I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.Question: Why did you change your mind and decide to put the original three movies out on DVD now?GEORGE LUCAS: Just because the market has shifted so dramatically. A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now. So rather than just sit by and watch the whole thing fall apart, better to bring it out early and get it over with.Question: Do you pay much attention to fan reactions to your choices?LUCAS: Not really. The movies are what the movies are. ... The thing about science-fiction fans and ""Star Wars"" fans is they're very independent-thinking people. They all think outside the box, but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen, and they think it should be their way. Which is fine, except I'm making the movies, so I should have it my way.__________________________________________(...)so what we have to do now is just rent it or buy a pirate copy (the package is even cheap,why did they not copy the design package of the LOTR extended edition?) When you watch the series, and when those changes comes, cover your eyes and go on!the only good thing is that the canges is only 5% of the whole trilogy, so 95% is the original version so it's worth to watch it, even if it's rented o piracy...star wars series were a good mopvie and one of the best trilogy of all time, but those changes lucas made, and watching the prequels, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is far, far away the best trilogy of all time...and return of the king the best picture of all time, only behind the God Father part 1...Thanks GEORGE LUCAS for spoiled one of the most exciting experience i ever lived, and Gollumn really kick lucas ass for that stupid jar jar binks.........."	3.0	Lucas is never going to release the original version on DVD!	2004-09-28	1	0	1

"If you want to talk about visual quality - and that's one of the big reasons to buy a DVD version of a movie even if you have a VHS copy - then this is superb, deserving 5 stars.  You will notice that the colors are much more saturated and, it seems to me, color has been added in some scenes.  I never found it to detract from the movie, it was always an improvement.  Two scenes I like to point out are both in ESB:1) Training with YodaThe whole environment looks much more earthy and alive with vivid hues of brown and green everywhere.  Even R2D2 looks noticeably different, almost organic as if he is molding-over in the soggy environment.2) The carbonite roomIn the original film and subsequent VHS releases, the colors in that scene are really saturated and the lighting is low, making VHS versions appear to bleed color between areas.  Here the DVD really shines as the colors are even more saturated and do not bleed at all.So why just 4 out of 5?  I wasn't blown away by the audio.  Heck, this is from Lucas - the guy founded the company that owns and licenses THX.  Naturally I was expecting really (...) audio.  But, alas, it was only ""okay"".  I have a mid-range 6.1 surround sound setup, and it's correctly tuned for my living room.  I was expecting to be surrounded by sound - something that doesn't always happen with surround sound encoded movies.  I mean, often it seems that the surround channels are only used for the occasional directional audio effect.  I was expecting to hear tie-fighters, xwings and the Falcon swirling around me, but that really wasn't the case.  It may not be fair for me to knock it down to 4 just cuz I expected crazy-good audio for no reason other than my own imagination, but hey, that's how I feel about it, reasonable or not.Anyway, I still think the DVD is worth owning."	4.0	Content changes aside, visual improvement is worth the cost	2004-10-02	3	1	2

Star Wars came out of the blue and blew us all away.At first, Han's attitude and behavior make it clear that he doesn't care who hires him - Rebel or Imperial - and that he can't be bothered with trivial details like politics. He's in it for the money alone. Imagine what ""Fistful Of Dollars"" would be like if someone went back and added CGI patrons to this dry, dusty deserted little town, turning it into a bustling metropolis. Imagine added scenes of Eastwood's ""Joe"" sitting at the bar drinking a wine cooler or something healthy, agonizing over how he's just going to ""do the right thing"" and how he's not in it for the money. In one moment, that's what Lucas did with Mos Eisley and Han's character. Remember what Kenobi said on the ridge overlooking Mos Eisley: ""You will not find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."" Scum and villainy in the special edition looks more like Keystone Kops and Three Stooges humor.Han's firing first is one of the best actions to describe a person's character that you could find. Han IS A BAD GUY. His attitude says it all: Don't bother him with any troubles or cause. Just show him the money. It is only the course of events that bring him around. The character grows and improves through the story. Believe it or not (especially in the current U.S. political climate) but seeing your mistakes and correcting them shows good moral character.And let's talk about that shot from a technical standpoint. As per interviews and such that came out just before and just after Star Wars was released, including Starlog #7, Greedo's gun was never made to be fired. The guns had strobe lights in the muzzles. The actor would pull the trigger and the light would flash. This would tell the FX crew where to start when drawing the beam. Greedo's gun did not have a strobe light. Lucas NEVER intended for that gun to be fired. And let's look at the position: Greedo's hand was solidly braced, resting on the table with the muzzle pointed at Solo's breastbone, at a range of less than three feet. Had Greedo closed his eyes first and an earthquake hit Mos Eisley at that moment, he still could not have missed. The beam emerged (without the tell-tale flash of every other blaster) and went up and to the right at an angle different from the orientation of the gun - and it's a major difference, something like 30 or 40 degrees. It clearly didn't come from that gun.Solo's conversation with Jabba was completely redundant. Every topic had already been covered with Greedo. According to an interview with Lucas in Starlog #7, he shot both scenes, hated the performance of the actor that played Jabba and realized that both conversations were almost exactly the same, and decided to cut out the scene with Jabba. Despite any Orwellian statements to the contrary, Lucas himself never intended for anyone to see the Jabba scene. He never intended for Jabba to be a giant animated slug. If he had, he wouldn't have spent budget on costuming a guy no one would actually see, and the camera would have been planted and immoveable instead of following Han around the bay. (FX techniques at the time weren't sophisticated enough to handle animation and camera movement at the same time. That's why battle scenes in Empire EITHER zoom along with snow speeders OR show walkers walking - NOT BOTH. Empire was made years after Star Wars - and they still couldn't do it.)The added CGI stuff in Bespin is pretty, but distracting. The same goes for the skycar chase in Clones. There's so much background movement going on that the story-related action gets lost in the jumble. I'm glad Lucas had more money than God, but he should have spent it on the writing and not the pretty pictures.Return (which WAS originally and officially titled ""Revenge of the Jedi"" - I've seen a 20th Century Fox official poster) wasn't so much part 3 as it was a combination of a 2h20m Kenner Toy commercial and ""I changed my mind about the story in Star Wars, and I want a do-over."" So, in a sense, we're still waiting for part three of the original trilogy. BTW: Star Wars was NEVER originally going to be episode 4 of 9 - excuse me - 4 of 6. Originally, Lucas KNEW that it was going to flop and he hoped it would be a cult classic.The biggest problem with the new trilogy - other than more time, effort, and money being spent on visuals than story; being written for 10-year-olds; and being a trilogy-long toy commercial - is that the whole thing is based on a lie. Darth Vader is NOT Luke's father. Darth Vader KILLED Luke's father. I know this. I've seen the movie and can quote the line; although, I'm sure there will be yet another special edition release when Lucas changes that and claims that the other ""never happened.""Here's how that section of Return should have played out (IMHO): Luke returns to Dagobah and confronts Yoda and the ghost of Ben. They explain to him that while he could feel the Force, he still couldn't control it. Vader used that to plant the idea in his mind, planted so deep that now Luke firmly believes that Vader is his father, even though it's not true. At the end, we see that the light side of the Force is indeed stronger than even the strongest of the dark side when Luke resists the taunts, regains his calm even under torture and defeats Vader and the emperor.The new trilogy should have gone into the friendship between Anakin and Obi-wan, the introduction of a new young Jedi named Darth Vader (""Darth"" being his name, not his title), the turning of Darth, the Clone Wars, and finally, Darth betraying the Jedi Order, killing Anakin, and helping to bring the emperor to power.And I'm sorry, but the line about something being true only from a certain point of view didn't work in Return. It didn't work when Clinton used it in front of the Grand Jury. And it still doesn't work in the new trilogy. Every time a character says it, it reminds us how Lucas just threw away the story when he decided to make Return.I'll buy the original theatrical releases on DVD, but not this.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1ACSZWF69L411	Chris Griswold	This release is of the re-edited version Lucas put out in 1997, incorporating new, more cartoony elements that ruin the atmosphere of the original films. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They appear to have continued work on these films, creating even more footage to be wedged into the films, including adding a shot of the prequels' Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen, into the end of Return of the Jedi. You can easily find this shot online if you look for it. It's upsetting. It's a bait and switch: this isn't the movie anyone grew up with. George Lucas doesn't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, and his films and his fans are suffering for it. Don't buy this now; wait until they release the original editions on DVD, which they most definitely will.	1.0	Bait and Switch: wait for the original version on DVD	2004-05-19	16	12	4

Yes, the original trilogy was good, but these enhancements make it even better. Don't listen to these people saying that they ""Ruined it"" by making some delightful new additions, they simply don't want to accept the possibility of changes. Those people truly are the Star Wars nerds who keep on complaining that the camera sifted 5 milli-meters from the right from the original trilogy. In short Lucas has done what many only dream of doing. Lastly, for those of you who hate George for what he has done, get over it, its his movie."	5.0	the true star wars	2005-05-23	21	9	12

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"In December of 2005, in conjunction with the release of ""King Kong,"" Peter Jackson released a two-disc DVD set on nothing but the film's production. Over three and a half hours of behind the scenes footage was presented, chronicling everything from set design to special effects and everything in between. Packaged with the discs were four production art prints and a fifty-two page booklet, which contained many on- and off-set photos.Wow. A two-disc set of production footage. This alone is proof that Jackson is a director who knows how to cater to his fans.George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Peter Jackson. For his ""Star Wars Trilogy"" DVD boxed set, Lucas apparently decided against going the extra mile in terms of special features. This is a real shame, not only because they're such classic films, but also because this is their first release on the DVD format.Nearly everything about this disappointing set is minimalist. Each film is given only one disc without any special features; all of those are reserved for a fourth disc, one that really doesn't go very far. The best we're given is a two and a half hour documentary on all three films, entitled ""Empire of Dreams."" Two and a half hours may seem like a decent length of time, but because it covers the entire trilogy, it was forced to simplify each of the films' productions into general, nonspecific analyses. It would have been better to devote a two and a half hour documentary to each film individually. Everything would be much more in depth and satisfying.Of course, there are a host of other special features that were neglected. For one, only a handful of the Trilogy's many trailers were included. Furthermore, virtually no artwork is presented, and promotional material is sparse at best. Storyboards and test footage are nowhere to be found. (Wouldn't watching the original animatics be awesome, especially for the battle scenes?) And what about deleted scenes? Any ""Star Wars"" fan knows of Luke's conversation with Biggs on Tatooine in the first film or of the moment when C-3PO tears away the ""Do Not Enter"" sticker from a door in the second film. Shouldn't we be allowed to view these moments in digital clarity? It's a side of ""Star Wars"" history that so few have had the chance to see.One of the biggest issues surrounding this set is the fact that only the digitally enhanced Special Edition versions are included (which, interestingly, have had more reworking since 1997). Lucas has remained quite adamant about this, claiming that the Special Editions represent what he wanted to see in the films originally. He's also said that the original versions will never again be released. As we all know, many fans are outraged about this; for them, only the unaltered Original Release versions are acceptable. I, for one, don't have a problem with the Special Editions. They are what they are, and in my opinion, they work just as well as the Original Releases. That being said, I still feel that Lucas was a fool to not release the original versions. He may not agree with the way the films were presented back in 1977, 1980, and 1983, but they are still a part of cinematic history. Denying them release is akin to denying the past.I'm sure Lucas will never change his mind about this. But in the off chance he opens to suggestions, then mine would be to include BOTH versions of the films on the same set. That way, everyone comes away happy: Lucas gets his Special Editions released and fans are finally allowed to choose which version they'd prefer to see. Many DVD sets offer this option, anyway (such as the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" set, another great example of catering to fans). It's puzzling why Lucas would be so blind to such a win/win scenario.Imagine someone trying to fill an empty swimming pool with a mere glassful of water. That's the way I see the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" DVD set. I suppose it would be fine for those who prefer DVDs without bonus material (and some do). But for the rest (and the majority) of us, this is not enough. I want to know everything about these incredible films, all the ins and outs, all the highs and lows. I want to see the details and hear the ideas that went into each film, even the ones that were rejected or changed. I want to see photos of set construction and footage of original interviews from the 1970s and '80s. I want to watch all the screen tests. I'd like to be able to read the first drafts of the scripts. I want to see model construction and hear some explanations as to their design.In short, I want more.If I were to describe the ideal DVD set for the ""Star Wars"" saga, it would be one that included all six films. Each would be given two discs, and they would all be packed with the special features I mentioned earlier, plus many more that I didn't mention. Episodes IV, V, and VI would have both the Original Release versions and the Special Edition versions available (as I said before). I'd probably include a booklet of some kind, something detailed and probing that wouldn't disappoint fans.Unfortunately, I have no control over the format of the ""Star Wars"" DVDs. For now, I have to stick with what was offered. I can only hope that future releases will do a better job of presenting what the fans want to see. Mr. Lucas, you're going to have to try a little harder if you really want to impress us. Give us something that is truly a collector's item instead of a bare bones gathering of three movies. These films redefined the meaning of the word ""blockbuster,"" and it's time they get recognized for that. A good start would be a decent DVD set."	3.0	The Force is Not with this Collection	2006-01-28	6	5	1

CGI special effects, and aside from the fact that George Lucas cares not for the blowback of fan criticism in regards to Episode 1 (The Phantom Menace indeed) and that truly awful character, Jar-Jar Binks... aside from all those issues that make being a fan of Star Wars in the 21st century so darn difficult (and make being a fan of Peter Jackson's efforts in bringing the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to the screen so darned easy), aside from all of that... we are still left with some truly great filmmaking, some truly great characters (and, while not truly great, some of the best known acting choices for a film of this type) and a sense of wonder and magic, and true menace (is there a better film out there that captures the grim desire to grow out of adolesence than ""Empire Strikes Back"" and all of its dark and sinister implications?). Leave the Ewoks out, and you've got one of the all-time best cinematic trilogies ever made, and now-- aren't we blessed? --they've come to DVD courtesy of Mr. Lucas's constipated, control freak manner. As usual, fans are left wanting... and though I've yet to purchase the DVD's I'm a little concerned at the level of care that went into this vaunted DVD edition versus the level of care that went into the DVD special edition (and even standard edition) DVD releases of Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy. Lucas seemed unable to get, or unable to care about getting, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford's input on the commentary tracks, and that alone is reason for concern.Still, the DVD set, with all of Lucas's tinkering... tinkering, mind you that did NOT need to be done, is a must have, regardless.Our wishes as fans may not have been answered, but George finally granted us the pleasure of owning the original trilogy on DVD, and for that, may the Force be with him."	4.0	George, why do you mess with your fan base?!	2004-07-28	10	3	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ASPMXNEFVVLNE	Christopher	This is just an alert since there seems to be some confusion about a trilogy release with the original unaltered versions along with the special editions vs a trilogy set that only contains the special editions and no copies of the original unaltered versions.The reviews for both sets are merged together... that is why you are seeing people claim that it has the original unaltered versions, and people complaining they do not. THIS set that I specifically clicked on to make this comment on is on the 2004 release which DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL UNALTERED VERSIONS. The box image is silver and has Darth Vader's mask on the box. This set ONLY contains the SE along with a 4th bonus disc of making of features and trailers and a sneak peak at episode III. If you want the trilogy set that contains both the SE and the unaltered versions but no bonus features, make sure when purchasing from Amazon, that the picture is a picture of Darth Vader and Luke clashing with light sabers and the box has a lot of blue coloring. It also says IV V VI along the bottom. Scroll down to DVD info and it should say release date: 2008. THAT is the version you are looking for.If you place an order on the Trilogy with the Silver box with Darth Vaders mask on it, you are going to get the 2004 release of the trilogy and that's probably not the one you want... This review is going to appear on both sets though... So make sure before you buy, that you are on the correct trilogy page. Check the picture. Check the release date.There are plenty of reviews of the actual product so I'm not going to go into that. Just wanted to clear up some confusion.	4.0	BE CAREFUL!!!	2010-12-31	5509	5399	110

Do the additions of some scenes not in the original really take away from the movie?  It's not like they went back and brought the actors back in to re-shoot a bunch of the scenes.  Most people are clamoring for more deleted scenes and extra material...these are the same people who say that Lucas has destroyed the movie by adding material to it.I agree with the person earlier who said...""thank god, now I can get rid of my VCR.""Those of you who think that this re-release of the special edition is sacreligous, shouldn't buy it...go watch it on your Betamax or laser disk player, afterall you were probably pissed when they put it on VHS and released the THX version that changed the sound.I personnaly cant wait to show it to my kids who will be able to enjoy it for years and years...BRAVO George Lucas for getting off your duff and releasing it...finally!"	4.0	The way Lucas wanted it ~	2004-05-07	20	8	12
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AU503HFYAB0IG	"Christopher J. Benz ""CJB"""	"I think if this box set release proves anything, it's that nothing can diminish the astonishing achievement of Lucas' vision and determination in creating spellbinding adventures in other worlds.I first ran into Star Wars in 1977, when my dad took me on a holiday to California (we're from Australia) to Grauman's Chinese theatre to see this new ""science fiction"" film. I was seven years old and the experience literally changed my life. I now work as a director in television commercials and films in Australia, probably largely because of that day.By self description then, I am I guess, a 'classic' Star Wars fan.But do I believe in the originals over and above the new reworked special editions and amended DVD editions?Well, frankly I'm divided... Let me tell you first, without hesitation, buy this collection - no amount of tweeking by Lucas can obscure what is, above all else a brilliantly constructed universe and epic narrative.I must say that even though I am highly critical of the prequel films, that fact that I had seen I, II and III added immensely to my enjoyment of watching the classic trilogy again. Knowing the background storyline somehow is a perverse thrill, as if you have power over these characters struggling to find meaning as they are thrown into peril and adventure!A few comments though on the experience of watching this trilogy evolve. Listening to Lucas on the commentary track (he participates on the audio commentaries for ALL of the films), Star Wars is like the most expensive, and detailed train set a Hollywood whiz kid ever conceived and he literally cannot keep his hands off it. An adjustment of colour here, an extra creature there, tweeked audio, enhanced skies. Some of the changes are very subtle, others are jarring. The general rule seems to be - if you don't notice it, it's good.For example, the cleaning up and enhanced shots in the battle for the Death Star in 'A New Hope' are brilliantly executed and seemless with the spirit and excitement of the original. To be honest, it's never looked so good. If all of the fixups had been this classy, I'd be ecstatic.The use of additional digital creatures in Mos Eisley on Tatooine is ill advised because it intrudes on the mood of the original film. Why does every new creature need to demonstrate some slapstick hijinks to make it's presence felt? Couldn't it simply form part of the backdrop as it would in reality? It's as if Lucas felt that, having spent money on the new creatures, they bloody better DO something to get noticed.Unfortunately, many of the enhancements belie the problems with the prequels - and most of these problems are associated with story and character deficiencies.Han Solo's added conversation with Jabba in 'A New Hope' adds nothing whatsoever dramatically to the film and in fact holds it up, when the rampaging pace of the original film is what made it such a revelation at the time. Likewise Luke's catching up with an old buddy before getting into his x-wing for the Death Star battle is clunky and slow - that's why it was cut in the first place! Put it in the deleted scenes section for crying out loud!I am one of the reviewers who definitely DOES have a problem with Han Solo's scene with the bounty hunter which Lucas altered so that Solo shoots only after the Hunter's first shot. The fact that Solo beat the Bounty Hunter to the kill told us a lot about who he was (and don't forget this is the FIRST time you see him). He's a mercenary, not a girl scout who waits to be fired on. These touches are politically reactionary. No wonder Lucas struggles to create good characters now when he's afraid to give them light and shade.It has become obvious following the prequels that Solo is still THE most successful and popular character in all of the 6 films. why is this? It's his humanity and cynicism that holds the sympathy and amusement of the audience.  Lucas' fantasy world is so much more powerful because of the wisecracking disdain that Han Solo has for it. HE dominates his environment as a character unlike every protagonist in the prequels, most of whom are developed little more than Playstation characters, completely dwarfed by the special effect landscape.The prequels sadly lack characters with Han Solo's attitude. Ewan McGregor has a crack in ROTS but he's struggling against a witless script. Whack on Episode 4 and 5 and watch Harrison to see how it's done. It's impossible to take your eyes off him. Still, even in the classic trilogy, you could see Harrison Ford starting to look accutely embarassed by having to act against Ewoks and by that stage the acting and space opera whoops-a-daisy was starting to suffer drastically from a serious case of 'the cutes'. As you can probably tell, I'm not a huge fan of 'Return of the Jedi' - Ironically, being the most recent of the classic trilogy, it's also the most dated with an unhealthy reliance of eighties pop influenced music (especially the dire 'variety entertainment' scene in Jabba's palace at the beginning of the film (mystifyingly extended in the special edition), and also by the over reliance on Ewoks (clearly small people in relatively inexpressive furry suits). Still, despite it all, at it's best, for me ROTJ still betters 95% of the prequels - possibly ROTS outdoes it occassionally due to better plotting and vastly better special effects. The main cast from the classic films (Ford, Hammil, Fisher) can still act rings around anyone in the new films, especially in TESB, where they are at their dramatic and comedic peak.'A New Hope' and 'Empire' are simply magnificent on every level and 'Empire' has been far the best treated by any Lucas updates on this release. It looks absolutely breathtaking and Irvin Kirschner's direction is just the kind of planet hopping adult science fiction adventure that we all feel we have been promised, and, aside from Blade Runner and Alien, have never had since.So, for my money, Lucas has done enough to make this one of the most satisfying experiences you'll ever have with your DVD player. For consistency and attention to character and emotions, I think he has now been outdone by Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but these films were here first, they changed the world and even made us feel that we had a new religion in a flagging spiritual era. For all of these reasons, I think Lucas has earned the right to keep playing with his train set as he sees fit. I'm still happy to watch on and enjoy.It's worth mentioning that the 150 min doco on the making of the films included in this set is absolutely wonderful, full of fascinating and frank details on the mountains Lucas had to move, both technological and political to make these films happen.

What an awesome experience. I have a fond love for Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, but didn't too much care for Return of the Jedi. Nor have I seen anything of Episodes 1-3 that make me want to sit through them entirely.Still this is a great set and definitely one to own. Like the recently remastered copies of The Indiana Jones trilogy, we've waited what seems like forever for this and Lucas' tinkering with HIS films is HIS perogative and HIS business. What if Terry Gilliam had never gotten a chance to share the ""real"" Brazil with audiences? What Lucas has done to this films, while being decried by many as ""ruining"" them, is instead retouching them to realize HIS vision for each project.Granted, there IS something nostalgic about the first releases of Star Wars and I suspect that at some point, Lucas being the merchandiser that he is, another set will be released with the unGGI'd versions.In the meantime, let's stop all the carping about CGI enhancements, especially from those who will run out this weekend and waste their hard earned $ on ""Sky CRAPtain""."	5.0	Star Wars Widescreen Special Edition DVDs	2004-09-17	1	0	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2MEPYXE0Z70PC	Christopher M. Domico	"Since I know that I'm getting this set as a Christmas gift this year, I chose to rent all three movies.  I did not watch ANY of the special features yet, so this review is on the movies themselves and nothing else.  In fact, my rental versions didn't even have any bonus discs in them.  (Thanks a lot Blockbuster!)Anyway, this box set looks and sounds great.  I noticed the video remastering immediately.  I think the last time I watched this trilogy all in one weekend was when I was about 10 years old watching them on Beta tapes that I had watched so many times they were probably about ready to snap.  The picture on these (again) remastered versions is very crisp and clear.  In fact, it sometimes almost completely eliminates any ""dated"" looking scenes.  And on that topic, movies just aren't made like this anymore.  A lot of the battle scenes between the rebel and imperial fleets look FAR more realistic than any of the CGI stuff we're being bombarded with these days.  The reason for this is that on the Star Wars trilogy, you're seeing a real ship.  It's just that in reality, it's a very very small model.The audio was impressive too, however episode IV is a little weak in this area in some spots.  I noticed a couple of scenes with syncing issues.  In some of the scenes that are heavy in dialogue, sometimes the sound quality of the dialogue changes suddenly to the old muddy sound of the original movie.  But all in all, these discs sounded great in my home theater.  The newly mastered audio combined with the ultra clean looking video made this a whole new experience.The only reason I give this set 4 stars is because I think in the audio area, episode IV has some issues as I described above.  I also think more should have been done with some of the larger scale explosions, for example the two Death Star explosions were a little on the ho hum side in the sound department.This set is SO worth having.  These three movies are truly more convincing than the newer episodes and I believe this is soley due to the puppetry and model techniques.  The CGI additions seem to actually make the movies look cheaper and I don't think they were necessary, though improvements were made for this set on the extra Jabba scene in episode IV that were much needed."	4.0	Worth the wait	2004-10-10	6	3	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GH4DV1ZVSCZO	Christopher Minjoot	I have just received and watched the DVD trilogy back-to-back. I grew up with Star Wars (was 11 when the first one came out) and must admit that nostalgia is a powerful thing. It is great to have all 3 films in one handy package ... but if Lucas is not going to rerelease the films in their original versions, then you had better hang on to your old laserdiscs and VHS tapes and I don't mean the Special Editions!That said however, the DVDs are an improvement, if only slightly, over the Special Editions. My two biggest qualms with them have been rectified, one fully and the other partially. The former was Luke's scream as he jumped and fell in Cloud City - they have removed it entirely. The inclusion of the scream (it didn't even sound like him) in the Special Edition took away Luke's integrity ... remember, jumping was his own choice. Second was the controversial Greedo shooting Han first scene in the Cantina. This time, Han and Greedo trade shots almost simultaneously which is a compromise of sorts.What does this all mean? Together with some other minor changes, it looks like Lucas does listen to the fans. Remember what happened to Jar-Jar in AOTC? His role was drastically reduced. However, do not get your hopes too high for the release of the trilogy in its original form. For all you know, even if Lucas were to accede to our requests, the original masters may have completely deteriorated. So, probably what we would now want is the trilogy in its original narrative form but with spruced up audio and visuals ... food for thought! Did everyone also realise that The Phantom Menace DVD is not the original movie version? There are additional minor scenes in that one ... so hang on to your Japanese Laserdisc if you have it!I have no complaints with regards to the audio and visual quality of the DVDs, they are close to perfect. The most controversial addition must be the replacement of Sebastian Shaw with Hayden's Force Spirit at the end of ROTJ. Before we go ahead to slam Lucas, I am confident that it is the result of a major plot point in Revenge of the Sith ... and will be explained fully (if you think hard enough or participated in the forums such as the one on TheForce.Net, you would be able to realise why).Well, I have bought the DVDs, watched them and have no regrets, even knowing that I may have to buy them all over again, especially if they came out on High Definition.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A256F7E787F5SG	Christopher Nieman	"Let me state first off that I'm not the most drooling fan of Star Wars in the world. I don't go to SW conventions, I don't dress up in costumes to show my love of the films, and I have never owned a toy light saber. But I do like the original trilogy very much, enough to have bought more than one copy as the years have gone by. I even saw (what I believe was) the first sanctioned screening of the trilogy in Hollywood in 1985, which was an experience I won't forget.I also consider myself somewhat of a film purist, and honestly I think it's sad to see such a classic series of pop culture films treated in such a cavalier fashion by their creator. Granted, George Lucas made them and he has the full right to do what he pleases with them -- I support the concept of the painter destroying his own paintings if he so chooses. But unfortunately Lucas seems to no longer trust his past work for what it was. His quest for technical and aesthetic continuity between the two trilogies, which is probably foolhardy from the start, seems to be insatiable. Most people agree that these films really didn't need any additional enhancement (or continuity checks) to retain their reputation with audiences old and new. George Lucas is on a slippery slope with his enhancement crusade, and it's becoming increasingly obvious that the Star Wars films will never truly be ""finished"" -- just constantly updated and remarketed.Sadly, this reminds me of the bad old days of the film preservation movement, not so long ago, when Ted Turner thought it was a good idea to colorize classic black-and-white films of the past -- a practice that, thankfully, has not withstood the test of time. Hopefully, neither will this.Yes, Lucas made the films and he can do what he wants with them. But I don't have to buy it if it's not what I want, either.

Personally, I'd gladly buy both versions.  Just search for ""original trilogy"" on a search engine, it should come up.There are parts of the special editions that I like, but other parts I didn't.  For instance, the song in Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi made no sense whatsoever, and was incredibly awkward and disturbing.  Jabba may be amused by that sort of thing, but I'm not.  Then again, everything added to The Empire Strikes Back worked perfectly...nothing was too big to distract from the film, only enhance it.I'd just like to see the movies the way I saw them growing up."	5.0	*Original* Trilogy	2004-04-04	1	0	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1CEULSUXYSJVR	Christopher Schiavone	Are Star Wars Episodes IV, V, & VI great movies?  YES!!!  Are the Special Edition versions great movies?  In my mind, yes.  No, I was not happy with some of the editions made to these movies.  For example:  Greedo shooting first (by far the biggest blunder George Lucas made, aside from Jar Jar, in all six movies.)  I didn't read all the reviews so I don't know if anyone mentioned how the actual explosion of the Death Star in Episode IV was altered.  Personally, I like the original explosion better.  It may be a minor point to some, but it bothered the heck out of me.  Yet, I still must give these movies 5 stars.  If we didn't have the original versions to compare the Special Editions too, people would like them just the same (think about that for a second or two).In response to a few previous reviews; Dune and Star Wars are ABSOLUTELY nothing alike.  Yes, I read ALL the Dune books and enjoyed them all, but to say Lucas copied Dune when he made Star Wars is ridiculous!  And another reviewer mentioned how a REAL moviemaker like Speilberg has never gone back an altered his works.  That reviewer has obviously not seen the NEW version of E.T. (Handguns mysteriously changing into walkie-talkies.)  Thank goodness neither of them got any funny ideas with the Indiana Jones series.Bottom line is that the SE versions are still great movies.	5.0	To buy, or not to buy.....  that is the question.....	2004-04-15	8	3	5

I saw this package in the store, and it doesn't talk about it being the special editions, it mentions the classic films.  Combined with the classic poster art, I had to wonder if my dreams had come true and Lucas had some how come to his senses and released the originals finally.  I'm glad I could look here and find out the truth about these releases.  I'm sure many others will not do the research and pick up this set thinking it to be the originals.I don't mind a lot of the special effects added, but as was said previously, things like Greedo shooting first change the story and in a ludicrous fashion (a trained bounty hunter fires for no reason and manages to miss at point blank range?!).  Some day hopefully these people will realize how much money they could make by simply cleaning up the originals and giving us what we really want to see.  Until then, I guess I'll keep hoping my VHS copies hold up for my son to enjoy.Another kind of stupid thing is the way they talk about these movies as if the reason to see them is to continue the story from the new movies, it almost comes across as this was some cheap Disney direct to video sequel instead of the superior original stories.	1.0	I'm glad this site is here	2005-12-07	16	12	4

Say what you will about the Special Editions (the changes don't really bother me), the quality of this film on DVD (and remember its from original 1977 film stock) is outstanding and looks like it was practically shot yesterday.  It feels like you're viewing a whole new movie.  Any one who owns a DVD player should purchase these films, because these films are a piece of history.  These Star Wars 'purists' need to relax.  If you want to view the original films, I'm sure you can find some VHS cassettes out there.  Remember, like a previous reviewer said, these are George Lucas's films, and he has every right to alter them if he so desires.  You may not like it, but you have to respect it.  The changes don't bother me, and in some areas actually do enhance the films.

I got out the original Star Wars out from a video store ages ago and the video was sooooooooooooo old! It had all its original VHS artwork which was cool, but the way it looked on TV was terrifying! It was crinkly and old, I wanted to watch it on DVD pretty badly, anyway it is out on DVD and a lot of people are comlaining about all these new changes! Its obvious its the best George Lucas could do for them, if you watch all the original movies in sequence it would look very silly when you get to episode IV,V and VI. Now that these alterations have been made it all pans out to one big great piece of work, after all those special effects on Episode III , anyone would laugh at the puppetry in Episode VI, though lots of people dont agree with me, I actually think the puppetry looks more convincing than computer generated things, but who wants to stay in the past?Basically this box set comes with all episodes 4-6 and a bonus material disc which , dissapointed me kind of, I wish it had more stuff! They couldve put so much stuff on here, the bonus disc is pretty much dominated by Empire of dreams. It was a great disc though, the movies are still fantastic, my favourites which many will disagree with areReturn Of The JediThe Empire Strikes BackStar Wars (AKA A New Hope)Lol, all those haters of these DVDs should come to terms that these movies needed a change!

Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling ""NOOOO"" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke.

Sadly, this box-set is NOT the original trilogy.  As a movie purist I am shocked and saddened that my favorite childhood movie-memory is being tinkered with by it's own creator.  I love the Star Wars saga but for now I'll be content with my laserdiscs, which hold up very well to DVD.  Why not offer both versions on the same disc?  In my opinion Lucas has ruined the Star Wars world with his prequel movies; Jar Jar Binks? storyline?  bad acting? digital worlds? ... and now with this DVD set.  Imagine if Lucas had created Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (another favorite) and CG implanted more oompa loompa's into a scene that he felt needed more of them???  That's how I feel, & I'm sure I'm not the only one.	1.0	Sadly, Not the Original Trilogy.....	2004-09-18	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2EGE6EDBIMU0E	Chuck 07	"Critics who give the filmed masterpiece ""Star Wars"" a negative review must not have a strong background in film. Have these members of the bourgeois seen Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress""?  Are they aware of the Classic Flash Gordon serials? Do they think a black comedy is any film that stars Eddie Murphy? Are they lost in translation when they are at the box office of their local multiplex. Are the techno-geeks too phat from playing their Matrix video games for ten thousand hours.The dialog in Star Wars was purposfuly juvenile and adds to the charm of the pictures. It's no ""Godfather"" and was never ment to be.There is no converting the unconverted. I only pity them. Life is too short not to have fun while watching movies. An example follows: I respect ""Schindler's List"" and I consider it the greatest picture ever made. I've seen it only once, an emotional experience I will never forget. I've seen ""Star Wars"" and its two original sequels houndreds of times. As for the SE versions, I understand what Lucas is trying to do by creating six films that progress and flow in a coherent fashion.All Star Wars fans, and fans of great cinema must stand together against the ""Seinfeld,"" ""Friends,"" ""American Beauty,"" reality TV loving zombies. Star Wars was a small art-house, independent picture that just happened to be very popular. It was never meant to have the success it achieved. It was not designed to be a blockbuster. It became a blockbuster because it is great. Worlds were created which never existed before.

Lucas can do whatever he wants with the movies, as long as that doesn't mean pretending the original versions don't exist.  That's what he is doing, however.These will be even further enhanced with additional changes made since the 1997 theatrical releases.  George Lucas has ruined these movies, for both first-generation fans as well as future fans.  Changing something permanently that so many people contributed to is unforgivable.  The special effects were groundbreaking, but future viewers will not be able to see film history as it really was.  Lucas has wiped it out in favor of computer generated effects and such.Some people feel this doesn't matter.  If movies matter to you at all- if they hold any importance to you whatsoever- you will consider boycotting this release.

Non-standard letterbox (these are NOT made for today's television standards and look just as bad on full screen TV's). Grainy picture, especially on the original movies. 2 channel sound on the originals and no bonus discs whatsoever.

The first time I actually remember seeing the movie was in 1982.  Since then I have been hooked.  As far as this DVD package is concerned, I probally will wait until Lucas releases a box set with all episodes 1 - 6.  There is really no need to rush and get this since this package does not contain the original movies that alot of us remember from the 80's (or even 70's for the older folks :-)). I don't think the original movies can be purchased anymore, and the only way I would purchase this set when it is released in September is if Lucas decided to put the original movies on the DVD as well as the ""remastered"" ones.  As it stands though, I will wait for all 6 to be released before I purchase.With that out the way, I think it goes without saying that episodes IV - VI comprise the best trilogy ever to make it to the big screen."	5.0	Best Series ever made	2004-04-02	2	1	1

Kresiak	"By virtue of age, I count myself among the lucky people who stood in line for hours to see these three films on their original releases. The first two films were only released to one theatre in Washington DC, where I lived, unlike today when mass releases to the cineplexes is the norm. Anyway, I especially remember seeing ""Empire"" just a day or two after it was released, and it was one of the best theatre-going experiences I ever had (""Jaws"" and ""Nashville"" are other films that come to mind).My wife and I sat down and watched episodes IV, V and VI over three nights and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing them again, especially in such pristine condition. My opinion is that the changes made by Lucas to these films are perfectly justified - they do not alter the integrity of the films, he has just given them a bit of a tune-up. I had never seen all three films back-to-back like this, and heartily recommend the experience.The bad news is that I watched ""The Phantom Menace"" shortly after finishing ""Jedi"" and was immediately struck at how wrongheaded Lucas was in pinning the project on such a cute but untalented child, and on failing to set aside his own ego and let a real director take the reigns. Lucas is a visionary filmmaker but is woefully bad at directing his actors. It is clear that the original films have the clear advantage by way of casting - the interplay between Ford, Hamill and Fisher is wonderful and intangible, something that fails to spark between Portman, Christensen, Neeson and MacGregor in episodes I and II. As annoying as Jar Jar is, at least he has a bit of life to him.All will be forgiven if Lucas triumphs with episode III. The legacy of Star Wars will live despite the failings of the most recent releases, but the longing for one more burst of magic runs deep with the fans."	5.0	Like Seeing Them All Again for the First Time...	2004-12-10	9	5	4

Lagonick-Weitzel	"I will be honest in stating that the only reason I asked for the blu-ray set as a gift is so that I can legally download an upcoming fan edit of one of these films.The fact is, the original Star Wars is a beloved film trilogy to many.  While this blu-ray transfer does provide for a crisp image of the original prints of the films, it also includes the added CGI and story elements from the re-release of the trilogy in the 90s.  These elements have not been updated to fit today's CG quality and standards despite Lucas being more than happy to further modify additional elements of the films.It would also appear that the color correction in these movies were done by different teams of people for different scenes.  Some of the scenes have a somewhat accurate color to the original releases, while a vast majority have an overly blue and highlighted tone to them.  Yoda's florescent green is of particular disappointment.The fact that Lucas refuses to release a cleaned up version of the original prints is still frustrating to many fans, as they would like access to both Lucas's ""completed vision"" for the movies as well as their childhood memory versions as well.The movies themselves are the classics that we have come to know and love, minus of course some of the added CG elements.  There are times when the added elements do enhance and improve the atmosphere and story, while at other times it distracts from and/or cheapens the story in the eyes of many fans.  Lucas did not bother to go back and correct simple-to-fix glaring issues such as incomplete spaceships, wires being seen connecting to lightsabers and yes, even Darth Vader's breastplate being upside down in the first movie.  These things easily could have been corrected but, have not been.Overall, I give 5 to the movies themselves but, 2 to this set for the poor technical quality and lack of restored original prints."	2.0	Great Movies, Disappointing for Fans	2013-01-21	1	1	0

I guess there's something to that, but there comes a time when the digitally improved ""Star Wars"" begins to look like the cinematic equivalent of Michael Jackson -- Lucas nips and tucks and tones and straightens and bleaches and generally fiddles with the face of his movies until finally he's saying, ""There's nothing wrong with gray skin. In fact, it's always been gray.""I personally think consumers should send a message to Lucas and NOT buy this box until he agrees to issue the original versions but given that this box is currently the #1 seller on this site, that's obviously not gonna happen (until, of course, he sells enough and rolls out an old school box set for completists -- though that might be me being too cynical).Anyway, I rented the box just to check out the changes and, yes, it's just as messed with as I feared.  After this travesty and ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" I thought my faith in the series had completely died.But then I watched ""Empire of Dreams,"" the special doc on the making of the series.  And I kind of got my faith back a little.  Yes, i still think Lucas has lost his mind, but ""Empire of Dreams"" is fascinating, a inpsiring work about filmmaking, special effects, creativity and the way a vision can change between the treatment and the images' arrival on celluloid.  It explains a lot about why Lucas became what he's become, but most importantly it harkens back to what I loved about the original trilogy.  It talks to every important person that can be interviewed and even though you may not think you can stomach 2.5 hours about the fading, distorted movies, I think anybody who loves film will find something amazing in it."	4.0	"The trilogy is gone but ""Empire of Dreams"" restored my faith"	2004-09-23	6	4	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ATOS750XCC9MQ	Classis Genre Film Fanatic	I think it's great that Lucas has decided to release the original trilogy on DVD. I don't mind most of the changes he made in 1997, and the newest changes that supposedly will be on the DVD (only Anakin is being changed in the force ghost scene in Return of the Jedi, and not Obi-Wan). I think, for the most part, they help blend with the prequel trilogy better. Plus, they're very minor changes, and 99% of the films are the same way they've always been but look and sound better because they're restored.However, I see no reason why Lucas can't offer both the original version of the trilogy and the newest version on the same DVD set. It's been done before with many other films on DVD, and I know it's something that countless Star Wars fans would appreciate. It just makes sense to me to release the original version on DVD with the new version so that we can observe and appreciate how it used to be and how it is now.So, I give 4 stars for the set because it's gonna be cool overall. But it's not a 5 star set simply because Lucas keeps tinkering with his movies and isn't including the original cuts with it.	4.0	Looks like it'll be a good DVD release...	2004-08-06	5	0	5

I don't own any Star Wars toys or whatever so I don't think I fall into the fanatic category, just a lover of the movies, especially in a nostalgic way.  These first three Star Wars films were for me the best Star Wars films.  In fact, the Star Wars films seem to be getting progressively worse.The material you're reading here from purists about changes made to the movies has some merit.  The most notable changes are in the Return of the Jedi, which I always thought was the worst of the three anyway.  It suffered from being entirely too corny, and the Ewok characters, for me were totally unbelieveable.  They look like little people in bear suits.  I would have preferred that the filmmakers digitally cover up the seams in the back of the Ewok costumes rather than adding so many things.  In that episode there are noticable changes, the most glaring of which is at the end when you see the ""ghosts"" of Obi-Wan, Yoda and Annikan, the Annikan character has been replaced by the kid who played him in Episode 2!  What's with that?!  Yoda didn't have a younger version, Obi-Wan wasn't somehow younger, but Annikan is.  So, don't get me wrong, I don't say this from a purist point of view, but to me that ruins the charm of these movies.  There are numerous other glaring changes.Overall, these are the best ""prints"" of the moives I've seen.  I only spotted two of those little halos that you used to be able to see around the spaceships.  The picture quality is astoundingly good.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ATR72FW8LEZV1	C. L. Hanson	"There aren't any real words that I can say that can explain just how much the original Star Wars movies mean to me. Being able to see Star Wars in the theaters in 1977 as a 6-year old was one of the greatest and happiest times in my life. I am not one of the types that attend conventions or wait in lines to see the latest Star Wars films, but it made an impact on me, and I cherish the original Trilogy.With that being said, I am saddened that the original format of the Star Wars trilogy will not be released with the ""special"" editions that we will be getting. This is why I am only giving 4 stars.Why not? I wasn't that impressed with the special editions. So they cleaned up the screen and added some new effects and explosions. That's where the tinkering should have ended. The scene in the ""Special Edition"" of Star Wars where Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table in the Cantina was changed to where Greedo shoots first. Why? That was one of the funniest scenes in the original. It also looks TERRIBLE! It didn't add to the story at all.I went to each Special Edition back in 1997, and I did enjoy seeing Star Wars on the big screen again. It was fun. But as nitpicky as I might be, there is something about the originals that shouldn't be messed with. So what if there wasn't any computer animation? That's one of the best things about it. Good old fashioned models and puppets. At the time, it was state-of-the-art. When Ted Turner bought the rights to old black and white movie classics back in the 80's, he colorized them. That looked terrible, and there was no reason to do it. There are some things that do not require changing.I know that I will still buy the DVD trilogy coming out, and its not as if the original stories aren't still in place. But I just wish that we had the ability to CHOOSE what we want to see. Hopefully they will make a last minute decision and add the treasures we saw so long ago in their original versions."	4.0	IF IT AINT BROKE, DONT FIX IT!	2004-04-02	1	1	0

In 1997 I was excited to hear Lucas was updating the trilogy with the ""Special Editions"" containing new footage and effects.  Let's just say by the end of it all my opinion of the Special Editions soured and I don't wish to view those versions of these films again.Thankfully, the original 1977 - 1983 theatrical versions are included with this DVD box set.  The format is not spectacular, being lower in resolution than the Special Edition trilogy included in the set, but at this point us Star Wars purists will take what we can get.These versions really stand the test of time.  While George Lucas may disagree, I think the special effects hold up well and that the flaws only add to the charm.  These films certainly feel more alive than the prequels as they were filmed using live actors against real sets.  I don't want to get into a fit of Lucas bashing here, so I will just leave at, this is the definitive box set for any child of the 70's and early 80's.  I really hope they release these versions on Blu-ray one day as well."	4.0	Worth it for the original versions alone	2010-07-25	3	3	0

But it's not all bad.I don't remember the original trilogy being so full of color.  In that respect, the DVD's look a lot better, but George's decisions to add and alter are disappointing.It's as if nobody working for him or with him will dare question his decisions.ESB was my favorite of the original three.  The DVD version has only a few improvements, and quite a few bad decisions.  I can understand the desire to re-shoot the Emperor/Vader exchange, but why re-write the dialogue?  George thought it would be a good idea to have Jango Fett's voice for Boba Fett (being clones and all), but he didn't think to ask James Earl Jones to do the voice-over for the 3 seconds of footage added to the Special Edition as Vader leaves Bespin.  If James was asking for too much $$$, George could have omitted the stand-in Vader dialogue in that scene, altogether.Putting Hayden's Anakin likeness at the end of ROTJ was a great idea, but how about making him look a little older, and a little more like the guy that ""looked on Luke with his own eyes?""  While we're at it, why not edit out Alec Guiness, and put in Ewen's Obi Wan likeness?  Didn't anyone at Skywalker Ranch have the intestinal fortitude to say, ""George, I think that scene is great as it is"" and ""we don't need to add another song to Jabba's Palace scene.""  Morons.For the new fans of the story, they're going to be cheated.  George has proven he's a lousy director and doesn't know when to leave well-enough alone.  It's a shame that with such a monumental release, he didn't include the original, not-so-special editions.  They were truly classics.Revenge of the Sith as directed by George Lucas?  I wonder if it'll be any better than the last two.If George wants to fix all the ""loose ends"" in his movies, he should have started with ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Willow.""The ""final"" product on these DVD's are a classic example of abject stupidity.  The flow is disrupted, your intelligence is insulted, and the uniqueness is gone.I bought them for my kids, hoping for the best.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"I'm not really a big fan of the term ""special edition"". It's usually a quick cash-grab to get people to buy the DVD/see the movie in theatres only to be cheapened. Before 1997, Fox released the THX enhanced versions of the trilogy. This was literally the last time you'd see the trilogy in its original form.  Couple years later, the special editions came out. George Lucas has been saying all the time that the films he made near 30 years ago were not his ""vision"" so he made some changes: some good, some bad but I didn't complain because I had the original THX ones and the special ones. Then the DVD set is released...and it's only the special editions? WTF?The films are timeless. The first film has a bit of a slow first half to me, the second is definately the best and the third is uneven but still good. Some of the changes are for the better though. That pink looking fudge under the landspeeder is gone, no more transparent snowspeeder and the Sarlacc pit actually has a monster rather than some hole with couple tentacles and spikes. The lightsabers have been refined a bit(although some of the colors change like when Luke practices on the ship it's green, yet later when he has the helmet on it's white?) and the Death Star explosions have a cool looking ring. As for the bad? Oh boy.Greedo still shoots first but it's not as jerky but still LOOKS odd. Jabba in the hanger is still in there but I think he made a better impact in film 3. They changed Boba Fett's voice and it sucks. And of course Hayden Christensen(Anakin in new films) replaces Sebastian Shaw as the ghost at the end of Jedi.For people who grew up with the 70-80's versions, these changes seem very out of place. In the end, they are his movies, his stories and he can do whatever the hell he wants. But sadly, the reason why he's a big name in the first place is not his improved films but the originals and thinks that's what we want. The Lion King dvd has the OPTION to watch either the special edition(it's only just a crappy song) or the original theatrical version...couldn't Lucasfilm have done that? I keep getting the feeling that the only reason he's doing this is to make it connect with the new trilogy and he otherwise probably wouldn't have bothered changing unless he didn't make the trilogy.As for the extras? VERY nice. First up is the big documentary(I'm talking over 2 hours) on the entire making of the Star Wars films. Very good, although you might've seen it recently on tv. Then there's the characters and a feature on the lightsabers. There's also your typical butt-kissing feature where well-known directors praise the film. The transfers of the films are excellent as they progress better and better with each new film and the sound is great.It's hard reviewing this. On one hand, you have 3 classic films that are nose deep in pop culture yet at the same time it doesn't feel like my Star Wars. But if you want these films on dvd then you'll have to settle with these which isn't a bad thing mind you."	4.0	Oh how this could've been better	2004-09-23	6	4	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1UUGCY1HIQZLR	cloudy	"Seemed like a rush job, but was still technically well done and restored. Even digital coloring enhanced trying to be like how the LOTR movies were done. At the average price of $40, still a reasonable deal since each movie on DVD would be about $14 each at the cheapest. If the original list price was truly $70, then maybe the distributers may have gotten a deal as well. Considering the controversy that this trilogy isn't the original, that may explain why. As for Lucas vowing not to release the DVD's until EpIII was done, my personal theory is that the superior LOTR films compared to the talentless prequels have devalued the mystique of SW and Lucas knows the original DVDs highest marketable value date has changed to before EpIII's release instead of after where EpIII if as inept as the other prequels could ruin purist fandom and marketabilty even further. The big question about the infamous changes since the special questions; again my personal theory is that Lucas is trying to dilute Marcia Lucas' oscar-winning edited version along with his obsession in proving his independence from the ""corporate studios"" even to the point of justifying the originals had to be ""improved"" since Fox studios had rushed him through the finishing of SW. However ESB and ROTJ have no shred of improvement justification since Lucasfilm ltd. was totally responsible for the production. If I could say one suggestion from all others, Lucas, I'd say use of CGI is still flawed. Stick to at least a hybrid of CGI and miniature and the model realism; take the LOTR film production as an example. Or even Star Trek: The Motion Picture Director's Edition(2001), where effort was actually made to blend the scenes in without any distraction as possible. Tieing in to the prequels in this latest edition is a flawed reason for using CGI enhancement. The documentaries were excellent however it ignored Tolkien and LOTR's influence on writing Lucas and Kurtz' space-fantasy script."	2.0	"Where's the Ewok's ""yub yub!""song?

This DVD is one example of the positive aspects of the digital revolution. (some would say Episode II is the negative) In any fashion this Trilogy is well worth the price of admission, even the updated expanded (CGI) scenes play better than the last ""special edition"" release. Some have explained their dissatisfaction with the ""special edition release"" but most are confusing real critical objections with nostalgia. Let's face it. These movies play mostly to the thritysomething plus generation and the retrospect feelings of children of the 1970s (don't screw with my childhood objection) then the real dislike of George Lucas trying to improve his movies, which in this release he does. The only objection here is disc four, where an ""official history"" has been created for future generations, but once again these are Uncle George's (any man who has such an impact on an individual generation has got to be an uncle) movies and he can do anything he wants with them. Well...almost, the other ""TWO"" are forgettable and that has nothing to do with the ""childhood objection"" they're just BAD but he's still Uncle George's. 10 out of 12 ain't bad.

Cosmic balance won't be restored until the untampered originals are given a proper release.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A324M46NHYZNO9	Count Spatula	Don't get me wrong, I have many Directors' Cuts in my DVD collection, many I really like and enjoy seeing orginal vision, extras scenes (Brazil, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings) but then there's the ones that should have been left alone. (Abyss, Star Wars) I'm not complaining about the special editions because I take offense at my precious Star Wars being changed from how I remember seeing it 100 times when I was a kid. As a filmmaker I take offense to Lucas making changes that look bad, change characters and are just down right stupid. There is actually changes I like. I love the extended Wampa scene in Empire. I like seeing the windows in Cloud City. So let's take a look:Star Wars: Mos Eisley scenes just look bad. Jabba doesn't look like Jabba. Han firing first, you just changed his whole character. Han is a badass. He would fire first. He spends most of the film looking out for himself. It's great to see the arc of going from self-centered jerk to someone who actually cares. I'm tired of directors getting older and wimpier. I'm surprised that he didn't CG the guns out of everyones hands. And if you're 'fixing' all this stuff why is Luke's saber still white/yellow on board the Falcon? The attack on the Death Star was great and I actually like that.Empire: like the Wampa, like Cloud City. Luke screaming in terror when he purposefully throws himself off the platform?!? Talk about changing character. Thank God he took it back out in the Special Special edition.Jedi: I was so mad when I started watching this I turned it off and didn't finish it for a year. That crappy computer animated rap scene with the band was bad enough, but Bobba Fett hanging out like a cowboy in a saloon and giving the dancing girl a little knock on the chin. What!? Soooo bad. Not to mention the technical slap in the face George gives to everyone who busted their hump creating puppets and perfroming in the orginal. It doesn't even visually blend with the look of the original film. I'm not that bothered by Hayden inserted other than the fact that it's a reminder of how bad the new movies are. Not that I'm a fan of Ewoks or the yub-yub celebration but the new ending is even worse not to mention that it once again doesn't match the look of the film.The transfers look great, but these just serves to demonstrate how bad the new ones look and how out of place the CG looks in comparison.  The orginals may have been using 'antiquated' techniques but a REAL model of a starship and a REAL puppet of Yoda, look REAL on film. Yoda isn't even identifiable as Yoda in the new films.	2.0	Looks great, changes suck	2005-12-06	15	12	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"Star Wars represented a landmark in motion picture history.  It was the beginning of the summer blockbuster, a film that catered to teens and younger.  It was the first film to have significant marketing tie-ins.  Modern Hollywood owes much to Star Wars, for better or for worse.  But the most extraordinary part about the original film is how well it stands up today.  It is the classic good vs. evil story about a boy and his friends overcoming enormous odds to rescue the girl and save the universe from destruction.For my money, Star Wars (now subtitled ""A New Hope"") is the best of the three.  I can still remember how thrilling it was from when I first saw it.  The DVD version has the 1997 special edition ""enhancement"" - computer generated effects and characters.  The enhancements are well worth-while - they do not change the story and anyone who opines for the ""good old days"" ought to look back at the original effects in the Death Star Battle, which definitely benefits from the new effects.The middle film, The Empire Strikes Back, is probably the best-made of the three.  The dialogue is better, the story is well-developed, and the effects are of contemporary quality (pretty amazing for a film released in 1980).  Return of the Jedi, the 3rd film, suffers mainly from the performances - the Leia/Han love affair is ponderous (as bad as Anakin/Padme in Ep. II) and Harrison Ford's portrayal gives you the sense that he would rather be making Indiana Jones movies instead.  However, it satisfactorily wraps up the series, and the Ewoks really aren't that bad!This DVD set has a few new surprises, a couple of which are welcome from a continuity perspective (inserting Hayden Christiansen and Ian McDiarmid as Anakin and Palpatine in RotJ and TESB, respectively).  Unfortunately, the Emporer's new dialogue is at an Episode II level of lameness, but it's only a minute-long scene, so I can live with it.  As for the sound and picture, it's great to finally have these films on DVD!  They are very clear and crisp.The extras are very good, although there are some curious omissions.  The two extras I would want to have most - cut scenes and a feature on the comparison between the original and the special edition would have been very welcome.  In fairness, we see parts of the cut scenes (Biggs, Camie, and Fixer making fun of Luke, for example) in the making-of feature and the still photos.  Likewise, the feature has some aspects on the difference between the old and new versions of the films, but nothing like what appeared on the Special Edition VHS set.  However, even the most dedicated Star Wars fan will learn a lot of new stuff watching the features, and the commentaries by Lucas, Burtt, et al. are generally entertaining and informative."	5.0	FINALLY!

Right now Lucas has left this trilogy is such a haphazard state you really have to wonder if the guy has any clue about quality control. It is appalling at times. Some things are redone in the original trilogy, and other things are simply out of place much or not up to the standard we have set today. Blade Runner had a lot of issues of the technical nature.... Star Wars is the same. It's obvious he wants to correct things, but then why go about it in such a cheap and unfaithful way?You see Lucas has a problem imo. The new trilogy has a LOT of heavily dated CGI, and if he honestly ever thinks that muck of a thing is going to be decent it needs an entire makeover. Good luck with that. With these original films we have exhaustive fan lists detailing pretty much every mistake from every frame. All he really needs to do is consult these guides or make his own... and then go to work correcting these things to some high degree of quality. Just issue a final cut and invest a 100 million or 2 George! Restore this set as an original set and as a new maximized final cut! So many little mistakes and retouches could be given that extra level of polish. Many fans would not be so adamantly horrified at the treatment of the films if they were finally just given a decent once over.I guess the mistakes they corrected for the bluray release do qualify as something, but they clearly didn't spend the money to actually make this a timeless piece in any regard. It just looks like the surgeon up and left in too many spots.Let's be real here. George Lucas is so far not really a man of quality. He doesn't have it in him if you ask me to bring quality to this series and release the originals and the final cuts with extensive restoration. It's such a huge community but Lucas chooses not to use nor please any of it. It really is a travesty on many levels. The only hope is that with a native 4K release they actually give this series the time and attention it deserves.	2.0	They need to offer remastered originals and final cuts.	2014-01-02	1	1	0

I know the old school fans are most likely in a state of digust after the last comment but i truely believe that these dvds are better. Not having seen the original version of in the theatres and being captivated by that experience, the new effects are a relief. With all of the prequeals being released it was hard to sit down and watch the complete star wars series.  The poor effects took away from the plot.....that the old star wars is set 20 years in the future.  The new effects help with the reality of the films, and help connect the saga.  Widescreen shots, and scope plays a large role in showing the viewer the full scope of the Star Wars Universe.

The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ...I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.Question: Why did you change your mind and decide to put the original three movies out on DVD now?GEORGE LUCAS: Just because the market has shifted so dramatically. A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now. So rather than just sit by and watch the whole thing fall apart, better to bring it out early and get it over with.Question: Do you pay much attention to fan reactions to your choices?LUCAS: Not really. The movies are what the movies are. ... The thing about science-fiction fans and ""Star Wars"" fans is they're very independent-thinking people. They all think outside the box, but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen, and they think it should be their way. Which is fine, except I'm making the movies, so I should have it my way.__________________________________________that's enough...(if you want to read the whole interview and make suffer to your stomach go to the link:edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/20/film.qa.george.lucas.ap/index.html)you are adviced! why lucas why...so what we have to do now is just rent it or buy a p'rate copy (the package is even cheap,why did they not copy the design package of the LOTR extended edition?) When you watch the series, and when those changes comes, cover your eyes and go on!the only good thing is that the canges is only 5% of the whole trilogy, so 95% is the original version so it's worth to watch it.star wars series were a good mopvie and one of the best trilogy of all time, but those changes lucas made, and watching the prequels, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is far, far away the best trilogy of all time...and return of the king the best picture of all time, only behind the God Father part 1...Thanks GEORGE LUCAS for spoiled one of the most exciting experience i ever lived, and Gollumn really kicked lucas a..ss for that st'pid jar jar binks.........."	1.0	Lucas is never going to release the original versions on DVD	2004-09-29	13	8	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AB74AZNZK69B9	C. Smith	Why?  These movies are just movies, but then again they're not.  You've got all these Matrix-generation goofnuts saying that it doesn't matter if changes are made.  But they don't get it.  It's like having part of your childhood re-written.  If your dad didn't take you to see these, or you were a baby or unborn at the time, then of course it doesn't matter.  But for those of us 32 and older, these movies are a moment in time.  Changing them does matter.  Some changes are good, like cleaning up the picture quality, fooling with backgrounds and things of that nature.  The new wampa scene is lame, and it throws off the timing of the sound when the lightsaber cuts through the ice.  And that's another thing.  What did they do to the sound on these dvds?  The snowstorm on Hoth sounds metallic like it was recorded in a trash can, Boba Fett's voice is changed, and all the sound throughout every film is different.  Just feels weird.  The cleaned up rancor scene is good, but all CGI creatures added to these films only serve to goof them up.  I can even live with Greedo shoots first (though it doesn't make sense), and a few other scenes that were added or altered.  But the ultimate slap in the face was putting Darth Vader as a kid at the end.  He looks younger than Luke, and that's supposed to be his father, and that's not the age at which he died.  Why isn't Obi-Wan 15 years old too?  It's dumb, and it absolutely ruins the whole trilogy.  His father should have remained the same as before.  That scene used to send chills up my spine every time.  Now it makes me want to puke.  Sad.	3.0	"Some things should never be ""new and improved"""	2004-09-27	14	11	3

After all, technology had changed so much in the span of twenty years that these restorations were necessary.Unfortunately, as fans of the original trilogy discovered, Lucas didn't stop there.  That content was changed (added, removed) from such classic films created quite an outcry.Needless to say, Lucas defended his position as the ""filmmaker"" and claimed such changes would have originally been made if time and technology had allowed.  I doubt Richard Marquand and Irvin Kershner would agree.Sadly, some fans feel the changes better connect the seriously inferior ""new movies"" and the original trilogy.  Sorry, folks you are really missing the point.

Absolutely ridiculous!! Why would anyone want the original theatrical release of one of the greatest films ever??? (Please note the sarcasm). George Lucas needs to get his head out of his -- anyway, the Special Edition versions are like making a two-disc set of Citizen Kane and including 5 minutes of Carrot Top mixed in. Boo! Boo! If I wan't to watch Star Wars, I should have the right to watch whichever one I like best. While they're at it, maybe they should also release a set that has no Jar Jar Binks (in the newest films). Either way, I guess I will buy this, but nostalgia isn't important to George Lucas, just his ""vision."" What a waste of plastic discs. Glad I got the originals on VHS!!! George Lucas sucks!

Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	"As these films have been reviewed and dissected many times over, not to mention the ever-raging debate over the ""Special Editions"" vs the"" Original Versions"", I'm not going to go into an in-depth story review or comparison here. These films waited way too long to be introduced to DVD, which is strange considering how George Lucas seems to love pushing technology. These films are the basis for his continuing standing in Hollywood, as well as the launching pad for several movie careers (can you say Harrison Ford?). Watching them now, you can see why everyone went wild back in 1977, again in 1981, and yet again in 1983. The basic plot of good vs evil, with plenty of temptation along the way for good to go astray, is as mesmerizing today as back then. A much-needed restoration and clean-up, both to picture and soundtrack, left these films shining like diamonds, with crystal clear sound. They never looked or sounded better. Of course, Lucas, being Lucas, made even more changes to his films before releasing them on DVD, much to the ire of Star purists. These changes are relatively minor, and are done to better fit the original trilogy with the later ""prequels"". If you are one to fuss over any changes to a film you already love, these alterations will drive you to distraction. However, the majority of the films remain unchanged from their theatrical run in the late 90's. I really won't go into whether I think Lucas should have left well enough alone or not, however, I do think he should have put the original versions with this set, instead of releasing them separately at a later date. The bonus features are a treat unto themselves, with a whole disc to devoted to them. This set represents Hollywood story-telling and imagination at its best, and a sizeable chunk of movie history. Not only is it worthy of being added to your collection, it really should be a staple of any movie collection, because it is Hollywood history."	5.0	"""Use The Force, Luke"""	2006-08-27	9	8	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2D6I6S2JQ0OLZ	C. Troxle	First, these films are amongst the best picture quality I have ever seen in a DVD.  Not to say that they are THE best, but they are up there.The detail is on point.  You can now see the weaves of the clothes and see the wetness of their hair.  It is super sharp.  As a matter of fact, it is sharper than The Phantom Menace which was flimed (or just edited?) in digital.  No need to go into the stories...Many people complain that these are not the originals.  True, but what else is there?  Do you really want the untouched originals on DVD in this day and age?  I am a huge Star Wars fan, but if the origianls were not cleaned up, then Lucas can leave them off of DVD.  However.......Let me talk about the worst parts of this set.  Things that he should not have touched!  Let's start with SW.  When Ben and Luke go to Mos Eisley, as Ben gives the stormtrooper the Jedi mind tirck, right beofore that scene, there ae new digital effects to get in the way of the original scene!  A distraction.  Before that, Lucas added a large creature where a Jawa falls off and robots fight.  All out foolishness!  It takes away from the serious tone that this film had for so many years.  Then there is the Jabba the Hut scene.  I still think that they should have done this better, but I do not think that it should have been omitted like others do.  They should have added the delted scenes with Luke and Biggs instead of trying to get money when he does release the ORIGINAL, UNALTERED verisons on HD-DVD.The Empire Strikes Back.  It seems to be everyone's favorite, and mine too.  This one was touched the least.  As it should given the fact that it was almost perfect to begin with.  The additons form the other Special Eiditons like the Wampa scene and other extended scenes were actually a good thing.  It did get you to see more of what you liked about the film.  The only major thing here is the scene with Darth Vader and the Emperor.  It was reshot and rescripted.  On the one hand, I like for things to remain in the origianl vision the director had.  On the other hand the new scene is cleaners and does not distract, but it is an after the fact scene which I must dismiss as false.  This is still the best of all of them.Return of the Jedi has the worst changes!  From the BS musical number in Jabba's palace(the worst addition!!!!), to the stupid additon of the Gungans in the end, and the DUMBEST addition of adding Hayden as Anakin over the old Anakin!  This is idiotic!  If future generations were to see this film and it's 1983 date and see the prequels and their dates, they will ask themselves how was this guy the say age 20 years ago?  He was hardly born.  This is all out stupid!  It again, ruins the original vision of the time.  All in all, I do like the ending a little better as it now does now leave you hanging.  I can now say that I don't need to see anymore Star Wars.  Especially if it will be kidde style from here on out.Should you get it - yes, if you like Star Wars.  It is like you must get it as a fan.  Too much changing can make a man never satisfied and Lucas will always look for something to be wrong and he'll end up making it worse...	5.0	Some of the best DVD's out!

There are countless arguements as to why they shouldn't have been changed and what changing them did to the storyline. It doesn't matter which side you take, there is one simple fact: The Special Edition Trilogy will be the only version to ever be released on DVD.Sure, I have problems with it, but it is essentially the films I grew up loving and I don't personally feel that my extensive DVD collection would be complete without it (Indiana Jones looks so lonely without Star Wars). People of all ages love these movies and the idea that a household would deny itself of Star Wars over a mere 1-3 minute alteration is, to me, absurd. Get over yourselves because boycotting the Special Edition Trilogy won't change a thing! If you want to yell at Lucas over something that can change, yell at him for not yet releasing Howard The Duck on DVD! If you are an avid Classic Trilogy fan and your skin crawls from the moment you see a non-transparent Star Destroyer in New Hope to the celebration on Coruscant in Jedi, then just buy the unliscenced Asian editions on Ebay (accepting all the risks involved, of course). For the rest of us, $42.00 is more than resonable for the trilogy on DVD AND A BONUS DISC! I remember seeing the bootleg trilogy on Ebay for around $100.00 when Episode II first came out! Lucas has never charged more than about $20 for the episodes 1 & 2 and only around $40 for the trilogy. He's not ripping us off, he's actually on par with a classic trilogy that's much better than most others on the shelves. Having said that, the only reason it recieved 4-stars instead of 5-stars is because he doesn't deliver both versions, he doesn't deliver a DTS track, and the fact it doesn't have the shotty christmas special and &quot;From Star Wars To Jedi&quot;. Even though I didn't expect them, they are what keeps this from being, in my opinion, a true 5-star boxed set.As for waiting for a six-disc edition post Episode III, I'm not sure it'll be worth it. He's probably not going to do anything else with the original trilogy (listen to Lucas, folks, you'll never get the original on DVD!). Episode I & II have so many special features I doubt they'll ever expand, and Episode III won't be out until late next year! I'm sure if you wait a boxed set will come out, but it'll only be a packaged version of what we've already got. Go for it, it's okay, you spent nearly $30 to see the special edition trilogy in the theatre, everyone did! Drop another $40, get the trilogy, and stop fearing the mild possibility that you may have to purchase another boxed set in the next two years in order to get a few extra features you won't watch.	4.0	Finally!

But the beauty of these movies is that it was the first real science fiction movie that swept the nation by storm. George Lucas had very little money making episode 4 &quot; A new hope &quot; but he pulled out a masterpiece. Everyone pretty much knows the story line, Luke Skywalker( Mark Hamil ) seeks revenge on the empire for killing his aunt and uncle. Him and Obi Wan Kanobi buy a ride with the ever fiesty Han Solo( Harrison Ford ) to find princess the dangerd Princess Leia( Carrie Fischer.) The rest of the movie is pure genius at its best.

It must be stressed that these disks do NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED VERSIONS OF THE FILMS.  It should also be noted that Lucas's decision not to do so because he claims that the original negatives were lost is blatantly false considering the fact that they had to transfer the originals from somewhere to do the digital re-editing for the re-mastered editions in the first place.

It's nice to have the movies in widescreen, and the picture and sound transfer is amazing.  The movies really don't like they were released over twenty years ago at all, it's sweet.  As for the changes made to the movies themselves, who cares?  Sure, they aren't THE original movies, but I'm not going to whine about it like so many devoted hardcore fans of the movies have been since this set was released.  Besides, this is exactly how Lucas wanted the movies to be, so if they were really such devoted fans, they would be happy about that.  Regardless, I think the Star Wars DVD set is definitely worth buying, and the changes made to the movies aren't a big deal, so just get over them and buy it already, because it's sweet!	5.0	So it's not THE original trilogy, who cares?	2005-05-03	9	3	6

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"Its amazing that its taken so long for these movies to hit DVD, and I must say that in some ways it was worth the wait, but in others I do feel a bit let down by some of the bonus features. While I loved Empire of Dreams (I had no idea the original trilogy was so frustrating for him) I had hoped that From Star Wars to Jedi would make it to the set. I also can't seem to find any deleted scenes. This doesn't mean, however, that they didn't include some of the most comprehensive making-of featurettes for this trilogy that I have ever seen, but somehow I had hoped for more.In many ways I'm suprised to see this trilogy released now, as I had originally thought that Lucas would wait until Episode 3 was released and then publish these DVDs. What's sad is his reasons for releasing them now. ""A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now."" He told CNN. Kind of scary that piracy has gotten so bad that these kind of fears are out there. Can you imagine a world without the movie industry? I can't. But at least we have these movies on DVD finally!As for the films themselves, minor things have been changed and tweaked, yes. However the story remains the same as the classic trilogy. These are also the versions of the film that Lucas has declared the ""finished"" version. They're beautiful, vibrant, and just as entertaining as their ""original"" counterparts, only with better looking special effects. My honest opinion is that while the Star Wars movies may not be the greatest films of all time, they are certainly some of the most fun, and enduring titles, and whether or not Greedo shoots first isn't going to change the fact that these movies are the reason we have the great epics like Lord of the Rings and countless other amazing sci-fi and fantasy classics. This box set is a must own for movie fans of all interests. They're true classics in their own right."	4.0	The Holy Trilogy on Holy DVD	2004-09-22	16	7	9

I truly believe all six were the greatest films of all time and would be astonishing on blu-ray. Lets face it, the blu-ray was built for these movies!! Put all six together with iv-vi and i-iii with the original and special editions. One down side to this is the whole 'where do we go from here thing' which is something that Lucas will have deal with eventually anyway.	5.0	I agree with the review who wants it all.	2008-12-01	6	2	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A65SODERGG0T5	Daniel E Nadler	Ok, first off I really like Star Wars. However I do not like when chefs add way too much pepper and salt to an otherwise perfect dinner, and that is precisly what George Lucas is doing. Now I do not know about anyone else, but I love the look of the star wars films, everything seems to have a rustic, throw-together look about them which I think is great. However when it ventures off to another world it becomes no longer the star wars that I and fans alike remember and feel in love with. Now on to my real complaint. The DVDs are cool and the sound is good, which is a no-brainer, there is one thing lacking. THE DELETED SCENES. Ok the films were already blockbusters and they made their mark, so lets now present them in the uncut presentation. I mean, you can't have Luke Skywalker comment on a conversation, while giving C3P0 an oil bath, that never existed in the film. That is bad story telling. You do see the pictures in the gallery section of the bonus disk. Another example is that are we to assume that Han Solo automatically forgives Lando for turning him over to Vader? There is a scene in which they meet after blowing up Jabba's sail barge and they do indeed forgive each other, becoming blasting off into space. Another gapping hole, which ironically was the first scene of the movie that they shot and can be seen in the trailer on the bonus disk. and the list goes on and on. I keep my rating at 3 stars because the bonus disk does acknowledge the existance of these scences, but they are sadly missing. Just alternate angles and extended scenes can offer much more possibilites. How can every other director not be afraid of putting out director's cuts of their movies? Who cares if they are bad, at least we will see where you were originally going with character development. Star Wars is suffering, because it has just become a money making scheme, but at least we fans out there will have our original VHS versions to keep the dream alive. I really hope and wish that he will make and distribute the Director's Cut of Star Wars, at least a new hope. However I will never have a new hope of Lucas preserving and untanting the vision and simplicity that inspired us so much.	3.0	Biggs?	2004-09-25	11	7	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2PDC6SESC021Q	Daniel	Face it, Star Wars is the best trilogie ever created.  It is creative, has great special effects, great writing, and good writing.  That's all a movie needs.  In this review I will indivually review each of the the three movies in this amazing series.  First of all I need to review the movie that started it all, the movie that started one of the biggest franchises of all time...That movie being Star Wars episode four: A new Hope...Star Wars episde IV is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  The writing is amazing the story goes a little something like this...  On the desert planet of Tatooine a young boy named Luke Skywalker is living with his Aunt and Uncle.  I don't want to give the movie a way so I guess I shouldn't tell you much of the story, that's just enough.  Lucas is a genuis, well a genuis at writing.  It is one of the coolest movies of all time.Next is the Empire strikes back, some say the best of the series.  that is a really good movie.  It is deeper and Darker than the original.  Luke is older,and the movie is scarier.  It begins on the swoy planet of Hoth on that famous battle called the battle of Hoth.  The special effects and writing are even better than the first, and tha's pretty hard to beat.  It is a wonderful movie.  Better than the first.And lastly(my personal favorite of the series) Return of the Jedi.  This is a moving wonderul movie.  The special effects are better than ever in this one.Well to make a long story short the SW series is the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy film ever to hit the market.	5.0	A quickie review.	2002-09-05	0	0	0

Providing ""Special Edition"" versions is interesting and maybe even kind of fun, but only if you can view the original unaltered version.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1ZSUBG2HUUU9F	Daniel	"Like a lot of other people, I found the addition of Greedo's shooting at Han first rather annoying, though they seemed almost simultaneous, so I just tell myself it was Han's laser blast richocheting off the wall.Anyhow, the picture quality is vastly improved, there are a few extra scenes with CGI that were impossible back in 1977-1983, and it's widescreen! If nothing else, at least you don't have to wait five seconds before you can read the entire first line of the opening STAR WARS scrolling script.The bonus material is great. You learn a great many things... like, they used potatoes for some of the far meteors, Harrison Ford (Han Solo) wanted to be killed off in the third movie, George Lucas was so stressed he went to the hospital, the Title of Return of The Jedi was changed at the last minute, and much more.You also learn of the struggle behind the production of Star Wars, earn more respect for Mark Hammel's performance, and there is a great deal of running commentary by all of the still-living actors. The man who played Chewbacca is 7'3""! And yes, he speaks. C-3PO's actor is quite funny, and then of course there's R2-D2's.."	4.0	Very nice quality, a few disappointments...	2006-01-02	5	4	1

I am only 22 and I hate the special edition changes.2- There are errors and lighting corrections that haven't been fixed. This is just not a very good cut even if you don't care about the Theatrical versions.3- One of the bonus discs include 7+ hours of extras while 2 of the discs include 3.5 hours of footage seems like they are skimping on the extras.	1.0	Poor enhancements plus no non-edited version	2011-09-05	10	8	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"STAR WARSEPISODE IV, V, & VI:  TIMELESS CLASSICSIt was history in the making in the world of Hollywood, beforeGeorge Lucas went over to the Dark Side with the prequels.  In1977, Lucas created Star Wars Episode IV-A New Hope, littleexpecting that this movie would go to box-office light-speed andgain him a name in cinema history.  This was the saga of anidealistic farmboy named Luke Skywalker, son of a fallen JediKnight, and his quest to seek out not only a princess but hisown destiny.  Luke, Obi-Wan Kenobi, two droids, the squat butvery versatile R2-D2 and the cowardly Tin Man, C-3PO, Corellianspace pirate Han Solo and the Wookiee Chewbacca immortalizedthemselves in the psyches of Boomer and Generation-X'ers.  TheMos Eisley Cantina, with its plethora of exotic creatures, thedesert world of Tatooine, the moon-sized planet-destroying DeathStar of Grand Moff Tarkin, the rickety saucer-shaped MillenniumFalcon, and dogfights between X-Wings and Tie Fighters set thestandard for science fiction films thereafter.  Viewers wouldalso meet Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, who wouldsymbolize the evil that was the Galactic Empire.  Menacing inhis skull-like helmet, armour, black cloak, and his ominousbreathing apparatus, Darth Vader became my favorite Star Warscharacter.Indeed, he gained prominence in The Empire Strikes Back, thebest of the trilogy, featuring Snow Walkers, asteroid fields,some hot-shot flying by Han Solo, cities in the clouds, andwizened Jedi Masters from whom we learned that ""luminous beingsare we, not this crude matter.""  Yoda demonstrated the triumphof the human will when he levitated Luke's X-wing from theswamps of Dagobah.  Luke's harrowing adventure in the cave was aclue to what he would learn later.  Empire featured the properdebut of the bounty hunter Boba Fett, whose armoured array ofweaponry, cunning, and guile served the Empire well.  A pity theother bounty hunters were seen all too briefly.The trilogy wrapped up in Return Of The Jedi, where Luke, Lando,Princess Leia went to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, thenprepare in time for the climactic battle against the Empire andDeath Star Mark II, and a shot at getting Emperor Palpatinehimself.  Luke learned the truth about his father and readiedhimself for the confrontation with Vader and the Emperor.  Themonsters at Jabba's palace exceeded the cantina scenes, withJabba representing the ultimate in Phil Tippett's creations.However, I do prefer the original Max Rebo music number.  And asfor the Ewoks, yes, ""short help is better than none,"" and atleast the revamped edition did away with their cutesy dancenumber.  And the space battle was the perfect special effectstriumph with just the right excitement, not the numbing digitalblast of sound and noise that permeates today's movies.All three of these movies played a formative role in mychildhood.  These three videos are the revamped editions, andmost of the new scenes add to the original cuts of the movieswithout ruining them.  It is the triumphant dialogue andappealing characters that make the original trilogy classics intheir time.  Who can forget such memorable lines as ""I felt asif millions of voices had cried out, and were suddenlysilenced,"" ""Don't you call me a mindless philospher, youoverweight blob of grease!"", ""Garbage!  What a really wonderfulidea!  What an incredible smell you've discovered!"", ""Look atthe size of that thing!""  and ""He's got to follow his own path,no one can choose it for him.""So remember, a Jedi's strength flows in embracing the GoodTrilogy, A New Hope, Empire, and Jedi.  But beware the DarkTrilogy--Menace, Clones, and the one yet to come.  Once youstart down the dark path, forever will it dominate yourdestiny.  So trust your feelings, and may the Force be with you."	5.0	A long time ago, in a trilogy far away....	2002-07-12	12	7	5

Frankly I'm not happy with this because the box is definatly cooler then the old one. Who wouldn't want the original picturing on their box of star wars? But the fact remains that Lucas is squeezing the life from the trilogy by reselling and reselling the old material in new packaging. When will he stop? Maybe start giving us newer editions of Indiana Jones instead.Buy this edition if you haven't already been scammed into buying his last year edition. Like I said, the box is definatly way cooler, but the principles that Lucas is displaying is sorry indeed for the market, heck forget the market.

You don't seem to realize that George Lucas created these movies, they are his vision, and just because we made them popular, it is his right to release whatever version HE feels is the best representation.  Plus you should realize that he will eventually release the original version to get some sales when everything has slowed down after episode three.  As for the movies themselves, they are classics.  For most folks who grew up with them, you know the dialogue, you know the characters, you know that there will never be movies that you love as much, what more is there to say?	5.0	Best movies ever	2004-09-04	18	5	13
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1WIS5FQGUWDOF	Daniel M. Hixon	Well, I had heard all of the rumors that George Lucas was changing our beloved trilogy even MORE for the DVD release, so it was with some fear and trembling that I watched them for the first time.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Many of the changes undid or softened some of those from Special Edition that everyone hated.  Now in A New Hope for example, Han and Greedo pretty much shoot at the same time, and it looks much less awkward.  Jabba looks a whole lot more like Jabba, and they finally made Darth Vader's lightsaber red in those places where it once was white!  I think there are a couple of places in ROTJ where the score was changed for the 'Special Edition' and has now been changed back.  This is good for me because the new music was always a little disorienting, it wasn't supposed to be there.  The lightsaber duel of ANH looks 'worlds better' than any previous release.  In fact the visual quality in general is stunning!  The same goes for the other movies as well!  The snow battle on Hoth looked really nice, I think they added a great quantity of blaster fire being exchanged...  The visual quality alone I think was worth the price.  Watching it on wide screen helped me feel more 'in' the movie.  There were a couple of points in Ep.IV at which the sound was kind of funny, but that may have been a result of watching it on my laptop - I'm not sure.  Also the special features were nice, watching the old trailers was a bit nostalgic.  The menus on the DVDs and all of the art work is VERY well done, I must say.  On the whole, I feel like I got much more than my money's worth - the Force is definitely with this one!	5.0	pleasant surprise	2004-10-15	12	9	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2MCC9L0YDQAA6	Daniel Mullen	"The original ending scene with the older actor (his name escapes me, sorry) who played Anakin/Vader after being ""de-masked"" makes no sense because, assuming your eyes are functioning correctly, you'll notice his face looks completely unblemished and scar-free.  Anakin was severely wounded/burned at the end of ""Sith"", when he was in his 20s.  Therefore it makes no sense to see the older vision of Anakin in his, say, 40s with no visible injury to his face and head - which is what is seen in the original ending scene in ""Jedi"".The new addition of Hayden Christiansen in this scene makes more sense continuity-wise because we see him the way he appeared just before turning to the dark side.  Some of Lucas's other changes can surely be second-guessed, but the more minor changes made for the sake of continuity make perfect sense.

If that's so, it should be pointed out that I'm &#34;reviewing&#34; the VHS version.Star Wars is Star Wars, and I don't feel a need to explain how great it is. The VHS tapes I purchased, in particular those released in 1995, were the &#34;last time&#34; the films were sold on that medium without subsequent additions and changes. Presumably, the DVDs released in 2008 also contained those versions, but the price to this day is somewhat ludicrous.I had immense doubts that tapes in &#34;new&#34; condition still existed, but I managed to get them. Everything was there, including the long expired coupons, but more importantly they all still work. If you have a VCR, then you can't ask much more.	5.0	Yes, VHS Still works	2014-05-08	3	1	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1QKKCVQC4BZT	Danilo Pochini	ok, I understand that people who own the Trilogy already might be disappointed by this VHS release. But I'm sure Episode II and III will be released on DVD . And then they'll also release the other films on DVD for you whiners. Anyway, the reason this Trilogy is being released so often, is simply that it's so good. George Lucas wants everyone to experience it, and I'm sure people who liked last year's Episode I will want to see it. People who think they have to buy it because it's STAR WARS, are crazy. Why do you have to buy this if you already own it? George wants to do something truly spectacular with star wars on dvd.

That is is impressive in itself, but director George Lucas is going to make it work.The last three of a six movie long story tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young man with an unbelievable destiny.  Episode IV: A new hope, begins with the display of domination in the galaxy by the Empire, as they attack a diplomatic mission.  It is the introduction of Darth Vader, the bad guy, as he shows is physical and mental strength over those who have no power and control over 'the force'.  Episode IV shows the upbringing of Luke Skywalker and the beginning of his training in 'the force'.Episode V shows that although a major setback to the Empire, the rebel alliance has not destroyed the tyrannical domination of Darth Vader and his master known simply as 'The Emperor'.  Also in Episode V, Darth Vader reveals a secret that shocked moviegoers.Episode VI shows the rebuilding attempts of the empire, Luke shows his newly developed abilities as he begins to develop as a young Jedi master.  In this final and gripping finale, Luke comes face to face with the emperor as the struggle between good and evil is taken to the climactical finish.	5.0	It's Star Wars...what else can I say	2001-10-15	0	0	0

The revamps to these movies wouldn't be a bad thing if they were integrated well.  The primary disappointment with this box set is the absence of the original films.

The picture restoration is outstanding and the bonus material is up to the standards of the Episode I and II discs. I won't go into detail since Amazon has listed everything that you need to know. I do have some quibbles however. The first is the sound quality in A New Hope. I'm not sure if it's my old Sony TV (it dates back to the 1980's) but the sound constantly alternates between sounding great and sounding like it does on VHS. Secondly would be some of the changes in the movies. In a way, I like them as they help to bridge the age gap between the old trilogy and the new one. Things like improved ligthsaber effects and cleaned up space sequences are nice but they do, to a certain extent, take away from the classic feel of the old movies. My biggest complaint about the changes is the fact that Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi.But shortcomings aside, this release is worth the price.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2MMCLX0MW54X2	darkmyst1	Well, I enjoyed the set.  I bought it the week it came out, just like all the other Star Wars sets that have come before.  I have the original set from the early 80's, the letterbox version, the re-release version of the mid 90's, the special editions and now the DVDs.I have three versions of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones on DVD, let's not go into all the other Star Wars stuff I just can't seem to part with in 20+ years of collecting ect, ect....Suffice it to say, I am a huge Star Wars fan.  Oh yea, and I am a mid-30 year old gal.With all that in mind, here is my humble review.I loved the set.  It was crisp, clear, clean, the picture is absolutely gorgeous.  The soundtrack is so clear, you can't hear any distortions.  If this is what we have been waiting for all these years, fine with me!The Bonus material is really cool. There are a few documentaries, specials & TV commercials.  I loved watching the old trailers. I remembered them as soon as I saw them!  Very cool.  I wish they had added the older CBS docu-special that they did in '79 or '80 with C-3PO & R2-D2, my taped copy is in really bad shape.  That is fun to watch just to see them bickering.I haven't seen them all, but I have seen two so far.  Well worth the price of the set on their own.For the changes:1.  The Emperor/Vader scene in The Empire Strikes Back -  I think it flows a bit better.  And having Ian in the scene is much more believable.2.  Biggs scene in Star Wars:  A New Hope.  It's a bit out of place since you don't see the friendship with the two developed a bit more.  I believe the only way to see those scenes are on the Insiders CD-ROM of a few years back (and the novel).  So I was able to piece that together in my mind, but I suspect that the new fan or someone who was a casual viewer might go, who is that?3.  The biggest change of course is Hayden replacing Sebastian Shaw.  Okay, I'll admit it, this was the one and only time I cringed for a Star Wars update.  I thought why?  But, I have to eat my words.  It *worked*.  I liked the effect.  Now, I will say they should have gone a step further:  Where is Qui-Gon?  If they went as far as changing out Sebastian, where is Qui-Gon?  hmm?  you know, the guy who found our little bundle of midi-chlorians?  But back to Hayden, the effect was believable, it looked like he was there back in '83.  Do I miss Sebastian?  No.  Why? I have 4 prior sets of VHS tapes that are mine forever to watch when I want to see the big guy.  More Star Wars to watch and enjoy.Nit-picks:I want the added scenes.  Where is Luke on Tatooine fixing the vaporators, hanging with Biggs?  Yea, I listened to the commentary for Star Wars, I heard what George said.  Bonus disk, Bonus George...  I want the sandstorm scenes in RoTJ, I want R2's run in with a wampa...  At least they are on the CD-Roms, but still.  I am very greedy.Let's face it, these movies were written and released 20 + years ago.  Qui-Gon and crew were not yet around, so George is attempting to tie the whole series together.  I think he is doing a good job at it.  The changes flow, they don't leap! out at you saying, hey I'm a new scene, yoo hoo!The reason they seem that way to most older fans is simply because we are used to seeing the movie a certain way for over 20 years.People reading this may wonder why on earth I am happy there are all these changes.  I remember the 80's, after 1983 when Return was out. I remember all the years when Star Wars was done, gone and pretty much forgotten.  There were the West End game books, and that, folks, was it.  One thing I would get so upset about is you could find book ater book on Star Trek, nothing on Star Wars. It was pretty pathetic for the Star Wars fan.  Then the mid 90's came, Timothy Zahn and the new movies.  Star Wars has been back ever since.At the end of the day, would I like to have the older versions?  Sure. But, I am of the opinion the more Star Wars the better.  So, in my mind, George, thanks!  Bring it on, new & old, updates & special.  The more Star Wars from the Father of the Force, is fine by this Star Wars fangirl.	5.0	Star Wars is finally here, on DVD  thank you George!	2004-10-03	16	11	5

I remember begging my parents to stay and see the movie again when an announcement came on saying we could stay and see it again for free.I enjoyed seeing the additions to the DVD. I have seen these movies many times. It truely is like seeing them again for the first time. The scene that suprised me the most was the fight with the Rancor in RETURN OF THE JEDI. It didn't look like it was shot in front of a blue screen.I don't blame George Lucas for wanting to complete these movies. I wish he had put the other deleted scenes in STAR WARS. I have bought all but one release of these movies. I feel if we want to see the whole story completed, we should buy the different versions of the films. To help fund the making of the new movies. Didn't George Lucas say that the black box set of the original version of the trilogy was going to be the last?The main reason I like DVD's is for the added scenes and special features. You didn't get all of these wonderful features on the old VHS tapes. You can not satisfy everyone. In my opinion the pros definitely outweigh the cons.  If you are a fan of the STAR WARS films, go and buy the DVD. I think it is worth it.	5.0	What is the big deal?	2004-09-29	15	8	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"Enough has been written about how much some fans dislike the changes that Lucas made to his movies from the Greedo shooting first controversy in A NEW HOPE to the inserting of prequel star Hayden Christenson at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. So, I do not plan to address those to ad nauseum, suffice to say I think the movies were perfect the way they were originally released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively.I was one of the generation of young movie-goers who, after learning of this movie on the school playground, persuaded my mother shortly after my sixth birthday to drive 65 miles to see the movie at a small Scottish movie theater,I am assuming that people are familiar with the storylines of these three movies that chronicle the journey of farmboy Luke Skywalker from a remote desert planet to interplanetary hero and rising Jedi master.Regardless how you feel about the movies as they exist today, you cannot help but admit that this is an impressive set. After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named ""Empire of Dreams"" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection."	5.0	Well worth the wait - a truly impressive set	2005-07-29	4	2	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1WT9ACIQHI7ZH	Darth Vader	"George,I appreciate your attempt to clean up matte lines, wonky lightsabers, and improve sound and picture quality in your Blu-ray release.However, I don't understand why you want to make jarring changes to your characters that make once powerful cinematic moments now creepy or distracting.A lot of people have made the case for Han shooting first (as in the theatrical cut) in Episode IV being a much more interesting and accurate characterization, so I'm not going to touch that.This review is going to be principally about the changes you made to scenes with me in it.For instance, in the original cut, when I throw Emperor Palpatine down the death star's reactor shaft, there is a moment of silent deliberation where, oscillating my expressionless masked face back and forth, I decide whether or not to sacrifice my life for the life of my son.  The lack of dialogue allows the viewer to read more subtlety and indecisiveness into this act, and the silence is truer to my character's previous dialogue in films IV-VI.In this release, you decided to have me scream ""NO! NOOOOO!"" at the very beginning of the scene, removing any of the subtlety or conflict, inserting a goofy, lamely comic line not befitting of my badassness, and consequently dulling the emotional significance of a father's redemptive sacrifice of his son.What's worse, you replace Sebsastian Shaw's peaceful and redeemed ghostly image on endor with Hayden Christiansen's garish, creepy, pedefile-like smirk.Not only does this not make any sense, because the last time I was alive (on the Light or the Dark side) I looked like Sebastian Shaw, and Obi-Wan and Yoda's ghosts look exactly as they did before they died... but again, Hayden's horrible acting and the visual unevenness of the three actors blunt what could have been a great, emotionally significant scene.The scene starts great with Mark Hamill's excellent contemplative stare, coupled with peaceful acting from Sir Alec Guinness, but it ends with Hayden Christiansen's disgusting smirk, ruining what was one of the emotional high points and one of the key resolutions of the trilogy.I keep trying to Skype you - please pick up so I can force choke you and prevent you from making any more changes to your movies.Sincerely,Darth Vader"	1.0	George Lucas successfully ruins the most emotional moments of his own movies	2011-09-02	26	24	2

Personally, I jumped for joy when I read about these changes - an updated Jabba, better lightsaber effects, Ian McDiarmid in Episode V, and Hayden Christensen as Anakin - these changes tie the saga together as it should be. The prequels so far have been superb, and I believe Episode III will be the best Star Wars film of all. I will always be grateful to George Lucas for the joy he's given me with these movies, and seeing these changes, as well as the beautiful picture quality of the DVDs, is the best gift he could have given me.

I have built a home theater system in anticipation of that day when I can sit in my recliner and immerse my self in ""A galaxy far, far away..."" I plan on turning the volume up so the neighbors can here the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader. But my excitement is, like a good Jedi, tempered. What about the famous Toshi Station scene? Or the Biggs on Tatooine conversation with Luke? These scenes (Well the Toshi Station scene does I am not sure about the Biggs scene still existing. There are still pictures in the original Star Wars storybook.) still exist. Why aren't these listed on the DVDs?  I think Mr. Lucas could have done something that no one has. He could have asked the fans what they want to see on the DVDs. Maybe he could have advertised it as ""Make your voice heard! Cast you vote at [...] to see what should be on the DVDs"" I know that is unprecedented but so were the Star Wars films. I also have mixed emotions about only the Special Editions available on DVD. Sure these movies do belong to George Lucas and he can do what he wants with them but...not really. Sure he owns all legal rights and intellectual rights etc, etc, etc. The movies have been adopted by so many people that allowing us to see only the Special Editions is like only being able to see your children if they have been cleaned up.

So while I'm all for the Special Edition changes like expanding Cloud City or fixing bad effects shots, things like making Vader say ""NOOO!"" in Jedi by clearly using the same exact piece of audio that was in Episode III are stupid and hurt the impact of the film.The films were fine as they were. If you want to polish the effects because you couldn't do so in 1983, fine. But changing the context of scenes ... it just hurts the legacy of these films. The Vader sequence at the end of Jedi that has been changed was one of the few perfect moments in that film.

Yes, there's charm in a Model T, but there's also charm in newer models. Listening to fans who like the original version better, Lucasfilm put out this version with old and new together- have to buy two copies? No!

Then I came here, and well, saw mostly 1 star reviews and knew something was awry. I haven't heard many good things about George Lucas in a long time.  I cannot totally judge the outcome until I see it myself.  Although I absolutely agree he should release a original version of at least the original 2, V and VI or whatever.  Why didn't he release them in the right order in the first place?  Wait, scratch that.  It's a good thing because jar jar blabber a lot really ruined it for me.  C3po was kind of like that, but the rest of it was way too awesome.  So he might of ruined them by the time he got around to making the V and VI. I don't know why he has to have the babbling idiot in every movie?  Maybe that should tell us something?Yes he was a visionary. This is why the first 2 movies were such a breakthrough at the time.

He has a point about them being ""his"" films, but I didn't agree with his points about most artists wanting to go back and change their work. I'd say a lot are satisfied with their final products, especially non-commercial artists. And how many filmmakers go back and change their movies 20 years after the fact? Part of filmmaking is working within the boundaries set for you, and that's not just technologically. The acting isn't always what you wanted, you had to alter the lighting after the fact, etc. But you move on to something else. Lucas is in love with his own creation, and what a creation it is, but for him to say he only liked 25 to 30 percent of it? Heck, give me back the other 75 or 70 percent and see if The Empire Strikes Back gets made. Simple fact: the 1977 version of Star Wars was the film that eventually made him billions, yes, billions of dollars.

Surprisingly, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Rocky horror picture show next year director Jim Sharman will be releasing a special edition of the cult classic in which new songs will be added to the film and old favorites will be cut out because Sharman doesn't like those songs. Sharman says its his movie and that he has the right to have the songs he wants in the film even if the film has already been out for 30 years.After hearing that the Rocky Horror picture show was going to have a special addition Sylvester Stallone thought a Special Rocky should be considered as well. To the surprise of many it appears that Rocky will actually defeat Apollo Creed in the first movie. When asked about the obvious character arc conflict this will create with the rest of the series Stallone was heard to have said he always meant to beat Creed in the first movie but due to time and budget constraints the version with Creed winning had to be used. As for any character arc problems Sly quipped ""I have no idea what that even means""Perhaps most controversially of all is James Cameron's choice to change the ending of his biggest movie Titanic. Cameron apparently was so overwhelmed by fan reaction to the Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson love story that Cameron has decided to ""give Jack back to the fans"" and produce an ending where they live happily ever after. The iceberg actually misses Titanic in this version and as the mighty ship sails into New York Harbor Cal Hockley (the fianc&eacute; of Rose) realizes that Jack and rose were destined to be together and heartily congratulates the happy couple in what insiders say is a most touching scene. Cameron is apparently so taken by this new version that he will soon be sweeping out all other versions of this film and is even going so far as to ask people to surrender their old copies of the original film. Cameron is even considering going after a court order to ensure the original film is never shown again anywhere.Other classics are sure to undergo the same treatment as time goes on. Rumors are swirling around films like Jaws, The sixth sense, grease and even the Ten Commandments. George Lucas should be proud of himself. The film pioneer has struck new ground yet again. It was sheer genius to edit his films years after their release and fans everywhere can't wait to see where it will all end."	1.0	Breaking News	2004-09-29	55	35	20

I have never dressed like one of the characters of the Star Wars movies in private or public, and I am grounded in reality, neither I, nor anyone I know can ""use the Force"". That being said, I was thrilled when I learned about the Star Wars Trilogy box-set. I picked it up the first day it was available. I knew beforehand that I was buying the 97 re-released films and not the original versions. I didn't care, I was very willing to hand over the $40 for these remastered movies. The DVD's are well worth the money. Sure, there are some changes to the original movies, some addes scenes, some added effects..so what? They don't hamper the story in any way, they add to the visual magic that has always made the Star Wars series so jaw-dropping, and so much fun to watch. I won't bother reviewing the individual movies, because the odds are good anyone reading this has already seen them scores of times. But, I do want to note, that the bonus 4th disk is really great. The ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary is informative and fun to watch, and really shows how much hard work Lucas and company put into these films. This disk is a must-view for fans of the films, and will increase your appreciation for all of the movies ten-fold.I wondered if the Star Wars Trilogy would hold up well, I mean I was 8 years old when the first one hit the theaters and was amazed by the movie. I was completely sucked into the story, and became a fan of the series right away. Now I have a six year old son, and I wondered if he would like the films, or if they would seem out-dated and lame compared to what is available to kids today. I popped in ""A New Hope"" on Saturday, and was able to enjoy Star Wars in a whole new way, through the eyes of my son. He was soon absorbed in the story, and carried away by the magic only Star Wars can perform. Right after the film ended, he asked if we could watch it again, and was delighted when I told him there were still 2 more movies to go. We have watched them all now, finishing ""Return of the Jedi"" last night....and now he wants to watch them all again starting tonight. Sure, Lucas changed some of the scenes, added some stuff, but the magic is still there, just ask my six year old."	5.0	Great DVD Treatment For A Great Trilogy	2004-09-29	8	5	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2YH8L1J2FE1C6	David J. Ambrozi	First off for the people who complain about the changes to the films, I have some compassion for you, but if you are a true blue fan like me, you have to get over it as I have. You can forget about seeing the original films on dvd unless you get them pirated. George made the changes because he thinks it tells the story more completely. The buzz now is the next release of the movies will be in 3-D. Now on to the review. Ok here goes. A new hope is I think a near perfect movie now with the changes,the tweaked trench run is really breathtaking and I love the improved Jabba/Han part as well. Really the only bad part is when the big beast walks right in front of camera when Ben and Luke are getting into Mos Eisley.  In the case of Empire you have to get used to the changes because the film was perfect the way it was. The biggest change to Empire is the added stuff with the wampa which I don't think was needed, and Mark Hamill has a couple of extra lines. They also redid the emperor's transmission with vader on the star destroyer which did not bother me much at all. It spruces up the film a bit. There is also a little more of when Boba Fett follows the Falcon to Bespin. The worst change to empire is when Leia and Lando are fleeing cloud city. There is an added part of Vader going to his ship, who cares we know where he is going, it screws up the tempo of the film,when it was perfect the way it was. Jedi's changes are I think the least important of the 3 film's. The improved sarlac pit is nice,and they added a lot to the band's performance in Jabba's palace, also a little when the slave girl is killed at Jabba's. And they added some parts at the end that shows different places celebrating when the empire is defeated. (Corusant, Tatooine,cloud city,etc.) and a little added ewok partying too, (of course). But the one change that bothers most people including myself is Hayden at the end, which I can't understand because Yoda and Ben's vision's were in their old form, and then you put in the young Anakin. But some one will have to take that up with George. The bonus disc has the empire of dreams documentry, which is really great. The birth of the lightsaber was pretty good as well. The other two documentries are enjoyable, but I think the really diehard fans might like the production stills and the trailers. The improved sound and picture alone is reason enough to buy because the digital remastering is breathtaking, it sometime's makes me feel like I'm 6 again, (PRICELESS). One good idea they had was an audio channel for all three film's that has commentary from the film makers and still has the film's sound at a lower volume. I thought the bonus features disc could have been a little better. But the reason I say that is because the original star wars trilogy is the best sci-fi saga ever told, and because the bonus disc that comes with Attack of the clones is so awesome. Well that's my 2 cents worth if you have too many doubts try renting before you buy. May the force be with you! P.S. Now that 1,2,3, are done A.O.T.C. and R.O.T.S. are the two good films. Clones is much better than Sith because more Natalie Portman, a better story, and come on, that lightsabre battle between Obiwan and Anakin while somewhat spectacular is completely unrealistic. They both would have been killed at about 8 mins in. As they do in Sith about 40X. End of review SWIPE!!

Well, she actually sat down with me one night and we watched all three of them in a marathon - how can you not marry a girl who would do something like that?  (We're married now...)For those of you looking for an actual professional take on this best rendition of the series to-date, I suggest you look up the very recently posted 2-page review of this actual box set on the [...] web site.  I have been reading this site's careful analyses of DVDs since 1999 and trust them tremendously.  In fact, the main editor on the site is one of the founders of the infamous petition letter that convinced Lucas to issue these movies on DVD.  In short, the editor LOVES this set and admits they're the BEST you've ever seen AND heard these films.  And he actually APPROVES of most of the digital edits that Lucas took the creative liberty to do(The website also has screenshots and side-by-side comparisons of the edits).In short, these movies are going to be so thrilling when they are released a few short weeks from now, but don't be surprised if there are even more deluxe high-definition versions of these movies offered several years down the road.  Enjoy!P.S. It's silly for folks to vote this review not useful.  Because NOBODY who has written reviews has had access to a preview of this box set, the information I provide is of great relevance.  I offer not just my opinion, but provide references for more informed information - how could that NOT be useful?  Silly, silly...P.S.S. Not to mention the fact that my review actually offers SOME of you hope that your interest in Star Wars might actually get a girl interested in you at some point...  :-)	5.0	Will be the BEST way to see these movies yet!	2004-09-11	12	6	6

Just because a movie has a Star Wars logo on it does not make it any good.  Pairing awful acting and obvious and pathetic digital effects have made the pre-quil trilogy sad and insulting at best.  If anyone out there likes Star Wars, and wants to watch a great movie, episodes 4-6 are it.  This is a great set, some of the greatest films ever concieved.  But, as I said, Mr. Lucas has lost his mind.  He keeps ""improving"" the originals-making them worse.  Ep. 4-6 looked real, maybe a little sketchy but nonetheless real.  Adding shotty digital effects all over the place greatly cheapens these films, and since we will never see the classic original cut movies on DVD, I suggest everyone buys this right away, before old George Lucas does anymore damage.

Of course.  But does he choose to use that power to set an example, or to placate his own ego?I think the answer's pretty obvious when you consider Lucas's stubborn refusal to acknowledge the original versions of the films that inspired so many of us.  I'm not saying that by supporting Lucas in the past (i.e. purchasing tickets, toys, videos, and other various merchandise) that we're automatically entitled to a reward for our loyalty.But wouldn't it be nice if Lucas would decide to present us with a gift?  Namely, the chance to enjoy his original works of art, and to honor not only his past efforts, but also the work of the various artists that collaborated with him?I guess one can only dream.....Or maybe I should blame myself..... for spending so much time dreaming about someone else's creations, instead of focusing on my own.Oh well..... blasted Lucas!!!	1.0	Lucas abusing his power.....what about the ORIGINALS?!?	2004-09-21	21	19	2

THE Star Wars Trilogy is the most influential series in History. Lucas created a Masterpiece of Since Fiction and Drama that is in a category all it's own. It is a classic tale of Good Vs Evil on a personal and universal Level. Since DVD format became mainstream this is the one that every collector has been beating down the Door to get.Lucas is a perfectionist and a few years ago he polished the Trilogy up and re-released it as the Special edition. Lucas has decided not to release the Theatrical Edition, causing much murmuring among some fans, but i see no problem here. If Anyone has ever created a work of Art and hung it on their own wall they know that over time you see mistakes and things you'd like to fix and I see it as the Artist right to do so. For those who still wish to see the theatrical edition , watch your VHS! That's about the picture and sound quality you got in the theater anyway.This will be a great set of DVD's Lucas will optimize sound and picture as only ILM can, making this a ceterpiece of home theater as it should be.	5.0	About Bloody Time	2004-06-25	43	15	28

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2QWXHB5IU8LCU	David W. George	"The wait was worth it. The ""Star Wars Trilogy"" DVD set is gorgeous, complete with the three original films (ok, special editions, if you want to get specific), and a superb disc of bonus material, including all the theatrical trailers, TV ads, and a 2 1/2 hour documentary with never before seen footage.What really stands out upon viewing is the picture quality of the films; ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" has been cleaned up so well it doesn't look like a 27 year old film anymore. Same with ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"". These could pass for films made in the 90's.Which brings me back to the new CGI-enhanced scenes. I may be in the minority, but I have no problem with George Lucas' tinkering. In the 1997 special editions, the new footage clashed with the worn look of the original footage. It almost seemed as if you were watching two films.Not anymore. Because the films have been cleaned up so well, the newer scenes blend in much more seamlessly than on the VHS versions. In addition, ""Episode IV""'s Han Solo-Jabba The Hutt scene is improved, thanks to a new, better looking CGI Jabba, modeled after the one used in ""Episode I- The Phantom Menace"". I also loved the inclusion of Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I really feel the films are stronger because of these changes. As for the big change in ""Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi"", I don't have an issue with Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as Anakin's spirit. So much of ""Jedi""'s last 5 minutes were altered in the 1997 special edition, this change hardly matters.Realistically, don't expect this to be the one and only DVD release of these movies. Once ""Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" is released next summer and the series is concluded, a box set of all six films would be the next logical step. Perhaps then, if the fans are still asking for it, we'll get the special editions and the original versions in a complete package. For now, enjoy this. The force is strong with this one!"	5.0	"""IMPRESSIVE.....MOST IMPRESSIVE"""	2004-10-03	9	6	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3H8WXUEG8KLGG	DavidW	"After reading most of the reviews I decided to conduct my own test on my Samsung LED 55"" HDTV. I have the box version with the Portrait of Darth Vader SE, widescreen. After viewing the new Blu-ray version then viewing the older SE version I could see a hugh improvement given to the film quality of being much brighter and clearer but unfortunately I should have not purchased this blu version. Blu-ray technology is great when it comes to newer films being filmed in HD. Lots of the charm of the VHS or older DVD wouldhide the tape, painted diodes on Vader's suit. I'm a hugh fan and grew up watching the theater release back in 1977. I won't get into the Lucas add-ons (I feel as most others do) I recommend purchasing the box set with Vader and Luke fighting on the box with lots of bluelight around them. Another reviewer suggested this and I agree. This gives you both the SE version and the original theater un-altered version. But lots of folks who have these know this and are asking lots of money for a new copy $185. Its too bad that Lucas (control freak) didn't include the original theater version which would have made for a nice contrast. But then again its pretty confusing how many versions Lucas has out there. Too bad he only gets the money, ego and not the emotional tie we all have."	3.0	Brighter, Cleaner but It Is What It Is....	2011-09-17	6	3	3

Yurkovich	In a way it's sad that Mr. Lucas is so tied to this trilogy that he's refused to do anything creative for >30 years since the films were originally released. I'm dismissing RAIDERS because, as I recall, it was a co-creation and not solely Lucas, besides which, only the first of the four Indy films is worth owning IMO. But I digress. As so many others have noted here, Mr. Lucas seems unable to just move on. He chooses instead to re-edit and re-f**k the same movies again and again. The fans who grew up with these films aren't interested in this. Just as we are not interested in a new version of JAWS in which Chief Brody goes into the belly of the shark and hollows it out from the inside. Just as we're not interested in a new version of ALIEN in which we find out that Ripley's ancestors had actually fought off an alien hive and the alien's motive in destroying the crew of the Nostromo was a blood vendetta. Just let it end, George. Suffice to say, I'll be saving my money for a blu-ray release that's worth waiting for, not this revamped nonsense.	1.0	MAKE...HIM...STOP	2011-01-10	30	23	7

Ballin	"Those who have been patiently waiting for the original 3 Star Wars films to appear on DVD might be sorely disappointed with this set. These are NOT the original theatrical releases, but ""upgraded"" versions with new scenes added and the sound re-mixed completely.For me, the sound is the biggest disappointment. The sound effects, particularly explosions and laser blasts are cranked up so high that it interrupts the flow of John Williams' wonderful music, which in this of all films is essential and all but carries certain scenes on its back!Stylistically too, the shiny new chrome colors of this release, as well as all the new CGI effect are inconsistent with the film's 1970's innocence. Like any other film, this one belongs to a certain time and culture, and to ""update"" it like this takes it completely out of any context.I don't know why filmmakers have the urge to revisit their old work. Perhaps it can be attributed to a certain self awareness of yourself as an artist. Sure, we would all like to go back in time and re-do some of the things we think we didn't get quite right the first time, but with art this can be disastrous, as it is here!Mr. Lucas, give us back the original Star Wars movies!"	2.0	Mr. Lucas, give us back our Star Wars!	2004-12-08	6	0	6

Those people and ""old"" effects were what gave the movies so much charm and timelessness.  Those people also slaved for hours and REDEFINED special effects as we know them.  Now most of it is just CGI whipped up in about a years time.  Replacing actors and effects that aren't even that poor is just a show that there is a pure monetarial motivation for doing this.What was so magical and timeless about Star Wars was that you could return to them whenever you wanted and see exactly what you saw the first time.  Now, we have so many different versions floating around no one can remember what's what.  And that's what I find sad about this.  It's deplorable that there is such a lack of respect being paid to the versions that made these films timeless.As far as DVDs go, I'm sure this set will be the new standard.  I'd expect nothing less from Lucasfilm.

Never before has the sound seemed so rich and layered.Never really bothered me about the added on CGI bits, except for two main parts:1) Jabba the Hutt in the first one looks stupid and cartoony. He is supposed to be the most ruthless gangster going, yet Han stands on his tail and Jabba yelps (or whatever he does). They should of not included that part (or added it as a novelty 'extra' on the fourth disc).2) The new dance scene in Jabba's palace is absurd and cringe-makingly out-of-place. The dark, smoke filled atmosphere is turned into a cartoon dance routine.I also liked the original end Ewok theme, which was better than the new one. It would of been nice if Lucas had just cleaned the prints up and left it that - or give the fans an option to buy the 'original' films.Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best of the three (and the six for that matter) remains relatively untouched. The print is cleaned up, dated-special effects errors corrected (transparency in the snowspeeder cock-pits). The only major change is a longer version of Luke versus the Wampa monster - this version is more terrifying for kids, as you see more of the monster eating Luke's transport.Also, in Empire, the actress (apparently it was a woman with chimpanzee's eyes (superimposed) and Clive Revill's voice) who played the Emperor during the hologram communication is changed to Ian McDiarmid (who makes his first physical appearance in Return of the Jedi). Cloud City is revamped, though it looks a bit to fake and cartoonish compared with the original more ethereal set. Though compared with Star Wars: A New Hope and Return of a Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back escapes much of the `revamp.'Despite the arguable flaws (some people may disagree and like the CGI Jabba) this box-set is still worth buying, it still feels like Stars Wars from yesteryear...well, most of the time.	4.0	Standing On Jabba's Tail...	2005-12-16	7	4	3

If your going to replace Darth Vader with a younger version of himself, i.e. the no talent hack that plays him in the recent stars wars movies, then you should also replace Obi-Wan with a younger version as well.P.S. I did like the Ewok song at the end, which was dropped.I wish Lucas would have done like the new release of Alien, and had both his new version and the original version on the disk. I think this would have made the purists happy, and I could have dumped my VHS versions. Now I'm still stuck with both.I don't think I will be convinced to buy any more releases when they happen, as I have no interest in the new star wars films. The new films while being visually good, are hampered by one big problem ( the actors suck, and have the personality of a tree stump ).I am not sure where Lucas dug them up, he must not have been able to get Van Damme or Steven Segal.	4.0	yet another review	2004-10-02	4	1	3

Dent	"Probably one of the greatest movie series/franchises ever (although Lord of the Rings is catching up to it),The Star Wars Saga has became a pop culture phenomenon for almost thirty years.Generations of fans are fascenated by what is essentially the story of Anakin Skywalker,A troubled young Jedi who becomes seduced by the dark side of the force and becomes the evil Darth Vader, only to be redeemed by his son Luke.The first three episodes (I-The Phantom Menace, II-Attack Of The Clones, III-Revenge of The Sith) were made two decades after the original trilogy.Although technecally superior than the original trilogy,they lack the passionate storytelling of the earlier movies.Arriving with universal anticipation from movie goers,I-TPM was a confusing mess with ridiculous dialogue, and clumsy direction(George Lucas hasn't directed a movie in 22 years).Geared more towards children(including the character of Jar Jar Binks),die hard fans cried foul,although the movie made millions.An improvement on TPM,II-AOTC was still a disappointed due to the  script making such talented actors as Natalie Portman,Ewan McGregor,and Hayden Christensen come off as wooden, and stilted.III-ROTS promised to be darker, and and delivers despite it's script and acting flaws.Released in 1977,the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV-A New Hope) was a hit from the start.Made on a low budget ($11M),it pushed the limits of special effects.Although it had a clumsy script,it made up for it with it's beloved charaters including heroic Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill),fiesty Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher),rogue pilot Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and wise Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guiness).Also introduced were the droid duo of R2-D2(Kenny Baker) and C-3PO(Anthony Daniels),and Solo's loveable Wookie sidekick Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew).V-ESB has aged better than the other movies due to it's superior script,direction(Irwin Kirshner) and special effects.The movie has a darker tone as well as an unexpected ending that sets up the next chapter,VI-ROTJ .An uneven mix of the previous movies VI-ROTJ is a bit of a letdown after the brilliant ESB.Wrapping up the events of the series ,it brought the series to a grand end.The DVD edition of the original trilogy includes one disc of extras including behind the scenes,trailers, and other goodies to make the fans drool,including a preview of the yet to be released III-ROTS."	5.0	Finally!!!!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1KFTG09DUO0ME	DEAN  NEEDHAM	If someone asked me what my favorite movies were, I would have to say STAR WARS, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, RETURN OF THE JEDI. The special editions are  real gems, {my favorite versions} and I am so glad that George Lucas is  also releasing the trilogy in special widescreen versions, because you  wouldn`t believe what your missing by not seeing the movies in widescreen.  For example when Luke is observing the sand peoples bantha`s Luke says  &quot;whell there are two bantha`s down there but I dont see any... wait  second there sand peoplke all right I can see one of them now.&quot; In the  widescreen version you will see that sand person through Lukes binaculars,  but in the non-widescreen version {pan &amp; scan} you will not see the  sand person. Not a big deal to some, but theres more although I don`t want  to go into it. All I can say is if you willing to see those black bars at  the top and bottom of you`r t.v buy the widescreen versions. George Lucas  is always hoping that the public will hopefully see the movies in there  best possible format, widescreen is the way to see them.

Children born in the past decade or two will probably be weened on these, while us older folks still struggle to watch the originals.As for the original releases, they are presented as basically a bonus extra, non-anamorphic, and not even close to a full restoration of the special editions.  These are comparable to the Laserdisc-transfer bootlegs that were available on eBay years ago.The real problem is Lucas doesn't care about the old versions.  The new ones are ""his vision"", but he cares little of us older fans who have fond memories of the originals.Vote with your wallet.  I have refused to purchase any of the Star Wars DVDs.

Once disc contains the re-released versions (Around 2000) with changed scenes and effects. The other disc is the unique feature of this set. It is the original (or as close as I have found) release to the originals in the 1970's and early 80s. I have not seen any other set that has these versions other than the old VHS tapes. In my case those were long since worn out, and as a Star Wars Fanatic, I could never enjoy the remastered versions as much. The changes they made (late 90's or early 2000's) were visually impressive but I personally could never enjoy them as much because I was always distracted by the differences. From what I have read, the perception is that George Lucas would prefer that these originals never be re-released but that may just be the rumor mill.	5.0	Exactly What I Was Looking For	2014-03-18	0	0	0

What's the point of wanting the original films released in the seventies? Yes, I was born in the nineties and the first Star Wars film that I saw was Episode I, but the DVD versions are in fact superior to the editions first released. Not only is the picture quality more pristine and crisp, but the CGI added to these editions helps with the continuity to the prequel trilogy. These are the films the way George Lucas envisioned them, he even admits this. He believes that the films released first were only about half of what he wanted them to be, and I agree totally. Trust me, these editions are WAY BETTER than the original films. I hope that George Lucas NEVER re-releases the old versions on DVD, that would be a BIG mistake. Just because the original editions were the ones you adults saw as children doesn't means that us younger generation should have to watch them. We need to look forward instead of backwards. The original editions belong in a museum somewhere. Go out and buy these DVDs. You'll be glad you did.	5.0	These films are the TRUE originals	2005-12-22	36	8	28

I thought it was really kinda neat, some of the things that are in there!  Truthfully, the only time in the first film that newness was even that obvious was the scene before the take-off from Mos Isley, where Jabba accosts Solo for money.  That was obviously CG, but it didn't look that bad.  Lucas brought us films that essentially revolutionized film and the way we look at them.  What was there before Star Wars?  I've read a lot of bad reviews because of the new cg effects, but cut the guy a little slack!  He lost a lot to make these movies to begin with... Let the man have his fun with his films!  Before you bite into the cg bashing that's been going on, see them for yourself.  If you're a lifelong, die hard fan, remember how open your mind was when you first saw them.

You might be more familiar with my distant cousin Greedo the bounty hunter and maybe even beedo if you know your history. I have one major complaint I have to set the record straight on. Han Solo killed my cousin in cold blood, plain and simple. I know a certain revisionist is attempting to sanitize Solo's image but it should not come at the expense of besmirching Greedo's bounty hunting credentials. I'll grant you Greedo embarrassed us Rodians by getting lit up by Solo, it was inexcusable to allow Solo to keep his hands under the table during the confrontation. Greedo made a mistake and it cost him.This episode is a blot on our history as a race but why do we have to suffer the humiliation of a self absorbed ego-maniac. After today people might actually think Greedo fired first and missed from three feet away. Was Greedo the best bounty hunter we had to offer? The answer is no, Greedo was competent at best but by no means up to Rodian standards. With that being said it is an insult that our people will have to bare for all time to allege Greedo could have missed from point blank range. It is not easy being Rodian and living down Greedo's stupidity has not been easy. It is going to be intolerable having people going around now saying Greedo fired first and missed. Please do not partake in this revisionism. History should reflect that Solo fired first. It is the way it went down.

All I will say about the movies themselves is that they are 3 of the best films of all time, original and clever. My beef with the new release is how George Lucas is selling another version of the same films over and over again. The Special Edition series was great, and like many fans, enjoyed it a lot. But form what I heard is that this new release is the special edition with a featurette on Ep. II. This a pretty cool, but you can get all of that of the starwars web site for free. They even have great streaming videos. Obviously, if you have a degraded old version or don't own this series at all, please buy this! But if you are like me, and already own the Special Edition, please check out the website for a lot of cool stuff on the film without having to pay 35 bucks to see new ep. 2 scenes.	4.0	Oops!

I don't know what in the world he was thinking as I find them distracting... especially in Episode IV.  The worst offender is the conversation Hans has with Jabba about paying him later... it actually takes away the sense of urgency to get away!  And the other animations added either look very fake or are just plain annoying.BUT for the price, I will take them.  I'm not one willing to spend the extra (and now that extra is more than the cost of a Blu-Ray player) for the theatrical release.  And the main reason I bought this was so my kids can watch it, so they don't know the difference anyway.Yes, the additions are annoying, but they are minimal and I'm capable of putting up with the extra 3 mins. or so of them and still have a good movie experience with my family.	4.0	Good quality	2013-01-08	3	1	2

These movies look brand new -- there's a digital perfection to every image.  The downside is... there's very little emotion and nothing to engage you.  While the effects are startling, the digitized colors feel both rich and fake at the same time.  They don't ""feel"" like the movies I've grown to love.The new scenes -- Lucas has destroyed the finale of jedi with new bad special edition music and having Luke looking on a ghost father younger than himself (Hayden Christensin), which makes very little sense.  The new fast cutting of the final ewok village detracts from the reunion of friends who have made it through thick and thin.To his credit he fixed the bad jabba in star wars and got rid of the dumb scream in empire when luke tumbles down the vortex at Bespin.But these movies have lost the fundamental emotion Lucas created.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1STS4VOTHFFQV	dh	"I distinctly remember thinking after seeing Empire, that Lucas was an exceptional movie-maker with very high standards.  This started to unravel with Return of the Jedi, when literally at the time of reading the synopsis going up the screen when I first saw the movie after release; I read that there was (alas) another death star being built. I remember thinking, ""oh no, we've seen this before, why do we have to see this same thing again?"". I remember feeling unsatisfied by return of the jedi, how cheap it felt compared to the first two amazing films. Then Lucas comes out with special editions that add CGI, which look ridiculous, like watching a video game. We then see in episode 1 that Lucas in order to avoid real human conflict, introduces droid armies to avoid having to make his movie like a real war. He then further ruins the franchise by making the clones CGI too as opposed to making the costume and having to deal with the hard-work of live action scenes.  More video game. I was a young lad when Star Wars came out, and I watched in the theatre when Han shot first and remembered thinking he was bad dude, but by the end of the movie he had changed. Watching Han shoot first, and watching Ben Kenobi cut the arm off of someone in the bar, did not make me crazy, nor any of my school friends. I knew the movie was make-believe, but it was fun to pretend.In the end the sad truth is that George Lucas reached his pinnacle with Empire, and was never the same again. But why he has to completely ignore the brilliance of the first two movies by ignoring their proper restoration is puzzling. He is who he is today, a different man than he was when he made those first two films.  Maybe it's the divorce he went through back then has deeply effected him. Whatever the reason, we'll probably never get to see those first two movies in their original glory restored and that truly is a shame.

It is not meant to ""trick"" consumers, for he's mentioned this countless times years ago up until the present, that these will be the only versions of these Star Wars films.I'm defending lucas, sure, because there's reason to. don't get me wrong, i'd rejoice in the event lucas was to change his mind about not releasing the originals, but that's only something that should be wished for, not demanded. i don't even like the guy all that much... met him once and he wasn't very pleasant, but the final cut is his decision because he is the filmmaker after all, not us.now those purists who still don't understand it and continue to nag, still have their low resolution VIDEO TAPES that they can  watch (until their VCRs eat them up at least). and those purists who complain, but still give in to the DVD set... one word: Hypocrites.If you liked the original versions, there's no reason that you shouldn't like the Special Editions. You may ""prefer"" the original versions, but that's no reason to ""despise"" the Special Editions because nothing Lucas added changed the movies all that much.These films are timeless masterpieces.

Undoubtedly, these changes make these three films a more cohesive whole with Episodes I - III.The movies themselves are all excellent, and the only one I find slightly flawed is ""Return of the Jedi"" - it's a fine film, and it just isn't quite as good as ""A New Hope"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back.""The DVD transfers are superb, and the extra disc of bonus material is bountiful. A minor complaint about this stellar release, is that I do wish that there had been even more extras when there was so much available. I for one would love to see the original, ""Making of Star Wars"" special that was aired on television in 1977 and hosted by R2D2 and C3P0.

Oh yea Leave Obi-one alone, First he see's his Mentor bite the dust,,Then he becomes teacher to a snoty sqeeley brat who grows up into a pretentious,self serving punk that turn on him, then the poor dude's got to see all his Jedi homeies get slautererd, then the poor dude saccrfices himself for his former patawan's secret love children (Luke by the way lets admit did not even know how to shoot a blaster right on the first Death Star), then this punk (ie; Luke) does not even let him rest in the great here after because he and Yoda kepp conjuring him up in the last 2 films. And now to top that all off we have a case of invasion of the body switchers?  Can't the dude just get a CASKET and RIP??? All in all I would have to say this is Lucas' worst release since oh I don't know...EPISODE 1 maybe!!!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWHSBFIV0F5IV	Disappointed	Ok, I bought this set well-knowing that it was the special edition and had changes. This has nothing to do with my review.First of all, the sound is absolutely incredible. I have many digital versions of Star Wars, and this one blows them all away. I couldn't be any happier in that category.My only problem is that the video is way, WAY too clear. Why is this a problem, do you ask? Because it makes the models used in the film actually LOOK like models, not the real thing. The Death Star looks like a plastic toy, as do the X-wings, AT-ATs, Y-wings, and all other models used to make the films. Everything has a sterile, 'plastic' look to it.The original films had a slightly 'grainy' look to them which GREATLY added to the realism. This may not have been originally intended, but it gave the trilogy a terrific 'period' feel. This DVD release looks like a huge cartoon with toy ships flying around. In my opinion, it's absolutely horrible and is nothing like it used to be: nothing like we remembered while growing up. It's like a box of candy with too much sugar.So, if you want to get that nostalgic feeling you had while first watching these films, watch the laserdisc or VHS versions, because this one is NOT Star Wars to me. It's a shiny new penny that was mistakenly dropped in a 30 year old well. You may not understand this review as of now, but when you see this set you'll definitely know what I'm talking about.	3.0	The picture is TOO CLEAR: Hear me out...	2005-07-27	7	5	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3DIKJP95XTKX0	"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley"""	I saw Star Wars in the cinema on its original release in 1977 and I was not slow to buy a ticket for an encore. The sheer experience of that film was exhilerating at a time when movie SFX were still a fair distance away from the quality we know and expect today. Few cinemas had stereo sound then because Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, and to actually be in a cinema so equipped at that time was a rarity. If you were really lucky, in addition to Dolby stereo, it might have a 70mm facility which would give you an enhanced picture, plus a 6 channel stereo split instead of the normal 4 channel of standard Dolby. Nowadays digital stereo in the cinema and home makes that sort of differentiating pretty irrelevent.Seeing Star Wars in stereo and with its incredible effects really was an experience . After that sound and SFX were never going to be the same, and neither have looked back since.Of the three films Return Of The Jedi is in 3rd place, a great film but is simply bettered by the two that came before it. In second place sits Star Wars itself. The film remains one of those viewing experiences which just remains in your mind as a milestone. What effects, what imagination, the ability to lift you out of every day life and take you to a galaxy, far, far away. Who can forget seeing that opening shot of the huge Star Destroyer bearing down on Princess Leia's fleeing vessel?No audiences had seen spaceships of those looks and dimensions on the big screen before...The pride of place by a whisker is taken by The Empire Strikes Back. Of the three films, this is the one that has stood up to more repeat viewings than the others. When I first saw it it did not have the effect that seeing the first did, absorbing though it still was. The passage of time has seen it establish itself as my fave of the trilogy though. I always felt that the plot for Star Wars drew on the Arthurian Legend and nowhere is this more apparent than in The Empire Strikes Back, particularly when the true identity of Darth Vader is revealed for the first time.There is a moodiness about Empire that runs through the film from start to finish, and I often wonder what Jedi would have been like if George Lucas had let the director of Empire Strikes Back - Irvin Kershner helm that film too....As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films.In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema. Thanks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.	5.0	The Force is still with us.......	2005-01-17	13	6	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	I was very excited about the original movies coming out on DVD but upon seeing them, I was utterly shocked at the tweaking that Lucas has done with his original Star Wars movies. They were absolutely perfect the way they were and the special effects were perfect for their time but whatever these 'special editions' were aiming for, they miss delivering by a mile. Now don't get me wrong, special edition or not, these are masterpieces without a doubt but after three or four versions of this trilogy being released on the soon-to-be out of print VHS editions, I am absolutely tired of waiting and waiting for the DVD editions of the originals to surface. There was nothing wrong with them and to see him do this to us is really saddening and has badly tarnished my respect for his lack of attention to his gargantuan fanbase to release these classics in their unedited versions on DVD. Why?? WHY?? WHY???!!!! I mean the revamped versions are really excellent but the new CGI effects are so out of place with the much older versions of the movies special effects of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is ridiculous. Okay so maybe he wasn't one hundred percent pleased with the results of the originals but come on!!!Earth to Lucas, Earth to Lucas. You should have looked at the way they did the Alien Quadrilogy where they had both the original versions of the films along side the special editions of each plus tons of bonus features. The Star Wars trilogy DVD is deficient in every possible way having really lame bonus materials.I have had it with his act of denying us Star Wars fans our chance to see the untouched originals cleaned up and remastered in their original forms and now I simply give up on ever seeing the original versions of this trilogy on DVD. This was Lucas' chance to really come up with a grand spectacular DVD set but he totally blew it! Do not buy this DVD. Stick with your VHS editions.

Yes, I would prefer the original theatrical releases but unfortunately they aren't available.  All of the new editions as well as the awful episodes 1,2, and 3 have soured me quite a bit on this once great franchise. If I didn't have children I probably wouldn't have been interested at all.  As a matter of fact I would of probably waited for the final release of these films on blu-ray.  It is sad Lucas doesn't have more respect for his fans and the original versions of these films.Anyway, Star Wars hasn't looked this good in a home theater before.  The biggest problem with this release is that there aren't any special features!  They could have easily ported the standard editions over to this set.

The 4th bonus disc features a very long, detailed documentary on the entire Trilogy, plus Trailers and TV Spots for all 3 films, along with featurettes on the lightsaber, and the characters of Star Wars. One last thing that bothered me however, was the DVD cover art for each film. I would have preferred the theatrical poster art over the new DVD covers they made.

I have a feeling that Lucas has made even better sound than before and added to the trilogy of what he wants. A note to George: George, I'm sure you will make this re-release more awesome than the last one (not to say the last one was bad).I'm very interested in seeing what has changed and what looks just a bit better. One thing to know about Mr. Lucas, he doesn't re-release without some kind of changes taken place. Just look at what he's done so far. Everytime he re-releases he changes stuff. I think it's cool. One thing to remember folks, he doesn't do this stuff to please people. He does this to perfect his vision of what he wants out of his movies. Just face reality folks, you're never gonna see the Star Wars Trilogy the way it first came out in theaters. To George Lucas, after he gets done fixing everything up that he wants to, adds anything he wants to and makes these films 3D, these versions are gonna be the only originals to him. This is what he wants, not us. This is what he wants us to see, not what we want to see.Just remember, the reason why George has created all of his own companies and only has gone with 20th Century Fox is because they were the only ones that would let him tell the story the way he wanted, when eveybody else wanted him to change it to what the audience wanted to see instead of what he wanted to do. This is why he is the way that he is. I say either like what he's done, or don't be into Star Wars at all. This is his story, not ours.	5.0	This should be awesome	2005-10-08	33	11	22

The special editions do not change the plot, or the themes. Some aspects are improvements: crisper images, and fixing glitches that, for some folk who notice details, where a bit distracting (some background images bleeding through foregrounds). Kudos to those who are not detail folk and can overlook such glitches. I was happy that the glitches were fixed (even before, I was still a fan - I saw Star Wars IV two dozen times in the movie theaters). Most of what were added were minor improvements.However, two additions were not improvements. First, in Return of the Jedi, the sand pit monster is more active, which goes against its very slow metabolism (takes 1,000 years or so to digest something). It was expending way too much energy in the special edition. Second, when Hans Solo first meets with Jabba the Hut and he steps on Jabba's tail - I did not feel that it fit Hans' character; I wasn't impressed with the scene, with Jabba's reaction (I thought Jabba's reaction too humorous, not quite in keeping with his character), or with Hans calling Jabba ""human"" (in early versions of the script, Jabba was a human). But again, these are momentary gnats, and I love the overall movies too much to let such things ruin my life, or my overall enjoyment and love for the movie."	5.0	Great release of a Great trilogy	2004-09-10	14	5	9

He's passing this trilogy off as being ""original"" or ""classic"" and hoping that, in time, the public will only remember his tinkered versions.

This is just simple one of those movies. other examples of this are batman begins and War of the worlds(check for yourself). Its a new marcheting scheme that allows fans to purchase the special features along with the trilogy, aswell it also allows people to buy the trilogy with out having to spend extra money on bonus features. Alot people are complaining about this but then agian a few years ago alot of people were complaining about how every dvd was labeled special edition. These days it seems they are starting to release normal and special edition DVDs. Long story short if you already have the trilogy with the bonus disc, this is useless except for a nice facy box(lol).

The acting was bad enough in Episodes 1 and 2, we didn't need to see those same wooden actors in movies that are beloved for their unexpectedly *good* acting.I also found the dialogue changes to be...unexpected.  Why, after all these years, does dialogue need to be re-written?  The fanservice to the modern ""glitz and glamour"" set has ruined the charm of the originals.  The joy of those original movies was the witty dialogue and believability of the characters, even in such an ""out there"" setting.  The newer movies (Episodes 1 and 2) reek of commercialism and glitter-with-no-substance filmmaking.  It is a sad thing that Lucas had to go back and wreck such wonderful films.Mister Lucas, release the trilogy I saw in the theatres, and maybe I will consider purchasing this set.  I only saw these because a friend of mine forced me to watch them, so that he didn't feel alone in wasting his money and his time on them.  (even though I think he was able to manage a refund anyways, since so many people didn't realize that the movies were going to change...AGAIN)Why do we bother purchasing anything, if it's going to be different than what we expected?

Bad. REALLY Bad. see above, and note ""almost"".""Return of the Jedi"": Old Non-stop frenetic cartoon action space combat with the same ships now moving six times faster than in ""Star Wars"" and H. Beam Piper ""Fuzzy Sapiens"" Rip-Off (oh wait, excuse me... it's an ""homage"") Dance Picnic Bad, New Tighter editing and a curtain call for all the planets we'd seen or heard of up to that point showing celebrations of the fall of the Emperor  and, of course, the death of the Rule of Law, but what the hell, you can't have everything, right?, but MOST OF ALL the elimination of the above-mentioned cynical marketing ploy monkey-dance Good.Yes, I did actually admit that at least in the case of the upgraded ""Return of the Jedi"", the new version was better than the original. See? I'm not completely intractable. And hey, I also think the new ""Sabrina"" is far better than the old one, too, and I'm a huge fan of Bogart, Hepburn and Holden.Anyway, let me know if these are what I fear, because hooking up my laserdisc player to the plasma screen TV so I can watch the digitally re-mastered original series versions I own on laserdiscs is like trying to run a fighter jet with coal.But it will be worth it.Don ""Pegging-the-Geek-O-Meter"" Hawthorne"	3.0	Even Noble Homer Sleeps	2004-09-21	18	5	13

There is also a hidden Easter Egg of a blooper reel. (to access, press 1138 on the gallery/game page).

Even if he chose to let the original theatrical versions be added to the set, I would never watch them. I would watch the updated versions.

John Williams has made it known that the ""Imperial March"" is being added to ""A New Hope"" plus a better version of Han with Jabba. And I've also heard that he might be restoring the Han shoots first scene, but who knows.As for adding Hayden as Anakin in the trees of Endor at the end of ""Return"" is kind of cool (except if your the actor who played the role originally).I just want this series on DVD, and I'm hoping that with ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (?)"", Lucas redeems himself from the very disappointing first two films (though, ""Attack of the Clones"" is way better than ""Phantom Menace"")Bring it on."	5.0	Better than video tapes	2004-06-23	15	6	9

The only beef I have is why did they choose to include certain scenes with the CGI updates, instead of the original versions. I get that the speeder effects were lacking a bit, and the scene with solo and jabba was absent and truly missed in the storyline, but HEY! Why not leave it as it was presented ?

First I checked out the special features, which were great. There is a preview for Episode III, which looks good, and there is "" Empire of Dreams"", the most comprehensive documentary about the making of Star Wars. Next I looked at "" The Force is with them"", which interviews filmmakers that were influenced by Star Wars, such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and more.In Episode IV there are a few more changes, most notably There is a new Jabba which actually looks better than it did in the Special Edition. Jabba has been changed to look more like the original puppet. Everything about him is improved and makes him seem more real. There are other various changes that are fun to look for.In Empire Strikes back, there is new dialogue between the Emperor and Vader. And the emperor is Ian McDiarmid, who plays him in the prequels and Return of the Jedi. That is the biggest change, aside from other little ones like a new Boba Fett voice.Return of the Jedi has the most notable change, where Hayden Christensen is the ghost of Vader at the end. They did this change because Lucas said he was the last form of Anakin before he became Darth Vader. Also there are more smaller changes.These films, though changed are still as wonderful and magical as they were 25 years ago. Don't complain about changes, embrace them as Lucas does. This is his vision of how the Star Wars saga was meant to be ( if you watch Empire of Dreams you can see the struggles he faced ) and if he wants to see his dream fulfilled that is his right. He is sharing his vision with the viewers and people shouldn't give him crap over it.

Well most of us at least.These are not the original movies, they are tidied up versions with 'extra' scenes. The cleaning up of the special effects is effective in places, however the extra content is not.What has been done is to add ridiculous, ill-fitting CGI sequences in order to prepare us for the lamentably poor prequels. We get a daft sequence of Han-Solo talking to a CGI Jabba which looks like a college graphics project. Worst of all is the new song and dance routine in Return of the Jedi which makes Fraggle Rock look like West Side Story.A digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable, these tacky cash-ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of Black & White classics.	1.0	Wait for the originals	2006-08-05	28	22	6

As for the sound quality, it's clearer than the DVD release making the dialogue easier to hear especially on A New Hope. As for the video, the picture is noticeably clearer and more detailed and the black level is better.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2TWIZ33KJCQ54	"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP"""	"BRIEFLY STATED:'THE' classic, modern ""Space-Opera Fantasy"" for literally everyone. Yes, like many others I find George Lucas a little hard to take, but I do like this trilogy and I just hope he stops tinkering with it.LUCAS SAID IN AN INTERVIEW - ""FILM EDITING IS NEVER FINISHED, IT IS JUST ABANDONED"":Okay, fine, let's not think that this idea of his, to constantly tinker with these, the most profitable films of all time, is motivated by copyright laws that protect each update for the next 50 or 75 years! Well, I am starting to have trouble believing that his tinkering has anything to do with our enjoyment and that is coloring the whole ""Star Wars"" experience.ABOUT THE DVD: GREAT SOUND AND VIDEO!The transfer is sensational and it is in widescreen. It does, however, include changes and additions that are sometimes disturbing. Perhaps, the most disturbing of his tinkerings was at the end of ""The Return of The Jedi"", where Lucas not only changed the scene, the setting, and the music, but he even changed the face of Anakin Skywalker's ghost to match Hayden Christensen, the 'NEW' and 'IMPROVED' Anakin Skywalker character! There are so many such examples that to enumerate them would probably injure anyone reading this review's enjoyment of the film trilogy.SPECIAL FEATURES: TOO MANY SPECIAL FEATURESThe main 2.5 hour featurette is for the most part excellent and, though subjective, very interesting. The three other featurettes, however, are another story. They basically tell three 20-minute tales from different viewpoints about how George Lucas was on a ""Mercy Mission"" of sorts as a filmmaker when he (with the force as his ally) took on the big studios to become a big studio himself. As a sort of parody on his Star Wars franchise, I like to think of the scene in the ""Revenge of the Sith"" where Ewan McGregor as the new and improved Obi-Wan Kenobi screams, ""You were the chosen one --- you were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!"", to the new and improved Anakin Skywalker in a dramatic moment. It seems that Mr. Lucas may have followed in Anakin's footsteps.3 FEATURETTES: PROPAGANDA IS NOT SOMETHING VIEWERS SHOULD PAY FORIn the featurettes, we saw testimonials from many of ""Industrial Light and Magic's"" leading customers like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Ridley Scott. Each in their own words described how Lucas and ""Star Wars"" revolutionized the motion picture industry and forever improved everything in the world for everybody, but especially for filmmakers and moviegoers.BOTTOM LINE: I WISH LUCAS WOULD JUST STICK TO FILMMAKINGI wish Lucas -- who is widely known as the proverbial ""closed-mouthed man"" and as such a very poor communicator who is silent when he should speak and often picks the wrong time to talk -- would learn when not to speak up. These featurettes, though stunningly well made, were clearly the wrong venue for Lucas to go on a personal diatribe while bragging about how he owns all the rights and has made riches beyond measure.IN THE END: THE STAR WARS TRILOGY IS A WONDER OF THE MODERN WORLDWhen you look at the movies alone, however, this trilogy is a wonderful work of art that was exceedingly well done when it was made long ago and far away.

The very fact that some of the special effects look out-dated some 25 years later becomes an important guide as to what contemporary society was like at the time.  Just as we now watch films like the original King Kong or Frankenstein with bemusment, it's important to know that audiences at the time found these images terrifying. By making the kinds of upgrades Lucas is doing here, and then denying the original versions existence, Lucas is in essence trying to re-write history, something that is very, very unfortunate.  It also seems to say about Lucas that he is more interested in the special effects than the artistic value of his creations.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2Z05Z04ANKJS9	Dryphtyr	I'm jumping on the old coot's bandwagon. I will not buy the relevant trilogy on blu-ray until the real originals are available. Lucas' remakes are an abomination. I also think Ep's 1-3 should be re-made by someone who knows something about story telling. I think the common denominator here is that Lucas didn't have full creative control in the making of the originals. The more control he's given, the more he destroys these once great movies. Until the originals are released in high def, I'll keep my Laser Disc editions. There was another person who, like Lucas, tried to change history. His last name was Stalin, & while I'm sure Lucas hasn't killed nearly as many people, he has killed the childhood memories of millions...	1.0	Originals on Blu-Ray	2011-10-04	18	9	9

My desire is based on my fond memories from the 70's of the original movie that I saw in the theater almost 20 times.  In fact a lot of us old timers saw it multiple times and that is what helped to make Star Wars such a cash cow.  You'd think Lucus would show some appreciation for that and include what we remember best.  Bummer!	2.0	I'm an old timer and I have a right to whine.  Deal with it!	2004-08-25	17	12	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1MEFMJR8KY0AD	Duke Snydewalker	"I loved the original movies, but my imagination, and modern technology, conspired against me so much so that when I first heard that George was updating the originals with more added scenes, I thought, ""Cool!  Gotta see that!"".  I'm not a purist.  If adding something to something great makes something that is great even greater, I say...uh...great.Anyway, I actually love all the CGI changes except two, and one of them I could live with...The change I can live with: Han no longer shoots first-I didn't really notice the first (and only) time I saw Star Wars: A New Hope in the theater that Han shot first, nor did I realize how important to his character development that scene was.  It was the audience's first encounter with this anti-hero who would soon become one of the most beloved heroes in movie history.  However, a lot of that development in who he was to become was firmly based on who he was to begin with.  So having Han shoot first was really an awesome way to tell the audience what a bad guy he originally was.  Sure, he shot another bad guy, and the other bad guy would have shot Han if Han hadn't shot first, but a bad guy who takes out another bad guy can still be a bad guy.  Right?  But to make the other bad guy just a bad shot, and to give the anti-hero enough of a heart to wait until his protagonist attempted to kill him before he took his shot was a pretty major, and disappointing, decision by Mr. Lucas.  But I could have lived with that.  The scene was short, sweet, and not enough to ruin the trilogy(note: you may have noticed I didn't include the prequel trilogy as part of the series; I still hold out hope that someday in my lifetime a new and upcoming Star Wars fan and director with the same focus Lucas had in 1977 will re-make the prequels, and Jar-Jar with only be a humorous footnote in the margin of Star Wars history.  I hold out the same kind of hope for the Harry Potter movies, but that's another review, and a lot less traumatic).The change I CANNOT live with: Little Annoying Annie replacing Papa Darth-However, having said all that, the scene that ruined EVERYTHING Star Wars for me (except the Dark Knight and Legos video games) was digitally replacing Anakin ""Big Bad Daddy"" Skywalker, the man who used to be Darth Vader, one of the most infamous villains-turned-repentant-father in Hollywood lore, who's former visage could chill your bones just by turning his helmet towards the camera, with Anakin ""Annie"" Skywalker, the teenage whiner who was only mildly interesting to watch when he got really, really mad.  And even then he flailed his light saber around like a Kung-Fu wannabe while battling his better, Obi-Wan.  Meesa no unnastan da logik beehine dat disizhun!Seriously, when I started watching the updated CGI'd ""original"" trilogy on DVD, I was digging the experience (""re-digging""?), and was so excited when at the end of Empire, I saw that Mr. Lucas had chosen to make the victory celebration more appropriately celebratory.  One of the few issues I had with the original was the wimpy musical number selected to end this epic experience. Imagine my horror (too strong a word?  I think not!), when, while emotionally engaged in the final scenes, our heroes and innocents happy, reunited, entire planets celebrating in a fashion appropriate to the occasion and scope, with space-high fireworks and various species-appropriate orchestral music, not just a bunch of paper mache koalas singing ""Kum Bi Ya"" in aboriginese, and I'm thinking, ""Yeah!  Awesome!"", the scene that carries the most weight and biggest pay-off arrives.  Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker (Luke's FATHER.  Not his brother, not his cousin, not his roommate) appear as we last remember them: healthy but aged and wise.  But wait.  What?  Who's that kid where Daddy Darth should be standing, uh, floating?  It isn't Anakin Skywalker as we remember him, but as we've been trying to forget him: as the whiny, non-heroic, non-repentant, goofily-grinning TEENAGER, healthy yes, but aged?  Nuh-uh.  Wise?  Not even.  Not to put to fine a point on it, but not even in the right trilogy!!!  Put back the old guy Mr. Lucas should.  Since that terrible experience (I still mumble about it in my car on the way to and from work), I haven't even had the desire to go back to my DVDs, let alone buy them on Blu-Ray!.(deep breath) Anyway, I think we all get where I'm coming from.  I digress.Sorry, Mr, Lucas, but if you were to ever bump into me on the street, and then, out of the blue, were to ask me (and why wouldn't you?) what I thought you could do to get me to watch anything Star Wars EVER AGAIN, I would tell you, ""Mr. Lucas..."" (no reason to be disrespectful), I would say, ""Mr. Lucas, in my humble opinion, your position in the sci-fi universe would be elevated from the current Emperor of the Imperial Army, back to Original Esteemed Jedi Master, by first of all returning Sebastian Shaw..."" (the man who played Vader unmasked; don't be too impressed, ""R. White"" set me straight on this) ""...to his proper place as the spirit of St. Anakin, and second by giving Han Solo back his anti-heroic dignity, and letting him shoot first.  That, good sir, would not only make me want to continue viewing your original trilogy in CGI, but I would then HAVE to buy the Blu-Ray version, because then, and only then, would STAR WARS IV, V & VI return to the top of my ten-best-movies-of-all-time list (at, coincidentally, positions IV, V and VI, only behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy)!!  Plus I would quit complaining to anyone who will listen about Anakin the Ghost-Child, and start gratefully recommending the original trilogy, on BluRay, to all my friends!!""And no, just because Star Wars beats Star Trek, that does not make me a Star Wars fanatic.  There are other reasons...So there you have it.  Just a casual fan, briefly (!) expressing his opinions about a movie series that was created 30 years ago.  No big deal.  Thanks for reading.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2HUGM0AV7MMVG	Dustin Alexander	"I got this box set less than 48 hours after hitting the ""Confirm Order"" thanks to free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime. It is exactly what I wanted, which was the original trilogy on DVD. The original copies of the movies on the bonus discs is indeed a bonus. I mainly wanted these movies because I own the original trilogy box sets, both the originals and special editions, on VHS.(Yes, that means the box set that is not numbered 4-6, nor is the first movie called ""A New Hope"") I just wanted good copies that I could watch while leaving the old dinosaurs in their cases. Finding this box set for $26.99 made it an instant buy for me because the individual DVDs are $15 each. So, $26.99 or $45, seemed common sense to me. While the box and slim DVD cases aren't of the highest durability, they do look nice on my shelf, and its not like their going to leave the shelf unless I am watching them.The picture quality and sound quality of the Special Edition films is awesome. The picture quality of the bonus discs is, like most say, VHS quality. Which I don't mind, since I was born after these films left theaters and the first time I saw them was on VHS. So, for me, watching the originals on these bonus discs is like seeing them for the first time all over again. It reminds me of the days of Game Genie and season 1 of Power Rangers, which I guess wasn't really that long ago, but it sure seems like it. Anyway, this is a box set worth buying since we don't know how much longer it will be until they produce BluRay copies and the BluRay box sets will probably cost $100+ each when they release. They already wanna tax soda, its only a matter of time before they start taxing movies and such also. Get them while they're cheap."	5.0	Box set worth buying	2009-10-09	5	5	0

Spielberg gave in on ""ET"" with 2 versions for a bit (although I think he has the revamped version on market now).

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1P5P2WBTYV8G	"D. Velazquez ""dv_samuel"""	"The films look absolutely fantastic! The sound 'booms'! In the documentary Bill Moyers says it's fun to watch Star Wars, and he is exactly right. I'm in my thirties and I enjoyed these films with the same enthusiasm I had when I was a kid.Ultimately, the changes are not even close to ruining the experience of watching these films. I even got goosebumps seeing Hayden Christensen at the now truly exuberant end of 'Jedi'. It was a great sneak peek into seeing how the prequel trilogy will tie into the original. My seven year old kid had a goofy smile from ear to ear after we watched 'Jedi' together and he saw Anakin back with the good guys. I remember feeling the same way.'The Empire Strikes Back' is simply perfect. I watched this one by myself late at night, in the dark, and I was completly transported to 'Hoth', 'The Asteroid Field', and 'Bespin'. This episode is Star Wars: High Octane. Intensely character driven and visually engrossing. The most realized film of the entire series.However, 'A New Hope', for me, is still the best. The one that started it all 'explodes' with enthusiasm from start to finish. I remember when it came out the first time and how crazy everyone was for it. People just couldn't see it enough times. Myself included. I used to beg my Mom and grandmother to take me again and again. And they would. And I remember just being elated after coming out of the theater with refreshed visual memories to go home with. Watching 'A New Hope' on DVD was a refresher of those feelings, and I truly marvel at how much I still love this movie.And I think that ties in with Bill Moyer's point from the documentary. Star Wars is fun to watch. It truly is visually arresting. It is all in the designs of the costumes, the spacecraft, the droids (my favorites), and on and on. Include an engaging storyline and all the other 'moments' that tell that story and you've got a classic that I never tire of watching every few years. The prequel films are lacking but they're really just as fun to watch. From 'Phantom Menace', the pod race is spectacular, and the duel between Kenobi and Maul is the best in the entire series so far. And I always find myself sitting through the last 45 minutes of 'Attack of the Clones' when it's on HBO. It's all good.If Star Wars wasn't still a 'living beast' or 'open book', what with another film coming out soon, I don't think Lucas would be tinkering with it as much. Changes being made even from the '97 versions really do express an artist's sometimes obsessive approach to a work in progress. If Lucas was available to someone telling him ""let it be"", maybe he would. If Lucas didn't own the films like he does, there surely would be director's cuts, but you better believe that if Fox owned everything Star Wars they would draw the line as to how much tinkering they would allow.No matter how you look at it, Lucas is telling a six part story. It's kind of too bad for us, the audience, to be so part of the editing and re-editing as it happens, yet it is at little cost. He doesn't exactly make Boba Fett Vader's brother or put in a CGI Chewbacca. He doesn't change anything detrimental to the story at all.And if the new end to 'Jedi' is any indication as to how it all ties together, then I'll even go see the next movie on the day it opens.The Star Wars DVD's are a perfect 5 stars."	5.0	"In a word,  ""Classics"" (each film in the trilogy)"	2004-10-26	12	6	6

As you all know, Star Wars is one of movies best series and is the best Sci-fi series.  The acting in these movies are unbeatable, the special effects are unbelievable and the action is superb.  I don't know what the features will be like in this set, but I'm sure it will be good.  I like R2D2.  He's a cute little robot, that only C3-PO can understand.  I don't know if the first 2 in the star wars saga are really worth buying because there nothing no where near the other 3.  Maybe the 3 star wars will be a good film.  Who knows, we can only wait.  Since the Indiana Jones trilogy was realesed on dvd, it's about time they realesed the star wars trilogy.  The series will be in Widescreen and maybe we will get a Fullscreen box set for the people who like Fullscreen better.  We'll just have to wait and find out.Star Wars Episode 4- This is may second favorite of the series including the first 2.  It has great acting and action mixed in with some slick humor that makes a perfect movie.  Ofcoarse Luke Skywalker isn't a good Jedi yet, because he onlt started.  He gets better in the later sequels.10/10Star Wars Episode 5: Return Of The Jedi- This is an awsome movie, but some how didn't have the magic of episode 4.  It was still a great movies with good acting skills, but some how it lacked on the action.  That's the wat it seemed for me.  I still loved it.9/10Star Wars Episode 6: The Empire Strikes Back- This is my favorite out of the whole entire series.  It had awsome acting, lots of action and tons of humor.  Mix all that together and you got Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.

The scenes were from Ep IV: The Biggs-Tank- Anchorhead cut scene and the Biggs & Luke scene, from Ep V: The Wampa scene where the Wampas were breaking into the Rebel Echo base and the dead Tauntaun scene where the 2-1B Medical Droid inspects it after Luke, and the sandstorm scene after leaving Jabba's barge on Tatooine in Ep VI. (There may have even been more deleted scenes.)This was Lucas' chance to add several versions of the movies or at least a deleted track option if you wanted to view them with the movie or not.Someone in one of the recent comments/reviews here asked why Lucas added the ""ghostly vision"" of YOUNG ANAKIN to the trio at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI (deleting the old Anakin). The answer is that Anakin turned to the dark side when he was a YOUNG man, not an OLD one, so by reuniting him to the Light Side, he became rejuvenated to young again. Just a theory.I give the DVD set 4 stars out of 5 because Lucas didn't include deleted scenes.-Ed Schodde-Pittsburgh, PAEddeeBee@netzero.com"	4.0	The Force Is Back..But Could They Have Added MORE?	2004-09-25	5	4	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1KZDMCI54UXIY	Eddie	"I've always wanted to own the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. I have the original VHS versions, both Original and Special Edition. Both sets of tapes are so old, the quality has become poor. Finally, it's here.What's great about this DVD release is simply the fact it's on DVD now. There's nothing more than that except for an extra bonus feature type of DVD, which is, in reality, just another documentary (nothing impressive). Over the past 20+ years, any Star Wars fan has seen so many different documentaries of the Star Wars Trilogy that this one added to the DVD set would just bring out the comment, ""Oh...not again.""I was really disappointed when I found out that each DVD did not have the choice to play the original, unedited version. If you look at all other DVD sets, they usually offer that, and the fact that this Star Wars Trilogy did not offer it upset me and probably millions of other fans. But who knows? Maybe they will release a special, special, special, ...special edition of Star Wars some day with this feature in it. You never know.It's obvious that some day there will be an 'Episode 1, 2, 3' DVD release along with an 'Episode 1-6' with all the Collector's Editions and Director's Cuts... but I'm not going to wait until then. I want to watch the Trilogy now. So my recommendation would be that if you are seeking those Collector's / Director's Editions or extra special features, don't buy this set...just wait until then. If you're impatient and want to see the old trilogy now on DVD with the THX sound hooked up to your home theatre, go ahead and get this now."	3.0	FInally...on DVD	2004-09-28	7	5	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1APNKI881T2K0	Ed Fleming	From what we've been told by StarWars.Com this DVD will be of the 1997 special edition versions. The problems with this release of StarWars on DVD is that it contains only the special edition of the film, and it is a flawed version at best.I will buy this DVD set, but I am not happy about it. When I saw the special editions of the films in 1997 I was very unhappy with StarWars 4 (A New Hope), (...). I was expecting more from the special edition too. Knowing way too much about the films missing footage, I was disapointed that there wasn't any of the cut sceens with Luke and Biggs at the start of the film.Empire Stikes Back changes were okay, but I would have liked to seen the Wampa sceen inside of the Rebal base. I would have also liked to have seen how C3PO got torn apart.Return's only major changes were at the end of the film. The edition of celebrations across the galaxy was goofy.To tell the truth, I'd to see this DVD set contain 3 versions of the films. The un-modified editions, the 1997 editions and a new mix that fixes the problems with a Star Wars 4 and maybe adds a few new sceens here and there. My guess is that there will be a version on DVD, or HD-DVD, like this in the future and I will be suckered into buying it too.	4.0	Problems with the Star Wars DVD	2004-04-21	4	3	1

I loved these movies with all my heart. I am thrilled to be getting these films on DVD...including the changes. Ok, I am on board with the whole Greedo shoots first debacle, but otherwise I feel like most all of these changes improve on the films. Personally speaking, I feel that it is entirely hypocritical to hate the prequels and love these films, seeing as they are in much the same mold. To hate a sci-fi/fantasy film because it had too many SFX?! Whatever..the point is that these films are classics and the moves to tie the saga in tighter to continuity is a move that I am happy for, and as for the originals being re-released (untouched), I guess it doesn't matter to me as much...only us old fogeys will care about that anyway, the kids will not like them so much, I think.

Hmmmm?????Well, I may as well join the crowd, but my review here really isn't a review of the DVD set (cuz I've not seen it), but a commentary on the ANTICIPATED release and the film itself, based on what I know about it from various sources and announcements, and what I know about the newer release previously put on video.I'm looking forward to the release of this DVD set, but I, along with most fans my age, am nevertheless very disappointed that it is not also being released in it's original format with NON-digital special FX.I wanna see the original miniature models that were shot bluescreen, not the inferior (and very obvious) CGI stuff which just ruined the original work of art. I wanna see the matte lines that were a result of the old optical printers which are now likely in museums. I wanna see those shots that weren't as good as they could have been due to lack of technology or money. It's all part of the original painting. And I won't even talk about those awful ""tweaks"" peppering the new version.Everyone complained when old B&W; movies were ""colorized"". That's an easy fix, since you can turn off the color on your TV and still see it in B&W;#, but replacing original brush strokes with a computerized substitute is not the way to go as far as I'm concerned. Preserve the original work, don't screw with it.I don't know about you, but if DaVinci were resurrected from the grave, would we really want him to ""touch up"" the Mona Lisa? Would it be the same if he were to destroy the original and paint a new version using Photoshop instead of brushes and guache? I just want the film in it's original format, as seen in 1977 but presented with the quality possible with DVD.I must admit that I did like the addition of Luke and Biggs meeting in the Hangar, since all that was just restored original footage. To me though, using CGI for the ""restored scenes"" is cheating, and doesn't look like it belongs in the film. If you MUST play with it, just re-shoot the miniatures and do it the old way. At least well done models look more real because they ARE real, handcrafted props.Yes, George, I'll still buy all the other versions to get all the other goodies on there, just as I did when you released the music soundtracks over and over again, getting me to buy it over and over again to get those extra little bits of music that were added a bit at a time, specifically so that I would buy it over and over again.Yes, George, I'll help you with your philosophy of ""why sell it once if you can sell it many times"". That's OK I guess. If you can, milk it for all it's worth. When people get sick of it they'll stop buying it I guess.So go ahead and release all the versions, I'll dutifully buy them all, as long as you let us have the complete original version as well.I give this set four stars. Not because I've seen this specific DVD set, but because I'm familiar with the film, and my review is based on that alone. I would automatically give it five stars if the original, superior version were included.Jim."	4.0	How can this be?	2004-08-31	18	14	4

It made total sense to leave this scene in. I saw this originally in 1983 when ""Jedi"" was released. Is George Lucas saying he made a mistake?

If you beleive all the &quot;greatest movie of all time!!!&quot; hogwash that's being splattered all over the place,  you'll be dissapointed: the Star Wars series are kid's movies. (On a  sidenote, I don't think anyone's qualified to judge what the best movie of  all time is since I doubt anyone's ever seen all the movies ever made.)  Yes, they're fun and entertaining and imaginative, but they're still just  kid's movies. It's kind of sad how Lucas' simple artistry is thrown out the  window by dealers merchandising and publicizing the poor movies to death,  and a horde of fanatics making the whole thing a stupid religion. It's  good, but not THAT good. The plot is pretty simple, your basic evil empire  with legions of evil soldiers who can't shoot worth crap and a large very  scary commander (Darth Vader's breathing alone makes him creepier than  Freddy Krueger) vs. a group of outgunned but indefinately smarter and  better-looking rebels (Luke's bad haircut aside.) The special effects are  only mediocre (I was pretty dissapointed the first time I saw the FX, all  the hype made me expect something that'd trump Jurassic Park.) The FX are  still good, but they can't compare to anything made these days. The acting  is pretty bad, but then again, who watches sci-fi for the acting  anyway?So if you're sick of all the brain-numbingly bad and unoriginal  sci-fi movies of the 90's (which there are a lot of), and you want  something with a lot of action and imagination, then buy the Star Wars  Triology. It just can't be beat, it'll bring out the kid in you.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	"Most of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no ""play all"" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.The deleted scenes though are gems. It was truly magical seeing scenes we've heard about for three decades but never seen. . I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 4 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better."	4.0	Great movies, decent revisions	2010-01-18	0	0	0

These are the remastered versions that you see on TV. If the quote &#34;Han shot first&#34; means anything to you besides that it came from star wars, this is not the set you want.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AUAUYGCPOXG2E	"enommaz ""enommaz"""	"Supreme thanks to the reviewer who gave the address thedigitalbits.com in regards to the highly anticipated DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy(I RECOMMEND FANS/NON-FANS OF THIS NEW EDITION GO TO THIS SITE, READ THE REVIEW, AND VIEW THE OLD SCENE/NEW SCENE COMPARISONS BEFORE JUDGING THESE ""VERSIONS"" PREMATURELY).  I, like most, was(and still am)looking forward to a crisp restoration and remastering of the original trilogy, and the now first special edition trilogy on DVD with a feast of bonus materials.  I wasn't even aware of more changes being made to the Trilogy until about a week or so ago.  At first I became really ticked and irritated at the news, I don't even consider myself close to the degree of fan some claim to be, but I'm a fan of things original, and in the case of Star Wars, I would prefer the originals over modified versions.With me the bottom line is film preservation.Here it is fans/folks in my opinion, George Lucas is an artist, and I know a little bit about that, and as an artist it is rare that you are ever satisfied with your work, and that's something an unaware fan base will never understand. Now, what the artist forgets is that when he/she releases a piece of art to the masses and that art reaches a status of worship, the artist must always be aware, that any changes to the original piece will invoke passionate questions and mass uproar. (Eventually Lucas should stop ""doctoring"" his films, they were great to begin with.)Should Lucas have released the original trilogy?  In my opinion YES!Should Lucas have released the special edition trilogy? YES!Should Lucas have released the original/special edition in this first DVD release?  Again YES!I think most would agree with this.It's amazing the impact and influence (whatever the version) these films have on people.Anyway I will buy this version (again it's not the version I prefer) partly just to see what DVD technology, film restoration and remastering is really capable of doing with these movies. I truly feel the heart and essence of what made these films magical and great to begin with will still be there, not to mention the majority of the original work.In my humble opinion, to own and view(again for some of us) films that are already making history(even before the DVD hits the stores)and what could later be of significant historical importance in regards to film, filmmaking, film doctoring, and possibly something beyond film itself, means more to me in the long term than what my current feelings about its missing or added contents may dictate.Is Lucas and 20th Century Fox making money off of OUR emotions,  OUR nostalgia, and OUR comments by re-releasing EPISODES IV-VI with or without the original films?YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT...NEVER FORGET THAT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME. (SAD BUT TRUE)The original Trilogy, uncut, restored and remastered will have it's debut on DVD, I have complete faith in this. Lucas seems to specialize in building anticipation and hype in regards to these films.Just look at the history of hype that surrounds Star Wars.  Look at the Official/Unofficial Web sites of Star Wars fans and devotees around the world.  Controversy is king(and a clever marketing tool)whether George Lucas consciously chooses to be controversial or not.Wouldn't it be interesting though if the original versions of each movie were hidden as a special little Easter Egg within each disc, [A third version of TERMINATOR 2 was found on the TERMINATOR 2: ULTIMATE EDITION disc and was never mentioned anywhere on the actual DVD or in press reports (from what I remember) at the time, you had to input a code to find it.]Anyway I will soon own what will probably be the best selling DVD Box Set of our current year and possibly next few years, plus to get some extras not guranteed to be on future releases(you know they'll be some.)Old School Thought, relax, THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WILL HAVE ITS DAY(it may secretly be here now)....New School Thought, enjoy the releases, but I ask you to take the time to learn a little more about the appreciation of things of the past, and understand the passion of the ""old schools"" way of thinking.I have hope that both 'schools of thought' will eventually get what they want.Are Lucas and 20th Century Fox milking us out of our money?(ONLY AS MUCH AS WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE MILKED)As a consumer exercise your power to purchase/not purchase.Whether we the global fan base purchase this DVD set or not, on SEPTEMBER 21, 2004, history will be made in some form or another in regards to this (FIRST)official release of STAR WARS 'SPECIAL EDITION' TRILOGY on DVD.  I ask the fans and devotees, WHAT WILL YOUR PART BE IN IT?I will cultivate patience to such a degree, that time itself will grow tired of waiting."	5.0	Was gonna buy...Wasn't gonna buy...Now, I'll buy!	2004-09-13	15	5	10

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AGM907X0URUZZ	"Ensio N Mikkola ""book worm"""	I bought the Star Wars Trilogy the day it hit stores. I thought I'd have felt that buyers remorse by now but surprisingly, I haven't.I enjoyed watching the cleaned up, polished OT movies as much as I enjoyed watching them on home video years ago (on Betamax nonetheless!) I did not mind the digital additions too much. I saw most of them the first time in '97. I'm assuming most of you did as well because you're all whining about them so much. So I wasn't expecting Lucas to f__ with this release too much.Actually, putting Ian McDarmid in ESB was a *good idea*. Adding Hayden Christiansen to the end of ROTJ was a *bad idea*. It goes to show you how uncharismatic this young man is that he managed to *blow* a cameo appearance by standing there with that malevolent smirk (his only expression?) which totally ruined the moment.Oh yes. The glaring omission. I thought Lucas would be kind enough to bring back the Ewoks 'jub jub' song at the end of ROTJ. I miss that song so much and to me it was a part of the experience way back then.Two thumbs up for the whole package, two thumbs down for leaving the 'jub jub' song omitted!	4.0	Good collection but one GLARING omission!	2004-09-22	11	8	3

Yes I was appauled that Greedo shot first. In this version he shoots at the same time. Lucas! How about him not shooting at all!? Han Solo is a pirate at this point with a price on his head. He doesn't have to have the heroic ""never shoot a guy in the back"" way of thinking. Y'know, one dirtbag rubbing out another. Other changes for the DVD version was Obi-Wan's Krytt Dragon call used to scare away the Sand People was altered. The Jabba scene was improved. He looks more life like and not like he belongs in a Playstation game. I also liked the addition of that scene where Luke sees his old friend Biggs in the hanger before the last battle. It added to the emotion on Lukes face when Biggs got blown away in the trench.In Empire they changed a few more things... Why did they have to change Boba Fett's voice? (Actually, it was so he'd sound like Jango Fett, since Boba's a clone and all...) It didn't really detract from anything but when you've seen the movie as many times as I have you notice right away. They changed the image and voice of the Emperor. This was an improvement that evryone pretty much saw coming as we're all trying to follow Lucas' insanity. The worst change in this film for me was the one he did back in 1997. He changed Vaders dialogue near the end of the film. The part when Vader leaving Bespin after not bringing in Luke is surrounded by his commanders and troops walking to his shuttle. In the original he barks out 3 words scaring his men, ""BRING MY SHUTTLE."" The mood was perfect, his men looked scared, and you knew Vader was pissed! In the SE version he said something completely different that did not at all show that same anger. ""Inform my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival!"" WHAT??? 1. He didn't sound pissed. 2. He didn't sound at all menacing. 3. ""Bring my shuttle"" would have worked with the new shuttle sequence just as well untouched. 4. James Earl jones was 17 years older when he redid that dialogue and it sounded like it. That dialogue change just sucked the life out of that scene as far as tension and where the mood was going.Return of the Jedi: Well, I wouldn't have cried if he did away with the Ewoks. LOL The Sy Snoodles animation made me feel like I was watching ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" But since Lucas hated the original scene I knew that was coming. The added look for the Sarlaac Pit was unnecessary IMO. I liked the added celebrations of the different cities at the end but changing the Ewok song was lame. And the Hayden Christiansen thing at the end was just obscene. Why change the original image of Anakin Skywalker? He died at that age (in that stage in his life) so his image should be of the same age/appearence right? Also, those images are how Luke remembers them. How could you have a young Anakin image for Luke to see if he's never seen his father until after he took the Vader mask off him? I mean they didn't substitute an image of Ewen MacGregor in place of Sir Alec Guiness! That just plain didn't make sense.The pic quality, sound, and widescreen is nothing short of stellar! The documentary disc was neat also. I do recommend this set for those reasons but if those changes I mentioned irked you as bad as they did me? Keep your original VHS/LD editions from 1995 or older to accompany this set because you'll always want to go back! Trust me."	4.0	The Good with the Bad	2005-01-08	14	13	1

I along with the majority of planet Earth love them, let's leave it at that. Nor will I go into the 4 billionth discussion about these ""Special Editions"" vs. the originals. I personally do not care all that much about what Lucas has changed or added. Sorry purists, but I just don't see this as significant as the Second Coming of Christ like you do. Having said that, I do agree with the one-star reviews about this only being the first in a probable series of ""Star Wars"" box sets, making us buy them over and over again. One can easily see this by the bonus materials. We all know that there is plenty of other stuff that *could have been* included here, such as deleted scenes (which anyone who even casually searches the Web for knows exist). This just reeks of an ""Extra Super Duper Mega Deluxe Edition"" in the future that will contain all this. So in a way this trilogy is a rip-off to some extent. I have never bought ""Star Wars"" on video nor laserdisc, whether it be the originals or Special Editions. So this DVD trilogy is my first official purchase. I guess people in my shoes won't get *as much* ripped off as others in that sense. Honestly, I find it better than going to eBay to hunt down the originals on video and probably end up spending more than I would on this DVD trilogy. And I would have to buy the videos again eventually anyway, as that format deteriorates over time. It all evens out in the wash."	3.0	Awesome movies, questionable bonus material	2004-09-21	9	3	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1WIT2RHPHIMXE	Eric Fischnaller	Whoops! I think Lucas missed the boat here.  By the time higher market penetration hits, the disc price will be down to an average of $15. Had he released it last Christmas, he could've sold the complete Star Wars compendium including all six of the original films with special features and the like (including original and revised versions of the films) plus Clone Wars. This set would probably have run somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 last year.  This year it would probably be on sale at no more than $150. Next year it'll be a Black Friday Door Buster for $49.99!Had he released it last year, it would've driven sales of BD players last year, he would've sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 1Million copies - a net profit to him somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million dollars... now who couldn't use an extra 40 mil during the Holidays?  This year he would sell an additional 3 million copies.  Probably by the time he releases it, BD will be no more.  That'll just frost my hide!LUCAS - if you read this.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	Star Wars: A New Hope-A highly enjoyable beginning to the saga, this is easily the most light-hearted and accessible film of the trilogy.  Taking place in a galaxy far away, young Luke Skywalker is suddenly propelled into a galactic adventure against the Empire when he encounters two droids that bear an urgent message from Princess Leia, leading Luke to Obi-Wan Kenobi and pilot Han Solo.  Little do they know they'll be in a battle not only for their own lives but for the freedom of the galaxy!  Star Wars is first-rate escapist entertainment, with plentiful action sequences and high-tech visual effects.  Unfortunately, much of the dialogue, quite truthfully, reeks and the acting is only somewhat better (Only Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness really impress).****/*****The Empire Strikes Back-This superior sequel to Star Wars boasts a more complex and imaginative plot that bears plenty of intrigue and mystery (we get the first glimpse of Darth Vader's head, Yoda speaks of &quot;another&quot; hope), far superior special effects, and confident performances from almost the entire cast.  Director Irvin Kershner crafts some of the series' most memorable action sequences, including the battle on ice planet Hoth and the climactic lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader.  The story separates into two threads, so the pacing isn't quite as consistent as the original.  The storyline following the Millenium Falcon is much more interesting and faster-paced than Luke's quest to become a jedi, but the latter story is just as vital.**** 1/2/*****Return of the Jedi-Long hailed as the weak link of the series, ROTJ boasts lots of rousing action sequences, terrific special effects, and decent performances, but little else.  The cliffhangers in Empire Strikes Back are lazily resolved and the continuing story is fraught with head-scratchers.  What exactly George Lucas was thinking when he included the Ewoks is beyond me, they're probably the trilogy's worst idea, period.  As cute eye-candy, they serve their purpose but they should have been kept in the background.  The battle of Endor Moon is cringe-inducing, with spear-toting teddy bears defeating high-tech imperial infantry troops with rocks and arrows.  If the special edition should have made any changes, it would have to be excising these teddy bears altogether!***/*****	4.0	Best sci-fi series? Can't think of any others as fun.	2003-10-19	5	0	5

Must have been either all the great sales of Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones, or that Paramount put out Speilburg, Indiana Jones Trilogy (which I believe Lucas had a hand in) on discs as well.  I for one am glad the discs will be the 1997 special edition re-releases. I admit with some films it's good to see the originals vs the special edition on the same disc for comparison, but this is one of those rare times that the special editions were so much superior to the originals that I could accept these AS orignals. Forget about the 1977, 1980 and 1983 copies respectively and respectfully. These 1997 reissues on tape are better, and on disc will be SUPERB. Besides only the original print of Jedi gives credit to the great James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, while the special editions of ALL 3 do the man justice.:-)  Order this set be it full screen or widescreen, and between now and September, buy yourself a multi disc player so you can enjoy all 3 back to back in one sitting.	5.0	The Force Will Be With Your DVD Player......Always	2004-06-26	18	11	7

I own a set of LaserDiscs of the series AFTER remastering and BEFORE all the changes, and I will not be replacing them until a proper version of the DVDs, with the original effects and scenes exists.However, if we go by Mr. Lucas' track record on Episodes I & II (which I thought were pretty awful movies) he has lost touch with his audience and can't imagine why everyone doesn't like his &quot;improvements&quot; He is lost in a world of CGI for CGI's sake!So, 5 stars for the original series, and 1 for this DVD set with the altered versions.	3.0	5 stars for the ORIGINAL series - 1 star for these DVDs	2004-08-06	18	14	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	APM06HT7JIPZ5	"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton"""	"I had resolved not to write an early review for this release, because there were already so many. But, alas, I could not help myself. I pretty much agree with what the majority of reviewers have said already. It is a certifiable crime not to release the original theatrical releases on DVD. The reason people are making such a big deal about this is because the Star Wars Trilogy was, without a doubt, the most groundbreaking film series of all time. Their superb special effects and grand, epic scale were equally matched by their characters, humor and story. Now how many modern big-budget blockbusters could you say that about, hmm? Not very many.Since I have mixed feelings about all three revamped films, I'll say a little bit about each of them:STAR WARS - A NEW HOPE: This one received the worst treatment of all the Special Editions, thanks to the new CGI effects. This is the worst CGI I have ever seen in any film ever! Mos Eisley looks taken from an original PlayStation game, and I dare you not to cringe during the new Jabba the Hutt scene. (He also looks nothing like the one in ROTJ.)THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK: Overall the best of the Special Editions, primarily because it received the least amount of changes. And what they did change is actually pretty good. My favorite new part comes when they arrive at Cloud City, during which new fly-by shots are seen. The CGI here is actually very nice.RETURN OF THE JEDI: Okay, now why the #$%# did they feel the need to put in that new musical number at Jabba's Palace?!?! It is horribly jarring, out of place, and just plain obnoxious. Plus, all it does is serve as another excuse to put in some more cruddy CGI. The revamped Pit of Carcoon scene could have been awesome, again, had they just bothered to make the CGI a little (or rather a LOT) better. However, I absolutely love the new ending, with the new footage of the celebration spanning the galaxy. And John Williams' new music here is outstanding, making for a much better sense of resolution and ""the war is over"" than in the original version. In my eyes, this single addition makes the entire Special Edition project worth while.Overall, the best thing to come out of the Special Editions were the cleaning up and digital remastering of the film prints, the removal of those little black lines that come from using blue or green screen, and that final adjusted scene in ROTJ.Looking back, I can't believe that the George Lucas who made those classic films is the same George Lucas who made those crappy prequels. Seriously, I think that Lucas is dead and was replaced by a robot or an alien drone. Far-fetched, perhaps, but you gotta admit, that would explain a lot of things. I mean, he is quite simply not the great filmmaker he once was a long, long time ago. Gee, THX-1138 and American Grafitti DO seem like a galaxy far, far away. He is absolutely right in saying that they are his movies, and he has the right to do whatever he wants with them, I agree wholeheartedly. But he also has a job . . . nay, an obligation . . . to the fans of these movies that are responsible for his success in the first place! If we want to see the original versions that we grew up watching, that we love, on DVD, than by gum he should do that! How hard could it be?!The original Star Wars Trilogy is the single most flawlessly entertaining achievement in motion picture history, its quality surpassed only by the LOTR trilogy, IMHO. Whether you found my review helpful or not, I just had to express my views as well. Maybe in the future, after George Lucas dies (but don't take me for some freak who actually wants him to die), the new heads at Lucasfilm will decide to release the theatrical editions on DVD. I sure don't want to wait that long, however.Actually, I'll definitely buy this DVD release (Oh, to hear John Williams' glorious score in Dolby Digital 5.1 . . . *drool*) . . . . . . but on one condition: they don't insert any actors from the prequels. I've seen some pictures online of Hayden Christiansen inserted into the end of ROTJ, and I literally screamed. Of all the injustices, of all the blasphemies, of all the - ! Sorry, I'm getting carried away. The point is, I don't care what Mr. Lucas does with these movies, or what new stuff he adds, as long as he never, EVER puts that horrible excuse for an actor in these priceless gems.

Crigger	"I haven't gone Blu-ray just yet and the CGI'd (ruined) versions of these classic films aren't going to get me on board either!  But that is neither here nor there since you can also buy these inferior releases on dvd!I figure at the very least the new versions of Star Wars could be turned into one hell of a drinking game.  Get a group of friends together, get some booze (your choice), pop in your favorite; A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi; Then everytime you see one of Lucas' horrible/unnecassary changes everyone take a drink!  You could also make up other rules, like first one to say, ""Dammit George!"" doesn't have to drink but all others do!I see many posting that the 2006 Special Edition dvds are one way of getting the original versions but why pay for that when all you have to do is buy the 1990 VHS versions (Glad I held onto mine!) because they are the same print!  Pan & Scan and 2.0 Dolby intact....Way to throw the fans a bone George!I'm sure the HD picture on these is flawless but the added CGI scenes are unneeded and take away the ""realness"" that the original films had....Lucas is spending to much time trying to make the originals like the prequels!  He should have tried to make the prequels more like the originals!

I WILL NOT buy this set or any other Stars Wars blu-ray set unless the original trilogy is released!Why can't George Lucas just release this:- A Blu-ray boxset of the original trilogy, in their original theatrical released forms, all cleaned up and treated with the upmost respect in terms of picture and sound quality- Bonus disc(s) of all the bonus features from the original trilogy; like deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, etc.Why is that so difficult?

I was eight years old when I saw Star Wars in the theater for the first time, and, like millions of other people, became an overnight lifelong fan.  Bought all the action figures and toys-had the posters on my walls-the whole nine yards.  Looked at another way, I'm part of the considerable fan base that elevated George Lucas to the lofty position he's in today as the head of Lucasfilm Ltd.  A position that affords him complete control over these releases.That said, I won't be buying these DVD's.Yes, Star Wars is one of the greatest trilogies of all time.  Yes, it's one of the most important cinematic milestones in the history of the medium in terms of its box office success and its influence.  So, why am I calling 'no joy?'  I see no need to lay down my money for what are, arguably, remakes of the classic movies I fell in love with as a child.Not that I mind the new special effects additions.  I can understand why Lucas might want to pump up the FX to make these films more visually appealing to newer generations of moviegoers who are far more jaded than I was in the late 70's.  But these so-called enhanced versions aren't the versions I care about.  What adds to the disappointment is the fact that the DVD medium is capable of containing both the 'enhanced' versions and the classic versions, allowing viewers to choose whichever they want.  But do we get that luxury?  No.  Instead, we're asked to placate ourselves with the remade versions now and then spend even more money down the road to buy the classic versions in some Ultimate Edition-the version these DVD's should have contained from the very beginning.  (At least I'm assuming the classic versions will be released at a later date.  I don't know that for sure.)  People-even devout fans-don't like being jerked around that way.Lucas has already made his fans wait a 'long, long time...' for this DVD release.  I'm very disappointed to see that the thanks we get for our patience is to be told he expects us to buy this on DVD not once but twice(?).  Sorry, but no.  I own these movies on VHS, and will continue to watch them in that format for an equally long time to come.  Lessons to Lucas and the rest of Hollywood: 1) Don't mess with a cultural icon.  2) If you can't follow lesson 1, at least don't deny true fans the classic version of a film.	1.0	The 'Farce' is With Us	2004-04-01	6	4	2

I remember as a child seeing an interview with him and he said something Most of hollywood has forgotten including him,..""special effects are NOT what the movie is about, the movie is about the CHARACTERS moving through a STORY"".

The originals were not as eye popping as todays' CGI films but quite well done special effects for that time. It felt more ""real"" than the overdone movies of today....don't get me wrong, I love a lot of today's great effects films but some do go overboard to the point where you feel like you are watching an almost animated film. For example, the Hulk movies where he is CGI look so unrealistic it ruins the action scenes completely. I don't feel the character is struggling or doing anything at all.I admire the actor who played the Thing in Fantastic Four for insisting on a suit rather than CGI, much more believable that he lost his human form to a mutation rather than an elaborate cartoon taking over his part.Well, I guess it seems hypocritical to worry about the realism of such movies that are so far from reality but that's what movies are supposed to do, make you believe in the unbelievable, even if for just two hours of your life. And that's the magic.So George, give the true fans a gift and put the originals on Blu ray!

I will not get into the differences, as the Amazon reviewer already has in detail, but at the end of the day, they really aren't that different, when you watch them as a whole, and not just the particular scene isolated.  Most of the changes do not take up much screentime, and the overall feel of the saga is still the same.  The purists may want to hesitate, since Lucas has stated that he will release the older versions on DVD when VHS becomes obsolete, so don't start screaming yet!The special features are great too, although I'm hoping for an even bigger set to come out in 2007 (30th anniversary).	5.0	Star Wars on DVD!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1NHLJ2J42OI8Z	Evan T. Wardwell	The Star Wars trilogy is, like many others have stated, our modern mythology.  The movies let us live vicarously through the characters and are engrained into our personality and our culture.  How many classic mythology stories have been made and remade into films.  The updated versions gave a more visually spoiled generation a new look at a classic without remaking it. How many people were disapointed with the 1976 remake of King Kong.  The critical person saying the new rerelease of the films is an afront has not done his homework or he wouldn't have made so many assumptions.  George Lucas does not feel or trust that the DVD technology cannot be pirated.  But he has stated that he would probably release DVD versions in the future. Also, it has been almost three years since the special editions were available to the mass market, so some may want to get the films that passed on it before the Episode I film came out. And lastly, the extra feature is not a simple trailer but a behind the scenes documentry which are just as interesting to watch. I may have the previous editions but I, like others look forward to catching a glimpse of the next chapter of a place far,far away.	5.0	We love it, if you don't get over yourselves	2000-11-05	75	37	38

However, like many people said, I wanted to see them as they used to be.  Some of the changes were acceptable, yes, but some were just plain stupid and I should say, unnecessary.  For example, the Wumpa cave.  In the original ESB, Luke only chopped off the monster's arm, so we never know if the monster survived or not.  But in special ed, you know he's dead.  Well, if the monster's dead, why did luke ever to bother getting out of the cave?  Why wouldn't he stay there to avoid snow storm?Anyhow, that's just an example.What I want to say here is 'Special Edition' should have kept 'Special.'  Now the DVD comes out, it becomes totally 'finished and permanent' edition.Well, Lucas is a bussiness man, so I'm sure he'll release the 'original' trilogy in a few years.But you know, Star Wars fans always love Star Wars.  Like myself.I'd give the set 2 less star for not including the original edition.	3.0	Special Edition - Wasn't it just 'Special?'	2004-09-13	19	11	8

It looks fantastic, though. I hope I just had a lemon, and that no one else has the same problem. Very frustrating. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, and especially love the first film (Episode IV) for sentimental reasons, though I agree with many others that The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the three.	3.0	Poor sound on Episode IV	2006-02-05	3	1	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3E12T3SEG0JMX	Extremisto	"It should be painfully obvious to all that Lucas will never stop changing the original Star Wars series.  Why is this, do you ask?  My guess is that he KNOWS that he's lost his spark, his talent, so he's continuing to focus on the only great thing he's ever done in his life and hawk it to a new audience.  There's no other reason for it.  He could have been working on Indiana Jones 4 ten years ago rather than trying to fix something that was never broken.I've been hearing people say things like we ""extremist"" fans need to get a life and get over the changes.Why would these extremists not have lives because they don't want their memories stomped on? Lucas NEEDS TO KNOW that his real fans continue to want the original versions released if there's ever going to be a remote chance of him doing so.  You know how he likes to 'change', so there's always a possibility. Simply rolling over and swallowing his garbage will only ensure that he continues to produce it.Others consider the special editions to be only a small change.A small change?  I see it more as a series of huge changes. Let me explain how this seems to many of us true fans: The movies have been dissected; they're no longer whole.  They've been, in a word, [adulterated] to the highest degree (but with George the degree can only get higher, so maybe 'highest' is an overstatement).  Speaking for myself, I watch these movies not only for entertainment, but to bring back a NOSTALGIC feeling.  When GL made these changes, he took away the nostalgia of the series.  THAT'S what many fans are bitter over...it's not about thinking that the new versions are horrible, but it's a feeling of betrayal, as if something once great and important during a certain period of our lives has been cast to the wind.  I enjoyed my childhood, and Star Wars was a huge part of it.  It's not healthy to *live* in the past, but we all like to reflect on it from time to time, whether it be through music, old toys, or movies.Others say that the changes are acceptable to everyone but angry, lonely, borderline sociopaths.So, everyone who refuses to settle for this insult is an angry, lonely, borderline sociopath?  Give me a break. True fans simply don't take whatever's thrown at them.  If we have a problem with the changes, then we have the right to let it be known.  Such personal attacks on character are not valid.Changes aside, the sound is also substandard as many reviewers have posted. I didn't actually purchase this abomination myself, but allowed a friend to watch it on my home theater system.  Audio inconsistencies are to be expected when considering the technology of the day.  Sound isn't nearly as easy to alter as video.  The video is much better than the 1997 special editions, but it didn't meet my expectations either.All in all, if you weren't happy with the special edition changes, save your money for a laserdisc player, check eBay for 'special' deals, or continue to watch the movies on VHS. This set is nothing more than 50 bucks worth of disappointment."	1.0	I wish I could give this ZERO stars	2005-07-22	13	10	3

I might add a voice reading of jango fett of this review.  I might even change one of the letters, maybe a capitol C instead of that lower case k. Anyways do not buy this, the changes to these movies subtract from the movie.  It would be like beethoven resurrecting from his grave today, and saying I think i'm going to add some electric guitar solos into all my work.Do not buy the star wars trilogy on dvd, get the original on vhs.  If you keep buying these special editions they are just going to keep pumping out special editions of this Trilogy.  The 50th anniversay of this movie, they will probabley do another special edition.  I think they are going to CGI replace mark hammil with Michael J. Fox or Ralph Machio.  And Star Wars 3000.

You see, something happened to George somewhere between Empire and Jedi. He lost his artistic vision, and got...well, weird.Can somebody out there, anybody, please explain to me how shooting Greedo first makes Han Solo a ""killer"" as George says -thus requiring a scene where Greedo shoots first? Do any of you really agree that Han was a cold-blooded monster for that? I doubt it; I don't think anybody thinks that, I think everybody thought Solo was ""cool"" for defending himself. Somehow, inexplicably, Goerge doesn't agree. He has confused his own morality with that of a fictional space fantasy character. In short, George has lost it.Are all these added scenes and revisions really necessary? I mean, they recently released the Indiana Jones series, without new scenes, and that was just fine.  (You know, if George had the power to re-make Raiders of the Lost Ark, I bet he'd have that sword-wielding dude throw a sword at Indy before Indy shoots him, so that people don't perceive Indy as a ""killer."" And you KNOW George would do it. All of us can just thank Mr. Spielberg for stopping George's silly revisionist nonsense on that series...)Advice to George: Listen to the commentary on Empire, listen to director Irwin Kershner. Listen to how he talks about character development, subtlety in a scene, emotion on film...listen to how he talks about creating humor without MAKING THE MOVIE SEEM COMIC. I love this guy.

Everyone is taking sides, either by claiming Lucas has raped their childhood or by making fun of this statement.I'll try to stay somewhere in the middle because I feel it's time to go past this useless confrontation. First, I love Star Wars, OT and Prequels too. I liked a lot of the SE tweaks (mostly in ESB and some in JEDI), and disliked some of them (the Jabba scene in ANH and Greedo and some of the Mos Eisley sound effects). It's like Phantom Menace. I didn't like Jar Jar or some of the kiddy stuff. But I love the movie in spite of that.I guess G. Lucas has the right to claim these are the movies he wants. I guess people have the right to ask for the editions they like the most. My personal choice would be a mixed release: the SE with a few changes, like the ones I mentioned. That would be MY choice. Since they aren't going for it, I accept these movies for what they are.I saw the originals like 20+ times each before the SE. I loved them and they were a constitutive part of my childhood. And that feeling will be with me forever, with or without Greedo shooting first. Again, I would have preferred Han doing it the old way. But I feel my love for these movies and the great imagination where they came from will be intact with or without this.So I understand and respect Lucas for his bold statement. I don't think it is a spit on the fans. I think it is a personal choice. The one he changed the most is the one he directed. If two years from now he releases the originals on dvd then I will think it was all about money. If he stays true to that statement, then I will respect his choice, like it or not. After all, I can think of a thousand ways to make money with the franchise if he wanted to (sequels, anyone?).My point is, it is alright. Everyone here can see both sides. In like 600 reviews, it has been made clear. So let's start talking about what WILL BE released and not so much about what SHOULD BE. I, for one, don't really like that much the extras. I expected rough footage and deleted scenes. The fourth disc maybe turn out to be great, but it doesn't really impress me that much. On the other hand, the Lowry transfer they are doing for the films means we are going to experience the movies in a way we never even dreamed we could (at home, anyway).Anyway, I will be buying this dvd set. I still have the originals in VHS, which is not that good I reckon. I love the new films too, and think they really add to the whole star wars experience. I am grateful that in my late twenties, I am about to see one final SW movie. I am grateful it isn't over, and when it is, I'll be grateful for the ride.These movies mean that much for me as they mean to you. That's why we are reading all these reviews. Now let's go past these words and watch the films. And be amazed, one more time.	5.0	Somewhere in the middle	2004-04-30	6	2	4

I does seem that Lucas is trying to impose his revision of history on us all.But keep a few things in mind: the original Star Wars and Empire were great; Return was a bit disappointing (I think that Lucas was already starting to change then in 1983). And so the revisions, I thought actually helped Return: the celebrations on the other worlds he added at the end broke up the Ewok celebration, and made it SLIGHTLY easier to take. The revisions really hurt Star Wars (the now infamous Greedo scene, especially), but I don't remember it having much of an effect on me for Empire (far and away the best of the original 3--and incidentally the one that Lucas had the least to do with).We all know how this will resolve itself. A few years after the last of these lame 3 new movies is out, a mega, super-expensive boxed set of pretty much everything will come out--including the originals of the first 3. I must say that it saddens me to think that Lucas really feels the need to milk (really exploit) fans that have made him so successful. Come on Lucas, give us a break.	3.0	Disappointed? ...

I don't want them on Blu-Ray.  Want to include them alongside the original versions, fine, but don't ignore your fans.  By ignoring them, you are caving in to your worst instincts as an entertainer and as an artist, to do your art for you, and you alone, and that is a very sad state of affairs.Releasing the original, uncut, restored versions on Blu ray would be a love letter to all your fans.  A thank you note for putting you on the map as a director and one of the foremost science fiction writers of the 20th and 21st Centuries.  We did together.  You worked hard and we ate it up, seeing the movie several times in the theaters, buying every version, whenever you released it, on every format.  Now that Blu-Ray is up the task and you are still alive and able to work on it, commit to us that you will do what we ask.  Please.  We are in no position to demand it, but we are in a position to respectfully request it.Thanks in advance.

This isn't an issue of messing with someone's childhood memories - Star Wars was a game-changer for the industry, and for people who still love it enough 30+ years later to cry foul, people who have well-lined Lucas' pockets with their so-called lack of interest.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1UGDLSFWZ76CJ	"Fire in the sky ""Metrarail"""	"I had a chance to watch the Star Wars disc from this supposedly unaltered set and was bummed out that even these are not the version that were in theaters back when I saw them.  I know this because when I was 8 I got to watch a bootleg Beta Max version of the first film nearly 50 times at a friends house.  I had also seen it the year before in theaters in 1977.This disc is missing 3 items that were in the original theatrical release.  I will list all three.1.  When they are all in the control center(in the death star), C3P0 points and tells Kenobi where to release the tractor beam in 3 different points at the same location.  (This was not on the DVD)2.  This one is the most obviuos ommission.  When Luke and Leia are at the Chasm before Luke throws the grappling Hook to swing across.  In the theater version , he puts the grappling hook in his gun and fires it at the ceiling so it will hook on.  Unfortunately it misses for them and it falls down.  Luke then needs to coil the whole cord up again with the hook and this time he tosses it and it catches.  If you watch any version of the film you will see a really poor edit of Luke pulling up the cord from his belt multiple times as if it had fallen once.  But Lucas couldn't just shorten the scene because it would have thrown off the music so he copied and pasted Luke pulling up the cord 2 times.  For what ever reason, he felt the first time using a gun was not needed to be left in.3.  This one is minor but when they get through the blast door in the death star to avoid Vader, you can hear the Storm troopers tell the door operator (somewhere) to ""Close the blast Doors"" and then after it closes, you hear someone say ""open the blast doors"".  In all the versions since the movie came out in theaters the ""Close the blast Doors"" line has been edited out.  It is possible it is still on the non THX version of the Laser Disc.There is also a shortened scene in the Return of the Jedi but that is for another day.  George shortened that as well.George if you are reading this (And I know you are not) Why don't you actually put the ""REAL"" theatrical version on DVD and not this Psuedo version of Theatrical.  All these DVDS are is of a transfer from the THX Laser Disc Version.  I think the original Laser Disc version might have a little more in them, but I am not sure.BTW, George even did this with Episode III as well.  He took out a 15 second scene of General Grevious climbing out side of the crashing ship as it was going down at the beginning of the film. he deleted it because he later realized that General Grevious could not breath outside in space.  We know he breathes because of his coughing all through out the film.  Those 15 seconds never made it to the DVD or the deleted scene section.  Woops ;o)I don't knwo why he does this to all of his films.I wish my friend still has his Beta Max copy but it has been long gone for 20 years."	3.0	These are still not the original releases from 77,80, & 83	2008-03-02	40	31	9
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2N32P9WR2S78W	FitzFG	"Many of these reviews blast purists and tell them to suck it up and get with the times.  Personally, I am a purist.  I want Lucas to release the ORIGINAL on dvd.I understand how this position may be difficult for a younger generation to understand.  Let me paint a parallel to which most people will be able to relate.  Lets say, theoretically, that in 20-30 years the Tolkien estate comes under new management.  Peter Jackson obtains the rights to The Hobbit and makes a new movie.  He casts Brad Pitt as Gandalf and proceeds to dub over Sir Ian McKellen's face in the original trilogy just to make the movies ""mesh"" more efficiently.  While he's at it he makes a few more changes that either a minority of people want or that he'd been wanting to do for years.  He makes all the Gondorians African American and the Rohirrim Native American because a few people have complained that the trilogy was racist.  Just for fun he places a repeating ballista on the top of each Oliphaunt and adds an army of dwarfs to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. He also touches up the scenery by adding flying dragons to the background or expanding some of the battle scenes with fighting wizards or other such junk.  The finale is altered to include a MiddleEarth wide song/dance/celebration with Hobbits doing ballet and Elves rapping.  All of these effects are done using state-or-the-art tech that contrasts harshly with the film quality of today.  Jackson then refuses to release the original LOTR on the video system that replaces dvd because the new one is ""better"".  You also have to listen to a new generation talking about how dated the original LOTR are and saying that Jackson is justified in mangling them.  If you are a fan of LOTR and this scenario does not bother you, then you truly have my sympathy.Returning to reality: I am going to hold on to my VHS versions of the original Star Wars Trilogy and hope they last until Lucas dies and someone else releases the original on dvd."	1.0	Terms most people can understand	2004-12-01	93	77	16

The main thing I really disliked about the additions was that of the young Anakin.  It's just not logical to have the young Anakin standing next to the old Obi-Wan.  If you want to use young Anakin, fine, but you should also use young Ewan McGregor Obi-Wan as well.  And really, since Luke only saw his father when he was dying, he only knew the old Anakin - didn't he wonder who this young kid was standing next to Yoda and old Obi-Wan???

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AOVTW977JK338	"F. Krubl ""Fe TTCandme"""	"I vaguely recall a very controversial interview with Lucas from years past, when he said he would not release the original trilogy ever again UNTIL the technology which he desired was finally available. Of course, he never really described such-mentioned technology.Well we all have heard that the apparent reason why he 'tinkered' with the original releases in the first place was because some of the 'technology' he needed to make those 'added' scenes was non-existant back in the 70's (CGI). Apparently those added scenes were in his notes, and just not do-able back then. Again, this is all arguable.But my point here is.....okay Lucas, you added your 'beloved' extra scenes as soon as you were able to. So what about the re-release of the originals? What more could you want from the 'technology' then BLU RAY? It's won the HD war. It is arguably, the future. Do what you said you would do... release the ORIGINALS on blu. And soon! This is finally a format large enough to include everything and anything everyone could possibly want all in 1 place. Satisfy us all by releasing a single blu-ray for each movie that includes every version ever released (they did it for T2!)....and every extra ever released. That would be a SINGLE SET OF 6-7 BLUs (perhaps 1 seperate disk for all of the extras). Not 10 seperate regular dvd sets (and lets not forget those old vhs sets some of us are still hanging on to). The double, triple, and ten-touple dipping has got to stop! Imagine that; product for the people. Your patient fans await!*****Update 8/2010*****So Lucas has announced in Celebration V that all of the episodes will be released on Blu in fall of 2011. Part of me is overjoyed. Part of me is not so sure. Time will tell with what is included. All we know is that it will most definitley be the 'ammended' versions. And, of course, he'll pull footage out of his vault that we've never seen before in the extras. So much for my idea of housing a majority of the previous extras all in one set. :( However, one of Lucas' comments left a bad taste in my mouth and I thought I would share it here. He is quoted for saying at Celebration V that ""We've been wanting to do it as soon as we possibly could, but we just wanted to do it when enough people would be able to buy it and see it."" What exactly is that supposed to mean? Hmmm? My euphemism-detector is about to explode! So in other words ""I didn't wanna do it until the opportune amount of people have jumped on the blu-ray bandwagon, so that I may make the most amount of money possible during it's first weeks of sale, therefore making my efforts worth while.""

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3B42K3RQ0U3E3	Flamanar	I grew up with these movies, having seen A New Hope in theaters when it was first released at age 16.  This is not the ORIGINAL Trilogy.  Lucas keeps altering the films.  Now he's digitally editing out actors and altering the plot.  Lucas doesn't understand that the fans love the movies the way they originally were...even with all the flaws.  He did a good job at cleaning these movies up, but there are lots of additional effects he's added that are subpar.  He's also done some color-correcting that, in some places, has made the picture worse (notice in the space battle that opens A New Hope that when the Imperial ship passes above the planet below it, not only do the engines glow blue...THE PLANET BELOW GLOWS BLUE, TOO!!).  It's apparent that some processes in the restoration of these movies received much more time and resources than others.  I wish Lucas would come to his senses and release the TRUE ORIGINAL TRILOGY...bugs, dirt, errors and all.  If they can release the Alien Quadrilogy with 2 versions of each movie, Lucas can do the same.  He's certainly not hurting for funds.  Mr. Lucas, give the fans what they want...unaltered and unadulterated.	1.0	Huge letdown for longtime fans	2004-11-03	32	24	8

As Vader said, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing."" From my vantage point, I have the ""original"" original Episode IV - A New Hope, my sister has the 1st remastered trilogy, I also have the 2nd remastered gold trilogy and 3rd remastered ""special edition"" trilogy with the new scenes and CGI effects. I agree with my generation's side on Solo v.s Greedo scene. George Lucas should've left it alone. As for the Moss Isley scene, they missed Lucas's point on why he wanted more people and activity in it compared to how the ""original"" scene was. Back in 1976, the studio execs were rushing George on a deadline for Episode IV's release. He didn't have the technology and materials to make Episode IV completed the way he envisioned it. Although over 90% of Episode V and VI were done, but the remaining portion had to be added with new scenes and CGI.Yes the prequels didn't meet every Star Wars fans' expectations due to the lack of story writing. But that's meant for the new fans who have to keep going back watching the original trilogy after Episode I and II to know how the story and characters are connected.And from what I'm hearing is this dvd trilogy has scenes with Christen Hayden replacing a previous actor's scenes as Darth Vader? Or is it the trailor that's been extended with scenes from Episode I and II to go with IV, V, and VI?In conclusion, I'm adding this new dvd trilogy to my collection and seeing how Star Wars has evolved in 27 years.

Also new locations, new villains, and new characters like Yoda, and a new plot to carry the series to the climax, all are added.The writing was also the best of any Star Wars movie; bring memorable lines like ""Luke I Am Your Father!""

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1QSSKI2U33K4R	"flashgordon ""flashgordon"""	"Mark Hamill is going to kill me for posting this rationalization of the Star Wars film; so will Harrison Ford; Carrie Fisher I guess will just make "" Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" movies; as for George Lucas, I guess he's make edits of my childhood movie because (paraphrasing more or less) 'it was unethical to shoot Greedo first.'  So, here goes.This old world falls apart long before 'episode 4' by means of the growth of some dark force jedis. We have little to understand about the differences between the good and dark side of the force other than 'fear.' Well, I have a few things to say about 'fear'.Fear is the tactic used by the irrationalist.  The rationalist tries to establish observational/experimental facts and deduce new facts from there no matter how disheartening to our mental/emotional crutches(like the earth centered universe before the copernican revolution and the belief that god made us perfectly so evolution must be wrong).Let me elaborate about how the rationalist figures out the universe. We can't take in the whole universe all at one go; so, we idealize.  These are our definitions.  We make sure that our definitions only things that make sense with respect to each of the elements of a definition.  The elements of the definition are the same as a declarative sentence - noun, verb, noun.  What needs to be realized here is that a declarative sentence/definition is the language version of 'structure.'  Everything in the universe has structure; and everything in the universe is about changes of that structure.  There's things that have the same structure.  Two apples and two oranges can make(through idealization) two concrete examples of the same abstract structure - the number 2. The mathematical development(the symbol of rational thinking) really gets going when you relate these 'abstractions' to show how they transform into each other.  For instance by mapping the structures of 1 plus 1, you get the abstract structure of 2.  Basicaly, when you can show that the elements(nouns), or relations(verb) are in common, you can often transform various structures into one another(such as 1/2=.5; or, you could relate disperate fields and do things you could not before such as the abstractly identical structures of a tangent line and average speed formulas, and your on the road to calculus and the ability to calculate instantaeneous velocities and the areas of shapes with curved sides).See, the rationalist tries establish clear structural relations; the irrationalist tries to be evasive, fear monger, and be vague to avoid the 'question'.  For instance, what do most people tell their kids when they ask questions?  Either some b.s. answer, or!  God did it!  God is the algebraic X standing for ""I don't know.""  What did 'God, or Elohim' say to Moses when Moses asked who's talking to him? He says shut up, ""I am that I am."" And Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."" Getting back to God is the algebraic X standing for ""I don't know."" . . . no matter what happens, good or bad, god did it; god believers will sweep the unethical problem of god making bad things happen(since he's the infinit all knowing and did everything god) by saying ""god works in mysterious ways.""  They are also full of little mental(the dark side of the force) tricks like ""believe and you will believe.""See, all the rationalist efforts came to a head around 1931 when Kurt Godel published his incompleteness theorems; basicaly, he said that a finite set of axioms cannot prove an infinity of truths; but, an inconsistent(the dark side of the force) can prove anything(god works in mysterious ways).See, god is used to make excuses for everything even dictatorships and claiming divine right to the thrown.  Those who did so(or do so) make all kinds of vague tricks to suggest they have divine right to the thrown.  Kings throughout the dark ages did exactly this.  Even the bible has god shutting up King Soloman from suggesting democracy and prefering dictatorship . . . at 1Samuel chapter 8:10-22.  George Lucas has come out and said, he thinks a holy one should rule the whole of planet earth.  See, the great human ability is to be able to combine ideas; the rational spirit does so mathematicaly; the irrationalist does so sometimes purely in terms of avoiding answering questions and growing, or a weird mixture of the two.  How rational is George Lucas?  Here's all the vagueness and fear gaming I found in the original star wars trilogy.In ""A New Hope"", C3PO and R2D2 are shut up by Han Solo when he tells them 'because Wookies are known to tear people's arms out of their sockets"" justifying Chewbacka getting away with a corruption of a game by pownting . . . Luke and OB 1 Kenobi are in a bar and some guy fear mongers Luke about how he has the death sentence on twelve systems; this is a good usage of anti-fear mongering; but, as you will see George Lucas(and most people in this world) clearly don't understand the true difference between the good and dark side of the force.That seems to be the only case in ""A New Hope"" which gives that movie a good overall rating; but then comes Empire Strikes back; here, Yoda shuts up Luke by saying ""this home it is"" even though Luke made an innocent remark about the surroundings.  Then, while inside Yoda's home, Yoda tells Luke, jedi are not interested in adventure; humans are about their ability to think and explore the universe.Return of the Jedi . . . Bib Fortuna the front door man of Jabba the hut is weak minded( he scoffs at the thought of Luke being a Jedi) . . . Luke goes to see Yoda and Yoda tries to demeen Luke by saying Luke looked at him wrong . . . when Han Sola, Luke and some others are captured by the ewoks, C3PO tells Luke and Han Solo he will not tell the ewoks to let them go because it would be improper to impersonate a deity.  Leia can't answer Han Solo about why she's talking to Luke(this is understandable considering she just heard some interesting news; she eventually comes out of it).  Darth Vader can't confess he's been bad when confronted by his son(this is actually a noble usage of personal problem mongering and its consequences).  Calrissian at first can't believe his copilot that the shields may still be up; he goes through the logic and eventually shows the character to confess that maybe his copilot has a point; this shows the central role of whether a person is being scientific or not; a person is either looking behind the veiled curtain of nature or he isn't; it takes character to do so.  Han Solo acts up and say's ""when he gets back, i wont' get in the way""; Liea tells him he's her brother; well, at least  Han Solo kept cool enough to let her explain.Clearly, George Lucas is a mixture; he seems to understand there's this kind of weird fear gaming; other times, he seems to loose site, or he's a bit more conditioned than he can possibly imagine.  Yoda is clearly not the great thinking he portrays himself in his tone of speech.  I find this everywhere in the world.I thought I'd give some idea of how the prequils should have gone. Yoda was never at Coruscant.  Or, if ever visited the place, he long time ago went to his home world as a precaution from some dark side of the force long ago conquered at one time but never really understood. Young Jedis are sent to his world for training; but, they are kept in the dark as to where this world is; Yoda communicates through the force only.  This was stared hundreds of years before a growing dark side of the force springs up again.  The Jedi can sense it; but, they don't understand it; they are kind of naive just like George Lucas and most people today about fear and vagueness gaming. Like people today, they pride themselves in being socially sophisticated. People are going to drugs and irrationality religion all the time because even the Jedi can't answer all their questions(seen the recent commercials about; hey scientists, where's warp drive?  can't you answer me?  Can't you solve all my problems for me right now?). People are trying to move up the social power ladder all the time because they figure, ""who cares, nobody knows everything anyways; and, who cares, these people are willing to take to irrationalities anyways; there's a passage in Eusebius's ""Principia Evangelica"" to the affect of ""XXXI. That it will be necessary sometimes to use falsehood as a remedy for the benefit of those who require such a mode of treatment(that is Eusebius Preparatio Evangelica, book 12, chapter 31."" I'd have the soon to be Emperor thinking along these lines.  But, of course, he can't make his move because he detects that the Jedi have a hidden Jedi.  So, he waits.  Then the Jedi find Anakin Skywalker; they send him to Yoda who finds to much of the dark side of the force in him; sends him back; Anakin gets into all kinds of further troubles which attracts the eye of the Emperor; trains him in the dark side force; Anakin accepts because the Jedi have been instructed to not teach him how to be a jedi, and, it goes from there.  There's more stuff.  There's suppose to be a clone war.  Perhaps the Emperor and Anakin find that there's too many Jedi; so, they clone themselves; they start a war keeping the Emperor and soon to be Darth Vaders new allegiance a secret.  Jedi are getting killed. Finaly, OB-1 and maybe a few are left; they finaly find out that Anakin has turned to the dark side of the force, they search him out; almost kill him; or, they think they killed him.  The emperor finds out, turns Anakin into Darth Vader; Darth vader goes and kills the rest of the Jedi except OB-1 because he knows Anakin's tricks.  The rebel alliance is quickly formed and goes into hiding.  This more or less sets the stage for the original star wars trilogy; of course, they never did understand how things went wrong in the first place even after they stopped the Emperor and Darth Vader . . . ;"	3.0	about a world order that shouldn't have gone wrong but did mysteriously	2010-10-03	55	3	52

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"George Lucas wields his artist's rights like a light saber. All three films are given digital nips and tucks affecting visuals, audio and storyline. For purists demanding release of the original theatrical version, there's plenty of provocation. Let the fan boys debate: The rest of us will celebrate the return of Luke Skywalker and pals in intriguing reference-quality discs that eclipse all previous video incarnations.Lucas' changes help bring the films into alignment with their (newer) prequels. They are, for the most part, pleasing and harmless CG upgrades. In a few cases, actors from the current arc are subtly inserted into the older films. Most viewers will enjoy the little surprises planted along the way -- but maybe not the major one at the end of the third film.The job involved cleaning up something like 100 pieces of debris per frame. Amazingly, the wear has vanished. All of it. These look and sound like new films. Visuals are bright and bold. Contrasts run high -- Darth Vader's helmet is as black as his heart -- and the colors appear oversaturated at times. It's a handsome look with plenty of pop -- but one that takes getting used to. The 1997 laserdiscs look soft, murky and artifact-riddled by comparison.The Dolby 5.1 EX audio makes consistent use of the rear-center speaker (for a change), but the audio mix just isn't on par with the visuals, especially on ""New Hope."" The mix is obvious and light on ambient effects. Dialogue can be muffled and the volume drifts now and then. (No DTS to the rescue.) John Williams fans will suffer a disappointment in the first Death Star battle scene, as his score gets a downgrade in the new mix.Kevin Burns' 2 1/2-hour documentary ""Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy"" anchors the features. The film's sole point of view appears to be the greatness of George Lucas. Burns says he enjoyed editorial freedom, but the docu plays like an endless Hollywood making-of featurette as it recounts Lucas' struggles and triumphs. (""It's hard to remember a time before `Star Wars,' "" the narrator intones ridiculously at the beginning.) A curious decision to let the film drag on so, given the DVD medium's many interactive possibilities.Still, ""Dreams"" has plenty to offer even casual fans. Burns landed interviews with virtually all of the key talent, executives and craftsmen. At every turn, there are rare photos, concept sketches, outtakes or candid clips.Three snappy featurettes cover the evolution of the Jedi knights' light sabers (a huge technical problem early on), development of the ""Star Wars"" characters (Luke Skywalker was a little person at one point; a 60-year-old general at another) and the series' legacy (James Cameron, Ridley Scott and Peter Jackson discuss the films' influence on their work, especially the concept of a ""used future."").A 9-minute preview of the third prequel features shots of Hayden Christensen donning the Darth Vader helmet -- yikes."	4.0	Lucas blazes on	2004-09-25	7	5	2

I, for one, think it's absolute crap.Each scene that has new or adulterated footage looks awful and sticks out like a sore thumb.  None of it blends with the campy low budget feel of the orginal footage.  Furthermore, the new scenes add nothing to the story, they just add pointless exposition and synthetic spectacle.  However, this is just my opinion, and I'm sure some people liked the Special Edition.  However I'm not going to buy it, and there are others on this site that seem to feel the same way.People are saying that the Special Edition is the version of the films Lucas intended to make, and that since this is his trilogy, it's his decision, not ours.  I agree completely, I have no problem with him releasing the Special Edition version.  But by refusing to release the original trilogy on DVD, he is ignoring his fans.People are saying that the originals are destroyed or in bad condition.  I'm not sure if any of these rumors are true, I doubt it, but I'd rather watch a gritty version of the originals than a crisp version of the Special Edition.I hope this is what it looks like, a marketing ploy to get people to spend money on the less desirable Special Edition.  We'll see how principled Lucas is a few years from now when demand for the original version increases.	1.0	George Lucas does not care about his fans	2004-04-25	13	9	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A38JHJJDG8M2O0	Fory-san	"Before I start, I must tell you a little about myself: I have been an avid fan of science fiction, fantasy and horror since I was 11 years old. When I finally sat down and watched the VHS copies of the original trilogy I was totally blown away. Today, I still collect ""Star Wars"" memoirbillia. But these films have done something more for me: I am pursuing a career in animation filmmaking (with some live action flicks sprinkled here and there) and I really must state that the epic imagination of George Lucas is one of those directors I must thank from the bottom of my heart for inspiring me to become a director. I am 20 now going on 21 and no matter what format these films are in, the ""Star Wars"" trilogy will always be one of the best damn movies of all time. We've all heard about the new changes to the ""Star Wars"" films for their release on DVD this Tuesday, specifically to the end of Return of the Jedi where the ghost of Anakin Skywalker is now Hayden Christenson (Anakin in ""The Phantom Menace"" and the upcoming ""Rise of the Sith""). There is an article in this week's Entertainment Weekly asking Lucas head on about these new changes. Some of which is posted below. Apparently, George is now saying that he had always intended for Han Solo to fire first at Greedo in the Mos Eisley cantina. Quoted from the interview:""It's a correction. [When I made Star Wars] I said, ''Well, I don't have that shot, so I'll just, you know, fudge it editorially.'' In my mind [Greedo] shot first or at the same time. We like to think of [Han Solo] as a murderer because that's hip -- I don't think that's a good thing for people. I mean, I don't see how you could redeem somebody who kills people in cold blood.""Go buy the issue on newsstands now for more of the interview. Basically, Lucas feels that these are exactly the films he wanted to make all along and that the people screaming about his additions to them are trying to take the power of being a cinematic artist out of his hands.Now, I've heard both sides of the argument and this is what my opinion is after previewing the changes made to the movies, as an aspiring director then as an avid Star Wars fan. First off, if you look into the *personal* aspect of the movies' makings, you'll know Lucas went through hell and back to make the first three finished. From Fox's continuous threats to cut budgeting to almost having a heart attack on the set, George Lucas struggled emotionally to bring his epic vision to life. He literally gave a proverbial ""up yours"" to the Hollywood system and almost went totally independant on the first film if it wasn't for the lack of money. What he finished, according to him, was only 25% of what he wanted to do due in part to those budget constraints. He wanted a bigger, epic scope to his space opera.Director's are artists. If they have failed to completely paint their true vision onto the big screen (their canvas), they have failed to express themselves fully even if it means rejecting the audiences' reaction. When making the 1971 anime ""Cleopatra"" (terribly marketed in the U.S. as the first ""X-rated cartoon feature""), Osamu Tezuka refused to listen to advice from execs at his own studio in favor of what he considered to be ""art"". He didn't care about how much money he'd get, he wanted to show that cartoons was an artform to be admired. The film was a total flop, but when watching it today, it's an incredible achievement in artistic expression but the average moviegoer would most likely hate it. My point is that I think in his mind, Mr. Lucas is trying to complete his painting and won't be fully satisfied until he has, even if it means changing the movies we've all grown up watching.With all that said, I have to say that I don't think it was a very wise decision to make everything about the CGI and leave the story and characters on the backburner (something I get the impression he's doing for the latest prequels). Special effects mean squat if the characters are not developed, so digitally replacing an actor in the original ""Return of the Jedi"" with Hayden Christenson from the prequels is a very bad move on his part. However, the rest of the changes don't bother me frankly and I know that's going to upset some people. :::shrugs::: Just my opinion from a rabid fan of Star Wars. :)"	4.0	Star Wars still rocks...	2004-09-19	4	2	2

Watching the original version of Episode IV is  boring and the special effects are pure cheese, when watching the special  edition your watching what Lucas invisioned when he wanted to release the  film back in 1976. I think it's great, it ties with episode I. Imagine if  you show'd your kids the original versions and explained to them why there  weren't any CGI creatures in the last three films! I actually think that  Lucas could've done a better job in restoring some other scenes that  weren't tweeked for the Special Editions. Episode IV needs more CGI shots  especially at the Battle of Yavin scenes, the CGI scenes blended with the  oldschool special effects are pure cheese (this is the slowest episode in  the Trilogy) it needs something to tweek it up. Episode V needs more CGI  creatures, and the asteroid scene needs to be fixed (this one lacks in  creatures). Episode VI, do something about the Rancor, the matte lines kill  the whole experience, digitise the speeder chase on Endor. I'm just worried  that the Original Trilogy wont blend with the Prequel Trilogy.

If he would change his mind on the subject this would add considerable gravitas and authenticity to this particular lesson!And as for the prequel trilogy I understood that a strong democracy is absolutely necessary to withstand the evils of a dictatorship or an oligarchy. However, given how George Lucas is constantly denying the requests of the loyal fans from the beginning and handles the issue with the attitude of a dictator or emperor, I cannot help but doubt if he is actually serious about the messages he conveys as he is obviously above the ""law"" and will not take to heart the lessons he is preaching. This is not putting your money where your mouth is.In terms of visualization this scenario reminds me of the climax in RETURN OF THE JEDI with George Lucas playing the Emperor and the audiences Luke Skywalker: ""Your lust for HD has made you powerful. Now purchase STAR WARS on Blu-Ray!"" ""I'll never appreciate the special editions. I like the theatrical editions, like my father before me...""The original Boston Tea Party was about ""No taxation without representation"". I feel somehow unable to invest any extra dime in the upcoming Blu-Ray edition, as long as my humble request for the theatrical editions is not represented.In A NEW HOPE George Lucas was providing a sympathethic portrayal of rebellion but now it seems he no longer shares this view as he is presiding over the opposite side."	1.0	Should I purchase a product its own creator dislikes?	2011-01-13	18	8	10

Why can't they bring this special edition on DVD, 'cause 15 years  ago a bought the original trilogy, 5 years ago the restored version, and  three years later the special edition, all on VHS.  So, I think I will not  buy this one, and wait...  3 stars for the Special edition and a big, big  5 stars for whole trilogy.	3.0	Special Edition Ok / Re-release no	2000-08-12	1	0	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"I think I realised I made a mistake almost immediately upon putting this on my dvd player years back when I was a lot less knowledgable about aspect ratios and picture and sound quality issues overall and hence found out to my chagrin just what pan and scan means.  Also as I have a widescreen LED tv, watching full screen pan and scan movies makes me feel cheated somehow.I've recently watched this on a blu-ray player that upscales to 1080p and I also realised that unlike that other great Lucas trilogy, Indiana Jones, this set of dvds do not upscale as well.  By the way, that set of standard dvds if you already have them looks wonderful upscaled and so I am in no hurry to get the future Blu-ray offering unless they have perhaps Director's Cut versions of the films.  This Star Wars set though is a different story and I find myself waiting in anticipation at a hopefully vastly improved Blu-ray version both picture and sound quality-wise.  Even the THX treatment seems to have done very little on these discs as compared to the obvious improvements on the Indiana Jones set.  I also happen to agree with those who think the young Anakin's ghost has no business being there together with the old Obiwan and Yoda at the end.  They should have kept it the way it was in the original or used all the younger versions including Liam Neeson!I also happen to like Eps IV, V and VI a lot more than I, II and III although I do understand Lucas' need for completion/closure and I can accept that others may feel the opposite of what I feel on this particular issue.  Upscaled, I did for the first time see the dents and dirt on C3PO but not enough to wow me the way the Indiana Jone Trilogy set did.Overall, the picture and sound quality is okay/average but not great and so is the bonus material disc and so I'm left expecting a lot more and I wait with bated breath to see if the massive amount of improvements this set clearly needs to be described as reference quality blu-ray will be made in the hopefully not-too-distant future.  If they could do the incredible restoration work on the great 1968 classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" on blu-ray, I wonder if there's any good excuse not to do the same on blu-ray for the ""Star Wars Trilogy"".Impress me George and Fox!"	3.0	Makes Me Eagerly Anticipate A Much Improved Blu-Ray Offering!	2010-08-27	3	2	1

I was however let down that the ""bonus discs"" containing the original cuts in the las ""go-round""were less than I expected quality wise.What we the true Star Wars fans crave is the original trilogy, cut like the ""definitive collection"" was on laserdisc...but with remastered picture quality and remastered HD surround sound like they used to do, but with todays equipment...with no CGI additions/extra scenes that were not in the original movies...

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	APJEA20PLV6ZB	Fred Flintstone	I was very pleased to see that this new DVD set is the Extended version including the scenes added in the 90's with new special effects.  Some of the purists on this site maintain that this was a poor decision and want 70's special effects???!??  That makes no sense, this is not the 70's and for the most part, effects in that decade were terrible!  If you can have much better effects than stop-motion has to offer these days, I am all for it!  Plus I have seen all 3 movies in the theatre when I was young, all 3 again when they came out on VHS, and again in the theatre when the extended versions came out.  I enjoyed them every single time, after all, what is not to like?So really, who cares if Greedo shot first?  I don't!  And since George Lukas dictated what would be in this DVD set, he is the best possible person to render that opinion.  He made the originals and the extended movies, so if he prefers the Extended versions, that is just fine by me.  I'll buy them!  This is the greatest trilogy every released, there really is no comparison to any other franchise (well maybe Lord of the Rings...).  The Alien movies are extremely well done but Star Wars ushered in a new era of sci-fi movies, and I don't think the Alien movies would have seen the success they saw without them.  Peter Jackson certainly credits the Star Wars trilogy for allowing him to make his absolutely incredible Lord of the Rings trilogy in the extras within the DVD set.I was hoping when I first heard about this Trilogy (Lukas had once said that it would NEVER appear on DVD), that they would contain the extended version.  For the films I really like, I always buy the Extended Versions if they exist.  The more, the merrier.  Just like the Extended versions of the Lord of the Rings, I want the experience to last as long as possible.  The purist argument won't sway me in the least.  Well done Lukas!R.	5.0	It's the Extended version!	2004-09-21	10	3	7
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3D63MQMPNY1Q8	fredlow1	The Blu-Ray played just fine. I am not a big Star Wars nerd so I do not care if it is the original remastered movies or not. I happened to buy the movies with the added scenes and Im just fine with that. It was actually good as I was able to point out the differences to my kids who where watching for the first time and now that they are hooked we can go back and watch the original movies.Only reason I did not give 5 stars is that when we played each movie it started with the end credits so it was as if they were used. Since I could not tell if the movies were used and they were sealed I will give Amazon the benefit of the doubt.	4.0	Love Star Wars	2013-07-31	2	0	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2VPGDXJ97XN5M	FrednTidy	"It's about time the Star Wars movies were released on DVD!  I saw that there are already a ton of reviews for this box set, but I will give my own thoughts anyway, since I have been a fan of these films for a long time.  The visual and audio quality of the movies on DVD format is superb.  Lucasfilm really made the effort to get the images and sounds to be crisp, clean, and vibrant, and it shows.  The commentaries for the movies are great because they include a lot by George Lucas himself.  In addition, the fourth DVD has an absolutely excellent and long documentary, Empire of Dreams, on the making of the movies.  With regards to packaging, a much, much, more sturdy outside box for the discs should have been used.  Also, the photomontage covers for the individual DVD cases look a bit tacky, especially since a lot of stunning poster art has been done for Star Wars over the years.  Some of them were used for the original VHS.  But it seems like the current design is meant to be consistent with the prequel DVD's.This box set contains the Special Edition versions that were in theaters in 1997, with even more changes since.  Most of the changes to the story structure have been controversial.  I felt that the changes produced mixed results.  It would have been interesting if Lucas had included the original versions along with the Special Editions, allowing viewers to compare and contrast, similar to how Lord of the Rings has theatrical release DVD's and extended release DVD's.Some thoughts on some of the alterations:-I am one of those who felt that Han Solo should have shot Greedo first, like in the original version.  In the commentaries, Lucas explains that both Han and Lando transition from more of an ""in-between side"" to the ""light side"".  Having Han shoot first would have established his character more bluntly and made his character transition more stark and pronounced.  Also, Lucasfilm has tried to polish this scene since the 1997 release, but the editing still looks a bit awkward and unnatural.-The scene in A New Hope where Han meets Jabba the Hutt is redundant, especially since Han repeats dialogue and information from a previous scene.  In addition, Jabba could have just settled things right on the spot by capturing Han or just killing him off right then and there.-I really liked the alterations made to the space battle at the end of A New Hope. A LOT of it was redone and the reshoots really update the look of the entire scene while remaining faithful to the choreography of the original shots.  They also make the battle seem faster and larger than in the original version.-In A New Hope, the updating of the lettering on the Death Star tractor beam control panel into alien script was long overdue.  I had always wondered about modern written English being used a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.-I thought that the changes made to The Empire Strikes Back were reasonable.  All of the effects shots look so much cleaner and many visual details of Cloud City were redone, making it into a more dynamic and busy place. The reshoot of the Emperor scene made sense with the use of Ian McDiarmid.  However, the new dialogue in the scene causes some confusion because it seems to contradict the fact that Vader already knows about Luke Skywalker by name from the beginning of the movie.  I have read various explanations online of what Lucas intended in this plot revision, whether Vader is faking ignorance in front of the Emperor or honestly doesn't know for sure.  But I think the audience has grown accustomed to thinking about the story in a particular way and is led to continue this way because the movie's opening scroll, which sets up the framework of the story, still remains unchanged.  Slightly rewording the opening scroll could have made Lucas's intentions for the revised plotline much more clear.-New to the movies, Hayden Christensen now replaces Sebastian Shaw in the ghost scene in Return of the Jedi.  In the commentaries Lucas explains why he did this, that Anakin basically died and got replaced by Darth Vader, hence the appearance of Anakin as a young Jedi in ghost form.  I understand Lucas's concept and reasoning, but it ended up raising questions for me.  For example, are Anakin and Vader now meant to be seen as two totally different and separate characters?  If Luke Skywalker sensed some good in Vader, then wouldn't this mean that Anakin isn't truly dead and gone?  Who is in the Vader suit at the very end, ""Anakin"" or ""Vader""?  If it is finally Anakin once again, then shouldn't it be the mature Anakin who appears in ghost form?  The answers were made very clear in the original version with Sebastian Shaw.  Nevertheless, I thought the use of Christensen was a very interesting interpretation.Overall, if you don't mind the more contentious alterations done over the years, then you really should get this DVD set.  Definitely get the silver-boxed Widescreen Edition.  Star Wars is still a real thrill to watch!"	4.0	It's about time, for the most part!	2004-12-05	14	11	3

(Please note...I am Practically 16 though, so I've grown up very used to this technilogic movie awesomeness).As much as I loved them, I couldn't handle the VHS anymore, I'm too adapted to the DVD player with Digital Sound and Video. Some of the changes made me go ""WHA!?"", like the Gungans at the end of Return of The Jedi (the Hayden replacing the orignal Anakin spirit really didn't bother me). But some others were awesome. Like I've heard people complain about the Emporer scene change in ESB, but I think that was needed. The first spin around it wasn't good old evil Ian playing the Emporer...and was totally off the Emporer's character. So that change I was VERY happy of. As for the dialouge there, yea it's kind of weird, but I think it makes sense.I like how it's crisply put together now, with very good sound, updated lightsaber quality, and ship quality and all that.Again just a reminder, I am 16...I really like Digitally Remastered."	5.0	I like it...	2005-05-09	11	6	5

I am a massive Star Wars fan, and I feel that this trilogy is second only to ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy from New Line Cinema. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that ""A New Hope"" is my fifth favorite film if all time. (That would be after the three LOTR films, Jaws, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.) I know that most people like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the best, but I like ""A New Hope"" just slightly more. Now, I like each of the five films from greatest to least in this order.""A New Hope"" (Five Stars)""The Empire Strikes Back"" (five stars)""Attack of the Clones"" (four stars)""Return of the Jedi"" (four stars)""The Phantom Menace"" (three stars)Other than ""Episode I"" which damaged the ""Star Wars"" legacy forever, each of these movies are monumental achievements. The effects have been redone a bit in these special editions (that monster in the sand has a mouth, The Emporer explodes when he dies, etc.), which keeps them fresh and exciting. I've always been a defender of ""Return of the Jedi,"" and I don't understand why so many people don't like it. Admittedly, it pales in comparison to its predecessors, but its a very good film nonetheless. One thing I notice is that film trilogys usually start out very well and then get progressively worse. The Matrix trilogy is a superb example of this (even though I liked ""The Matrix Reloaded"" a lot.) I'm getting off topic. If you've never seen the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, do yourself a favor and buy this set.

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I saw the advertisements for this!  Star Wars Episodes 4-6 were landmark motion pictures.  Sure, the acting is bad and the George Lucas' dialogue is cheesy, but the marvelous feats that were acheived in terms of story and special effects push this trilogy into the stratosphere!  Anyone who's seen these films will never forget the legendary characters, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader or Han Solo.  No one will forget the chilling cliffhanger ending of The Empire Strikes Back, easily the best film of the Star Wars saga.  Even the Ewok-infested Return of the Jedi is classic, especially compared to the mediocre prequels (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones).  And we can't forget the film that started it all, A New Hope, which set the high standard to which all Star Wars films are compared.George Lucas reworked this trilogy in the late 90's, adding a new effect here and there throughout the three films, and this is what's being released on DVD.  Most of these additions are welcome, such as making Mos Eisley look like a busy spaceport instead of a deserted town, or adding windows and color to the Cloud City.  Some are not so welcome, such as the ghastly new musical number in the beginning of Return of the Jedi.  But regardless, these changes are what George Lucas originally intended for these films.  Therefore I welcome them into my DVD collection.  I can't wait to see the comprehensive making-of also.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ATJLR5VAS2QE5	Garrett Aja	Gone With Wind. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Wizard of Oz. Casablanca. Star Wars. What do all these films have in common, you ask? Easy-all are icons of American culture, and true triumphs of the silver screen. So, when Star Wars (and its two sequels) joins those other films on DVD, you know it's going to be a very big deal.However, in this case, Star Wars is *not* as we remember it, for George Lucas has decided to place the original versions of his landmark films (as well as his first film, THX-1138) on suppressed distribution in favor of a more extensively re-touched version of the 1997 Special Edition. Besides the spector of false advertisement (as Lucasfilm is pushing this release as *the* Trilogy), there's the matter that the special editions have changes that are uncalled for (Greedo shooting first) or simply there to mimic later efforts by ILM (the shockwaves eminating from both Death Stars are much like the shockwaves from Praxis in Star Trek VI). And, as others have stated, some changes (the reported changes to the lightsabers and lasers in this DVD edition and the changes to Mos Eisley) are more for the benefit of having great eye candy instead of great special effects.With this said, I do like some of the changes (Cloud City looks nice, even if the original is visible in the background of most close-up shots), but I like being able to choose even more. Also, while the special features don't look to be as exhaustive as they could be, there's still quite a bit of value, making this set extremely tempting for all save the most jaded Star Wars fan.	3.0	A wasted opportunity	2004-09-08	12	12	0

Koltookian	I don't understand why George Lucas refuses to give fans a high-quality transfer release of the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars trilogy. For those of us who don't like the tweaks, the lame revisions (Han shot first) or the overdubbing (I liked the original Boba Fett, thanks very much), this release is just another slap in the face to film buffs, historians, and preservationists.They say if you whitewash something long enough, people will cease to remember it. Sadly, that's what Lucasfilm seems to want to do - whitewash the superior versions of the Star Wars films until newer generations don't know any better.Shame.	1.0	NO THEATRICAL CUTS = NO SALE	2011-01-28	36	29	7

These versions are so much better. It just seems like a NO-BRAINER to me. Look, I was one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world, I was 11 years old when A New Hope came out, and I stood in line to see it several times, I had all the toys, I had model kits(still do), collected bubble-gum cards and spent countless hours drawing every character known to the public. My point is...don't give me this traditionalist perspective, it just doesn't hold water. My kids love these movies and so do I! It's going to be even more of a tradition in 20 years.

Chenoweth	Yes, I really do like the Special Edition versions, and I am glad George Lucas is releasing these films in this format and not the original.  It is looking at the big picture.  I don't think George Lucas would have made special editions of these films if he wasn't planning on making Episodes I, II and III to complement the original trilogy.The first three films needed to be updated in effects and style so that a person could sit down and watch all six episodes in a row and have it seem like one long picture.  With the update in technology available since the original trilogy came out, it only makes sense to update Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as well.  All six films can fit perfectly together after the release of Episode III in 2005.Yes, it would have been nice to have the original trilogy in the original format alongside the special editions.  However, the bigger picture is for all six Star Wars pictures to look the same for the story's sake, not because of George Lucas' ego.	5.0	I Like The Special Edition Movies	2004-04-15	22	4	18

I was only 10 when I had the privilege of seeing this masterpiece when it was released in 1977 and have been a fan ever since. And in 1997 I saw the re-release of it and I got to be 10 again for 2hrs and 15 minutes. I was just as awe struck by it as ever! No other movie has ever had that effect on me, and I don't think any ever will (except for its sequels.) This movie is a true experience on every level, the acting, the f/x and story are brilliant. It is hard to imagine any one not having seen it, but if you haven't and want to experience a true cinematic masterpiece, skip &quot;Titanic&quot; and all other recent movies and head straight for this!

I think it would have been great, but just releasing the new Special Edition on DVD is not a sensible thing to do, not even a smart move. What's to say about the original versions? Well, actually nothing! Those are now part of human legacy and not only should, but must be preserved as the masterpieces they are from the first day human race were introduced to the Star Wars. About the Special Edition released on DVD, first I think the DVD should clearly state in big letters that it is the Special Edition, and secondly, it wouldn't have been that bad if Lucas had limited himself to clean up the movie, fix some errors, and probably even add some special effects, but what's been done is outrageous. I mean to put Jabba the Hutt there in A New Hope is the worse mistake of all, not only does it look just plain ridiculous, but it doesn't really add anything valuable to the story. I think some of the new scenes and special effects are pretty good, and they really improve the movie to some extent, but some others are just offensive. Bottom line: The original Star Wars trilogy must be released not only for the fans, but for historical reasons; the Special Edition should, at least, strip Jabba the Hutt out and put the original music at the Ewoks party back on during The Return of the Jedi ending.

I liked A New Hope best, Return of Jedi second, and Empire Strikes Back least.  I give it five stars for the following reasons:1.  The first star is for the superb acting of Harrison Ford as the braggish space pilot Han Solo.  He did a great job!  Also, James Earl Jones' deep voice was excellent for the evil Darth  Vader.  Carrie Fisher was ok as Princess Leia and Mark Hamill did will in the first two, though he was kinda weird as a Jedi in the last.  Other voices include Alec Guinnes as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anthony Daniels as c-3PO.2.  The second star is for the magnificent special effects, especially during the destruction of the first Death Star and the lightsaber duels.  This 1997 edition also include some specially done computer-generation for a new scene with Jabba the Hutt and some interesting new creatures in his palace.3.  The third star is for the droid duo in itself.  The arguments and antics of C-3PO and R2-d2 are just so hilarious anf the way Han snaps at Threepio all the time and calls him ""Goldenrod!""4.  The fourth star is for the music.  John Williams is my favorite American composer.  His music in the SWT was strong, powerful and at times, sad.  I intend to buy the Trilogy's soundtracks as soon as possible and any other Williams soundtracks too.  Any recommendations would be helpful?5.  The fifth star is for thr story and the plot, which is rather simply when you come down to.  A farmboy, longing to leave his dusty planet, journies to become a Jedi knight and discovers that an evil Imperial leader is his father.  A young Princess and a small band of Rebels fight against a consuming force threatening the galaxy.  And in the meantime, the Empire is building a strong, planet-destroying machine.These are great films, and though the theology is a little rusty and the movies are not for little kids (violent and scary), I highly recommend them to any sci-fi lovers."	5.0	Best Science Fiction ever!	2002-01-26	2	1	1

This makes Star Wars so unique.As far as the new DVD trilogy, I think that the Special Features disc was excellent. I thought that the changes Lucas decided to make were HORRIBLE, at best.One of the most prominent ones was the switch of Sebastian Shaw to the new boy in the prequel trilogy, a very, very sad move. It is possible to see Lucas' thinking, which was shortsighted, at best. Since anakin must become 'good' or 'light' (supposedly impossible, becasue 'once on the path of the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny') so the YOUNG Anakin must be portrayed. I, on the other hand, think that by having the AGED Anakin, we see that in the end, the great Skywalker realizes his crimes and disillusionment.	4.0	Star Wars - Dissapointing and Wonderful Simultaneously	2005-01-29	6	4	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1AZMTKPT6H4RT	G. L. B.	This set is great and a definite must for any Star Wars fanatic.  The casual fan probably won't be impressed though.  However, do not buy this for $150.  I was going to, but I found it at Best Buy for $70.  The tin is really cool- it opens on both sides- but it dents fairly easily.  6 movies and a flimsy (but cool) tin is not worth $150.	4.0	Great, but don't buy here	2006-12-30	19	16	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1BMAJSOUAHGTB	Glen Bieber	I have been a Star Wars fan for years and after years of having to watch the Trilogy on VHS or Television, it was nice to finally get the Trilogy on DVD, which in my opinion should've been released  on DVD when the Special Edition was released. I have watched the movies with and without the audio commentary.  It would've been nice to have the Trilogy as we all know them from their original releases on the DVD as well so we can see for ourselves what was changed, added, etc., but overall I'm happy with having the Trilogy on DVD.	5.0	Absolutely awesome!!!	2005-01-05	8	3	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AAUAOPPH3PBB2	Glenn M. Schoditsch	"Well: The DVD is clean and has nice color and sound. BUT, Greedo did not shoot first. Jabba's appearance is a waste and is redundant script at best. Mos Eisley is crowded and cluttered with CGI junk. We all could go on and on. One thing; when Luke and company go tumbling in to the trash chamber, you can STILL see Luke mouth ""What was that?"" With all the ""corrections"" made, one might think they could have fixed that one.  Why George Lucus tampers with a masterpiece I do not know.  At this rate, if he ever aquires rights to the ""Wizard of Oz"", he probably will colorize the sepia tinted beginning and end.I am now 52 years-old and Star Wars is a pleasant memory and it is nice to see it in widescreen again. Remember, when it first came to the screen many of us baby boomers were expecting a cheapo SciFi flick and to the casual movie buff, no one even thought of a sextuple series. You didn't even know there might be a second one until the end of the movie when Vaders ship tumbles off in to space.To be honest, I think I'm one of millions that truely enjoyed Episode IV, A New hope and in my humble opinion none of the others have ever come close to duplicating the pure magic of A New Hope. ANH was groundbreaking and revolutionary for it's time. But as enjoyable as STAR WARS was and is, I suggest everyone follow Bill Shatner's advice. Get a life!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A7I5SQ4BOCK2	Glenn M. Vile	I just read an interview with George Lucas confirming that these are the special edition and not the original trilogy.  I wish that had been disclosed before my preorder.  The restored graphics are great, the new CGI stuff looks like a video game.  Also, the jabba stuff is recycled because he couldn't make it the first time around so it was worked in later.  With all due respect to an artist, once it is out and observed, I feel that you lose the right to tinker.  Imagine if Paul McCartney took Hey Jude out of print and replaced it with a version featuring synthesizers and a speaking verse along with a chorus of seal trumpeters.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1EIZ593NRUHU3	G. Nedeff	I don't like the SE changes all that much, like the majority of SW fans, and some of the new changes, in particular the redub of Boba Fett, are as offensive as the damn Greedo scene, but the screentime of these changes are not worth protesting the purchase of these DVDs and certainly not worth abandoning the films themselves.  In all honesty, the restoration to ANH is worth forty bucks.  Anyone who claims that these DVDs sound and look worse than video tape are flat out liars (or they own the worst DVD player and monitor known to man).  Yes, it is true that the dialogue can be a little inconsistent in ANH and here in there in ESB, but this is due to the source material.  I don't know if these things can be corrected without overdubbing and to be honest, I don't want these films to be touched again . . . although they will be completely revamped for the new DVD format and possibly updated in the 7 DVD box set.If you can't stand the changes so much that you can't overlook them and go on with the film viewing, then by all means, twiddle your thumbs and don't buy the set.  Wait for the originals if they ever show up, but quit your whinning.  I'm sick of it.  I'm more sick of the whining than I am of the damn changes Lucas implemented.Fact:These are the best looking Star Wars DVDs I've ever seen and the restoration to ANH is perhaps the best restoration I've ever witnessed, rivaling Criterion Collection.  The colors alone are amazing, not to mention the detailing, cleaning, and polishing.  Not a single hair, blemish, or flaw. The restoration brings in details that appear to be additional changes although they're not.  I don't know if interiors were upgraded with more lights, if displays changed, if decals were added.  I just know I can see a hell of a lot more in these transfers and I enjoyed them.The sound is as good as it can be.  The dialogue in ANH is inconsistent in a few spots, but for crying out loud, it's the source material, not the restoring sound engineers that introduced that.  Darth Vader always sounded tinny in the opening scene.  The voice of Darth Vader on the Death Star is much more full, but that's the way it always sounded on video. If they can fix it, I'll buy it again, but it's not that big of a deal.  I think the sound is amazing in ESB and ROJ.  I may be open to an updated soundtrack for ANH, with redone sounds, but that's asking for trouble isn't it?  I mean, if you're a purist, you should be happy with the tinny sound in spots.  That's the way this independent film was shot.  Can't have your cake and eat it too can ya.  People, make up your minds.  Either accept the originals and their imperfections, or accept the new transfers and changes and their imperfections.  Star Wars was never and will never be perfect.CONCLUSION:Buy the DVDs if you want to see quality you didn't even see in the theaters, if you want to hear sound that is the best it's ever sounded, and if you want to see improved SE changes (Jabba looks better, digital additions look better).Changes or not, they look and sound fantastic.  These DVDs make the Laserdiscs look like Beta tapes.  The only reason not to buy these (47 bucks) is if you can't stand the SE changes so much that you can't watch the films.  At this price, I don't know how on Earth a Star Wars fan could refrain from this purchase.  This was a bargain.	5.0	SE changes and new changes aside . . .	2004-09-22	19	12	7

Did you ever get jealous listening to someone bash HAn or angry when someone called Luke a sissy?I remember those days, but George Lucas obviously does not. The man is insufferable. The dreadful and ....oh god! it gives me shivers just thinkig about them.....heinous, unnecessary changes that were made in 1997 were not enough. As if the crimes of a Jabba the Hutt in Mos Eisley regurgitating Greedo and Han Lines, a replacement for Lapti Nek with Jedi Rocks!?! (Jesus! George were you smoking the reefer?)and the Sarlacc Worm creature that drastically changes that entire scene? Were they no enough George that you had to go and screw it up yet a second time!?!Well I am sad to say it has happened. Star Wars has hit rock-bottom. Now on top of the abovementioned crimes, we must also endure Hayden Christensen yet again in Return of the Jedi, Ian McDiarmid in Empire, a role he did NOT originally play! and Boba Fett redubbed to sound like Jango from Attack of the Clones! Doesn't anyone else find that wrong? What if someone remastered Gone With the Wind and added new digitally enhanced scenes and redid dialogue? Wouldn't someone be outraged? I would complain to George but I think he's too busy counting all the money he's earned from this release and snorting the booger sugar?Damn, man get a grip!I refuse to buy this DVD set, not only because of the trashjob remakesof stellar films but because the special features are...well not at par.

Lucas essentially pioneered computer graphics after taking models as far as possible.It's a TERRIFIC story -- first rate! Find yourself a copy of ""The Hidden Fortress,"" a Japanese samurai film Star Wars was very loosely based on. The idea of ""droids"" being seamlessly integrated into everyday life was brilliant.

After years of interminable patience, the original Star Wars trilogy at last makes it to the modern technology of DVD.  All three films are spectacular in sound and visuals-particularly the Dolby EX soundtrack.The digital transfer is clear and concise, to the point where some compositing of the motion control spacecraft cells show up a bit too clearly.  It does seem that the Lucasfilm technicians cleaned up most of the shots, but a few got missed.  Oh well-a minor quibble.All three films are magnificent, but my favorite, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the most impressive.  The incredible asteroid chase measures up to ANY modern digital effects sequence, and the DVD treatment only makes it better.  The final ""I am your father!"" scene is a masterpiece in digital format; every detail is crystal clear.  At last, there is commentary by director Irving Kershner (who provides some fascinating insights), Lucas, and sound man Ben Burtt.  Disappointingly, the only actor on this disc is Carrie Fisher (I did not do commentary tracks on the other two discs, and so can't comment on those).There are some areas where ""memory dating"" takes place: the cheap-looking plastic suits the Imperial Storm Troopers wore, for instance.  Of course, this has nothing to do with the trilogy coming to DVD.  It is just a sign of the more than two decades that have passed since these films were released.  DVD only highlights the passing of time by making the movies sharper.I sincerely hope movie goers of all ages see this spectacular updating of the classic film trilogy of all time.

While the added detail in the background of places like cloud city is a sweet addition and adds to the reality of the film's world; and while the video quality is so phenomenal that your jaw will drop all over again; and while the effects are, clearly, the best possible Star Wars expeirience, the ""cover-up"" nature of the campaign speaks volumes. Neither the advertising and promotional material, nor the actual box text mentions the fact that the dvd is the special edition. They are reffered to as ""all three classic films"" and ""all three original films"" in the text. They're not.Now don't misunderstand me, even though Greedo shooting first is just plain wrong, I respect Lucas' right to revise and re-interpret his work, but pretending the spec-ed IS the original is revisionism.Also, they put the actor from ep.

I cannot say I belong to the original Star Wars generation, but I did see countless times the ORIGINAL trilogy before the 1997 re-release, and even after numerous big-budget sci-fi films I've seen, the story, effects, and feel of the original trilogy have so far been impossible to improve.Yes, if you're a die-hard purist, you're better off with the VHS edition; if Greedo shooting first is such a big matter to you, you're either a complete geek or simply a person with poor criteria; as for everyone else, this is a perfect buy.Now, the special features in the extra DVD could hardly be better, including character creation and lightsaber featurettes, the usual trailers and (multiple)TV spots for all 3 films, including one for the 2 week re-release of ""A New Hope"" and for the 1997 trilogy re-release. Also included is an entertaining ""Battlefront"" game demo for XBox and a ""Making of"" for the Episode III videogame. There are still more features but it would be unnecessary to list them, the sheer weight of the movies is enough to warrant a purchase.It is in fact doubtful that the new computer sequences and the added and restructured scenes do anything more than improve the movies aesthetically, but if you don't have a problem with a CGI Sarlaac, then by all means, buy now!"	5.0	Make the jump to lightspeed...	2006-01-13	4	1	3

There are just too many people who turned STAR WARS into THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. While it's OK for little kids to memorize every line from THE LION KING and then recite them when they watch for the 50th time, it is absolutely infuriating to attempt to enjoy one of the STAR WARS films while others are reciting all the dialog.

I had some trouble at the midway point of ANH, but when I turned off my DVD player and turned it back on, it ran smoothly, starting from the exact point where it hiccupped.  Go figure.I was recently talking to a friend about how Lucas would justify Boba Fett's voice being different from Jango's.  And I knew that for the theatrical re-releases additional footage was blended in to give the films a bit more of the director's flavor.  So, for this release, when I saw the new Emperor in ESB (with new lines), I was surprised to know that Lucas made even more changes.  But when Boba Fett busted out the Crocodile Hunter-esque ""What if he doesn't survive?"", I said, ""This is just ridiculous!""  Pardon my saying so, but I prefer the original voice for the freaking MOST FEARED BOUNTY HUNTER IN THE GALAXY!  If anything, they should splice the original Boba Fett voice in Clones.Anyway, this trilogy stands as a staple of American culture, and it is the same story at heart, and it still has all the moments that fill us with awe, and the story is more continuous for it, but I wish someone would shake George Lucas and tell him to stop making modifications to these classic films just because he has the means, motive and opportunity to do so!"	4.0	But I really liked Boba Fett's voice!	2004-09-23	6	4	2

I got what I expected out of this DVD boxset: the special edition versions of ""A New Hope"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi""..,because we all know that the special edition versions are how George Lucas supposedly intended for them to be all along. I'll get to that in a minute though. I must say, they really did clean up the video and audio on these movies. If you go back and watch the original VHS releases, the video/audio quality is as different as night and day. So that was nice! The 4th disc which contains a bunch of special features including a behind-the-scenes look at ""Episode III"" are quite interesting, but I'm sure there could've been more stuff to put on there that Lucas is saving for another future re-release. Overall, this boxset is good and it's nice to finally have the ""Star Wars"" trilogy on DVD...However, I was looking forward to throwing away my old VHS copies of the original theatrical versions, but it looks like I'm gonna end up keeping them around after all. With the exception of Greedo shooting first (God that was awful) I don't have much of a problem with the special edition version of ""A New Hope"" but the extras weren't needed. Now with ""Empire Strikes Back"", I think the special edition was actually better than the original...all the extras actually managed to enhance the film. But with ""Return of the Jedi"" the changes were just enough to upset my stomach. The corny and out of place CG images and retarded music was just not needed. I'm sorry, but you don't take some of the most classic films of the past 20 or so years and jazz them up with a bunch of terrible computer generated images and lame music. It's ruining art! It'd be the same if The Beatles went back and re-released all their albums with a bunch of keyboards and synthesisers and said ""thats how we wanted it to sound."" I'm pretty sure everyone and their grandmother has written George Lucas begging him to put the ORIGINAL versions on DVD, but he keeps saying he won't do that because the special editions are how he intended them to be. Well, he could've made ALL of his fans happy by packaging the movies the way they did with the ""Alien"" movies or with ""E.T.""...having BOTH the original AND special edition versions in one box-set. But we all know Lucas will crack one day and want more money, so he'll put out the originals on DVD, but he won't package them WITH the special editions...no no no.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1NCA0717SN4Y	Greg	I cannot say anything about the trilogy that has not been said.  This review is regarding the quality of the video itself.  Overall, the quality is very good.  First, the widescreen version is the only way to go.  I compared scenes from my special edition pan and scan version to this new widescreen version and it is amazing how much information is lost in the pan and scan version.  the true star wars fan must see these movies in widescreen to see what Lucas intended.  Picture quality is great for VHS.  Colors are vibrant and the picture exhibits little grain. You will see occasional flaw due to the age of the original masters.  This is also the best I have heard these movies sound outside of the last theater release in 1997.  Using a prologic decoder, this release creates a great soundfield.  Overall, the quality of this release is a five.  It is far better quality than the Phantom menace widescreen release.  Makes you wonder how 20+ year movies can look and sound better on video than one that was just released a year ago.  My only complaint about this set is that the movies are the &quot;special edition&quot; versions and not the originals.  For that reason I give a total rating of 4 stars.  I reccomend this set highly, especially the widescreen version.	4.0	New Video release	2000-11-25	3	3	0

But the marketing ploys that have come along with it have really killed the mood. It started with VHS, one movie per tape.  Then came the fancy boxed set.  Then shortly after came the theatrical CGI update.  Then came the VHS CGI-update boxed set.  Then came the various incarnations on DVD, sold separately as full screen or wide screen, then came the boxed set. Then came the prequels (ok... this part didn't market me to death).  Now it's time to double dip with blu ray.  First we have the boxed set... cool. Why was the original non-CGI release not included?  One blu-ray disc can hold both versions.  Look for it later on yet another incarnation of the franchise. I give the original trilogy 4 stars, and the prequels 2 stars.  The marketing over the years has jaded me, so I can only give 2 stars for all things considered.	2.0	The Star Wars video marketing has made me nauseous	2011-05-05	9	7	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3P0KI3M51LI01	Gregory Masciola	I've been waiting so freakin' long for the Star Wars Trilogy to be released on DVD!  The added scenes in the special edition don't bother me as much as they do other fans, but that's probably because the special edition was the first version I saw.  I agree that both George Lucas and Speilberg have made dumb decisions about going back and changing their movies.  Still, at least when Speilberg had all of those really lame and unneccessary changes made to E.T., the special edition DVD came with the new version AND the original one.  To me, the problem with George Lucas is that he's so in love with the wonderful CGI shots that are in movies that he almost completely relies on them.  CGI's can make movies better, but they don't make movies.  All that being said, I'm glad that these movies are finally going to be released on DVD.  I came onto amazon.com to search for movies that weren't out on DVD and contribute my vote to have it released.  The star wars trilogy is the first thing I searched for, and I was shocked to see that it is finally being released on DVD.	4.0	It's about time!	2004-05-10	5	1	4

The cycle that would make sense would be the first three would be the most technologically prevalent, than the next three would be right about at the level of the original, than the final 3 would be the one movie, THX 1138.I don't find the re-release offensive because I would have gone to see the original 3 at the theater anyway. The deleted scenes made for more excitement (even though they were not all that meaningful to me). We get to see a sneak peek of Episode III, which to me, is worth the price. This is the kind of movie that you can watch until next year and try to gain something new each time (i.e. CLERKS X).I look forward to buying this set and locking myself indoors for the following two months in awe.

I'd rather watch Antonioni's trilogy of solitude, Bergman's religious trilogy, or listen to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Trilogy.  The best film Lucas made was the original THX 1138.  When I saw the first film, the film broke a few times, which was more entertaining than anything on screen.  Luckily, Lucas has decided to end the series, which all of us can be grateful for.

Much like Adolf Hitler during WWII. It's known as a scare tactic, much like what was displayed in Episode IV with Princes Leia. As for this, ""newly revised"" Lucas piece, I have to say as a fan of the original version, I am most displeased with the addition of Anakin from Episode III into Return of The Jedi, and the removal of the original, newly released from the, ""dark side"" Anakin. Also there is a scene in Empire, that is clearly and truly degrading where Vader talks to The Emperor in the asteriod field. Just watch you'll notice. Lucas merely took his almighty power and changed his original films, to some how try to satify the miffed fans who felt the storyline didn't add up.

Van Ling, the famous producer of the DVD menus, did an absolutely amazing job, he (and his team) not only deserves 5 stars for this, but much more! This alone makes this set worthwhile.2. At this point it is obvious that the release of this set was rushed and there were some compromises, that hit ANH the worst: the colors in this movie are royally screwed up. You all know about the sound issues, already. You all know about the freezing/skipping problem already. I simply cannot imagine, that GL, this BIG EGO is happy with the result. The question is whether or not he is going to do something about this. I would personally welcome a corrected version of the ANH disc (alone) made available for those who care. We'll see.Other than the first movie, the sharpness and disappearance of VHS/Laserdisc effects make Ep. V-VI. a rather pleasant and refreshing experience.3. The extras are interesting, and they are not going to be repeated on an ultimate version, so again, a worthwhile purchase.Van Ling: 5 starsGeorge Lucas : 1 star for continuous tweaking and allowing the release of an unfinished, half-made, screwed-up restoration of ANHILM: 3 stars for the effortDocumentary crew: 4 stars for the nice featurettes	4.0	Is this worth buying?	2004-10-11	10	5	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AV3JZAYAP7GHC	halda	This review supposes that you've watched all three movies -- in their various incarnations -- at least a dozen times. If not, what are you waiting for? And only the sheer love I have for these films precludes me from rating the whole shebang less than four stars. Otherwise, this is a three-star product...First of all the presentation and packaging was noticably sub-standard for such a hugely anticipated, landmark DVD launch: cheapily thin cardboard volume box with the DVDs shoved in. No booklets, no tchotchkes, no nothing. Some people may not care about such things, but it immediately signalled to me that Lucas really didn't give a hoot about how it looked -- people were going to buy it anyway. For such a lanmark piece of cinema, it compares poorly on packaging with the awesome care put into the &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; boxed set, or even the LOTR films.While I'm not a sound or video expert who can pinpoint minute errors, there are noticible color correction problems in Episode IV, which may be a holdover from the quality of the print. But I'm sorry, in this digital age, someone at Lucasfilms should have picked up on it. It's most annoyingly apparent in the opening Tatooine scenes. There were also some DVD static too which to me signals a poor transfer. It's a sad fact that for 'A New Hope' my VHS copy has better picture quality in some scenes...The best is the Death Star battle -- the cgi remake is IMO superior to the original.Episode V was a vast improvement in transfer with no noticable color issues, f/x artifacts, etc. Same with Episode VI. Music in both is given a stronger boost (in a good way) that really lets you hear it tell the story along with the visuals. Whether this was an error, or not, it sounds magnificent.The special seatures, including the much-hyped two hour documentary, aren't all that, to tell the truth. There's little offered in these extras that most Star Wars fans don't already know, nor is anything beyond the usual full-length feature, some featurettes, trailers and production stills. I did get a kick out of the old trailers for their amusing cheesiness. However the quality of the extras is such that once you've watched the extras, they're not worth a second viewings.The commentary tracks are so-so as well. Lucas does provide some interesting bits about his inspirations and about the evolution of the story. By far the most fascinating commentary comes, once again, from sound designer Ben Burtt. Carrie Fisher contributes really nothing aside from typically cynical showbiz comments. Harrison Ford is a grouch anyway, so he's not missed, but where was Hamill? His interviews on the extras were quite good. Or Anthony Daniels? I'd would've loved to hear John Williams discuss his musicial score and cues. As far as commentary goes, it really should have had something along the level of what was on the LOTR extended DVDs where there were multiple tracks for the filmmakers, the cast, and production/design teams.All told, if this is the best Lucas could do, it falls short; I think it will be disappointing on several levels for many die-hard Star Wars fans because it feels like a half-baked effort to present a legendary work of film. At least I wasn't getting gouged on the price.Like many fans, I regret not having theatrical versions of the Trilogy included. If so, I would have gladly paid over $100 for some sort of &#34;Ultimate Star Wars Edition.&#34; &#60;hint, hint...&#62;	4.0	35% outstanding; 55% so-so; 10% junk	2004-10-12	11	10	1

The classic score by John Williams is great. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford (""Indiana Jones"" trilogy, ""The Fugitive,"" etc.) and Carrie Fisher's  performances as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia have become legendary. Of course, the most fascinating and intriguing character in the series is the villain, Darth Vader. I don't know how Lucas did it (getting James Earl Jones' voice to coincide exactly with Vader's movements, because HE wasn't the one in the suit; David Prowse, now 66 years old and struggling with arthritis and a dodgy hip, was the man behind the mask), but James Earl Jones did an AWESOME job providing the voice of Darth Vader. EXCELLENT choice, sir.""STAR WARS Episode IV: A New Hope"" featured the legendary Sir Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and is the introduction to this trilogy, with refrences to the previous film.""STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is the darkest entry in the saga (so far, wait for the final prequel, which will tell how Anakin [a cute Jake Lloyd in ""Episode I"" and a terrific Hayden Christensen in ""Episode II""] becomes Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones). The scene where Han Solo (Harrison Ford) dies in ""Episode V"" is very sad and poignant.""STAR WARS Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi"" is the exciting conclusion to this epic saga. Excellent climactic duel between Vader and Luke. Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) provide comic relief in all three films.Now just a few of the questions die-hard ""STAR WARS"" fans are burning to have answered.""What did Darth Vader mean when he said to Obi-Wan in their climactic duel in ""Episode IV"": ""You should not have come back""? What did Yoda mean when he said in ""Episode V"": ""If you take the easy way, as Vader did""? Why did Anakin look like he had cancer when his face was revealed at the end of ""Episode VI""? HOW WAS Anakin Skywalker ""Seduced by the Dark Side of the Force,"" thus becoming Darth Vader, probably the most iconic screen villain of all time?These questions (and more) will be answered in the final chapter ""STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"", coming May 19, 2005.I can't wait for ""STAR WARS EPISODE III: Revenge Of The Sith."" Good thing Lucas included a preview of ""Episode III"" (eight minutes, to be exact) on the fourth disc (sorry, you die-hards, no scenes of ""Episode III"" included). Makes me EAGER for it to show in theaters NOW, but Lucas is a master of making exciting movies, so we'll just have to wait for May 19, 2005, when ""STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" opens in theaters nationwide to see how Anakin is seduced by the Dark Side of the Force, how he assumes control of the Empire, establishing it as the most feared in the galaxy, how he exterminates the Jedi knights and of course, how he became the most feared and fascinating villain of all time, aided by the excellent voice of James Earl Jones, Darth Vader.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2DD8Q2V1O7BW1	HanShotFirst	Pointless CGI additions that only serve to distract the eye and worse, degrade the story. These versions at first didn't bother me that much, and thinking back now it's difficult to understand why. They ruin several aspects of the movies, and I'm not going to list every example and why it does as you probably know yourself if you're the kind of person who gets annoyed by this sort of thing. You're also intelligent enough to make your own mind up. Safe to say that Lucas has proved that his decisions of late are seriously flawed, and these versions of the 'original trilogy' are an obvious example of that.Fundamental changes to character - Han Solo, Jabba the Hutt, Anakin, Boba Fett - are not minor changes in my opinion and some of them make no sense whatsoever. The opening of Jedi is ruined entirely with the Disney-esque dance number and the amazing work of the model departments and original actor (in the example of Boba) are given less respect than the audience. Ultimately these versions are a muddle. A muddle of effects, character, story (Jabba scene is pointless and incongruous with his later character) and tone (if he was trying to 'bring them in line with the prequels' why create a further childish sing along sequence when Sith is all about child murder and physical maiming?).The original trilogy is loved by millions for what it was; An amazing batch of films made in a time before CGI, that changed special effects and science fiction. No film ever reaches 100 % of what the director wants and most directors live with that for a good reason. To revisit years later is unfaithful to the team that created it in the first place, and unfaithful to the original vision. Lucas has changed, his priorities have changed, and although he might think it has, story telling hasn't changed. Fundamentally, we react to character and story, not to the thousand new creatures jumping around in the background of Mos Eisely. It degrades the original vision, and I for one will not be giving any more money away to Mr. Lucas until he releases the original trilogy without the CGI additions and subsequent changes.Clean the picture up to how it was when first released. Clean the sound up to how great it was on the finished master, but then stop. The ultimate irony is that Lucas has attacked the 'colourisation' of black and white films and rightly so. However, the arguments against colourisation are almost seamlessly transferable to this travesty also. Why change what people love? It simply provokes confusion and disgust.	2.0	Don't Colourise Film, but do anything else you want...	2011-01-09	27	22	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2GRC6IJRA7W4H	HeadbangerDuh	The original 'Star Wars' trilogy is perhaps the most well-known series of movies ever made. In 1977, 1980, and 1983, three landmark action/adventure films were made. They were: Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi. I will now rate each one.STAR WARS (9/10) For 20 years, this was the most successful motion picture ever. The story of a young farm kid who becomes a Jedi-in training with the help of the rogueish Han Solo (Harrison Ford).EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (10/10) While this was the least successful of the trilogy, I like it best. There is more action than the others, and it shows better character develpment.RETURN OF THE JEDI (8/10) Return Of The Jedi is the worst of the original trilogy, while still being a very good action movie, all the actors are too old, and it seems to lack the power of the two others.	4.0	One of the greatest motion picture events ever!	2005-02-19	13	5	8
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1AJA930WZO14R	"Heather Hilburn ""Prince of Dolls"""	Han shot first.  My biggest complaint is simple.  Why make the new changes shiny and bright, while leave the rest of the movie dull?  If you're going to add Jabba, either make the new Jabba scene look like a muppet or update Jabba to make him look like the new one.  Don't include shiny new robots into the hive of scum and villainy.  It's a dead-end town on a dead-end planet no one bothers with.Leave the 'force field' under the landspeader alone!  It added a sence of realism and cheep.  Yes, landspeeders used a force field to get off the ground.  No, Luke couldn't afford a nice one.  It's like having a car with the muffler full of holes, you know?I don't mind small things, like making the Falcon spin a little as it leaves Bay 94.  (Wow, I had to look up what number it was!  My geek-powers are fading!)  But the new scene showing it lifting off wiht Stormtroopers shooting at it just doesn't mesh with the old pictures.  Blowing planets up, however, looks quite nice.  And the lightsabers look really good now.  But these few good points don't make up for the loss of the original movies.  Do't forget the stormtrooper making a 'BONK' as he hit his head on the beam.Changing Anakin in the very ending to look like the modern actor was a logical idea, but screw it.  Hayden Christensen sucked.All in all I'll watch my old VHS tapes over the new releases.  Too bad Lucas screwed up.	4.0	A mixed bag.	2005-09-06	3	3	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A13GTABWN4F6MW	"Heavyarms ""Heavyarms"""	"I'm not going to sit here and bash this set because Greedo didn't really shoot first, etc. That's a critique that should be left for the original Special Edition. I'm going to critique the video quality and the extras included in the set.First, the video transfers are OUTSTANDING. The film is crisp and very clean. If Lucas hadn't already released the Special Editions in 1997, I would be even more impressed since this would be the first time these films would have been available in WIDESCREEN in over 20 years. For pure viewing pleasure, the audio and video quality are PERFECT.EXTRAS - Here's where the set really let me down. The extras included are nice, but just don't feel like enough to satisfy more than just casual Star Wars fan. The most glaring omissions are the infamous deleted scenes (Luke at the Toshi station, the sandstorm scene from RotJ). Anyone who has purchased the ""Making the Magic"" CD-ROM will have seen them, but it would have been nice to include them on the DVD set, too. Also, it would have been nice if there was an option to watch the original versions of the films, or at least the original versions of the Special Editions to see what changes were made for the DVD release. As it was, I had to hook up another TV in my living room and watch the VHS and DVD side by side to compare. I really didn't like the commentary on A New Hope. When I listen to commentary, I want to hear things like ""What I was going for in this scene is..."" or ""When we were shooting THIS scene..."" Through the entire commentary for ANH, though, Lucas mainly talks about ""my vision"" and just his general approach to the Star Wars universe. The commentary on ESB and RotJ is much better, with director Irvin Kershner of ESB doing the best job explaining his approach and the different techniques he had to use in shooting the film. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Ben Burtt (sound designer), Dennis Muren (special effects supervisor). Burtt's and Muren's contributions are informative, but Fisher's are mostly useless.""Empire of Dreams"" is the biggie here, a 2.5 hour documetary that originally aired on A&E.; It's a good documentary on the Star Wars phenomenon. The three smaller featurettes are okay but don't really provide new information for fans. What would have been nice would be some featurettes on HOW they made the blasters, HOW they constructed the full-size Millenium Falcon set, HOW they actually did stuff. These documents are very general in their approach. Trailers for the original films are included and, while it's interesting to see how far movie trailers have come in 25 years, the trailers on their own are B-A-D. Most just include stills or McQuarrie paintings, and some guy who I guess was ""The Trailer Guy"" before the current ""Trailer Guy"" got his job. Photos, movie posters and TV trailers are also included. It would have been nice to include the Special Edition trailers as well. There's also a preview for Episode III, but I haven't watched it yet for fear of spoiling the movie. And X-Box demo for Star Wars: Battlefront is also included, but I'm a PS2 owner, so it don't do me any good.The films themselves are perfect in terms of video and audio quality. If DVDs could just be judged on the film alone, this set would be a 5 star set. The extras are good, just not GREAT. They just aren't enough, for me at least. What knocks this down to four stars for me is the LACK of things, namely the exclusion of the ORIGINAL films. Most fans I talk to want a DVD quality release of Star Wars 1.0.

If you are familiar with the saga, you may agree that the more you know about the STAR WARS universe, the more comprehensive the back-stories become.George Lucas, the writer and director, has created an entire universe around the characters and the perils of their fight for freedom.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a farm boy on planet Tattooine, learns that his father was killed by Darth Vader (played by David Prowse, but voiced by James Earl Jones), a menacing half-man-half-machine, and evil follower of the ""dark side of The Force.""Luke and his friends Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca and two droids join a rebel force to take on Darth Vader and the evil empire that wants to rule the galaxies.In ""STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), Luke is training to learn the ways of ""The Force,"" to complete his destiny and face Darth Vader. He meets Jedi Master Yoda (performed by Frank Oz of the Muppets) while Leia and Han Solo try to outrun the evil imperial fleet.The third movie ""STAR WARS Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi"" (1983) is the final chapter of this trilogy and reunites the heroes on Tattooine, where Luke and Leia have to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, a ruthless local gangster.Once again a team, the rebels join up with the lovable Ewoks and take on the evil empire. Luke has to face Darth Vader, as well as his own self as the ""dark side"" is closing in.The STAR WARS trilogy was a box office hit, a master-piece, a technological achievement and won countless awards. Though some of the ambience of the originals seems dated, the films hold up well.Lucas has updated the trilogy by adding various computer generated scenes and images. They enhance the original versions and integrate them into the more recent ""STAR WARS Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" (1999) and ""STAR WARS Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" (2002).Lucas is currently working on ""STAR WARS Episode III: The Return of Darth Vader,"" which is slated for release in May of 2005.The included bonus DVD has hour's worth of extras, which includes documentaries, never before seen still galleries, insights into the old Hollywood and what it took to complete and release the films. Any film student or aspiring director can learn something here.STAR WARS veterans will fondly remember these classics from their youth and can now re-live the saga in digitally re-mastered form and THX sound. This is a great value for $40, that no STAR WARS veteran or newcomer should be without. The wait for ""Episode III"" seems far, far away indeed.May ""The Force"" be with you."	5.0	Still an engaging epic story	2004-12-13	12	6	6

Lim	"The abominable shouting match against this DVD set is proof positive that an inordinate number of bizarre people populate the Internet. When I heard about the problems with the DVD set I held back on buying these movies (besides, I'm not very fond of these movies); but on getting them I am astonished at the heat they have generated.To a normal movie watcher, one who is not an angry, lonely, borderline sociopath, these disks are very fine. Admittedly, as a fan of movie history I would prefer to have these movies, as any other, in their original form alongside these modified versions. But these movies really do deserve their reputation. I had forgotten what a powerful experience the second movie is, for example. (I still reserve a smirk of disbelief for the borderline-sociopaths mentioned above - surely the movies aren't *quite* good enough to inspire *quite* so much fanaticism?)The flaws in the sound are basically not noticeable with the exception of the switched-over rear spearkers, which is an issue everyone with surround sound should consider before getting these discs. As for visuals, the remarkable restoration has given these movies a glow that makes them pleasing to the eye.The CGI additions are usually amusingly gauche and old-fashioned compared to the original miniature and matte-work, which I suppose shows the immense skill of the original effects artists - many of the most impressive shots *still* seem to be the ones that are twenty years old.As for extras, I was particularly fond of the documentary on the final disc, which runs for 2.5 hours. Unlike most such documentaries, this one concentrates pleasingly on the *real* world of Star Wars (as opposed to the non-existent gestalt reality that now forms the hallucinatory habitat of the aforementioned sociopaths) such as the cinematic milieu of the late 1970s.It confirms in my mind the fact that Star Wars single-handedly brought to an end the ""second golden age"" of Hollywood (c.1967-1977) by ending the reign of the personal auteur-movie and giving birth to the mindless blockbuster - which is an era that still persists, although the commercial decline of cinema may well bring about a third golden age in the near future.So watch this, a turning point in cinematic history and a powerful drama, and be overwhelmed by an excellent presentation whose inherent quality is being out-shouted by a few frightening individuals who unfortunately have an immense voice on the Internet."	5.0	2001st Review	2005-07-09	9	4	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A39O9NAFJ1PY49	H. LUI	"You know Lucas can do whatever he wants to his movies. They are his creations. They are his artistic vision. Where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for HI-def as an option. No other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version. Yes these are his movies, but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is. Sorry Mr. Lucas but I will not be ordering these. I'll stick to the laser discs.You know on second thought all these changes since the 1997 Special Editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the Prequels. I always believed that the Original Trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway. Sort of a ""Mirror Universe"" version of Star Wars which is fine. The George Lucas of 2011 is certainly not the George Lucas of 1977. So these new versions of Star Wars should be called Star Wars : The Rise and Fall and Redemption of Anakin Skywalker which is the way Lucas sees these films as nowadays. The Original Trilogy should exist as Star Wars : The Adventures of Luke Skywalker which I believe was the original conceptualization of the series. This if I remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy.Darth Vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at. This only enhanced his legend, mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place. He was essentially a sci-fi version of the""boogie man"" . The Original Trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he WAS. Unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down Dart Vader into something a lot less. Lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help. This is fine if that is what Lucas wants of course. But as I said earlier give the fans the option of which version they want to see. There is no reason why they cant both exist. It is a big universe anyway.What I would like to see in an original trilogy Blu-ray set :Restored unaltered versions of the Trilogy with cleaned up effects and Original sound mixes as an option.Deleted scenesOriginal Making of documentaries.Star Wars to Jedi DocumentaryEmpire of Dreams DocumentaryStar Wars Holiday Special (Restored and Remastered)Vintage Interviews with cast and crewAudio CommentariesNew documentary on the Star Wars Phenomena from a 1970's early 80's point of view which includes vintage toy commercials, actor and character appearances on such shows as Donnie and Marie, The Richard Pryor Show, The Muppet Show, etc. and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period.New documentary on the merchandising bonanza of the series.Promotional art and trailers"	1.0	They are almost totally different movies now.	2011-09-05	16	13	3

Do whatever you want with them, Mr. Lucas.  Just make sure that the millions of people who MADE YOU RICH, and loved the movies just the way they originally were, are able to choose which versions to watch.But that simply is not the case, and while I'll be the first person to admit - 'they're just movies' - I'm still upset and sad about these dvds.  The original version of any movie should be respected and preserved.  The ground-breaking work provided by hundreds of people who were part of the crew really deserves to be remembered, not replaced.  Not just the crew, in fact, because now even original cast members have been jettisoned:  the origninal Emperor from 'Empire' has been removed, Sebastian Shaw's final appearance at the end of 'Jedi' is gone, and the actor who spoke Boba Fett's lines has been excised.  It's disgraceful.I understand lots of people are just happy to have the Star Wars Trilogy on dvd in ANY form.  Not me.	1.0	Inexcusable - Release Unaltered Originals, too	2004-09-14	134	118	16

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1KLNYFROE90OV	Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...	"Okay, just relax you Star Wars-movie-viewing cult. You are probably ready to jump down my throat, so just calm down. I am pretty mad right now too. You see, when I was younger I never happened to catch The Star Wars like so many of you did. Sure, I was aware of it quite a bit, and had heard OF it a lot. As a kid there were plenty of times when bullys would punish me whith wiffle-bats that they pretended were light-sabers, and I would always get drafted to play a Speeder-biker or an Ewok when everyone else got to be main-characters. Obviously these things left a bad taste in my mouth about the Star Wars. I started getting my parents to buy me the action-figures and vehicles, and that brought plenty of kids over to my house, and people THOUGHT I had seen it because I had quite a collection.So when I finally saw some of the novels at the library, I gave-in and picked up the first in the series. It completely captivated me and made me realize exactly what was going on, and I didn't even HAVE to see the movie. I moved on to the next 2 books shortly after, and now reading them has become a yearly tradition for me. I was enthralled by the Socio-Political struggles and the in-depth character building so much in fact that I began to realize something. That something truly this special would be significantly weakened by condensing them into 3 ridiculously short Hollywood-style movies. The concept of these movies is just laughable to me that they would even TRY something like this. I therefore established ""The Star Wars Movie Boycott Movement"".You see, when I read the novels I have very vivid pictures of what certain space-ships, monsters or planets look like, and the best part is that I can imagine whatever actors I want playing the main-characters. I obviously imagine myself as Luke because I feel that I really capture the character well (especially in the 3rd book). My best picks for the other characters is how I visualize Han-Solo as being Patrick Swayze. He has that dashing charisma that the character MUST have. I imagine Darth-Vader's voice as this guy Lance I know who is a real bully-type just like the character. Another one I have is harder to explain but I will try. I chose my dog Morris to be Chewbacca, but now he is 8 feet tall and can stand on 2 legs. If an element of the story is too hard to imagine, that is the ONLY time I will accept an out-side influence and refer to my action-figures.Do you see what I'm doing here? I am able to personalize the story, whereas you can only imagine it how the movie tells you it is. I can now enjoy the story far more, and on so many more levels than you can. In conclusion, I know that quite a few of you have seen these movies, so I guess it's too late for you to imagine what is actually possible. The people I am trying to get through to are the people that are looking up this DVD because they don't know if they should see it or not. The answer is NO. Buy the books instead, and save yourself a ton of money in the proccess, and imagine it how YOU want to. Not greedy Hollywood movie-makers.

As a purist, I must admit that altering some of the scenes was a bit much, especially the addition of another Anakin Skywalker in ""Jedi,"" but the films are left with the exact same storyline, and little has changed over the years (in terms of the film itself).It was about time that Lucas released the original films on DVD, and because he has done so my children can now enjoy the films as much as I did when they were first released.The additional disk provides an inside and insightful look into the people that are/were Star Wars.

First, they released the theatrical version; then some months later they released an extended version and that disc _also_ included the original theatrical release. People were steamed, but many both the whole kit _a second time_. But George Lucas won't do that. Why? Because he owns the whole thing from start to finish. He's the annoying studio head he has to deal with.That still leaves the question of why he doesn't even want to just make some extra money.The answer is straightforward. NOBODY thinks his ""extended"" version is better. If he were to release the original theatrical, sales of the ""Lucas new and improved"" would drop to ZERO. And lil' ol' George just can't bear the thought that his franchise took a nosedive straight down the toilet.

And I'd love to see the original films on DVD.  But, according to Lucas, that just ain't gonna happen.So I will buy the special editions.  And what's so bad about that?  Really, (unless these versions are entirely different than the theatrical releases in the 90s) the added CGI effects and scenes made no real major changes to the storyline, which is what made Star Wars so great.  (With one notable exception below).Oh no, he's added CGI effects!!!  So what, none of them took away from the movie, in my opinion. Some of them were pretty cool.He's cleaned up the print and made the effects look more realistic!!  How dare he!!!He put Christensen in as Vader's ghost, because at the time ROTJ was filmed, Christensen was in diapers!!  How dare he erase that other guy, who we saw for one second in the movie, and even then under about ten pounds of makeup so that his ghost was barely recognizable.  Again, just my opinion here, but seeing that Darth Vader looked like Captain Kangaroo without the mustache was a little disappointing to me.  Of course, Hayden's not all that much better, but at least he fits in with the backstory that we have now (flawed as it is---don't get me started).Which brings us to the notable exception, and the one change that really killed me.  The Greedo shoots first change.  Totally kills the character of Han Solo.  Lucas says he always meant for Greedo to shoot first.  Bull.  If that was the case, it would have been filmed that way.  Lucas says ""how can you redeem a character who would kill in cold blood?"" Uhhh, duh, isn't that the whole point of Han's story arc?  That he's a cold-blooded pirate who redeems himself??My guess is Lucas has lost touch with the original thread of Han's character. Han started out as a ruthless pirate.  He was redeemed over the course of A New Hope and the later movies when he put aside that life to join the ""good guys.""  Sheesh, even as a kid I could figure that out.  That's what made him so much more of a compelling character than Luke.But I digress.  My point here: with a few exceptions, futzing with a few of the shots and the matte painted backgrounds is not the end of the world, and does not change the original story and spirit of the movies.  At least to me.If you don't like anything but the most pure, then don't buy it. I don't blame you for it.  We all want to hang on to our nostalgia.And if George relents and brings out the original on DVD, I'll have you guys to thank for it (seriously).And I'll go ahead and buy the original version too.

Usually they can't. If they're really smart they realise they shouldn't. Why? Because time is linear and finite and we should embrace it as such, not contest the laws of physics trying to go virtually back in time to fix something. Otherwise you'll get stuck in a loop, because as you change as a person, your perception of your past work will change and if you then go and change it you'll keep changing things for ever. I've been looking through the list of changes made to the films over time as listed in the Wikipedia (possibly incomplete) and this is exactly what George Lucas is doing to the original trilogy.So basically by constantly changing the films he doesn't let them live on as the works of art they are. Thus for me they are dead.Finally, I want to clarify I completely embrace re-mastering and restoration efforts of film in general. I can also perfectly understand a director's edition of a film (they didn't get to do what they want the first time around) or even a new edit once in a lifetime, but constant tinkering with something is another very different thing.	3.0	These films are dead	2009-08-14	16	10	6

Unconverted onto my 720p, the original Star Wars looked beautiful and was exactly what I was looking for. My TV even had a special screen size selection that made the 4:3 widescreen a lot more liveable, but that is something to consider if you don't have as many ""zoom"" selections. The biggest drawback was the audio quality which was pretty sad, due to its lack of digital processing (or any form of processing for that matter). For me, it's worth it to see the original untouched visuals from the original trilogy, but if you don't have a copy of the movie score, you might be a little disappointed in hearing that orchestra screech its way through low-quality sampling.

This lackluster review is for the Blu-Ray ""Original Trilogy"" as well as any DVD's which only offer the ""Special Release"" of episodes IV -VI. Lucas again disappoints fans like me who won't settle for anything less than inclusion of the theatrical releases with the special editions.  Unfortunately, these ""special editions"" for the most part add little and sometimes even detract (i.e. the ending of the theatrical version of ""Return of the Jedi"" is so much better than the ending of the special release version).  If you don't care about the theatrical versions, then either of the existing blu-ray releases are fine.  The extras in the ""Original Trilogy"" are adequate, although for the die-hard fan, you'll want to get the release that has all six films along with 3 additional bonus discs.

It sounds like Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) re-taped his whole dialogue!  There are many word changes from numerous characters but even worse are the changes in the intonation and emotion old lines - the whole movie feels different and it really bugs!  The new digital effects - They ARE really bad.

First off, it is a movie, and therefore it should be treated as such.  Secondly, do you think George Lucas is doing this to please his fans?  It's his universe so I think he can do what he wants with it.  He always wanted Greedo to shoot first, so then when the SE's came out, he made him shoot first.Now, I haven't seen these movies yet (Of course, none of us SHOULD HAVE) but I'm still writing a review ahead of time because the movies will always be great.

Even with all the changesHansolo still shoots second, but this time a bit sooner. Dont understand this! Why bother changing it again? either change it back to him shooting first or leave it alone.The new improved Jabba in EpIV looks much better than the first attempt in the 1997 special editions.Some lightsabers have been cleaned up to look slimmer as they appear in Ep I & II, but lukes lightsaber in Ep IV when aboard the Millennium falcon still has a thick chunky white blade where it should be thin and blue.The new improved Hologram of the Emperor in Empire Strikes Back looks pretty cool.As for the ending.....Well fair enough if Lucas wanted to change Anakins appearance to Hayden Krsitian....BUT, If he changed Anakin to a younger Kristian Hayden, shouldn't he have changed  Obi Wan to a younger Ewan Mcgregor...instead of Alec Guiness still being there.  It doesn't make sense... One Jedi comes back looking old and battered but the other comes back looking young & fresh.Why change stuff that does'nt need changing, but then leave crap effects like the explosions of the first death star in Ep IV, which looks like Christmas decorations being smashed with a cricket bat....ok maybe not that crap.  But if they're making changes they could have changed that part of the movie, along with the Alderan explosion in Ep IVBoba fett doesnt sound as nasty anymore with Temuera Morrisons voice dubbed over, Don't get me wrong Temuera Morrison is tough looking especially in ""Once were warriors as Jake Heke"" and as Jango Fett in Ep II, but he doesn't sound that tough in Ep V as the voice of Bobba Fett.  The original Boba fett voice sounded more menacingAnyway the changes have been made, and there is nothing we can do about that.  As for the Extras....Not bad, but there isn't much.  Most fans would like to watch the makings off, the out takes, the deleted scenes etc.  The box set has none off that.  However what is included, is pretty good.  The History of starwars is very interesting, along with the preview of episode III.  DVD menus etc have been done very well, with some cool backgrounds and short movie clips in between.Hopefully we can look forward to more extras when Ep 3 is released and they have a new box set for the first 3 episodes....or a few years after that when they release a 6 DVD box set...or a few more years after that when they release a special edition version of episode I, II & III....or a few years after that when they release the Originals as a 6 set DVD....or a few years after that when they release a 12 set DVD with the originals and the special editions.....or a few years after that when George Lucas finally snuffs it, and they release another box set in his memory, with a picture of him on the back glowing like a Jedi who has joined to the force.....Question is will the Box display a recent picture of him as he looks now.....or one where he looks a bit younger and actually knows what hes doing.Overall, not bad, but it could have been Great!!

The cause of death was the same thing that had unnaturally prolonged childhood an additional 28 years: Star Wars. The victim was a husband, father of three and a huge Star Wars geek. Don't weep for him, for he is me and although my geek-side has died, I have been resurrected. I guess you could say that now I am truly, finally, an adult.So what happened? How did my undying love for Star Wars die? How does a man go from the joy of spending most of his life and disposable income on Star Wars toys, clothes, cards, conventions, magazines, videos, digitally enhanced videos, extended version DVDs and countless movie tickets to a dead feeling at the center of his soul? How does a man go from standing in line for three hours in the freezing rain waiting to get into Celebration III (humming the Ewok song like a Buddhist monk chanting to keep his mind from despair) to wanting to sell every Star Wars-related item in his home? How does a man achieve total Nerd-vana, then turn his back on it? It is quite a task to murder such enthusiasm and as such, it took the concerted effort of three highly trained assassins armed with the latest technology and gadgets. The assassins were Episode I, Episode II and Episode III.Step away from the keyboard, fan-boy. I am not a prequel hater whose childhood was raped by George Lucas. Heck, I even find a great deal of merit in Jar Jar Binks. The prequels are great science fiction/fantasy movies filled with incredible sights, sounds and fully rendered worlds of amazing depth and imagination. But for all the wonders we are blessed with on the silver screen, none of these films are really Star Wars. Throughout every viewing of these films and trust me, there were many, I couldn't shake an inchoate sense that something wasn't quite right. I liked the Gungan/Droid battle and Darth Maul opened a terrific can of Sith whoopass on the Jedi, but for all that, something was nagging at me that this wasn't right. My brain was trying to tell me that George Lucas was off track, but my heart wouldn't listen. What was he up to? Why is he introducing all these new characters instead of focusing on the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker? Surely he must have some master plan that would all be wrapped up neatly in Episode III? So I sat dutifully through the childish fart jokes in Episode I and the egregiously awful Anakin/Padme' love scenes in Episode II in order to get to the big payoff of Episode III. Like a brainwashed religious zealot, I kept the faith that my cult-leader Lucas would lead us into the promised Star Wars paradise. And then the veil dropped and revealed nothing more than a painted straw man.My fellow friends and geeks, I am not here to tell you that Episode III was a bad film. It wasn't. It was quite a good film actually. In fact, of all six films, this would be in the top three. It had a great story, exciting action sequences, state of the art special effects, satisfying battles and well-developed characters. It was well-edited and fast paced; a perfect popcorn movie. Lucas kept the story focused on the main characters and pushed the secondary characters to the edge of the film. Jar Jar is only in two brief scenes and he is only seen and never heard. Great, right? Wrong. Wrong. Stupendously wrong! As a stand alone film, Revenge of the Sith is superb. But it cannot be a stand alone film. It is part of a trilogy. It is the payoff and reward for our loyalty to the series and patience of sitting through two other films and waiting 6 years for this one. It is the reward for 28 years dreaming and imagining the legendary light saber duel on the lava planet and the birth of Darth Vader. Was the reward worth the effort? Well, let's hear from the master himself. This is how he rewards loyalty and devotion:""Now he [George Lucas] volunteers that his prequel story line-derived from material he brainstormed over 30 years ago to inform his writing of Star Wars-was `thin'...'It was not written as a movie. It's basically a character study and exhibition piece about politics-two things that are not dramatic. [Not like] the dramatic story that was constructed for Star Wars. But I wanted to be faithful to it, so I didn't construct other stories. It is what it is...This is the story. I know I'm going to need to use Hamburger Helper to get it to two hours, but that's what I want to do.' By Lucas' own calculations, 60 percent of the prequel plot he dreamed up decades earlier takes place in Sith. The remaining 40 percent he split evenly between Menace and Clones, meaning each film contained lots of...filler.""--Entertainment Weekly, #820, May 20, 2005""Filler"", ""hamburger helper"". That is our reward my fellow geeks and fanboys. By Lucas' own calculations, Episode I and Episode II were 20 percent story arc and 80 percent filler. Filler that by Lucas' own admission was not ""written as a movie"". Digest that for a moment. Do you feel used? Unappreciated? Is your love unrequited? I feel the hate in you. Let it go, release your anger and your journey to the Dark Side will be complete. George Lucas has been writing about Sith Lords for so long that he has become one. His reward to us for our decades of unfettered loyalty and devotion was betrayal by ""filler"". My love for Star Wars went into a coma after viewing Revenge of the Sith. After reading that interview, the feeding tube was removed and my Star Wars fueled adolescence finally passed away quietly in its sleep.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"	1.0	My Childhood has died	2005-05-24	55	18	37
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3R56AWX8PRQLP	Indy Reviewer	"I just spent the day watching the newly released Widescreen DVD edition against my Laserdisc (LD) CAV Definitive Collection (for those unfamiliar with it, a 9 laserdisc box set THX remastered in 1993 that remains the highest quality version of the unenhanced originals until now and if you're lucky is the source for the bootlegs.)  For technically inclined types, I'm watching on an old Pioneer CLD-704 (reasonably high end LD player but 10 years old) versus a Sony DVP-7700 (5 year old reference DVD player) on an 6 year old 32"" analog Trinitron.  Your mileage may vary if you have a HLD-X9, line doubler, and a plasma HDTV.My judgment is that the DVD release is simply a milestone in DVD sets, comparable to nothing I've ever seen in terms of video quality.  While watching, the thought occured to me that I was surprised to see VH1 showing heavy people in their 50s doing interviews for the set; the sheer sharpness of images and completely deartifacted frames is astounding and makes me think this came out last week.  Colors are magnificent.  Space blacks are deeper, planet and ship scenes against them cleaner, troubling things like contrast with white-walled interior scenes look more realistic, and the good part of CGI has been to enhance detail of such things as C3POs wiring and making Jabba look as good as Yoda did in II.I love the soundtrack as well.  The subwoofer and center channel additions of Dolby 5.1 versus the LD Dolby Surround (2 front, 2 back, no distinct subwoofer) are noticable, especially in battle and space scenes.  (Listening to the wind blow across Tattoine and the tympani sequence upon Death Star ignition is a reason to own a subwoofer.)  It is a technical achievement of which the folks in Marin should be proud.Now for the other side.First, the extras are impressive at first glance but in comparison aren't that great.  The commentaries are similar to those on the LDs, with both sets having a couple exclusives the others don't.  Photo stills are good but basically identical to the LDs.  There are a couple of nice featurettes that aren't available on the LDs (and a couple on the LDs that aren't on DVD), but the best one - a great 2 hour making of the trilogy special - has already been broadcast on cable several times.  What is most frustrating is that deleted scenes - most notably the famous early Luke and Biggs scene in IV that appeared in picture books but not in the movie - still didn't make the DVD set.More noticably, as you have probably read elsewhere these are in fact the 1997 versions of the movies.  That means that you do get the Jabba scene in IV - the one great add - along with several things that purist fans (usually born between 1963-1973 who saw the originals in the theaters as young kids) simply hate.  What is more amazing is that Lucas has tinkered _again_, making the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo in the cantina shoot only slightly before Han Solo rather than long before as in the 1997 film, as well as substituting Hayden Christensen for the anonymous actor who played the old Anakin in the pyre scene.  (This last one made my jaw drop as the internet gossip was right.  At least he didn't sub in Ewan MacGregor as Obiwan.)So be it.  It is Lucas' right to do what he wants with his baby.  He's earned it given what he had to go through to make Star Wars in the first place.However, Lucas' decision not to include the original versions as an additional disc or two has probably singlehandedly saved Laserdisc as a viable format for the foreseeable future.  Honestly, while the DVDs are a magnificent technical achievement, the quality gain over the 1993 THX remastered LD is noticable but not that dramatic...and with the right equipment, you can probably cut that down.This is why I am keeping my Laserdisc.  And this is why I think Lucas has singlehandedly saved the format.  For those of us too lazy to transfer the original series to bootleg DVD, we will not part with the defining memory of our childhoods.  DVD is a better format than Laserdisc (especialy since no new movies have been released on it since 2000!), but to watch one of our most precious memories as a kid the way we remember them is worth it for some of us.  We're not getting rid of the one way we can do it in quality - Laserdisc.  Pioneer and Ebay should write Lucas a check.For others, Lucas has his presentation the way he wants it, and it is magnificent. More power to him, and if you didn't see the films the way they were presented originally as a kid you probably don't mind the changes.  For me, I have the DVDs for the commentary and features.  However, when I have friends over to watch it, my old Laserdisc will keep humming with the original versions until it breaks.  For those of us with several hundred or thousands of dollars to spare, an interesting add to our collection but not essential; others will be somewhat satisified with the fifty dollar DVDs."	4.0	Magnificent DVDs, but Lucas singlehandedly saved LD.	2004-09-21	4	3	1

From what I saw, all that was changed was that one scene with Han and Greedo, which, I admit, used to be one of my favorite scenes, but it's nothing to hate these great movies over. These extremist reviewer types need to first, get a life, and second, get over it! I love the originals as much as the next guy--I grew up watching and loving these films, but now I say quit whining. My advice is to get these DVD's and appreciate them for there stories and don't get so worked up over one scene like the other nutter reviewers.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ARLK1DYKBAH55	interested classical fan	As stand alone movies and for people who are not die hard fans of the Star Wars movies.======================================================================This movie trilogy is pretty good - a 8 or 9 out of 10. It has great music (I think John Williams wrote the scores to all three soundtracks - I might be wrong). The special effects are great for the years they were produced (1977,1980,& 1983).Considering that the moves are science fiction and the they were probably marketed towards adolescents when they were produced, they movies actually have a reasonable plot. If you want true drama and plot, then you should look into other movies.For the more dedicated fans...========================I thought the series was a little disappointing. I watched all three movies as they were originally released in the theater. So  I was not impressed with the new CGI effects for the explosion of the Death Star in Episode IV: A New Hope. Also I was disappointed that they inserted Hayden Christensen's image in the final sequence involving Anikin, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Yoda.I only watched the movies, but I don't recall a deleted scenes option when I watched the movie. I think the DVDs I own have this option. I 'm not a big fan of commentaries, So I wasn't impressed with the fact that they were there - in fact, I didn't even listen to them.	4.0	mixed review... ;)	2013-08-16	1	0	1

Nothing MORE, nothing less. Of course, I would have preferred remastering but seeing as how George Lucas is the Anti-Christ, I will have to settle. I also have an upconverting blu-ray player. I had no idea of the acrimony over the upcoming blu-rays until I read the reviews here. I then found out about these theatrical releases on DVD. However, I was hesitant to shell out over a c-note for a trilogy, even this one. Especially if it was butchered. I had it in my cart but decided to google it. What do ya know, 6 stores in SE WI had limited stock. All had this gem at significantly lower prices than here. I had to confirm that the ONE store that had it was the right version: DVD, 6 discs, Luke and Vader on the cover, black and blue NOT the one with only Vader's mask and 4 discs. For those seeking digital nostalgia nirvana, ""The force is strong is this one!"" Say ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" to George.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A24YY65ZFKE0XU	Irishmobsta	This set contains the best versions of the film available. In 1995 Lucasfilms remastered the color and put some sharper filters on the picture as a marketing ploy to prepare the release of the horrible edited versions released in 1997. This 1995 set has NO ADDED CG, NO REVISIONS OR EXTRA FOOTAGE. This set was how it was supposed to be. Its wonderful. The only problem is, it was only released on VHS so I suggest purchasing these and transfering them to DVD before the tape quality starts to break down. Its also not widescreen but I'll live with that. Its better than seeing Hayden Christansen edited into the final scene of Return of the Jedi with the Yanni-style music edited into the background...	5.0	The Best version out there	2008-12-09	6	6	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3VHV0NV7NKQPC	irnmtn25	Why do people get so carried away about how good or bad Star Wars is?  Or as to what George Lucas does to change the movies?  These movies are good because they tell a good story, not because they make some kind of monumental political or ethical statement.  If you want politics or ethics, I highly suggest reading and watching DUNE.  If you want sheer entertainment with a good sci/fi gleen, then go with Star Wars.  The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was that I just didn't like the packaging.  They should have just packaged it as a straight box set like the Indiana Jones movies instead of having all of that excessive paper around the edge of the box.  The set does redeem itself with the individual DVDs as the art on the boxes and the discs are very vivid and colorful.  The sound of the DVDs is really good.  I really like the remastering in THX.  Also, the picture didn't look too fuzzy or sharp, and the color was very crisp, even for movies which are over twenty years old.These movies have become modern classics, and have to be included in any serious DVD collection.  May the force be with you!	4.0	A little disappointed in the packaging....otherwise good!	2004-09-27	12	7	5

Not only were the films clearer and sharper than they ever were, the subtle additions of deleted scenes made the whole re-seeing all that much more spectacular. My husband and I saw the originals when they first hit the theaters over 27 years ago. It was great to see them restored so well. We especially loved the end of Eps. VI where Hayden C. was placed next to Yoda & Obi-Wan in spirit form. It just made the melding of Eps. I-III with IV-VI all the more complete.	5.0	The Trilogy Reborn!	2005-08-01	2	0	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AAFFGI1X3B0QV	"Ismael B. Mendoza ""Ismael Mendoza"""	"It was a Long time in coming, however, now the DVD dream is a reality!  I was expecting for the set to be released after Revenge of The Sith, thakfully Lucas gave in to preasure and we have the set for our digital viewing pleasure.First off, we all know by now that this set is not going to make all purists happy since our last chance to get these films untouched was back in 1995 with the THX transfers.  In addition, we all know that there is a hardcore group of nerds that like to see George Lucas put on trial for treason after doing the major overhaul on Episode IV.With that said, after this new prequel trilogy, The first STAR WARS can now better stand next to them. Hell, the first was far from what we saw in EMPIRE And JEDI, in terms of specail FX!  It need touching . . .  and not in the Michael Jackson kind of way!A NEW HOPE is a joy to watch on my big screen.  The sound makes my windows rattel.  The Specail Edition parts are better than in 1997 with a a Jabba The Hut that is closer to the one that appeared in Episode I.  I know the Catina shooting scene is still in there.  Much to the dismay of nerds still living in their parents basements.  But, this is a much better presentation than what was transfered onto VHS.  Some parts don't match the rest of the film, I know, yet it's still better and closer to what Lucas wanted in the first place.The other two films are just as packed with sound and refinments that, in my opinion were not fully finished in their 1997 re-release.  The blue screen problems that were never really fixed ( even though They said they were)In the hoth scene are gone. No AT-AT legs overlapping through the cockpit canopy.  The only thing that bugged me was the new over dubs for Bobba Fett.  It makes sense to use Jango's, but, the old voice had a grit to it that is kinda lost.The big thing that made no sense was to give poor dialogue to the revised scene where Vader learns that Luke is his son.  Again, I see the point in making Palpatine like he did the other films.  It just stuck out like a gay man at a G. W. Bush rally.  the new lines kinda take away from the fact that we were kinda let to believe that Vader was obbsessed with finding Luke becuase he already knew he had a son fighting against him.Now to JEDI, still contains of the best dog fight scene's in motion picture history.  On the techinal side all the blue screen stuff is smoother.  No lines at all to tell this was superimposed.  Another thing that was never really fixed in 1997 was the Rancor pit scene with Luke.  You could still see the heavy black lines on the monster.  All gone now . . . thank God!Some people don't like the new young jedi Anakin at the end.  But, I thought it was touching for Luke to see the man that was and only heard about.If you're going to get this set, and you damn well should, get it on Widescreen.  For those of use that lived on Fullscreen for 25+ years one would be astonished on how so much was cut off the sides or Pan scanned out of our view.  It's almost like watchinga whole new trilogy!Don't forget, this has the trailers, TV spots, ""Empire Of Dreams"", a look at the new movie, and the demo for the ""Battlefront"" game for the X box!"	5.0	Luke , Yo soy tu Padre!	2005-03-13	13	8	5

It's a shame, and a contradiction from a man who claims to want to preserve classic movies, but there it is.What's probably the worst part is that by wanting to ""fix"" the movies, he's basically detracting from all the hard work done by the puppeteers and FX guys, who were doing cutting edge stuff for 1977-1983.  Also, it takes away from Irvin Kershner & Richard Marquand's directorial efforts.  When you insert whole scenes and change snippets of dialogue, it changes the pacing of the movie, which the original directors intended.  George apparently just wanted to re-direct them.  Such a shame.Oh, well.  I'm buying them anyway, since they'll probably be the only DVDs of the thing we'll see.

I have the original pre-special editions. I never purchased the special editions and never got to see them in the theatres when they came out in 1997 (had a new-born and that took up all my time).So, when I eventually went out to purchase these movies (just before Episode I came out), I was disappointed to find that they were no longer in stock and that they stopped all production of them.So, this re-release has allowed me to purchase what I never got to see before and own them.I have ENJOYED the added/touched-up scenes. Case in point - the Cloud City scenes. It seems SO much more open and spacious now, compared to the crampt feeling you envision in the original. As for the Jabba the Hut scene in Episode IV, it allows you to understand more about WHY Han had a bounty on his head. I read the original book back in 1977, so I knew who Jabba was, even though I wondered why he wasn't in the movie. Heck, he was even in the comic book edition of the movie, so I was REALLY confused as to why he wasn't there. So, the scene helps build up to Episode VI when we finally come back to Jabba. The only gripe I have is, how did he get so big so quickly? I mean, how much time has really elapsed between Episode IV and VI? Jabba must have been stuffing his face since Han left him hanging dry in Episode IV.In any case, this release is a God-send for me to finally own all four episodes. The wide-screen edition is what I purchased and like the other reviewers stated, it allows you to see the scene as it was meant to be, since movies are formatted for the theatres, not your TV screen. In fact, I bought another copy of Episode I. This time, I purchased the Widescreen edition.Thank you George Lucas for re-releasing this timeless classic so that I can finally own it.	5.0	Thank you for re-releasing them	2001-01-31	1	1	0

This is extrcated from an e-mail I sent out late 2004As I sit here, I am totally astounded...I have just put in disk 1 of the 4 disk ""Star Wars Original Trilogy'' box set, released in the UK yesterday Monday the 20th, namely ""Star Wars - A New Hope"", into my Pioneer DV575 player, and what appeared on my SHARP 32"" (82cm) 16:9 flat screen has truly made my jaw drop! I have never seen DVD quality like this....NEVER!The colours, oh man...the colours! The clarity.....the sound.....the sound is so good I had to turn my system down!""Lord of the Rings Trilogy""? Oh please! Sit down and shut-up! ""Alien Quadrilogy""? Sit down and shut up!""A New Hope"" looks like it was shot yesterday, let alone 1975!I must admit that I am fortunate enough to have a system that allows for the maximum picture quality allowed by modern, current, conventional (Interlaced) systems, namely RGB (via SCART output / input) allowing for pretty much the optimum of the PAL spectrum, namely 625i resolution, which is pretty much just the next thing down from full-blown Progressive-Scan quality (625p) via Component output / input.  The result though, via interlaced RGB input, on my 16:9 flat screen, is distractingly good! The colours and resolution clarity of the picture that I'm witnessing is almost too much!Even if, for whatever strange reason, you are not into ""Star Wars"" or have never seen the films (um..er...where have you been??), but you are at least a film fan, then do your self a huge favour, buy or at least rent this box set....do it, do it, do it!"	5.0	Astounding!!!	2005-08-13	11	4	7

I like them, I enjoy watching them, and anytime someone can acknowledge whenever I make a Lando reference, it makes my day.However, the golden age of Star Wars fandom must have been somewhere between '92-and '94.  Far from the tired debates of whether Lucas was or wasn't justified in making his special editions, or whether or not the prequels are good, the early 90's were an intrepid time for SW fans.  It had been a roughly a decade since the last film, and the SW fan club was a fledging group.  Merchandising was next non-existent.  Hanging on to fandom was something you did because you were true to it.Nowadays, the fan-culture is over-blown.  Lucas, whom I do not think is driven by greed, has said that licensing funds his projects so that he can avoid studio producers, and thus retain control over his projects.  However, this abundance of licensing is where Star Wars fandom rears its ugly head.  If nothing is more ""imperial"" than millions of people spending excess money on products made for the members of the world community whom consume an excuse of natural resources, not to mention that these products are sold by the world's largest retailers, than I don't know what could make us more ""imperial"".Ever wonder what teenagers in Asia do?  Check out your collection of items from the last few years.  I remember a newscast that compared images of people rushing to hoard episode 1 toys, while on the same day, people in Kosovo rushed UN workers distributing food.  Sick.After episode III, I urge you to give it up.  Find something else more constructive.  Make choices and sacrifices in a way that Princess Leia, Han Solo, or Luke Skywalker might do.  Thats the spirit of Star Wars, thats what I feel Lucas is trying to get you to do.  If you still crave entertainment, why not investigate Lucas' other films and examine the themes he uses, or why not check out the films that influenced him.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	This here review only concerns the first episode. More about the others later. This first film in a long series is interesting in the vision of the world it provides. The world is dominated by a terroristic and tyrannical Empire. But the vision is centered on simple people who suffer this tyranny but who are in contact with  the force . They are thus able to go beyond the surface of things and to use the balancing forces of the universe that the Empire negates. Then this first center connects us to the rebellion against the Empire, a rebellion that is seen as a monarchy of some symbolical value, particularly a Princess. The second interest is the fight between this Davidlike rebellion and this Goliathlike Empire, and the rebellion, with its little means, but its enormous personal investment and courage, a bunch of heroes ready to die to assert and give some future to the rebellion, is thus made victorious and it can destroy the &eacute;normous war-machine of the Empire : the gnat is stronger than the lion. This makes us feel that this rebellion, in spite of its monarchical aspect, is the real representative of the American ideal : to fight for justice and freedom, through personal commitment. We can think of the model that lies behind : the fight against Nazi Germany, Hitler and fascism. We could also see the model of the fight against a certain type of communism represented by the Wall or the Iron Curtain. We must also note the vision of this intergalactic world as being an assemblage of very different  people , species and subspecies, within a  market  economy where everything has a monetary value, but a wild market-economy where violence is at times the best way to  buy  something. Yet the mercantile and mercenary pilot hired by Luke and his friends becomes a hero because he saves the situation and enables Luke to destroy the warbase of the Empire at the very last second. Hence ideals are successful in the end. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.	4.0	The force is invincible when used by David against Goliath	2001-04-30	1	0	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3JHIL46L89JB9	Jaideep Chakraborty	What a let down!!I was born on the same year that Star Wars came out, albeit a few months earlier, and by the time I was old enough to go to the theatres, they banned new American movies to be distributed in India (only Soviet movies were authorised to be shown and most English movie theatres either closed down or resorted to showing Hindi or vernacular films or cheap Hong Kong flicks for the major part of 80's).The very first brush with this legacy happened in the summer '91 when I watched Return Of Jedi at the theatre as a 14 yr old, although don't remember much of it except for the chase scene.So essentially, I was initiated into the Star Wars galaxy in circa 1997 when the Special Editions came out on Video and were shown in theatres as well; the Archie Goodwin comic strip came out for a brief period in a local magazine during my early years, and fascinating as they were, could not quite the follow the story having not been initiated to the Star Wars legacy yet.That finally brings to these recent pressings of the trilogy and the supposed improvements. Before really proceeding any further, Mr. Lucas should really answer some questions that come to mind:*Why amend the text of the tractor beam marker (that Obi-Wan turns off in Darth Vader's lair) in the New Hope?*Why blank out Luke's scream in the Empire Strikes Back, while he admittedly attempts the jump on his own accord, the sheer drop would scare the daylights out of any human; so the scream was justified!*The most blatant of all, why substitute Anakin Skywalker's spirit image with a younger version?Lucas should realise the fact that these are movies that should be watched just on their merits and not for some supposed continuity with subsequent editions. If this is made the norm, we would have umpteen editions of a hit-movie till the maker kicks the basket. The bottomline is give the viewers what they had liked instead of a tinkered version that you would hope they would like!Well, what's the point now; what's done is done and the fact that my hard-earned money has gone down the drain wouldn't make me particularly happy with this purchase.Lucasbaby could go on making as many version as he wants to but he would not get any more of my dough!	2.0	Lucas has gone loco	2004-11-19	23	14	9

I don't understand why George Lucas is so damned stubborn.  He HAS to know by this point how many people want to see his classic, original trilogy in pristine, widescreen editions (the paltry, un-anamorphic, unrestored DVD extras included on the last set just didn't cut it).I just don't understand the man's logic.  If he were to include both versions in this set then he would sell MANY more copies and everyone would be happy.  It's basically as if he want's to rid the world forever of his original works and that's truly sad.  I realize that these new versions contain his supposed original ""vision""... but they are not the versions that so many millions of his fans grew to love and cherish all of their lives.  That ought to count for SOMETHING in his mind.I also understand that the films are his creations and he has the right to tamper with them as he sees fit, but they were never self indulgent films to begin with, as he has made them now.  It strikes me as very unfair to give something as monumental as the Star Wars films to the public, only to yank them away, change them into entirely different entities, and then toss them back in what he obviously considers superior, but what many fans feel are quite inferior editions.I am not expecting anything to change from any of these Amazon reviews.  10 million negative reviews probably wouldn't change the man's mind.  He doesn't need more money.  He already has more cash than God.  Fans of the originals can only hope that he will eventually, one day see the light.  Either that or when he finally dies, maybe his estate will do the right thing...  In my opinion, to have such important films as the Star Wars Trilogy only readily available in these silly new editions is a truly a travesty."	1.0	I just don't understand it...	2011-05-04	15	12	3

I know there are fans who hated the fact that Lucas changed things from the original, but I say what he did made them better. I like the way they look now, and it also helped them since he made the prequels. For me, it was awesome to see some my favorite movies from my childhood come back to the big screen and have things added and enhanced. I really thought the extras did the movies a great deal of justice and made them look better. It made them look less fake, and more real. So basically, you either like it or you don't.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ARW1NFQIIN644	James Brinegar	"Sure, nothing will beat the real original trilogy as we all know and love them. You'd think Lucas, being such a connoisseur of old films, would recognize a threat of tainting nostalgia, but his actions show that he doesn't think in terms of protecting nostalgia, but rather puts technology first, and updates his films as he sees fit. Lucas doesn't believe in the proverb ""just because you can doesn't mean you should"". Be that as it may, the Special Edition is refreshing, and I don't think it takes anything away from the overall feel that allowed everyone to fall in love with the movies in the first place (except maybe the ridiculously updated, all-CGI Max Rebo band in the special edition of ROTJ). Overall, I think it is a tad harsh to take what would be a 5-star rating down to a 1 simply because of a few new scenes.I've been waiting to see the original trilogy in pristine format since... well, since 1982, when I first fell in love with the saga. As if the movies weren't enough to get excited about, the special features disc looks incredible, and will be chock full of goodies that not even the most die-hard Star Wars fans have seen. Head over to the official Star Wars site to check out all the special features.By the way, those waiting for a non-Special Edition version of the Original Trilogy on DVD... just wait. George Lucas is probably the most business-oriented film director in the world, and knows exactly how to capitalize on every little teeny tiny detail that will bring him a profit... Rest assured there will be an UNTOUCHED Original Trilogy on DVD sometime in the near future. Over the next few years, I would expect no less than 2 or 3 big sets of Star Wars DVD releases... An untouched Original Trilogy set, a New Trilogy set, and a huge ""sixology"" set... not to mention the anime star wars on DVD, children's cartoon star wars on DVD, star wars the TV sitcom on DVD, and star wars the reality show on DVD."	5.0	Rest assured.	2004-04-20	3	0	3

I saw these films many times in their original versions, and these revisions are clearly better. YES, I'm a fan of the films, and I don't mind any of the changes. They hardly seem noticeable when you focus on the best part of Star Wars.. THE STORY.. George Lucas has every right to change these films, and I'm glad he's doing it. If the originals were released on DVD, they wouldn't fit into today's world, and would be boring to watch on a surround sound system, and High Definition TV (If I want to watch them in Mono, and without any of the dazzle of this set, I have my VHS copies, but I bet I never do) Star Wars has always been far ahead of it's time, and this is yet another example of trend setting. I'm sorry so many of you are stuck in 1977, but for me this is a great trilogy and these DVD's should win over many new young people. I'm sorry, but if a young person (such as my family) watches the original verisons of these, they are bored because they are used to the type of enhancements Mr. Lucas has given us on these versions.

Too bad that there has been so much damage done to the franchise, not the least of which is the gross myopia of Lucas himself when he defends that awful mess known as Episode II.  I am not going to get into the whole ""keep your hands off our trilogy"" debate, because I think that is a waste of time -- the changes are here to stay people.  Unless you have 250 million and the rights to the films, you're stuck with what is out there.  I am relieved that Episodes IV - VI are finally coming to DVD and I personally am looking forward to John Williams on my surround sound system at home.

For these films are not the films I wanted, they aren't even the 'special' editions.I'm not going to launch into a tirade against Lucas, there's enough of that to go around - I just want people to know what they're buying. Several changes have been made to the films, including re-recording the dialog of Boba Fett, and to add insult to injury, the spirit line-up at the end of 'Return of the Jedi' has been altered with Hayden Christensen replacing the original Sebastian Shaw (RIP) Anakin apparition. This on top of the already atrocious revised ending.To their credit, the picture quality is marvellous, and the extra features many. The commentary from Lucas is worth a listen, and the `Empire of Dreams' documentary well produced. But where are the fabled deleted scenes? I know they exist, I've seen one of them.

We all grew up with the classic trilogy, and i think it's a BIG mistake not to issue them on DVD. Lucas would definately make some great extra cash by releasing these.

Well I and it looks like many feel that way. I think others have said this but I will say it again. It's not the new scenes that bother us old Star Wars fans it's the way they're being offered. We watched movies that were great for their time and that's why we love them. Great things don't need change if they did they wouldn't have been great to begin with. I'm only 26 years old, and have seen both versions of the films. I obviously saw the older versions first when I was a kid, and those are the ones that I love. If I were to have seen the special editions first my thinking might be different but I didn't and it's not. All I'm really saying is is it that hard to release two different versions of the dvd set? I mean can't they just clean up the old one, surely they can otherwise there wouldn't have been any special edition to release. If Fox and George Lucas want to do this right, they will release the original set and a special edition set. It can't hurt, they did it a while back on vhs, and I know people who have both, so it can only be a good thing money wise. I understand about the continuity thing, but it's null and void when you try and change things people have already seen and liked. Then all you accomplish is people saying things like ""what the hell was that?"" and ""That isn't right."" So again I say release both versions and then everyone will be happy. jIn fact I wouldn't be surprised to see a set with all six movies in it in about 2 years or so. Maybe by then there will be a choice. I can't wait for the third installment, and I have to say I liked the last two movies as well, but in my mind the original three will always be the best and all I want is a dvd set of the movies I grew up with."	5.0	5 stars for the films 4 for the set.	2004-09-11	15	12	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1A535W556ROBQ	James Ferguson	I must say it is nice to see the original trilogy on DVD.  I had got the set on VHS sometime back, which looks good, but is already starting to show wear and tear.  The first film remains the standout picture in this series.  Loosely based on Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress, it incorporates a wide variety of science fiction themes into an action-packed adventure. Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi lack the initial punch, but taken as a whole it is an immensely rewarding set.  The prequels are more spectacular in terms of scope but nothing compares to the impact these movies had on the general public when they came out in the late 70's and early 80's.  2001: A Space Odyssey lavishly portrayed space but took a decidely existential approach to the subject, whereas Star Wars treated space as a wild frontier.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2VPQLX127G5QJ	James J. Fox	Being a die-hard Star Wars fan for all the years of my life Ive grown to love the original trilogy and find a special place for it no matter where I was. Being a collector and big movie buff the movies meant a lot to me and when I heard the news that  they were coming out on dvd i flipped out. Very unpatiently waiting for months I realized that the versions to be in the box set were not the originals, but the special edition (or the director's cut). I was never a big fan of George Lucas's directers cut of the 3 classics but I could live with them. Waiting in line at 12 in the morning anxious and excited for these movies was one of the most exciting moments in my Star Wars agenda. Although when I watched the movies for the first time, it was very shocking and disappointing. I would never give a Star Wars movie under a 5 rating (even the new ones which I can't really stand myself) because the movies are a part of me and its hard to say that they are bad. But thanks to the master mind of George Lucas the Star Wars trilogy no longer exists. Numerous scenes and voices have been added for the dvds. No longer does the awesome voice talent of Jeremey Bulloch heard through Boba Fetts helmet in Empire, Naboo and the gungans are at the end of Jedi along with a fruity ewok tribe tune, Jabba was touched up again in both episdoe IV and VI. Ive waited so long to hear my favorite lines of any movie in the world right here on this dvd set, and now thanks to itz creators that will never happen. Hayden C. (yuck) is also taken the place as Anakin at the end of Jedi..totally out of place and makes it look like a whole other movie. On a bright note the fourth disc of special features are amazing. Good care and effort went into collecting some rare and awesome footage for a spectactular bonus disc. The artwork for the individual boxes, and the dvd menus itself are all very similar to the episode I and II dvds and are bad as well..both the cases and menus do not give the feeling of the classics we watched for the past 27 years. I hope George Lucas is recieving all this negative feedback from this cite, the papers and other fans so he can think twice on how he crushed and ruined his biggest supporters.	1.0	When did the Star Wars Trilogy come out on DVD?	2004-09-23	26	15	11

We've all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention.  Why does it get our attention?  Because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil, backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters.  Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bring a movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the ""original"" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.  I encourage everyone to do what I did and buy these films and watch them for the first time, you will be amazed at all that HD has done for these films.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3KLZE84BCS2XZ	J. Antoniou	"I remember sitting in the theater in 1997 watching the revised Episode IV and thinking it more a strange oddity of Darth Flannel's (George's) brain than some brilliant update.  The new CG animals / creatures / robots flitting across the screen were more a distraction than a help.  It did not ""enhance"" the picture.  One enhancement that was done properly was refining and CG-izing the Death Star sequences.  That is the only right choice Lucas made on the ""enhanced"" Star Wars--OTHER than digitizing the DVD version, which was not just absolutely necessary, but brilliantly done.  The DVD trilogy is incredibly clear and crisp, no question.  One day when I have an HDTV and a HD-DVD version of this movie, I will be able to bring the full theater experience into my home.The debate rages on about the versions.  I have my own set of reservations about ""director's cuts.""  I think director's cuts are only helpful when they add ORIGINAL footage, not re-shot, enhanced, or newly created footage.  For example, the DC version of Terminator 2 was excellent; the DC version of Blade Runner, which we can credit for essentially starting the DC craze, is so trivially different than the original theatrical cut, it almost seems unnecessary.  Regardless, neither broke new ground.  Neither were artificially ""enhanced.""  For fans, it was exciting to see new original footage.George has taken off on a DC bender though: he has decided unilaterally that Eps. IV-VI are his toys to play with.  This is the sad reality of the cult of personality around him that he has bought into--now he thinks because he has unlimited rights to change the originals, he should.  He wants to villify his creation as flawed and weak because it was the product of limited time, budget, and studio pressure.Frankly, George, so what.I was 7 years old when Ep. IV came out.  It became, like that of many children of the time, the center of my little universe.  I *was* Luke Skywalker.  Yes, I had the stand that held all the Kenner action figures and I had EVERY SINGLE ONE.  As silly as all the attention was to the actors (who, unlike us, were adults, after all), it was our world.  It became embedded into our mythic imagination and is forever an integral part of our nostalgia.George doesn't care about us.  He could care less about our nostalgia and our history with Star Wars.  I honestly don't think he cares so much about the money--he can bankrupt most of the Third World just by writing a check--I think he honestly believes he has some unlimited right to re-realize his artistic vision, no matter if he should or not, no matter the opinion of what he sees as some small fringe of the fans that have been with him for almost 30 years now.As director and writer, clearly George has a perspective and understanding of the original the rest of us don't.  I'll give him that.  Do artists, writers, and movie directors revise their work continually?  Yes, of course--but, at some point, they have to stop and move on to the next thing.  Very few masterpieces of literature were re-written or revised after they were published.  There isn't a single author that doesn't see room for improvement, but almost none go through the process of revising the text.  They let it stand on whatever merits it has.George should have done the same--with very carefully chosen enhancements of original footage.  AT LEAST--at the VERY least--he should give us fans the cleaned and scrubbed originals on DVD, no CG, no enhancements.  He is adamant that he won't.  Wait, he's not just adamant, he's utterly indignant that he won't.Now, with all this said, I will say I have no problem with George  changing Eps. I and II all he wants--in fact, he can scrap them and start from scratch.  First thing to go?  Why Jar-Jar of course."	3.0	Hey, you, George, no touchy...	2004-09-23	18	13	5

I like having the original releases, however I just wish they included the ""making of"" dvd, with this set, I really don't want to drop $30plus on that DVD alone. Don't get me started with the Prequels, I have no problem with Episode 1, if I was 5 I would be kind of psyched, I wasn't 5 when I saw Episode 1, the writing was really poor, I did enjoy having the Tuscan Raiders, portrayed as drunken hillbillies, also just all of Lucas stereotyping with all of the creatures, yes I wish Jar Jar have never been thought of would like to see a death cage match between Jar Jar and the Ewoks.When I heard Lucas hired writers for Episode 2 I was happy until I saw the film, episode 2 is just plain awful, except for the last 45 minutes, overall just a cluster of good intentions gone horribly wrong. The there is Episode 3, great action scenes holy crap writing (As Harrison Ford once said ""George can write this s***, but whose going to say these lines"") and if I'm wrong all apologies. The Star Wars prequel just demonstrates to leave well enough alone, however the 2nd & 3rd Matrix films all time worst in my book only 1 Matrix film made.Back to Star Wars, this DVD set first night I got it I ended up watching the 'extended editions' with the commentaries, and they weren't half bad, however Greedo never shot first.So it is nice to have the original and altered versions of the first saga, ""Fanboys"" has its heart in the right place and if George had that passion with the Prequels as the makers of that movie (Fanboys) Lucas wouldn't be so heavily criticized.Fanboys"	3.0	Episode VII: The ILM Money Grab	2010-01-30	2	1	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWLTGXKX52MP0	Jason L. Rollins	"The ""original"" Star Wars trilogy is finally available on DVD and I purchased it over the holidays (the reason for the quotes will soon be apparent). I wasn't expecting much with regards to the quality since the movies were all filmed over 20 years ago, despite the requisite digital remastering. Much to my surprise, the movies actually look spectacular. The quality is without question better than you would get in an actual movie theater. I'm really thrilled with that.My enthusiasm turned to revulsion as I neared the end of Return of the Jedi, however. I hadn't heard anything about additional changes to the movies, other than the ones added back when the trilogy came out on VHS (when the Jabba the Hut scene was added to ANH), so I was completely shocked and appalled when Hayden Christensen made an appearance as Anakin Skywalker. After Luke removes Vader's mask and has a conversation with Sebastian Shaw, the actor playing Anakin, the latter dies and is cremated with honor in a funeral pyre on the moon of Endor. In the final scene of the trilogy, Luke is pleased as he sees the ghosts, essentially, of Ben Kenobi and Yoda, joined by his father, played by Sebastian Shaw in the original movie. In the DVD vesion, it is not the original actor, but Hayden Christensen who strolls up to join Ben and Yoda.This is going to sound like sour grapes, but I'm absolutely furious. I know George Lucus considers these movies his own to do with as he chooses and technically he is correct. But Star Wars, especially the original, is more than just one man's project now. The movies have become so ingrained into the minds and hearts of their fans that they are in a real sense, a national treasure. In that they should be sacrosanct and immutable. Imagine taking the Declaration of Independance out of its view box and scribbling ""even if you're black"" next to the phrase ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal,"" just because 80 years later the people decided that that phrase should have been in there to start with. It's ludicrious. It's revisionist history. And what Lucus has done is even worse because what he did was not because of some widespread recognition that a wrong needed to be righted. Nay, there is no other explanation than that he did it to arrogantly prove that Star Wars belongs to him alone and not the masses.To top it off, in Lucus's zeal to tie in the prequels, which are viewed by all but him as inferior to the originals, to Episodes IV-VI, he has marred the original movies, doing what a true fan such as myself would have thought impossible, turning the original trilogy itself into an inferior product. First of all, Luke never had the opportunity to see his father as a young man, even in pictures. Hayden Christensen doesn't look anything like Sebastian Shaw. How would Luke even know who he was? The expression on Luke's face is one of recognition; recognition, among other things, that his father will live on forever in the company of his friends on the good side of the force. Instead it should be one of puzzlement: ""Who is that guy?""And why would Anakin get to live on in eternity as a young man while Ben and Yoda, who never wavered from the proper course of a jedi, were not exempted from the ravages of time. The transposition of Hayden for Sebastian is not only blasphemous in theory, in practice it is forced and awkward.The addition of the extra celebration scenes, clearly designed to make it known that the defeat of the Empire was celebrated galaxy-wide, not just on the moon of Endor, was unnecessary and the insertion forced changes that were just as scarring to the film. Apparently, it was felt that since the celebration was universal, the score must be universal as well. This led to the removal of the Ewok song that played in the original. The song's countenence would be familiar to all, though it's translation here will necessarily be lacking. Bum ba bum ba bum, bum bum ... Bum ba bum ba bum, BUM BUM ... BUM BA BUM BA BUM, BUM BUM  ... crescendoing to a dramatic seque into the main theme as the credits start to roll. It provided the perfect bombastic musical ending to a series in the which the score contributed greatly. The new music has no such effect. It is flat and boring, a paltry substitute for the original. The movies go out with a whimper, not a bang.Still, the DVDs are a must own for any Star Wars fan, especially one with an HDTV as the overall quality of the picture is heretofor unimagininable. George Lucus, however, is off my Christmas list for good."	4.0	Amazing Picture quality ... Appalling content changes	2005-01-13	15	11	4

These won't even be the 1997 SEs. These aren't the films we grew up with. I'm hearing Lucas may tamper with these films even more for the blu release. Keep in mind that he didn't even direct Empire and Jedi. Two other guys did. One was his instructor in college and the other died 10 years before the SEs were released. This guy has no scruples. None whatsoever. As much as I wanted to like these ""SEs"", I can't. They aren't the same movies anymore and the changes stick out like a sore thumb.Don't buy these discs. If enough people refuse to purchase them, maybe he'll grow thick skin and accept that he made a mistake by denying movie lovers everywhere the original versions. He should also apologize for being such a liar. Telling us no high quality prints of the original Star Wars exist, when there are. I'm not buying and neither should you.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3JXVV1QJ68PAX	Jason Wilkerson	Tomorrow the Star Wars trilogy will finally be released on DVD, and today I am watching Return of the Jedi on DVD. You're probably wondering why that is, well, it's one of the great perks to working in a video store. It's great, the picture is great, all of the original material is intact. The only problem most people are having with it is the added material that Lucas added to the movie a few years ago.It's ridiculous for the uproar over the use of the special editions for the DVD's that are coming out. This is the way Lucas wanted it to come out originally, and as the artist in this situation he has ever right to add what he wants to artistically.Of course most of the problems that people have stem from the question: Who shot first, Greedo or Han? I read an interview with George Lucas where he said that the main reason people want to think Han shot first is because you kind of want him to be a cold blooded killer, but he isn't that type of person. The way Lucas originally envisioned it was that they either both shot together, or Greedo shot a hair before Han. But it completely makes sense for him to fix that misunderstanding.I'm not going to lie and say that I love every change that was made, I don't particualarly care for the musical number in the Jabba the Hut scene at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. And Jabba doesn't quite look right in his new scene in A New Hope. But these do add somewhat of a greater understanding to the storylines they inhabit.Allow George Lucas to do what he will to his films, the movies he created. None of you were the artist behind the script, or the artist behind the camera, so allow that artist to do what he will and just enjoy the ride.	5.0	Working at a video store has it's advantages!!!!!	2004-09-20	23	18	5

George Lucas' mastery of storytelling and special effects has changed the way movies are made.  From space battles in the middle of nowhere to dramatic lightsaber battles between father and son, the special effects are like none that had ever been seen before, and inspiring everything that we see today.  Not only has he changed the way movies are made, he has also changed the way movies are watched.  Before Star Wars, movies were all thought provoking emotional dramas that tied you to the protagonist. Lucas changed that by taking the focus off of the heroes and putting the focus on the story as a whole.  With action drama, and romance, it is a perfect mixture of cowboys and aliens, or as Lucas likes to call it, a ""space opera.""

The way they were shown at the theaters for the first time. The way we love them.I can only quote what George Lucas himself said, not so long ago, in this very same world....""People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be ""replaced"" by new altered negatives.

Lucas is releasing a boxset of all six films on HD-DVD for the 30th anniversary. He is releasing a standard set (with more alterations, mainly touch-up work from what I hear), and another set containing THE ORIGINALS. He simply did not have the time this go around. It took him a year just to re-master the films to DVD format. Don't cite an interview with him claiming that he won't release the originals, because Lucas is very good at doing what he says he won't do:""Phantom Menace won't be on DVD until 2004""""I won't release the original triliogy on DVD until 2007""""I won't create another Star Wars movie after Episode III""Yet, he leaked some Episode 7-9 info recently, as if to hype these movies that he ""will never release."" Hmmm...Just to name a few. Give the poor man some time, and you will get your movies IN HIGH DEFINITION. Be patient.For the most part, the changes enhance the story, and push it beyond what it originally was. The only changes that damaged the story line were Boba Fett's voice dubbing, and Hayden's cameo, both were poorly done. I was going to give this set four stars for those two reasons, but after seeing what cry-babys have reviewed this set, I decided to give these films the stars they deserve. Plus, those two alteration were very MINOR issues.Face it: if Lucas didn't exist, you all would never have seen Star Wars in the first place. You are all complaining about something he gave you. It's his property, let him do what he wants with it. He puts millions of his own money into his films to ensure it is a quality product. Lucas has high standards for what he puts out.Bottom line: find something else to do until 2007. I'm going to chuckle quite loudly when you all start singing praises to him when he panders out the originals. It may seem like a long time, but trust me, seeing the movies just as you remember them in HD format will be worth the wait."	5.0	70's fans, shut up and read this	2005-04-03	16	5	11

Each film comes with 2 discs, the first containing the 2004 re-mastered version in 5.1 and the bonus disc contains the original theatrical versions of the films in 2.0 stereo. This is pretty much the only set with the original un-altered versions of the films unless you still have a VHS or Laserdisc copy. Some have complained that the films look terrible on an HDTV but if you have the widescreen version and a newer Blu-ray player to watch them on they look pretty good in my opinion. Plus you cant really complain about the look of the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 versions since you cant find them anywhere else on DVD and Lucas has already stated that he will not release them again. The only thing that bothers me is the 2.0 stereo but I decided to watch the films with a stereo gaming headset instead of my surround and it worked out great. This set is rare and hard to find, ive had mine since it released in 08 and have not seen many others. If you are looking for the original versions of Star Wars then make sure you get the set with the cover I described at the top.	5.0	Original Theatrical Versions in the 2008 Blue and Black Limited Edition DVD Set	2013-10-20	8	6	2

Of course, everyone was raving about it -- even adults.  However, I remember sitting in the theater bored stiff waiting for an interesting story to unfold.  I was very disappointed.  I even went to the second one a few years later and was again disappointed.  There was nothing engaging about the Star Wars films at all, and why they are still revered all these years later as great movies baffles me.  My reasons for not recommending these films are listed below:a.)  Too much BAM! and BOOM!  --  These films are extremely noisy and irritating.  If you like explosions and fireballs, and things blowing up, then maybe it's for you; however, if a lot of irritating noise, music, and sound effects get on your nerves, then skip them.b.)  Cardboard characters  --  Come on... Just look at some of the names... Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Hans or Han Solo (can't remember which).  My six year old nephew could have thought up better names.  The characters themselves are all flat and one dimensional.  There's no life or spirit in them.  They're predictable and dull.  The only character who has any substance at all might be Obi-(Wan or Won)-Kenobi, and that's probably because the actor (who is actually quite good) playing the part tries in vain to give him life.  Unfortunately, there's not much he can do with the insipid script, but at least he tries!c.)  Egregious writing  --  There's not much to say about this.  Between the BAMS and BOOMS and all the explosions, the characters engage in lame, predictable dialogue.  Some of the one liners by Han or Hans Solo are expected to elicit mirth from the audience, but this is only to divert the attention of the viewer from the terrible shortcomings of the plot and quality of the films.d.)  Special effects  --  Okay, I know a lot of money was spent in creating the special effects, and that ""NOTHING ELSE HAD EVER BEEN DONE LIKE THIS BEFORE!!!""  But nothing is left to the imagination.  It's all thrown at you quickly and with such noise and thunder that one gets the feeling of being cheated somehow.  There is nothing atmospheric about the effects here.  Lots of fireworks but little else.Overall, these movies were incredibly dull with silly characters and a lot of empty noise sprinkled with fireballs and spinning spaceships.  These were typical ""market"" movies intended to bilk the imaginations and purses of a gullible public.  Unfortunately, they succeeded only too well."	1.0	I REMEMBER PRETENDING TO LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS A KID!	2010-08-14	33	2	31

I remember with great fondness waiting in line to see the originals in the theaters.  Back then you could buy a ticket and stay in the theater all day.  But with all the changes these are NOT the films I remember.  My younger sister and I could quote whole scenes, but not anymore.  To me the additions don't contribute anything significant to the films.  The changes seem to be little more than a gross endulgence by the very man who created the originals that we all grew up with.  I so loved the special effects in the original versions because they were cutting edge for their time.  Why the obsession with ""improving"" old films?  I am sorry I ever bought this set and I can see that there will be 1000's of used sets available.  I am very glad I still have the originals on VHS.

In episode 4 Jabba is a laid back, don't worry about it pal, when you get the chance dude, but a I'm going to send bounty hunters after you at the same time.  If he is so mad, then shouldn't he had offed Solo when they met in e. 4?They also axed the classic ROTJ songs.  Again I feel that it was done as an excuse to show off what would and wouldn't work for episode 1.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2NF1RY31JF0HE	"J. Buettner ""Jaws Fan"""	"I grew up loving Star Wars and I, like so many others from my generation, had all the toys. This film is the one that made science fiction real. It was a simple movie. Instead of dealing with social issues like the Star Trek series, these movies were more concerned with real characters and good and evil. Everything about Star Wars was cool because it was new at the time. Han Solo was cool! Darth Vader was cool! The fights in space were cool!Even after all the years the original two films hold a sentimental value. I remember watching these films in awe because special effects and the look of these films were on a different level than anything before it. That's why I don't think the series carries the same weight with the new generation of kids. The effects don't hold the novelty to them. If you look at the original films now you'd surely see television series have slicker effects. The story still holds up because of the characters, but George Lucas now seems to hold a much greater fascination for effects, plot, and profitability than he does characters. This tendency can be seen in Return of the Jedi when the best they could come up with is the Empire rebuilding the Death Star. Where's the originality? Ewoks to sell dolls to girls since he cornered the action figure sales to boys. And how many versions of this movie have been released on video and laserdisc? Too many to count. Now we have the first release on DVD.My expectations were low for the new trilogy because I saw the decline in George Lucas's interest in the franchise and I still believe his heart is not truly in it. Maybe he's doing it because he's bored? If you want to see George Lucas at his best look to his early work, THX 1138, American Graffiti, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Empire Strikes Back. These are the films that he should be known for. I hold out hope for the third installment of the new series. It definitely has the potential to be the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the prequel trilogy. I mean the way we know it ends is Darth Vader coming to power and the dark side prevailing. How can George miss with this film?In regards to not releasing the original versions of the films, just be patient. Anyone that pays attention knows how Lucasfilms has been releasing multiple versions of the same movie knowing that all the fans will shell out another $50 bucks for it when he's ready. Much like Miramax and Tarrentino are doing with Kill Bill. Do the enhanced versions really make that big of a difference to me enjoying the films, no. I think the best part of the first two movies are the stories themselves and if the effects are a little better then so be it. Lucas hasn't done anything in the new versions that really hurts the story has he?I just wish I could just buy the first two installments and leave the horrible third installment on the store's shelf. I probably will next year or the year after that when they release the films individually."	4.0	Two thirds of the original franchise is excellent	2004-09-05	7	3	4

Also I'm not sure I'll miss much by skipping the making-of documentary since all the new footage will probably be about the added effects and how much everyone loves them.But the main reason I won't get this is because doing so would be doing my part to reassure Lucas that the garbage he's been selling us is satisfactory.	1.0	"Is there a ""Special"" Edition Mona Lisa?"	2004-05-24	30	17	13

I'll have to sit down and read the book again then watch the SE edition to be able to list all the scenes, but I can say for certain that the approach to Mos Eisley as well as the Jabba/Han meeting in the Falcon's hanger bay *are in the book*.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1HF6TIJ0YV6JO	"J. Carlile ""JC"""	Yes, I'm another old-school fan of the original trilogy.  In fact, I have the original trilogy on laserdisc and transfered it to DVD for my own personal use, but the picture and sound quality is not up to par with modern DVDs.  It's better than VHS, but not quite good enough for the modern audiophile.The sole reason I bought this set was to see and hear it on my home theater system.  I must say, the picture and sound quality is better than any Star Wars version I've ever seen.  My house literally shook when the Star Destroyers rolled across the screen.  Laser blasts seem to come at you from all directions as you become more and more immersed in the Star Wars universe.  In that aspect, it more than lived up to my expectations, hence the four-star rating. It does have a few audio inconsistencies which I expected since the movie is 28 years old, but it's nothing major. I had to take off one star out of spite, however.  Well-justified spite.Visuals and acoustics aside, George Lucas killed the nostalgia of Star Wars when he made the special edition changes.  I see many kids writing reviews saying how much they love the changes, stop complaining, and so on and so forth, but many of them had never even *seen* the original trilogy before the prequels were released.  Obviously Episodes I, II, and III created a whole new generation of Star Wars fans.  Good for them; I hope their memories of the version they love will remain as fond as mine have for the version I love.Therein lies the problem.  George has basically spit on my memories as well as those of other Star Wars purists who made him who he is today through our monetary support.  The ONLY special edition changes I can deal with are the explosions and improved quality of the picture and sound.  Everything else was either totally wrong to change or unnecessary to include.  I literally cringe when I see the special edition version of Jabba's palace in ROTJ.  Aweful.  And what's the deal with that scrawny, misshapen Jabba in A New Hope?  Did he really change that much in 5 years?  Why, oh WHY did he change the song in the Ewok village at the end of ROTJ?  That was the last thing I remembered about the original trilogy as a kid, and he destroyed it.  And I can't even bring myself to discuss how Lucas disrespected Sebastian Shaw (old Vader's ghost) by replacing him with Hayden Christensen during the final scene of the trilogy.  My god.In conclusion, I'm glad that George finally released the trilogy on DVD, but I believe he should have more respect for his loyal, die-hard fans and release the original, unadulterated version on DVD as well.  If the purists didn't support him back in the day, there would BE no Episodes I, II, and III. There would BE no new generation of Star Wars fans.  Why he fails to realize this is beyond my comprehension.I may bring out this set in case I'm entertaining a few youngsters or people who don't know much about the original trilogy, but I'll always prefer the 1995 laserdisc versions myself.	4.0	I bought this set to test out my new home theater system ONLY.	2005-07-17	12	9	3

George Lucas listen up...The Original Trilogy is great, however, I did like some of the improvements Lucas made and others not so well.  Why is it so hard to make a dvd/or blu-ray where you can choose what special or original scenes you want to see when you watch the film.  The menu screen should take you to a description of the scenes and you check the boxes that you want or don't want.  It's the Definitive Star Wars set for EVERYBODY.  You make everyone happy if you do that.  The only bad thing is when you want to start the movie, you'd have to go through all those checks.  Maybe, you can have a 1977 Original, 2004 or 2006 Special Edition check boxes.  I still think it would be great to be able to make your own version, just the way you like it.  Just like Burger King, have it YOUR way.  That way you don't have to buy 3-4 different versions to get what you want, that's just crazy.  Us fans only want to buy ONE, 1 version, that's all nothing else.  I can't wait to own these on blu-ray, just hope they put it out right, which means fix it right first.  Fix the color correction.  If anybody has seen Adywan's Star Wars revisited on Youtube, that's exactly what I want.  I intend to buy his version over anything George wants to put on dvd or blu-ray.

The success of E4 was not expected by anyone, especially George Lucas and the various actors. That it was any thing other than a standard summer release was suprising, and sequels were not dreamed of, or expected...the surprise factor was enormous. You can thank the 'old timers' who watched the thing 5 or 6 times for it's success, and for allowing G. Lucas and crew to scamper to fill out the sequels.A lot of backfilling was necessary.  It was like building a house from the roof down (and Revenge of the Sith is the basement).  The first was the best, and the rest have had to make do with slick special effects to make up for the plot problems.  I'm not complaining, but feel that the DVDs should have been available separately.

Rowland	"Mr. Evans, first I will not say that I disagree with your unhappiness about losing the original theatrical versions of Episodes IV,V,VI.  I do cherish the tinted green effect when watching my rustic VHS copies.  I will, however, say that I do not agree with you when you make your statement that Lucas has no soul.Perhaps we're looking at this the wrong way.  Kids are growing up in a society that demands entertainment.  Video games are becoming more and more realistic while the other side of the entertainment industry fights to stay ontop of the ""ooh & ahh"" competition.  Lucas gave me something that you had and I didn't.  I had the chance to go to my local movie theater and watch the Trilogy.  I will say that tears welled up in my eyes when ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . "" came up on the screen.  The anticipation of the theme that, like most young children when I was their age, use to hum and sing wile running around the front yard, pretending that I was defeating Darth Vador.  Lucas made it possible for me to feel like a child again when my parents first rented Star Wars, yet this time I was able to enjoy as they had the first time they saw it.As far as putting the Trilogy on DVD and them being updated yet again.  All I can ask is have you ever had a really good idea, put it into action and then thought that you could possibly make it better?  I have.  Perhaps Lucas has too.  Besides, keeping the DVD updated with special effects just might attract newer, younger Star Wars fans.  True, the real love of Star Wars isn't based on the special effects of the movie.  But please admit, when you first saw the death star blow I'm sure you found that amazing.  Think of how much that is going to be for this new generation watching for the first time.  I'm still wowed.  Of course I'm still easily entertained.The fact that Lucas makes these movies available for every generation is awesome.  I know that when the time comes, I will share my love of Star Wars with my family.  I have Mr. Lucas to thank for that.  Hopefully some day when I'm long gone, my family will cherish that same love and share it with their family.  Perhaps it's not about money, but more of love.  Love of entertainment.  Love of science fiction.  Love of heroism.  Whatever you want to attach it to, it's still love.  Lucas' love.I'm not trying to pick a fight with you.  I'm not going to be one of the gentleman who sits in the basement of their parents house and fights with everyone on everything by putting their posts on the internet.  Not just me.

That music, the sounds, the awesome special effect. It's what I bought a home theater system for.But to all those who have nothing better to do than complain, I say stow it. In a few years, an HDTV version will inevitably be released which will make this version obsolete. Its the nature of the technology so get used to it.I have nothing against a director trying to make his movie what he wanted in the first place. I do agree that the DVD's should contain both versions of the film so you can choose which one you watch. I'm just thankful that I'm getting these at all considering that only a few years ago he vowed to never release them in DVD format.Oh, and last point. I have every re-issue of the Star Wars trilogy. From the original release on VHS, to the re-release with the new cover art, to the re-issue for the box set, to the re-issue for the special edition box set. My point is, a true fan will take what you get, no complaint, no worries. Just enjoy.As for the prequels....well, I too am a bit disappointed (Jar Jar can rot in &quot;Bleep&quot; for all I care) but my main problem is the &quot;clean&quot; feeling the films have.

How much longer is he going to wait to release this on DVD widescreen?  Most of us that shared the excitement of the original release in the days of our youth are in our mid 30's to late 40's now.  If Mr. Lucus waits any longer, he may wait past the point to where we just won't give a crap anymore.  If maximum sales profit is all Mr. Lucus is concerned about and the fans be damned, then I suggest Star Wars sales would have already reached their peak at this time, and it's all downhill from here.  I'm in my mid 30's and to my surprise, most 18-25 year olds that I know have never seen the original trilogy and don't have much interest in watching them.	1.0	too little, too late	2000-11-24	4	1	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	The Star Wars Trilogy features some of the most recognizable characters in film history. The story of Star Wars is universally known and celebrated. The films play out like Space Opera Saturday Matinee Serials. Each film is meant to be viewed as part of a whole story, and be seen as one film. The films feature astonishing special effects for the time they were made. Take, for instance, in The Empire Strikes Back the amazing Hoth AT-AT walker attack scene. Or the attacks on the two Death Stars in A New Hope and in Return Of The Jedi.The story of the trilogy is quite original and interesting. The idea of an energy field called The Force surrounding everything is an interesting concept. The trilogy mainly revolves around the journey of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into becoming a Jedi knight, the former guardians of peace and justice. Luke meets smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford,) Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and rescues Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher.) He must also conquer his fear, and face Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones.)All 3 Star Wars films are astonishing in their own way. The first Star Wars introduced us to our heroes, and also introduced us to Darth Vader and the evil Empire. The first film is the second best in the series. The Empire Strikes Back is the mother of all sequels. Empire is the best in the series. This film is remarkable for being the most notably different Star Wars film created. Everyone is at the top of their game. We also get to meet Yoda, the ancient Jedi master who helps Luke with his Jedi training. Empire is also notable for it's tantalizing cliffhanger. You know what I'm talking about. Return Of The Jedi is the worst in the trilogy, but it's still an excellent film. It's an excellent conclusion. In this one, we get to see our heroes defeat the Empire, and destroy the evil Emporer. Also notable for the ultimate lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader.Overall, the Star Wars Trilogy features some of the best movies ever made. These films are such a treat to watch.Overall Trilogy Grade: A+ (10++++)	5.0	Star Wars Trilogy	2002-04-30	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1IGSLHSS6B58Y	Jeff Larath	"For my money, Lord of the Rings is the absolute best. First off, there's no question that the original theatrical releases should have been included with these DVDs.  The movies are so different from one another that it would be interesting for true Star Wars buffs to compare them.  George Lucas' answer?  ""Well, I'm sorry that fans fell in love with a movie only half done but they're still on VHS."" These are actually even slightly different than the re-re-releases from a few years ago.  In Jedi, for instance, the young Hayden (from the new movies) replaces the original actor as Darth's ghost in the end (with a still aged Alec Guiness, not Ewan McGregor, as Ben).The first movie, Star Wars still lives up to it's reputation.  You will notice that the bar scene is a lot different.  Jabba's appearance in the movie only adds to it, in my opinion. The Empire Strikes Back, also, has lost none of it's power.And then, we have Return of the Jedi.  Although it was better than I remembered it, by this time the series had become a shameless attempt to market children's toys (everyone in the movie is an action figure).  Characters like the Ewoks and the small bug-eyed giggling aliens who ride with Lando during the attack serve no purpose at all other than, seemingly, comic relief for children. It is at this point that takes Star Wars out of the running for me as the greatest trilogy.There are several documentaries included with the set that are worth watching.  The game demo is on XBox, though, and I don't think they tell you that on the box.All in all worth the money, but hardly as ""fan friendly"" as some of us would have liked.  If episodes 7-9 get produced (as there are rumors of), one hopes that Lucas will produce, not write or direct them because the first two of the new installments have lacked the old magic."	4.0	One of the Best Trilogies in Film History	2004-09-30	3	1	2

Lucas CHANGED the ""effect"" changes of the original special editions??? The added ""Jabba the Hutt"" scene now has a larger, more detailed Jabba! My Lord, the man is obsessed... he can't leave these films alone!And yes, Han shot Greedo first. And he was justified in doing so... he knew the poorly constructed alien was preparing to kill him.These films were ""stage 2"" in a revolution first introduced by ""2001."" They brought Sci-Fi into the blockbuster mainstream.They are full of exceptional music, swashbuckling adventure and sympathetic characters.But WHY does the original drag us along with droids for the first several scenes?Some complaints would be in the writing... especially the dialogue. After winning a Tie Fighter battle in the original,  Luke yells ""We did it!"" Much to my horror, Leah then yells the exact same sentence ""We did it!""Or in Jedi, Han tells Lando ""Good luck... you're gonna need it."" This old cliche would even feel tired in a comic book.Of the three, I believe ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the most entertaining, albeit disjointed experience. The humor is especially sharp... like the repeated failures to go to lights speed.This version actually transplants pretty boy Hayden as the apparition of ""Anakin"" at the conclusion, but all in all it's not too annoying.A great trilogy, not perfect but great.Jeff Messenger, author of the novel ""The Shroud of Torrington."""	4.0	A Groundbreaking Trilogy!	2005-12-28	2	1	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3989O6O4I8TKP	"Jeffrey Kowal ""mykerri"""	"So let me begin by saying that I was nervous about the release of this Special Edition. The reviews have been so polarized regarding the release of these updated movies, that I was concerned that Lucas had blown it. I was pleased, after my initial viewing of ""A New Hope"", that he had not.I was the generation that grew up with Star Wars. I made my father take me to see EP IV 8 times. So this adding footage thing didn't sit well with me. However, in watching this film, with it's updates and restored picture... I understand what Lucas is doing. Thirty years later, he is continuing his store with EPI, II and III. This is him going back and ""adjusting"" for continuity issues (both in the story and from a visual story standpoint) so that the story is consistent. These changes really do help to draw the first three movies into the new set of movies. If you are able to abandon your clutch on what these movies were, and look at the Star Wars saga as it stands today, this all ties together much better than if the movies had been left alone, and will be a launch-pad for the next three movies, if he is in fact going to do them.There has been footage added and adjustments made since the 1997 release of the Movie, and I am pleased to say they are much better than THAT debacle ( I DID oppose the additions in '97, not because they we're additions, but because the we're really lousy in production value). The changes made in 1997 are still there, but have been improved and feel much more integrated into the newly restored film, which, by the way, looks amazing! So now, this classic movie has a major face lift and some new pieces parts... so what, it is still Star Wars. The story, characters and events haven't changed, or if they have, they've changed for the better in my opinion.Picture quality is, as I said great. In fact the only reason I don't give this set a 5-STAR rating is because I feel like Lucas wasn't as thorough in his restoration process as he should have been. Being the king of the Lucas Ranch and all that prevails there, these DVDs should have been the benchmark that all heretofore DVDs should be measured by... they are not. They ARE great, but there are some consistency issues and obvious oversights that just simply should not have been (for instance leaving the key blocks around some of the space ships or inconsistencies in color from scene to scene.) Nothing that breaks the movie, but to a detail-oriented person like myself, it seems like a glaring omission. None the less, the film looks pristine and gorgeous and NOT like it had been shot 30 years ago. Also, as I indicated, the restoration of the film helps greatly in the integration of the new sections, they don't have the ""glaring"" contrast that they had in '97... it all feels seamless.In terms of Audio, again GREAT, dynamic 6.1 separation. But again, they miss the 5-star mark for some glaring oversights in the remix. Sudden drops in the soundtrack, the occasional muddled voice track due to a sound effect... things that Skywalker Sound simply should not have happening. That being said, again very critical and doesn't detract from the overall experience too badly.In terms of extras, I have not gotten to them yet. However, I understand that the bonus DVD feature, ""Empire of Dreams""- the making of the Star Wars saga, is reason enough to own the box set. It's the most comprehensive documentation of the making of to date.Bottom line, this is a successful DVD launch of these movies. Of course, you KNOW they will be re-released with when EP III comes out on DVD as a 6 part DVD collection, and perhaps for that version they will fix some of these things and maybe even offer the original releases of the movies on alternate DVDs. For now, I am very happy to have these on DVD and in the excellent shape that they are in. And I am also pleased that I can play Ep V next to Ep II and feel like they are part of the same story, rather than the glaring 30 year gap that would otherwise be there."	4.0	Star Wars - expanding the universe	2004-09-21	17	14	3

The new Star Wars adds both positive and negative elements to the film, depending on your level of devotion of course. Regardless, it is a NEW Star Wars. The visual quality has improved by leaps, and the audio effects by bounds, although one of the TIE Fighters in A New Hope still has the pasted rectangle artifacts around it from the original film (lazy editors). The 5.1 is breathtaking, and the new scenes are intriguing. They really should release the original films on DVD, but then the remastering will be kind of pointless as people who would buy it will simply want the ""original"" film. Hey Lucasfilm, just go out and put the analog films through a A/D filter and slap on a price tag. Scores of original fanatics will be happy and you won't get anymore flak, considering they are asking for the OG version they won't care about remastered quality.Personally, I am a Star Wars fantic, and I frankly enjoy ANY new SW material, so I say bring it on!

I saw the originals when they first came out, and I have no idea what is missing from them or what has been added. Don't worry about it and just enjoy the movies. As for the films, the original is clearly the least impressive film. The effects are now almost tacky, the acting primitive, and some of the dialogue lame. It still is a lot of fun, but it takes a while to get going. Empire is easily the best film in the trilogy, pretty much a perfect action movie. It is smart, the characters are more developed, and there are some stunning scenes and memorable lines of dialogue. Return of the Jedi is silly at times but ends the trilogy on a nice note.

Each movie contains extra footage that was not included in the original films, such as Han's encounter with Jabba the Hutt at Mos Eisley.  All of the action and adventure that we all have grown to love over the years is brought back to life, and the new scenes are excellent as well.  This set is a must for Star Wars fans.

However, it's my opinion that the packaging seems a little flimsy and not a lot of extra love went into it. I guess I have been spoiled by stellar and artistic packaging treatment of each of the Lord Of The Rings extended versions.Anyways, By all means you should buy and enjoy these movies on DVD but I for one was a little disappointed with the presentation (and naturally that the set doesn't include the original versions).	4.0	Great movie - -  Not-so great packaging	2005-01-08	4	2	2

Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	If you haven't had enough of Christian as Anakin, you'll love the fact that He's been squeezed into this trilogy. Along with Padme and oh yeah, You get to see Jar Jar. The storm troopers voices are all the same (cloned), but wait, Everything is reformated to look beautifully and sound Dangerously clear! I try and not get angry to the point of finding George Lucas (probably riding on his horse somewhere in Norther California) to say a few bad things, I rather remain calm. Calm and not succumb to the (dark side* coined!!property of Lucas enterprise. Don't wan't to be sued by the man). I don't recommend this set for the Avid fans, and the elder fans (who are old enough to remember watching the first film back in the seventies). Perhaps the younger generation, like 4 and 5 will enjoy it. Maybe it would be fun to pop in at a party, just to add noise and sound effects to the night. My only request now is to have my mind ripped out and cleansed of the memory of watching these films, and most notably, the prequels(eww I hate them). I'm just kidding....or am i? I suppose rent it at least. See what I'm talking about.-jeff	3.0	NOOOO, George LUCAS must be stopped	2004-12-15	17	11	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3GWDRH67O4LB2	j ehrhart	First, let me say, that impressive, is not even close to the word that describes my first experience watching the DVD trilogy. Orgasmic, is closer, but not quite there yet.I was raised on STAR WARS, and have been anticipating this release with great anxiety. Altough, I am not impressed with the new additions that Lucas has added to this flawless trilogy, I can say without a doubt that I will enjoy watching my children experience STAR WARS with the same captivating attraction that my parents watched with me.It is obvious that Lucas is making the prequels up as he goes along, and it's a shame that he now has to alter the original story, and it's actors to fit a new bill. Lucas must take the fans for idots. Since the prequels were filmed nearly twenty years after the IV, V, VI, it stands to reason that Sebastian Shaw be viewed at the end of JEDI, since he is the approximate age that VADER would have been at his death. But, no, with special effects and editing, HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN was morphed into Shaw's image. This shows to me that Lucas is not a fan of his own  work, and is not impressed with his contribution, not only to the advancement of the film industry, but to pop culture as well. I would like to ask George Lucas to define perfection to me. What he has done to his original story is like buying a new car, and striping the paint down to the primer, and then repainting the car with a roller and brush.  I guess that a new IV, V, VI will be reissued when episode III is released, so that any more contradictions in episode III can be made right, and can be altered to fit a new trilogy.Visual and Audio tracks are impressive, and flaunt off the obvious advantages of DVD over video. This is a must see, and is well worth the investment.	5.0	I Can Die Now In Peace, Having Watched This DVD Trilogy	2004-09-28	5	1	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	Star Wars is etched in the Cinema landscape as the film that changed the movie industry forever.  Some people hate it for that, but no one can deny how much it opened the doors to more exciting and creative movies.  Only 2001: A Space Odyssey had centered it's subject matter in space.Back in 1977, Star Wars premiered with clunky, but still start of the arts, effects.  It's characters were like nothing ever seen before and the cantina scene could be compared to nothing at the time.  Now, with the dusk of the newest generation of Star Wars movies quickly approaching, George Lucas has taken his prize possession and made it what he always wanted it to be.  Whether you like it or not is totally your own opinion.  Personally, the only flaw I can see is the `Greedo shoots first' scenerio, and this is only because it doesn't look good.  No matter how much technology they throw at that scene, it doesn't look right.Other than that, everything else is spectacular.  The additional scenes, creatures, vehicles and cityscapes; to me they all add to this world that Lucas wanted so badly to create in 1975 but couldn't due to lack of budget and distrust of the material.  Personally, I love it.  There should be an extra ten minutes of CGI dogfighting scenes in the final battles.  There should be a long panning shot of the cantina showing the managerie of creatures that he envisioned.  I just wish they could get the puppet Jaba to look as good as the CGI one.  Yes, there is texture and reality to the puppet version, but c'mon, he only swayed back and forth when he moved.  If they could mix both technologies somehow, couldn't it work?All of this is creative, and it's George's work (and world), and we just get to play in it.  Everything else about the movies stands firm.  The characters, the story line, the plot; nothing else has changed.  To say that you want the old version back is like saying you would rather have the old 65 Mustang that is beat up and not maintained vs. the completely restored 65 Mustang.In any case, to each his own.  I bought this Trilogy on DVD the day it came out, I saw Star Wars in the theater when I was seven years old and it has been my ultimate dream to have a Lightsaber and use the ways of the force (c'mon I was seven, anyone would have).  Some people would think that's geeky but I bet they would change their tune if they saw someone try to mug you when you're armed with a three meter laser sword.In true progressive nature, George Lucas has upped the bar on his creation with completely digital sound and picture.  This movie looks fantastic and sounds just as good.  I can't wait to get a wide screen TV to see how it looks.  The 150 minute documentary on what it took to make all three movies is almost worth the price of the set alone.  But there are three other shorter documentaries that are very well done too.  One in particular that displays Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christiansen practicing their lightsaber dual for Episode 3.  It looks like this one is gonna be quite intense.This trilogy is timeless, no matter how many additional CGI creatures, vehicles and spaceships Lucas superimposes to the original track.  In the end, it's all about adding to the strong story that is already there.  The Good vs. Evil bloodline is still there.  The excitement and escapism of another world is ready to be experienced.  George Lucas created something that has stayed with us for over 25 years and will keep going, no matter what anyone thinks of the new movies, or the changes made to the old ones.	5.0	An American Icon Gets Refreshed	2004-11-02	15	8	7
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3N8FQIB7MLVGD	Jen Arpin	There is no such thing as a better story than the Star Wars saga.  The series is so intricately written that one can watch the movies over and over again and catch things that were missed before.  &quot;Star Wars&quot; is, of course, a classic and set the stage for the other Star Wars films.  &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; is perhaps even better than the first one, and examines the complex relationship between Luke Skywalker, his Jedi training, and Darth Vader, who finally reveals himself to be Luke's father, yet at the same time, his nemesis.  Finally, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; which I saw as a kid in the theater (yeah, I'm old), which is okay, a good way to end the trilogy, yet sets the stage for possible future episodes.  Anyone who likes Star Wars should purchase this trilogy as a boxed set, it is highly entertaining and a great value for the worlds most complex and interesting fiction.	5.0	Unequalled	2003-01-20	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A259W5KIP41XFL	Jennifer A. Everhart	The films in this Star Wars set were awesome, but not what I had in mind. I was expecting the set from 2008, but it was the one of 2005 to promote the release of Revenge of the Sith, the best of the prequels and the darkest in the series. The set of 2008 has the theatrical and 2004 enhanced versions, but this one just has the latter versions standalone. That would explain why it costed about $24.00. I am dead serious. It was neat, but when it comes to ordering used films online, please be careful. If the seller has an average rating below 95% by the public, the product would likely be flawed.	4.0	Great films, but different boxed set.	2009-04-11	3	0	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1Q3SY9T4WJE7U	"Jennifer E. Luckner ""mrsblackthorne"""	I have been a HUGE Star Wars fan since I was seven years old and I saw the first movie in the theater. I always count Star Wars (New Hope) as my all-time favorite movie, hands down.  Anyway, when the trilogy was released, I must admit that I was VERY disappointed that the movies contained the newer versions of the films rather than the originals.  I cringed when I saw the remade version of New Hope...when Greedo shoots first, that is SO lame....it really takes away from the scene. I was hoping that the trilogy would contain only the unchanged versions of the films and was sorely disappointed to find that they are indeed the new ones. Boo!!  If it ain't broke, why fix it??  Why would they take a movie as classic as Star Wars and add changes to it?  It isn't as though the movie was not well loved by its fans. More people than not have expressed dissatisfaction with the changes.  The only people who seem ok with these dubbed in scenes seem to be kids who didn't grow up with the original versions.  ANYWAY, this is the reason I gave this trilogy 4 stars instead of 5. I almost gave it a three but being such a fan of the films, I couldn't actually go that low because I still love these films. I hope that eventually they put out the ORIGINAL, untouched films so that true fans of the movie can enjoy the film the way it has always been.	4.0	WHY?????	2004-10-03	17	15	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWA0CA9AYL5YQ	Jennifer Litchfield	Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . . . . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and handsome scoundrel Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street.In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and added to 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether.	2.0	"""If you only knew the power of the Dark Side"""	2002-12-06	12	1	11

However, on one side note, some feel more like Star Wars I & II.Is that good or bad? We may love Star Wars I-II and IV-VI, but not IV-VI if it feels more like I & II?I guess that's the only way I look at it to like the new updates.I-III gave us one sort of feel to the films, and IV-VI gave us another, so having IV-VI to be like I-III may disturb some of us.I would of course prefer THE ORIGINAL film, the way it was done the first time with widescreen, but these will have to do.I did however, save the originals with the THX and Widescreen on VHS.The bit that I don't like, is that George Lucas did say ""original"" on DVD.Other than that, and some minor changes, you have it restored on DVD, able to even play it on the PC.Overall, 4 stars. 5 if they were the original, or at least having George Lucas say it's the updated version."	4.0	Good or bad?

Everyone always drags Jar Jar in as states evidence No. 1 that Lucas should not be tinkering with perfection.Now, I didn't like him either, but only because he is as culturally offensive as the worship of the golden idol (C3P0) by the Ewoks in Jedi. Which brings me to my point: There are many more similarities between The 2 trilogies than people would like to admit.I'm going to go out on a sacrilegious limb here and say that the original trilogy, while a fun ride, was no classic of American cinema either.Those who take exception with Jar Jar muddying up the sacred realm should consider that, while we all have a soft spot in are hearts for the walking carpet, Chewie (the name alone) is a silly character. Critics also fault Lucas' second trilogy technically. The writing, they say, has gone downhill. But SW's dialogue was famously derided by its cast members; And Lucas' direction (""faster and more intense"") has pretty much stayed consistently wooden.Now, don't get me wrong. I believe that the original trilogy holds a very special place in our culture, and our hearts. I just believe that we shouldn't elevate it to Burning Bush status. Forgetting our own rosy-colored memories of the way we felt the first time we visited the galaxy far far away, we are left with a pretty consistently fun set of trilogies. The first is no better than the second."	4.0	New Trilogy vs. Old	2006-04-08	13	7	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2L1V0OKT7FO6C	Jeremy Montano	"Without going into all the reasons, I'll just say first of all that I'm one of those people that prefers the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars Trilogy films.  They are simply more cohesive to me, and of course truer to history.  I see these as historical artifacts just as with any film, and I (almost) always prefer to see any film as it was originally released.With that said, the treatment of the theatrical versions here is...lacking, to say the least.  I knew what I was buying, and truth be told was largely replacing (or at least backing up) bootleg versions that I purchased a few years ago, since my particular copies had trouble running properly on some players.  The visual and sound quality of this release is actually about the same as those bootlegs (being that they come from the same 1993 laserdisc masters) with a major difference: the bootlegs were actually anamorphic!  The way they are now, they won't quite format correctly on a widescreen TV (or computer screen), and lose some potential resolution as well regardless of the TV or screen.  That said, these are still pretty serviceable versions, but the quality is lacking compared to many DVDs of similarly aged films.  The high-quality restoration the ""Special Edition"" versions received isn't the only thing that makes the theatrical masters look a little bad.Also lacking in this set is the extras.  None of the extensive documentaries, theatrical trailers, and other goodies from the initial Special Edition-only set are present here; only the commentary tracks from that set still survive, along with the new and fairly dubious extra of a demo for a Lego Star Wars video game (ironically, my bootleg versions also contain a number of extras, again making them seem superior).  The commentaries are pretty interesting, if a little dry, and seem to have been recorded with each person talking separately and then edited together, as they never make conversation or play off of each other.  There are some cool factoids to learn though, and they are certainly worth a listen.Ultimately, considering the price and the presence of both versions of each film, this is a pretty decent set, just not a great one.  By all rights the theatrical versions should receive at least an anamorphic transfer (not a difficult or costly thing to do by any means) and at least some minimal cleanup compared to 1993 standards, and the removal of extras (now no longer available on any DVD set still being manufactured) is just baffling.  Hopefully, in the Blu-Ray age we'll finally get a release that shows the original versions the respect they deserve and reintegrates all the extras from before.  Just don't make us buy any movies with Jar Jar in them to get the originals, and I think I'll be pretty happy."	3.0	A mixed bag	2010-01-27	4	4	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A29460NEDCMSEK	Jeremy Porter	People should realise by now that all 'full screen' edition DVDs are actually cropped version of the movies. You lost up to 2/3 of the original's composition, so what's the point of filling your square TV screen for the sake of severe cut off & badly composed image? Also, all Star Wars's original trilogy edition after the year 1997 has been altered heavily by George Lucas. The improved version of the film looks nothing but ridiculous. A lot of people might believe in what he said regarding his unhappiness about the original looks, but in my opinion, that's just a lousy excuse of his. It is obvious that he is never satisfied with the looks of the film and will keep changing it again and again, like god knows how many times some pops stars go through countless plastic surgeries because they never satisfied with their appearance. That's a mental problem.	1.0	"Eeek! What's the point of ""full screen"" version!"	2005-12-08	11	6	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1LR0H445JZ8VO	Jerry A. Pope	First the good news: The picture and sound quality is fantastic, beyond desciption.  This and the bonus disc will make it worthwhile to purchase the boxset.  All those annoying Special Edition additions come across less obtrusive when the whole thing is digitized.  Still, we don't get the originals, which is a letdown.  Those were great pieces of film making, truly lightyears ahead of its time.  Lucas and his team took puppets, plastic models, and so forth, and made a story that touched millions of people.  Lucas himself once said that special effects are there just to help you tell a story.  When he changed something that enhanced the experience, like most of his changes in Special Edition Empire-it was okay.  But when he starts having Gweedo shoot first, and changing little bits of dialogue, you have to start asking why.  There's no need for it.  The rhythem of the stories was there, and it worked.  Why does he keep messing with it?  In this boxset edition, on Empire Strikes Back, he changes Boba Fett's voice!  Again, I ask why?  Fett's voice was awesome.  He only spoke a couple of lines, but also became at least as popular as Vader.  His new voice sounds much less sinister and abrasive.  This just makes the Boba Fett we always knew to be obsolete.  And what is going on with putting Hayden into the end scene on Return of the Jedi?  Again, there's no need, not unless you also include Ewan Mcgregor along side him.  Why does he keep messing with these movies?  You had it right the first time Georgey boy!  If you want to change something, how about taking Jar Jar out of Phantom Menace?  He said it best himself, in one of the documentaries on the bonus disc.  He started as a hungry film maker, wanting nothing to do with the corporate jerks.  So he set up his own studio, and ending up becoming just another coporate jerk.  Oh cruel fate!	4.0	I Am Altering the Trilogy, Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further	2004-09-22	19	15	4

He kept borrowing my copy. I am pleased with this DVD version. It has one difference from the VHS version, when Anikin appears at the end of Jedi with Joda and ObiWan, he is the young Anikin instead of the old Anikin seen on the VHS version.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A32RA5SYUI3P0K	Jessica Neal	I really wanted to find the unaltered versions of the Star Wars trilogy for my brother's birthday. The DVDs are incredibly expensive, so I was excited when I found an affordable VHS set that was described as the theatrical version. Most Star Wars fans are not crazy about a lot of the newer editions because of the new scenes that have been added, and my brother and I are the same. I purchased this VHS set because they were described by the seller to be unaltered theatrical versions. This was not the case; though the videos didn't have all of the newer scenes that all of the new DVD sets do, there were still enough of those annoying differences to notice. While my brother watched the videos and decided that he could handle some of the newer features rather than go through the hassle of a return, neither of us was pleased with the false advertising from the seller.The videos worked great; the only problem was the dishonesty (or cluelessness) of the seller.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ASG9UDDWNO8XP	jflynn	"i saw star wars when i was seven years old.  it literally changed my life.  it was the first film that made me fall in love with movies and that romance has been burning bright since.  when i watched my first dvd i couldn't wait for the release of the trilogy on dvd.  truthfully, i figured mr. lucas would pull out all the stops.  i had imagined that the set would be a seven disc set that included the original and special edition versions of the three masterpieces, plus a disc overflowing with special features.  to find out that not only is it a four disc set, but also that even more additions have been made to the film is disappointing.  my wife and i recently had a child, a boy.  upon finding out that the trilogy would be released i was seriously stoked to know that i could share that vision and joy of ""a new hope"" with my son.  but in reality, he will be seeing a new film, and mr. lucas has stated that he will never release the original (even though there are bootlegs of the original in circulation internationally).  on the other hand though, it is star wars!  the additions do take away from the orginals, but it is still star wars.  it remains one of the greatest cinematic visions (and franchises) of cinematic history and there is nothing more thrilling than hearing the opening bars of the theme song.  so while fanatics will be disappointed it is still great to be able to see some of our best friends in this new medium.  may the force be with you, always."	2.0	disappointed... but in love	2004-09-21	11	6	5

Having seen the ""updated versions"" of the films all the new footage did was detract from the ""nostalgia"" of the originals. I wouldn't accept the new versions as a gift and I certainly wouldn't pay for them.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ACXLSYCAFQAQD	J. Fujiwara	Many of the changes made to these classic movies are unnecessary and, to some degree, take away from the magic of the Star Wars trilogy. HOWEVER, when viewed with just a modicum of objectivity, these are still three great, magical adventure movies that are a lot of fun to watch.There's been a lot of argument about who owns to Star Wars triology. Here's my 2 cents: George Lucas owns them LEGALLY, but, as soon as he released them and they were embraced by the world as part of popular culture, they became much more than just the celluloid reels shown in theatres. As is pretty obvious from the reviews posted here, a lot of other people's dreams, emotions, and beliefs got wrapped up in these films. I think that George Lucas, unfortunately, hasn't respected that, by stubbornly refusing to also release the original films. He must not believe that that is his responsibility.Moving on, after finally seeing these films on DVD, I have to say that I love them all over again. There's still a lot of magic and fun to be had with these films. It's just too bad that the fan-boys, who are proving themselves just as stubborn as George Lucas, are denying themselves the pleasure that they obviously hold in high esteem. They're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.My advice: Get over yourself and re-live the adventure of the Star Wars trilogy.	5.0	Three great movies (if you have any objectivity)	2004-09-26	10	5	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3IX3TVYSIXZNP	"J. Fulgham ""Puck"""	As many other Star Wars fans, I'm very excited about this release.  I don't mind most of the enhancements in the Special Editions of Star Wars, save one:  Greedo shooting first.Unlike the other tweaks, it actually changes one of the characters.  Lucas claims it makes Han less of a bad guy, and I agree.  Because of that, it weakens his eventual redemption at the end of the film!Also, it's ridiculous.  Greedo is sitting across the table from Han, pointing the gun in his face and pulls the trigger and misses when Han doesn't even move?I can believe (while watching a movie) that there is sound in space, that hyperspace works, that light sabers fire a beam out only a specific length, and that there is a quasi-mystical Force surrounding all living things that some people can control to do amazing things.  I cannot believe that a bounty hunter that has you covered with a gun from two feet away can fire and miss your unmoving head.If Greedo shoots first, I won't be buying this edition in protest, and that's a shame.  If Greedo doesn't shoot first, my review is 5 stars, not 4.	4.0	Does Greedo Shoot First?	2004-06-13	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3LT5J5Z3Y8IO6	J. Gates	I saw an interview with Lucas claiming that artists during the renaissance painted over their own work or added to it all the time. He used this as justification for why he adds to his original Star Wars films.Lucas doesn't seem to understand that those artists did so for time and space reasons. They didn't get a new type of paintbrush and add in a joke or two to their piece. They didn't get new types of paint and make their past creations into cliches.That's what he has done. It's a nerd with a hobby...a billion dollar hobby that he can play around with. He forgets the people who made him and why, then makes it worse by acting like they are fools.Stay away from this until someone decides to remaster the original theatrical pieces and put them out. All we are doing is feeding the billion dollar hobby. With terrible added music, effects and high-jinks.	1.0	Terrible	2013-02-02	4	3	1

Then I got to the return of the jedi. When that fuzzball thing started singing and dancing across the screen, I wanted to throw up. If George Lucas wants to turn the original star wars trilogy into musicals for children I have no problem with that. He created the movies, he has every right to do so. But for him to say, I'm ruining the star wars movies, and I'm going to force everyone to watch these abominations, is outrageous. This basically means he made it so everyone who doesn't enjoy watching pure crap, won't every buy his movies again. It's sad but, whatever, I'm sure there will be plenty of science fiction movies out there that aren't directed towards 5 year olds. I would suggest looking into those instead of this mockery of a good trilogy.	1.0	Insulting	2004-09-07	32	24	8
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A13AT470KXT9DP	J. Gilbert	I give it 3 stars because regardless of whether the altering done by George Lucas is for the better or the worse the Star Wars Trilogy is still at it's heart. That being said I still can't get over the changes done to Return of the Jedi.I can proudly say I am someone that resisted and never bought the Trilogy with the changes. The alterations done to Return of the Jedi was the primary reason. I for one can live with most of the changes to Star Wars and Empire, but Return was a debacle. Why? Two reasons.The first I miss the Ewok song at the end. It fit with the movie and the era of early '80s movies. Simple. However, the next reason is the real reason I obstained from buying the movie versions. The muppet guy that reminded me of Animal from the Muppets. As I said I never bought them so it has been a long time since I have seen them so I don't remember exactly when he was on the screen. I am sure that those familiar with them know what I am talking about. He is the muppet guy that came thrashing about right smack in the screen way up close. I saw that and my mouth hit the floor. I thought this is 'freaking ridiculous'- only I didn't say freaking. Sorry for the language, but it was that jarring to me. I thought 'what in the h*ll was Lucas thinking.' To this day I crack so hard on that  foolishness. It was quite simply retarded. I find it so inexplicable that it is beyond words.At any rate, I own the originals on Laser Disc in Widescreen THX so I am quite satisfied with them for now. I will eventually transfer them to DVD and enjoy them until Lucas and his company come to their senses and release the originals in DVD DTS/Dolby Digital surround sound and make his ardent fans happy.I would love to hear from others that also found that muppet guy to be the most obnoxious alteration done to the originals.	3.0	I still can't get over.....	2004-08-18	0	0	0

This newest release appears to offer nothing new but a trailer to Episode II.  As fans eagerly await the DVD release, Lucasfilm has ignored their wishes, but instead has insulted fans by asking them to spend even more money on VHS tapes that will be replaced when the eventual DVD release is distributed.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ADENS68K21AQM	J.Gill	I am one of those fans who loves it all. From the corny 1970's Christmas Special to the lame cop-out of Greedo shooting first in  the special edition of 'New Hope'. I can even stomach Jar Jar & Anakin in 'Phantom' and the over-dramatic dialogue in 'Clones' between Hayden and Natalie. Why? Because I simply love Star Wars!This DVD set is very nice. The documentaries alone make it worth  picking up. And at a reasonably affordable price for 4 DVD's,($44 or so) these versions will do for now until the next release of the trilogy arrives.WHAT NEXT RELEASE YOU ASK?The one with (in my opinion) two changes that would have made this first set PERFECT. (1) The original versions of all three films included. (2) Deleted scenes.Everyone knows the controversy surrounding the original versions vs. the new versions. I don't really care that much about it because I like them both (except for that Greedo thing...why, George, why?) so I won't go into that biz. However, I was really looking forward to seeing some deleted scenes from the first trilogy. They have plenty available on the dvd's of 'Phantom' and 'Clones' so I thought, naturally, they'd have them for these films as well.However, aside from a plethora of never-before-seen footage in the documentaries which was interesting in it's own, no luck.I wanted whole deleted scenes. Cutting room floor type stuff. For example, ever since I was a kid, I noticed the difference in the openings of the 'Star Wars: New Hope' script, novel and comic book to the actual theatrical release. There's a scene where Luke see's the opening battle through his electrobinoculars while on Tatooine and then races to Anchorhead to report his findings and runs into Biggs. I have this scene and others like it as stills on bubble gum cards so I know they must exsist somewhere. Not to mention the various other shots taken out of 'Empire' and 'Jedi' I've been dying to see since I was 12. Well, now I'm 33 and a little let down. But hopefull. I'd love a section of organized deleted scenes and commentary on them. That would make the 'circle complete' for this die-hard fan.Looking at how well this trilogy's release has been put together and it's incredible attention to detail, makes me almost certain that Lucas will heed the cries of the millions of fans about the original versions and one day release them on dvd too. When that day comes, maybe I'll get my deleted scenes and a PERFECT collection. Overall I love these films and look forward to 'Revenge of the Sith' next summmer.Also, don't forget to check out the hidden easter eggs in this trilogy's release at [...]for some outakes and bloopers.	4.0	Almost PERFECT....	2004-09-21	1	1	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A19L4J82QJPY7B	J. Gordon	"It's hard to believe that it's been only 30 years since the original Star Wars (now known as Star Wars- Episode IV- A New Hope) was released, thus changing the movie industry as we know it.  Sure, Jaws is considered the ""original"" summer blockbuster, but it was Star Wars which introduced the concept of a larger-than-life, over-the-top movie that wasn't based on a Biblical story, which would resonate with the public in a massive way.  Indeed, Star Wars may have been indirectly responsible for the decision to revive Star Trek, as science fiction and fantasy suddenly became a viable commercial proposition.  After letting the original trilogy languish on VHS and laserdisc for years, George Lucas finally relented, and released this DVD boxed set in 2004, which includes all 3 movies and a bonus disc.  However, these aren't exactly the movies people might remember from long ago, which I'll get to in a bit.If you're a newcomer to Star Wars, I'll try to cut to the chase about what made these movies special with the Reader's Digest version.  A young filmmaker from California, having had some modest success with his coming-of-age nostalgia flick ""American Graffiti"", decided he wanted to make a movie based on the old ""Flash Gordon"" serials.  Finding that the rights had already been taken by someone else, Lucas decided to instead make his own sci-fi/fantasy story, and forged a vast array of influences, including ""The Lord of the Rings"", Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's feudal epics, 1930s serials (such as ""Flash Gordon""), World War 2 movies, and much more, into what would become Star Wars.  The creation of the original Star Wars was plagued by problems, including financial problems, a general lack of faith by some crew members, encroaching deadlines, hostile weather, and Lucas's own near-breakdown from the strain.  Lucas's team had to literally invent new types of special effects in order to avoid a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""-type disaster.  When the movie was finally released, cast members actually did a double take, as their experience during the filming never indicated that the result would be so incredibly dynamic.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" both served to expand the scope of the Star Wars universe, and solidified the series as what Joseph Campbell would term ""modern day myth"".""A New Hope"" establishes the main characters and the primary struggles of the original trilogy, some of which already have been introduced to some degree by the subsequent prequel films.  Droids R2D2 and C3PO escape a besieged ship carrying a rebel leader, Leia Organa, and end up on the desert planet of Tattooine, while Leia is captured by the Empire's sinister Darth Vader.  When the droids are bought by Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle, Luke finds that R2D2 is carrying the plans to the Empire's gigantic and deadly space station, the Death Star.  Recruited by Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi, a former Jedi Knight and master of the mystical ""Force"", Luke and company engage the services of rogue space pilot Han Solo and his furry Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca to try to get to Alderaan.  From there, the film builds up to a climactic battle over the Death Star as our heroes get into one sticky situation after another.  There's a reason that this movie defined the ""event movie"" from that point on: off the cuff, natural delivery of dialogue, fantastic special effects, creation of a living imaginary world, and very effective, if archetyped, characters.  In Lucas' latest tinkering for , he tries to half-way amend for the ""Greedo shoots first"" gaffe of the Special Edition version, by having both Han Solo and Greedo shoot at almost the same time.  While this won't appease everyone, it's still enough to keep the scene from looking silly (as was the case with the Special Edition edit).  The crude computer effects from the Special Edition are also touched up, resulting in Jabba appearing much less like a crude, mid '90s Playstation cutscene relic.""The Empire Strikes Back"" picks up months after the original film, with Vader, who survived, obsessed with finding Luke, who along with Leia, Han, and a contingent of Rebels, is hiding on the frozen world of Hoth.  Luke, after surviving a near-death experience at the hands of a monster, is told by the spirit of Kenobi to seek the Jedi Master Yoda in order to master the Force.  Unfortunately, Vader's massive fleet has located the Rebels, and launches an attack on Hoth.  In the confusion, Han, Chewie, C3PO and Leia are chased by the Empire across space, while Luke trains under Yoda on the swamp world of Dagobah. Eventually, Luke confronts Vader in a dramatic duel, where he learns a terrible fact about their true relationship, while Han and Leia fall in love, but are tragically separated.  ""Empire"" is cited by most fans as their favorite, perhaps in part due to not only the darker tone of the movie, but also due to the fact that it truly expanded the scope of the Star Wars universe.  Most of the changes made in this movie are minor cosmetic changes, with the exception of the re-dubbing of bounty hunter Boba Fett's voice (by Temura Morrison, who played Jango Fett and the clones in the prequels), and a partial reshoot of Vader talking to the Emperor, with Ian McDiarmid being inserted in this scene with revised dialogue.""Return of the Jedi"" begins with an extended sequence detailing Luke and Leia's rescue of Han from Jabba on Tattooine.  When all is said and done, our heroes emerge victorious, but find themselves facing a much bigger conflict.  The Rebel Alliance has found that a new Death Star is being built, and that the Emperor himself is overseeing the construction.  Luke and friends are tasked with destroying the protective shield generator on the forest world of Endor, but find themselves walking into a trap, while the Rebel fleet finds itself cornered by the Empire.  In the end, Luke must confront Vader and the Emperor, and take on the role of the last Jedi.  Of all the original trilogy movies, this one suffered the most from Lucas' tinkering, in the form of the horrid ""Jedi Rocks"" musical sequence.  Incredibly, Lucas is apparently blind to how hated this ""Muppet Show"" sequence is, and has not altered it, or restored the original version of the scene.  The other major controversy in this version is the removal of Sebastian Shaw from the final shot of the ""Force ghosts"" at the end, and the insertion of Hayden Christiansen, who played Anakin Skywalker in the prequels.  This change is nowhere near as unforgiveable as keeping ""Jedi Rocks"", which came this close to making the movie unwatchable.  While the film itself is the weakest of the three, with Harrison Ford sometimes pretty much phoning in his performance, ""Jedi"" still ends on a positive note, and wraps up the whole saga nicely, if a bit abruptly.All changes aside, the video quality is pretty good, although you can sometimes see blatant matte effect squares around TIE fighters in ""A New Hope"".  Lucasfilm was meticulous about removing dirt and age effects from the films as much as possible.  In terms of extras, the bonus disc includes a number of short features, and a definitive Star Wars documentary titled ""Empire of Dreams"".  The commentary tracks for the movies are entertaining and pretty informative, being certainly more dynamic and insightful than much of the commentary for the prequels.  The audio is also pretty good, although the actual sound quality in ""A New Hope"" is markedly duller and more muffled than in any of the other Star Wars movies (either an unfortunate byproduct of the original masters degrading, or of the equipment used circa 1977).  The simple truth is that, unless you are someone who dislikes any kind of speculative fiction/fantasy movies, you must have this in your collection.  I should note that Lucasfilm re-released the Original Trilogy  in 2006 in a collector's format, containing both the current versions and the ""pre-Special Edition"" versions of the movies.  However, this is more costly, and the ""original unaltered"" versions of the movies were not properly cleaned up or adapted for the DVD format, so for the less hardcore fans, you'll be fine with the 2004 boxed set."	5.0	"The ""Not Quite So"" Original Trilogy Finally Hits DVD"	2007-08-16	6	6	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWOZ0CZODX9PQ	j	"Some would argue that Star Wars is good no matter what.  That, despite the changes and upgrades, Star Wars is a classic.  While this is true, I think there's a lot to be said for *leaving* classics the way they were made famous.  It would be sacrilege to touch a movie like The Wizard of Oz this far down the road.  And would your grandmother's secret recipe for your favourite blueberry pie be the same if she threw in some new ingredients to surprise you?Here's the skinny: to date, there have be 3 incarnations of the Star Wars Trilogy.  Some of us complain because we've seen and fallen in love with the originals and don't NEED modern technologies to ""upgrade"" the films just to fit them into ""today's Hollywood"".  Every film on DVD these days seems to have Special Editions and Ultimate Editions, featuring various version of each film.  I think it's only fair that what is arguably the most famous movie franchise in history give their devoted fans the option of seeing what they fell in love with.  I'm 24... so while I didn't SEE the original in the theatre, I grew up with them.  I have them on VHS and though I was petitioning for the DVD all these years, I think I will just keep watching the VHS versions.  George Lucas is being stubborn for no reason.Maybe I'm biased.  I am not a fan of the new episodes -- mostly because I know Hayden Christensen and find that his entrance into the saga makes it difficult for me to ""escape"" into that alternate universe that movies suck us into.  Mostly, it's about betraying your art.  A few years back, another famous movie was altered.  They took ""E.T."" and revamped it, digitally removed the shotguns police men were holding and replaced them with flashlights.  Now, tell me how that's the same movie with the same intensity?  A group of kids come racing to a barricade, worried their precious alien friend if going to be taken away from them... and there... at the barricade... flashlights???  I'd rather remember E.T. how I saw it as a child.  Intense... frightening... not dumbed down and sugar-coated.What's more, some additions make no sense.  Gredo's hand over the table instead of under?  Anakin's ghost appearing as a young man instead of the older man he IS when he is killed.  Why do the other ghosts appear the same age they were when they died if he doesn't?Point being: the original trilogy was untouchable.  It was comforting... like an old friend.  There was never any reason to play around with it and keep updating it, except to please a younger, hipper audience.  That's called ""selling out"".Today's audiences are interested in eyecandy.  So I suppose this release has a purpose and that's okay.  But what about the older generation who've been waiting for this for nealy 30 years??  Star Wars -- the original versions, as is -- will always be my favourite.  But I'd rather pretend Lucas never got the chance to put it on DVD.  Do yourself a favour -- buy it on VHS."	5.0	Lucas Sold Out	2004-09-21	27	18	9

Hink ""joker253"""	I had this item flagged on Amazon before Christmas thinking that this was the Original - Unaltered Pre 1997 Special Edition Versions of the Original Trilogy.  I was sure it was not the &#34;Special Editions&#34; because it didn't say that in the item description online or in the stores.  My wife purchased this item for me for a Christmas present because I told her it was what I wanted and that it was the unaltered Original Trilogy.  Needless to say, I was wrong.  These versions are not the Original Theatrical Releases but are instead the Special Editions and, yes, they are beautifully done.  The picture is perfect, the sound is excellent but these are not the originals.  Since there really are no Remastered Original Trilogy versions on DVD or Blu-Ray and probably never will be, I will watch these versions and be happy with them.  I'm finally ok with it.  Jabba makes an appearance in Star Wars, Greedo shoots first, Hayden Christensen's ghost appears at the end of The Return of the Jedi, etc.  You wore me down George.  May the Force be with George Lucas!

Weather you like the changes or not really isn't worth discussing but the soundtrack has been totally hosed. You can tell when a new scene comes on because noone bothered to make the sound levels the same so much for THX. Seriously George hire somebody to deal with the details. If you want to destroy fond memories of peoples childhood at least have the class to do a good job of it.

This movie is great, but DVD is the only way to view it. Widescreen, with crisp DTS or Dolby Digital sound (TIE fighters zooming overhead, Sweeet!!)

At the time it was the premiere version of the films.The set contains all 3 original films in mostly unaltered condition (before George Lucas started playing with them) plus a couple of frames of film from one of the prints (35 mm print) and the hardcover book  ""The Creative Impulse"" by George Lucas.The picture quality is superb, only bested by the Blu Ray collection, but the Blu Ray's have been heavily modified by Mr. Lucas.They are packaged in a sturdy box and have no known defects.We've all seen these movies a zillion times so I won't bother to revisit plot, I will only say that if you have a working laser disc player this set it a must. Although the value hasn't increased over the years, when laser disc becomes a faint memory and landfills are littered with discs, it should command an astronomical price since the is the last time these motion pictures were released before George's tinkering."	5.0	$250 masterpiece	2012-10-27	1	0	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A661JXONTDKCK	Jimdaqguy	I'm not quite the purist that many reviewers on this site have shown themselves to be. In fact, for the most part, I actually enjoy many of the revisions that they made to the special edition of the original Star Wars. I just don't quite understand why you would rather see the Vaseline smudge underneath the land cruiser--and hey, the snowspeeder isn't translucent anymore. And who doesn't laugh at the beefed up audio of the storm trooper whacking his head in the background of the control room shot?Be that as it may, it remains pretty clear that as soon as Lucas got his hands on modern special effects, his creativity and production value plummeted dramatically. That's why I won't be buying episodes 1-3.But I almost bought this special edition set anyway. What stopped me? You threw reminders of your horrible movies into my classic movies. I do not want to see Jar Jar, I do not want to see Hayden Christensen. And a young Hayden Christensen at that. And even if it wasn't Hayden... old Yoda, old Obi Wan, and young Anikan?? It doesn't even make sense. And messing with the actor under the helmet to make him look more like Hayden? He's old and disfigured--does he really have to look anything like him in the first place? If Lucas would just remove Hayden and Jar Jar from the special edition of episodes 4-6 (and the whole Han vs. Greedo debacle), I would buy it.	2.0	Almost had me... but...	2011-04-28	5	3	2

But no one can ignore the fact that GL has issues. He sincerely believes that the prequels are as good as the original films, and that anyone who says otherwise is just a crazed super-fan. He didn't write the dialogue for the original trilogy, right? Now that we've seen the prequels, we know why--he sucks at writing dialogue. But he doesn't believe anyone that tells him so! The guy has become such a moviemaking legend that he thinks he can do anything and that people will love it no matter what it is--and based on people writing about how they own every one of the twenty versions of the original trilogy that have been released is proof that he's right. I had no idea until reading the reviews that he had changed the ending of Return of the Jedi yet again to insert Hayden Christensen in?! I don't mind some new scenes and all, that's cool--but sticking whineyboy in somewhere he does not belong just to support his self-delusions about the prequels being as good as the original trilogy ever was is sacriledge. Sorry--Hayden was okay for the prequels, but good grief man, get a clue. We didn't need him to make the trilogy good before, and adding him now is pathetic. If your prequels need tie-ins that badly, maybe it's because they were poorly written in the first place? Adding in Hayden is equivalent to the White House taking a big kickback to put a giant Pepsi can in the statue of Liberty's hand. It's in such poor taste as to be not only clearly a pathetic attempt to strengthen the weak prequels by tying them in to something that actually IS good, and so tacky and in such bad taste as to be disgusting. Unfortunately George is so full of himself we can all write whatever we want and he will never bother with any of it--since after all, the only opinion worth listening to is that of the GREAT George Lucas. The rest of us are just commoners, what do we know? This, boys and girls, is called fame going to ones' head. I don't know if I want to buy these or not, anymore. Shame, too-they would have made a nice birthday present. But fear not, purists--I'm willing to put money on the fact that once we've all gone out and bought this version, an 'Original' verison will be released so we can all go out and buy it again. It's not like it would be the first time George and company have used that kind of marketing to make suckers out of all of us. Just wait a few years and then you can pick from the 20 different DVD versions Mr. Lucas will have released by then.	3.0	It's about darn time--but blind faith in new films is sad...	2004-07-28	18	10	8

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AYS05FEGASUC	Jim Mitchell	"It seems like once every decade some from of entertainment comes along that just speaks to me on all levels.  It captures my interest and I want to know everything about it and experience it again and again.  These days it's the music of Bruce Springsteen.  The book ""Lonesome Dove"" did that.  For most of my childhood, it was Star Wars.  I've never completely lost interest in the movies, but that interest in the original Star Wars trilogy was greatly diminished by the inferior (Phantom Menace) and wretched (Attack of the Clones) prequels.  The inconsistencies, the overemphasis on bad special effects, and the overall poor writing and acting in the two newest movies really tarnished my memories of the originals.  Some of that was justified, as the weakness of the prequels made the flaws of the originals all the more evident.  But how could I have resisted watching on DVD what were once my alltime favorite movies, especially when my own children were aware that they were about to be released and were expressing the same interest that I had shown when I was just a little older than they are now, back in 1977?  I couldn't resist that, and I'm glad that I didn't.  Despite their vastly sub par prequels, these movies are as wonderful as I remember them, and seeing them in this format on a low-end widescreen TV with a moderately decent surround sound system has actually been more enjoyable than I could have imagined.  And let's face it- like a lot of people who grew up in the 70s and 80s, I know every second of dialogue, sound effects and music in these movies.  I could recite them in my sleep.  I'm not sure I'm proud to admit that, but it's the truth.  You don't get that way by disliking a movie.  I got that way because at one point, these films were so good and so entertaining that you wanted to see them over and over again.  Yeah, the responsibilities of adulthood take away some of that magic.  Some of it.  But not all of it...Everything that was wonderful about the original Star Wars movies remains so.  There are so many unforgettable sounds and images, some of them major, some of them tiny:  the stark white of the rebel cruiser, the glowing eyes and gibberish of the Jawas, the hiss of Vader's breath, Luke first igniting his lightsbaer and that imitable hum, the otherworldly weirdness upon first entering the Cantina, Chewbacca's grunts and growls, the corridors of the Death Star, the murky water in the trash compactor, Luke and Leia swinging across the chasm, Ben Kenobi disappearing upon being struck down by Vader, those awesome gun turret chairs on the Millenium Falcon, the orange flight uniforms of the X-Wing pilots, the explosion of the Death Star, the blue ice of Hoth, the lumbering bass of the AT-ATs, Yoda raising Luke's X-Wing, the danger of the asteroids hurtling by the Falcon, those bounty hunters like Bossk and IG-88, the beauty of Cloud City, the hellish glow of the carbon freezing chamber,""I know."", the thump of carbonite encased Han Solo landing on the ground,  the clash of light sabers between Luke and Vader, Princess Leia's devastation as Boba Fett narrowly escapes with Han, Vader's terrible revelation on the gantry after Luke looses his hand, the rebel fleet gathered around the nebula, the first glimpse of Jabba, Luke's somersault over the Sarlacc pit, the arrival of the Emperor, the speeder bikes, the lightening from the Emperor's hands, Vader's final act of goodness, the victory fireworks over Endor, and those ghosts smiling at Luke at the end.  And there's that wonderful, glorious music that underscores the whole thing- that's another whole review by itself that I won't get into here.  The list goes on and on and on, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Those images are indelible in our imagination, and will be with us for the rest of our lives.  Never mind the Ewoks and the dumb looking aliens in Jabba's court and the illogical physics- there's so much good in these movies that the flaws are easily overlooked.  It's only a movie, but for a brief two hours, it's much, much more than that.Lucas's changes range from needed to unacceptable.  I don't have a problem with updating the special effects, although as the prequels reveal, CGI is really no match for detailed models, props, sets and costumes.  Those discrepancies are especially apparent with the new-found clarity that DVD allows.  But they don't distract from the film nearly as much as they do in the prequels (have I mentioned that I don't much care for those?).  The addition of Jabba is unnecessary, and while a bit better than in the 1997 version, still embarrassing.  Replacing the original ghost of Anakin with Hayden Christensen is the change that I found to be the most offensive.  I understand the logic behind it, but I think it's terribly disrespectful to remove a longstanding actor (who is now deceased) who has long been identified with that role.  No matter that the role is minor- Lucas should have considered that the timeline and the choice of actors didn't match up with the original movies when casting Anakin for the prequels rather than undoing his sloppiness later.  It's an ominous sign and an indication of what's wrong with his current style of filmmaking that Lucas values technology over an individual performance.  But overall, these changes don't distract from the movies- they are basically as you remember them.  Since we're not going to convince Lucas of the evil of his ways, I'd rather have the DVDs with the changes than to not have them at all.  I know, I know- more money in this pockets that just reinforces his misguided notions.  Anyway...The extras?  Haven't watched the main documentary yet, but it sounds good.  I enjoyed the trailers and TV spots- talk about bringing back memories.  The ""preview"" for Episode III is intriguing but doesn't reveal much.  The video game advertisements are worthless, and won't help this set from looking dated in a few years.  I'd have liked to have had deleted scenes, an isolated score, and a few more things, but overall, not a shabby set of extras.  Besides, we're buying this for the movies themselves, and these things are just icing on the cake.Video and sound are fantastic, although these movies are all over 20 years old and won't compare to modern films that were made with DVDs in mind.  Some odd mixes for the score in Ep. IV, with some of my favorite bits of music being faded out at very inopportune times.  Lucasfilm claims that this was intentional, but they're pretty good at following their boss's lead of revising history, so I don't trust them.  But again, overall very spectacular use of Dolby 5.1 and widescreen.  (And for the love of God, people, buy the widescreen versions, even if you don't have a widescreen TV.  You just don't know what you're missing in a fullscreen format!)If you loved Star Wars back then or now, go buy these DVDs.  That's what it boils down to- if you want Star Wars on DVD, this is how you're going to get them.  That's not a bad thing.  You can complain about the changes and the poor quality of the prequels all you want.  I certainly do.  But that doesn't diminish how truly wonderful these movies are, even with the relatively minor changes made to them over the years.  Nothing can replicate the first time you saw them, but seeing them on DVD comes pretty close.  Enjoy them with your kids, watch them alone, whatever.  But there's no diminishing the fact that for millions of people, many of us now on the near side of age 40, these are simply the greatest movies of all time.

We all know what made Star Wars work. George Lucas was a young,up & coming  film maker with a very cool vision of something he knew none of us had ever seen before. special effects were not yet capable to handle the level of his own visions, so what does he do? He invents those effects!!! He puts together a company that produces the most technologicly advanced, never before seen special effects to date. And guess what? They worked! They worked to perfection! The first time all of us(the world I mean)saw our first showing of Star Wars we were all blown away! Am I right? It not only forever changed the way films were made,it was like...finally I knew what I wanted to do with my life...Special effects!!!  I had no idea what I was watching up there, I only knew that there was all of this really cool stuff on the screen and I was in love! I coulden't take it all in at once!I was still finding new stuff after many many showings. It was like being a new born baby when everything in the world is brand new. It was the first time in history that multible showings were going to be a must for everyone. And George Lucas did it all for less than ten million dollars.(that's unheard of today) That was another reason it was so great, they all(Lucasfilm LTD.) had to actully work to be creative and inventive! The new editions of Star Wars,Empire,and Return of the Jedi suffer from the exact same things that make Phantom and clones barfable. George Lucas dosen't know when to put the brushes down. There's just way too much crap on the screen at one time! Mr Lucas? If you do dicide to finally make episodes VII,VIII & IX in the future, will you please do your fans a huge favor?.... Listen to us, were trying to set you straight! Do yourself a favor and get rid of all the yes men you have kept so close by your side for all these years, they're killing you!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2CJSVREXONVST	"Jimmy ""jimmyrockfl"""	To all the crybabies who can't get their original untouched version of Star Wars on dvd: Too bad!  Star Wars fans are notoriously fickle about the way any Star Wars merchandise be handled, whether it be the books, video games, etc.I remember first watching Star Wars back in the late 80's (I was born in '84) and how I instantly fell in love with the universe.  I'd watch the film on VHS regularly until they just wore out.  When the 20th anniversary special editions came out in 1997 with additional scenes and minor touch ups, I was surprised just as much as anyone else.  Unlike anyone else, I welcomed the scenes.  Okay - some were a little corny.  For example the Greedo scene was just downright terrible and Luke's scream in The Empire Strikes Back was laughable.  Thankfully these were fixed up in the DVD editions; you can actually stomach the Greedo scene now.The new touch ups and additional scenes were not intended to scam anyone.  Unlike most director's cuts, the new scenes really do enhance the film experience.  Lucas always intended to have the Han/Jaba confrontation in A New Hope; he always intended for a more spectacular end celebration on Return of the Jedi.  His only reason for not having those scenes in the original releases were because he simply ran out of money and time.  Therefore, I respect Lucas' decision to change whatever he felt necessary to change - afterall, are these not his films?  If Lucas wanted to do further additions to the movie featuring the cast digitally modified as clowns, then so be it.If you want the originals, they're still available on VHS.  If you want to live the old memories of originals, it's still on VHS.  If you want ugly, unrestored, low-quality sound entertainment, oh my - it's still on VHS!  I highly doubt anyone at LucasFilm is going to waste their time and money restoring the originals to DVD.But for the rest of us who have moved on to the 21st century, the new DVDs are wonderfully done.  The pictures are cleaned and polished.  In many cases, they look far more crisp than the films produced today.  The dolby 5.1 surround is a nice addition too.  I can finally hear the engines and blasters roaring all around me.  It does make the difference from the mono VHS versions...but then again, we'll just leave that to the folks who want to reminisce of the old days.	5.0	Boohoo!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3VGXYYEBWSATM	"Jimmy The Cat ""deathmasterx2"""	"Star Wars, in my opinion the greatest movie saga ever, on DVD is a must buy. The changed scenes and lines are true, but do they really change the story? I believe these altered parts make the movie somewhat better, when watching it from the TWO trilogies perspective. Seeing Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) at the end of Return Of The Jedi, makes it more noticeable and important, when you have episode 2 and 3 just out. Changed lines and (if you havent noticed) new the sith lord/emperor are done to make episode 1, 2, and 3 more connected, and similar to the original trilogy.Now I love the original Star Wars, and would own those tapes if i could, but technology has changed through these 27-28 years. Of course you have the Dolby 5.1 surround sound, and the color it so much better. Just look at C3PO. The sound has been MODIFIED, not changed, just to sound better through your speakers.And possibly the main reason to buy this set (main would be if you dont own Star Wars already), is the bonus feature disc, which has a 2 and a half hour documentary through the ups and downs of George Lucas and the making of the original Star Wars trilogy. There is also some sub-documentaries about the lightsaber, characters, and how Star Wars changed the movie industry. A true collector feature is the tv spots, commercials, and teasers of each Star Wars movie, which is fun to see, because its before Star Wars changed the world. And if you're a video game fan, you get a tight demo of Star Wars battlefront for xbox, and the ""making-of"" of Star Wars episode 3 game.Now i dont expect a lot of ppl agreeing with me, but think of the newer generation of fans, and the ones to come. This dvd set is better than just hearing about it. If Lucas left it alone, he would of definately got crap from Fox and the ""original"" star wars fans, for wanting to milk the original Star Wars for every cent its worth."	5.0	Its still Star Wars	2005-06-21	0	0	0

However, I think both versions of the films should be released and just not the Special Editions. I loved the original version of Return of the Jedi and the Special Edition takes the darkness mytery out of the Jabber the Hut scene. I mean the scene with creatures perforrning there is now turned into annoying cgi musical number. It's just goofy and doesn't belong in a scene that is meant to be dark and mysterious.  Well Lucas obviously didn't think it was meant to stay that way. The new score at the end of the Return of the Jedi as well, I think is really bad and I miss the original score. Lucas is too much into effects and todays technology. Mean look at the prequels, if he put more time into the scripts and less into the visuals, the movies might compare with the original movies. Anyway I think the original movies were fine before the special editions. Ok the Jabber the hut and Han Solo scene that was added to the original in entertaning. Some other changes like the ones to Return of the Jedi are really bad though. I heard rumors that Lucas actually wants to make Special Special Editions now but I think he hacked his beloved trilogy to bits enough. I'm still gonna buy these dvd's, don't get me wrong but the original versions should be there as well. If anything needs to be hacked up to be made better.....it should be the prequels.	5.0	It's about time.....but	2004-03-31	2	1	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3HTY0VY4MGDZ4	"JLS ""amotion"""	"I honestly don't know what to rate this collection.  On one hand I want to give it a five star rating.  I, like many others, grew up with Star Wars and have been waiting for the original trilogy to appear on DVD.  On the other hand, I am quite saddened by many of the changes.  To sum it up, I am rather conflicted...So I will just list the good and bad and let you be the judge.THE GOOD:Well, the picture quality is superb.  I was completely blown away by how well they remastered these films.  They look like they were made yesterday.  Also, the sound is absolutely stunning.  If you have a nice surround sound system and a big television and watch any of the 3 with the lights off, you could quite easily be fooled into thinking that you were in a state-of-the-art theatre (I tried it out on a smaller television with a mono speaker and it still sounds good so don't worry if you don't have a fancy set-up).  Also there is a decent commentary track with Lucas and others (including Carrie Fischer) talking about the movies.  It is kind of fun to listen to and informative.THE BAD:Frankly, after the picture and sound quality, I was extremely dissapointed.  This was supposed the be the DEFINITIVE DVD set, but unfortunately it isn't.  The special features aren't really that great.  There have been so many news shows, made-for-tv-specials, and special effects programs on television, you would think that they would have included more of it on the fourth disc.  Instead, it is just some mediocre documentary footage.The worst thing about this collection though is that the ""original"" original trilogy was not included.  I remember on the Abyss and T2 DVDs, there were 2 or 3 versions of each film...on each DVD.  I kind of feel jipped.  They could have put the original, the first Special Edition, and now the Definitive versions all on the same DVD for each film, but didn't.  I also feel that it is false advertising to promote these discs as just Star Wars when it is yet another special edition.  This kind of leads me to believe that the Lucas camp will eventually release the ""original"" original trilogy to milk the consumer of even more money instead of just including all version into this set like most other sets do.Now I know that most people are complaining about the original, unmodified versions not being availabe.  Then everyone else is complaining about the PEOPLE complaining about how the original, unmodified versions are not available.  All that I have to say is that we have lost too many original films through the years.  Look at Metropolis.  It has been chopped and edited to peices, and we are still trying to peice it back together into its original form.  The same goes for many films for yesteryear.  I have a feeling that the same thing will happen with Star Wars eventually.  The VHS copies are wearing out.  The original celluloid is wearing out.  If these versions are all that we have in the future then film historians will be trying to obtain the Laserdisc versions for prosterity. It would be much better if they unmodified originals were in full circulation also.I  honestly don't have a problem with Lucas screwing with his own films (I don't like the changes, but he does have the right).  I do have a problem with not releasing the original versions though.  I would have loved to compare the old with the new.In conclusion, everyone reading this probably already knows what Star Wars is all about.  Everyone already knows that changes have been made.  So you now have to ask yourself...Do you feel like spending 40+ dollars for a highly modified version of Star Wars that looks and sounds good but is lacking in special features?If you are into Star Wars for the big booms and flashy visuals, get this.  If you want the unmodified original trilogy, go sign one of the online petitions that are in circulation.I give this one 2.5 stars.  Even though the unmodified originals aren't included (and they should have been for prosterity's sake) and the special features are lacking (they could relase a DVD set of JUST special features) it is still Star Wars with an ultra-clear pictures and excellent sound and it kicks *** even with all of the CGI added....it just doesn't kick it as hard."	2.0	2.5 stars	2004-09-22	18	14	4

MAY ""Music Addict"""	Amazon, will you PLEASE stop being lazy and heaping in the old DVD reviews with the (yet to be released!) blu-ray reviews?!!! VERY confusing and has people thinking we will get the original (and superior) cuts of the trilogy when in fact that's not the case. Creates needless confusion and would be easy for you to change...... To others who also find this irritating I advise letting Amazon know - if enough of us complain perhaps they'll finally get around to addressing this problem.Since I have to give a rating, I'll give it a 3. I adore the original films but despise the constant OCD tinkering that Lucas has done to them since 1997. If the film (as he said in his interviews in 1997) is now finally finished, why keep changing it? I resent films being treated like bits of software and 'upgraded' at regular intervals (thereby - I assume - meaning the old(er) versions are now obsolete!). Lucas has proved he doesn't quality control his films either or can't be bothered to make an effort for his audiences - if he did he would have gotten the look of the CGI Jabba correct in the 1997 version (not to mention Yoda in The Phantom Menace!), and not had to redo it for the 2004 DVDs. Ditto the third attempt at getting the Greedo scene correct. If he's such a genius/perfectionist film-maker he would have gotten those right when he had the chance to fix them in 1997. And if he wasn't happy with some of the 1997 effects he was certainly happy to let us pay to watch them in the cinemas again, and to own them on VHS and laserdisc for many years...George, just COMPLETE these films already and then LEAVE THEM ALONE!!! Leave Star Wars alone - in my humble opinion it's been run into the ground over the past decade and horribly cheapened. Move on - do something new! And allow ALL cuts to be available on bluray so the paying consumer has the CHOICE of which version to watch - it would get rid of all these tiresome fanboy arguments overnight! If Spielberg can do this with E.T. and Close Encounters, or Sir Ridley Scott with Blade Runner there is ZERO reason why you cannot also offer this too. By not allowing this you make a mockery of your stance on film preservation not to mention those whose hard work was digitally replaced.....	3.0	Amazon - please sort out your reviews for the products actually LISTED!	2011-06-28	15	12	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	"In reviewing these DVD's, covering the plot strikes me as an exercise in the absurd.  If you don't already know it, you're not going to be buying these DVD's.  Instead, I am going to focus my review on two points of comparison that are particularly relevant.  The first is the comparison of these ""Special Edition"" versions of ""Star Wars"" to the original films; what's better, what's worse, etc.  The second point of comparison is to the ""Extended Editions"" of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  These DVD sets represent the gold standard for excellence in a DVD release, and for any film of ""Star Wars"" reputation to be considered successful, it must compare favorably to these sets.First off, calling these films special editions is something of a misnomer; George Lucas has been emphatic that going forward they are the only editions.  Fans will not have the option of buying the original versions on DVD, so asking whether or not these editions really are special is a critical question.  The answer, unfortunately, is yes and no.  The enhanced special effects and new scenes are a mixed bag, that generally stand well on their own, but which sometimes detract from the film as a whole.""A New Hope"" benefits the most from the changes, largely because it was the most primitive film to begin with.  CGI has been used to great effect to make the spaceport of Mos Eisley look like a bustling metropolis, and an additional scene with Jabba the Hutt has been improved upon since the original 1997 release.  Moreover, the spaceships have a much better look than the original models.  Unfortunately, all of this window dressing causes a problem which plagues the other two films: the addition of 2004 CGI to the films looks great until it is bumped up against 1970's and `80's special effects.  Since Lucas didn't replace everything, the pieces he didn't replace look shabby by comparison.  For example, in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the AT-AT's look significantly worse, not because they were changed any, but because everything else looks better.There were also a lot of lost opportunities to improve background elements through the use of CGI.  For example, the interior of the Death Star, and most of the larger ships, feature control panels that consist of randomly flashing lights and big blank pieces of plastic with almost no displays.  It would have been relatively simple to clean these up to the point where they actually look like they perform some sort of function.  In a similar vein, the briefing for the attack on the Death Star in ""A New Hope"" still features the same ridiculous Atari style graphic, while the same briefing in ""Return of the Jedi"" features a hologram.  It would have been relatively simple to update the former in order to bring some internal consistency to the story, but it was completely overlooked.Don't get me wrong, the CGI additions look great, and they undeniably fix visual problems with the originals.  However, making only partial fixes has created a movie that feels oddly disjointed and that can be visually comical at times.As for the second comparison, to the ""Lord of the Rings"" Extended Editions, I have to begin with a caveat: I fully understand that Peter Jackson shot his movies with the understanding of the potentials of the DVD format, an understanding Lucas couldn't have possibly had.  Moreover, Jackson deliberately shot mountains of background information for the sole purpose of releasing it on DVD, and again, Lucas wouldn't have done this.  That said, I found the extras to be rather lacking.I haven't listened to the commentaries in their entirety, but what I have heard is interesting, even engaging, but rarely entirely fresh.  Though to be fair, how much new can be said about these films?  As for the fourth, bonus disc, the extra features are generally solid, but rather limited.  The excellent documentary ""Empire of Dreams"" is an interesting, if somewhat egotistical, journey through Lucas' struggle to make the films.  It stands up well as a biographical work, and has rightly been airing in a somewhat compressed form on A&E.;  However, the other extras really only amount to featurettes, none lasting more than 25 minutes.  A highlight is one dealing with the upcoming Episode III, which deals with the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.  It's not a trailer, and not even really a teaser trailer, but it does show some fighting between Obi-Wan and Anakin in front of a blue screen, and was overall a nice little feature.However, there was nothing of any substance about the sets, the wardrobe, the weapons, the ships or the races of Star Wars, and in this regard, this set compares very poorly to Jackson's films.  While Lucas may not have the documentary footage Jackson had, he has twenty-seven years of tightly controlled Star Wars mythos to draw upon, and the opportunities for special features are virtually limitless.  Unfortunately, Lucas chose not to give his fans any.To be fair, these movies look and sound great; in particular they appear as if they were shot yesterday.  Ultimately though, for arguably the most popular films ever made, I found this set lacking, and frankly, there's no excuse for it.  Lucas could have named his price for these discs, and people would have paid it, and I can only assume that the flaws I have outlined will someday be rectified in a ""Super Special Edition"", and that speaks to a greed that demeans what these films mean to so many people.  I have no problem with Lucas tinkering with his films, they are his after all, but failing to do so comprehensively is a glaring oversight at best, and insulting to his fans at worst.Buy these movies because they look and sound great, and because they are still a ton of fun to watch, but don't expect anything special from this latest and greatest edition.Jake Mohlman"	3.0	Nice -- but could have been a whole lot more	2004-09-22	15	12	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A109FLT2P9JEFD	"Joan Loewen ""Joan"""	"MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!I am a 16-year old Star Warrior, and still living under the empire that is my parents, so I was amazed when my dad came home with the trilogy on DVD in hand (although, now that I think about it, that seems kinda' stupid, since Dad is a bigger sci-fi fanatic than I am). I immediately slipped in ""IV - A New Hope"", and now that I have seen the DVD's, and watched the Bonus Features, I'm ready to pass judgment.First of all, I have to give George a lot of credit. Despite what almost everyone else says about the ""new and improved"" Star Wars: Special Editions, and the fact that George did not give us the option of watching the original films, I have to say that I enjoy the Special Editions MORE than the original films. Yes, maybe the infamous ""Greedo Shoots First"" scene was poorly edited, and yes, the Jabba the Hutt in ""A New Hope"" did look like crap. But the fact is, if you have already watched ""Empire of Dreams"", then you know that George Lucas did not feel as if his films were finished back in 1983, because technology had not caught up to his vision at the time. And now that it has, George should be allowed to make the changes he wants until he feels that the films have caught up to his original vision. After all, they are his movies. And now that I am done ranting, on to the reviews of the movies themselves.In the years since 1997 and 2004, George has made even more changes to his movies, not only to bring his vision closer, but also to go with continuity from the soon-to-be Prequel Trilogy. Here is my review of the changes made.---------EPISODE IV - A New HopeChange 1: STILL THERE, BUT IMPROVEDAs you all know, when the Special Editions came out, the most infamous change that was made was that in the confrontation between Greedo and Han Solo in the cantina, Greedo shot first, missed, and THEN got fried. As I said above, the scene WAS poorly edited, and it appears that George has listened to the thousands of screaming fans out there, and changed it. The scene has now been changed so that it looks like Greedo and Han both shot at nearly the same time, and Han's entire body now moves to avoid Greedo's blast, so that it no longer looks like Greedo was an incredibly horrible shot.OVERALL RATING: B-Change 2: HOW JABBA GOT HIS LOOK BACKAnother infamous addition to the Special Editions was that a new scene was added in which Jabba and Han are talking about Han's debt at Docking Bay 94. Let's face it. In the original Special Editions, Jabba looked like a piece of crap. George has also noticed this, apparently, and changed Jabba's look so that he looks more like his model in ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"". This is a great change, as Jabba now looks a lot better, and his actions with Han look much smoother. But the scene is still a little boring, as most of the information from the Greedo scene is repeated.OVERALL RATING: CChange 3: FANTASY OVERHAULIn the scene with Obi-Wan sneaking behind the power station, and shutting off the tractor beam, if you look very closely, you will see that the English print on the station has been changed to the writing of the Star Wars Universe, Aurabesh. This is a great change, as it brings more fantasy to the movie. The onlyreason that I don't give this a perfect rating is because somepeople may have a hard time reading it.OVERALL RATING: AOther changes include longer hallways, and (strangely enough) ""creative decisions"" that make the sound fluctuate at times (which ain't good).---------EPISODE V - The Empire Strikes BackChange 1: PALPATINE'S GOT A BRAND NEW LOOKIn the scene where Vader is communicating through hologram with Emperor Palpatine, the actor who played Palpatine has been changed to Ian McDiarmid, the actor who plays him in ROTJ and the prequels. The dialog has also been slightly changed so that it appears that Vader never figured out that Luke was his son. I like the new actor, but I'm not a big fan of the dialog. It just doesn't seem right that Vader uses Luke's last name before this scene, and never figures out that they are related. Apparently though, this will be explained in Episode III, so I'll just have to wait and see how George explains it.OVERALL RATING (FOR NOW): BChange 2: THE PREQUEL VOICE CHANGEThe voice actor for Boba Fett in this movie has been replaced by Temuera Morrison, the actor who played Jango Fett and the Clone Troopers in ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"". This is another good change, as it makes sense that an unaltered clone of Jango should sound exactly like him in adulthood.OVERALL RATING: A+Change 3: NO MORE WUSSY!The most infamous change in ESB was that when Luke fell down the huge catwalk room after Vader revealed the shocking truth, a scream was added. This was really bad, as it didn't make Luke's fall seem like suicide at all. Fortunately, this has been removed, and the scene is as it should be once more.OVERALL RATING: A+Other changes include bloopers that have been corrected.---------EPISODE VI - Return of the JediChange 1: SIGNS OF THE PASTWhen Luke takes off Vader's mask at the end of the movie, the man under the mask has been changed slightly. His eye color has been changed, and his eyebrows are now gone. This makes sense, as someone who fell into a volcano wouldn't have eyebrows anyway.OVERALL RATING: AChange 2: ""WESA IN THE MOVIE!""When the Special Editions came out, the ending celebration and music was replaced by a first shot of several planets celebrating the fall of Palpatine, including Coruscant, Tatooine, and Cloud City. The music was also changed from the Ewok theme, ""Yub-Nub"", to another song composed by John Williams with no words. Now, in this new DVD edition, a new planet has been added to the celebration: Naboo. And, if you listen closely, you can hear a certain Gungan yelling, ""Wesa free!"" Ring any bells? I like this change, as it shows what happened to Naboo after the prequels.OVERALL RATING: AChange 3: SPIRITS ANEWThe most noticeable change in the movie is at the very end, during the celebration, where it is seen that Sebastin Shaw, the man who played Anakin Skywalker's spirit, was replaced digitally by Hayden Christensen, the man who played Anakin in Episode II and III. George explains that the reason that he changed this is that when a ghost appears, he or she appears as his or her true self, and that is Hayden, after all. All in all, good change, George.OVERALL RATING: A+---------In spite of all these changes, it's still Star Wars, and it always will be, no matter what else is done to it in the future. So all of you fans out there who have been griping to no end about George's changes, try to consider things from his point of view. Maybe you'll change your mind. And maybe you won't. I'm not here to make you change your opinion."	5.0	A DIfferent Kind of Trilogy	2004-10-21	24	19	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A6P626LOA1XR9	"Joe Danger ""Joe Danger"""	"I am 34 years old, I saw Star Wars 37 times during the summer of 1977, and I was 6/7 at the time.  I stood in line 5 hours the Saturday Empire came out.  I had a Revenge of the Jedi poster that I ordered from the Star Wars fan club. (YES, it was a REVENGE of the Jedi poster, not Return, REVENGE.  God, I wish I still had that, cha-ching) I had just about every action figure, ship and play set Mattel came out with. (Both the large and small Snaggletooth)  I still have most of the action figures, worn as they are.  Like for so many others my age, the original Star Wars Trilogy is a deeply moving experience and one that brings me back to my childhood whenever I see it.  I still have the first VHS set of the movies that came out, and have just about worn them out watching them so many times.  I have every reason to be a purist, and rue the day Lucas came out with the special editions.  But you know what, I don't.  27 years later, I don't remember every minor detail of the movie, just the feelings of wonder and awe I had.  The VHS versions I have watched over the last decades were faded and grainy.  Poor sound and special effects errors had eroded my childish enthusiasm.  But now, the greatest movie trilogy ever has come to DVD, and I am 7 all over again.The picture transfer is amazing, and every scene (1 or 2 exceptions) is clear and bright.  A lot of work went into transferring the images from the original negatives.  The colors are awesome, and all the smudges and dust that were there are gone.  All the effects errors (Rancor Pit blue screen edge, Ben and Darth fighting with non-glowing light sabers) have been fixed.  My suspension of disbelief is back, I get lost in the films again.  The DVD's really show off the lost art of matte painting.  If you don't believe me, just look at the Cloud City exteriors on the Empire disk.  Try to match that with CG.  These films never looked so good.  Anyone who says they remember exactly how they looked in the theater all those years ago is either wrong, or processes a photographic memory.The sound is fantastic, although I will agree that sometimes the score and effects overwhelm the dialogue.  Home theater is the only way to go with these films, you need to FEEL the explosions (crank up the sub-woofer) and hear the ships speed across the sound field. (Lightsabers make the coolest sound)  I like the changes in dialogue, especially the re-dubbing of Boba Fett.  The commentaries are a bit light, and Hamill and Ford are really missed, but Lucas does make interesting comments about the changes he's made.  (Why no Hamill and Ford, ask them.)The extras are a little weak, and the centerpiece documentary was on A&E; just last week.  I would have liked to see some deleted scenes, but how many times can you watch the grainy, cut up Luke/Biggs conversation from Star Wars?  If you even know about it, you probably have the Star Wars: Behind the Magic CD-Rom just like me.  Watch it there.  Ask yourself, do you buy a DVD for the movie or the extras?  There is a reason they are called ""Bonus Features"".Thus ends my review.  Short I know, but for these films, I think a movie review is a waste of time.  Who hasn't seen the Star Wars Trilogy?  I will now delve into my thoughts on the debate raging over Lucas' changes.  If you're not interested, read no further.It is my firm belief that the Star Wars films are 100% the property of their creator, George Lucas.  Let me say that again.  The Star Wars films BELONG TO GEORGE LUCAS!  Don't give me that ""they belong to the fans"" crud, you and I did not write, produce, nor direct any of these movies.  We did not invest any time, money, heart or soul into their creation.  We watched them, that's it.  George is the artist, and the movies are his works.  If he says these are the films he wanted to make in the first place, that's good enough for me.  If you are someone who thinks there should be no changes, and moans for the original 1977 theatrical version, that's your right.  Here is what you do, DON'T BUY THE DVD.  Take a stand.  If you are so set against the Special Editions and the changes made, then pull out your old VHS copies, and watch them in all their grainy, pan & scan, mono sound glory.  As for me, I'll be laying back with some popcorn, gazing at the beautiful digital picture and listening to TIE Fighters and X-Wings zip from left to right.  Trust me; I'll be transported back to a time when my biggest concern was fixing the flat tire on my bicycle.This whole ""debate"" reminds me of the Saturday Night Live hosted by William Shatner.  There is a sketch where Shatner plays himself at a Star Trek convention, and is asked what the combination to Kirk's safe was.  Shatner responds to a Spock Eared John Lovitz, ""What are you, 35?  Have you ever kissed a girl?""  Let it go people, there are more important things to worry about than whether or not a Jedi screams during a death dive from a Cloud City catwalk.  I mean, how can you have a meaningful debate when the phrase ""Cloud City catwalk"" is part of the conversation?"	5.0	Stop Moaning & revel in the beauty of a galaxy far, far away	2004-09-21	25	13	12

While they are sub-standard in this digital age of restoration, they aren't further down the road of bastardized revisionism.  Yes, Lucas can do as he pleases, too bad he doesn't realize all that earned wealth comes at the price of whatever cinematic soul he ever had.

I cannot believe that he would completely change & re-do the films that made him so completely rich...& made so many people happy.  If he wants to release these new ""& improved"" versions along with the originals that would be one thing.  But, to change the originals so that they almost don't even appear to be the same movies is a tragedy.  I WILL NOT buy these DVDs & I refuse to watch the next film when it comes out.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3FJPBSK6NUA5U	Joey Buchan	"I grew up with these movies.  I remember being 6 years old and standing in line opening weekend to see the original Star Wars.  To this day I can remember the excitement and hoopla the first film created.  I, and my friends, helped make George Lucas a very rich man by going to see these movies multiple times and buying just about anything and everything we could get our hands on that had Star Wars on it.When the original versions of the films were released on VHS back in 1989 (I think) I purchased them and to this day I still have the occasional marathon where I will sit up all night and watch them back to back.  I know there are some people who aren't Star Wars fans who might think this is a little nutty, but as I said, I grew up with these films and they hold a VERY special place in my heart.When the special editions of these films were released a few years ago I didn't go to see them.  I had no reason to.  I didn't particularly have anything against them, people update and make older versions of films ""better"" all the time...but the original versions of the film are generally still available.  Same thing goes for when the SE versions were released on video.  I never purchased them, nor have I even seen them.When the Phantom Menace was released I again stood in line to be able to be one of the very first people to see it.  I was in the theatre at Midnight with 100s of other fans and nearly started crying when ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..."" came onto the screen.  Unfortunately, by the end of the movie (actually, about 5 minutes into the movie), I was nearly in tears again because the thing was so god-awful bad.  Actually, the movie really wasn't THAT bad...if it had just been released as a movie itself and there had been no originals, I think it would have been ok.  But, seeing as though it was supposed to be the prequel to the originals and had so much to live up to, I (as well as just about anyone) thought it was vastly inferior to the originals.  Same thing goes for ""Attack of the Clones"".  Just horrible.  I never purchased either film because although I'm a huge fan and felt somewhat ""obligated"" togo see them, I didn't enjoy them...and only saw each one once or twice.I've been waiting for years to get the original movies on DVD.  When I heard some months ago they were to be released I could barely contain myself.  Now, I'm learning that only the SE versions will be available and to make matters worse again...they have been tampered with AGAIN.  So...they look even LESS like the originals do.Another film I grew up with was ET.  I waited years to get it on DVD and when I did I wasn't disappointed.  It had a newer ""cleaner"" version which is great to watch, but Steven Spielburg knew his fans and he also gave them what they really wanted...the original film...the film they grew up with.  It's not that difficult to put two versions of a movie on DVD...it's done all the time.It seems as though George Lucas doesn't care what his fans think.  He doesn't care that many of us gave up entire weeks of allowances to buy toys, costumes, books, etc. which all added to his wealth.  By all accounts he's an extraordinarily greedy man, which is proven in the fact that he plans to release them yet AGAIN in three years...still, not in the original format.  Just another ploy to get our money...again.I won't be buying this set of DVDs.  I won't be going to see the latest installment of the series when it comes out.  I am officially boycotting anything and everything this man touches.  I'll take my money and go buy another copy of the original releases on VHS on Ebay and hang onto it for when my copies finally die.Maybe one day Mr. Lucas will come to his senses and release the originals.  When he does I'll be the very first in line to buy two copies."	1.0	One star - only because I can't choose zero stars	2004-03-31	8	7	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1UTCISDQPKPVL	John Beimheim	"Oddly enough (considering the title I've chosen) I am not going to write a scathing ""review"" of something I've yet to see. Instead I'm going to praise the genius behind the original idea that became Star Wars.There is just something about that 1977 movie that's just indescribable. It's as though it was concieved with superior style and substance. One wonders where the talent that characterized this seminal work of fiction has gone.When I make such a comment I'm not considering the remarkable achivements in visual imagery that characterize the new Star Wars movies - in my view they are unparalleled. What I'm refering to is the genius that gave us a timeless tale of a struggle between good and evil - which is to be released for the first time in DVD format.To me it's almost as if the original Star Wars was based on something else other than the story Lucas is trying to peddle now. It wouldn't surprise me to discover that some unsung writer created a magnum opus about war in heaven, to be portrayed in a revolutionary narrative style, only to have it pilfered by Francis Ford Coppella and handed to his protege George Lucas in 1973. Hollywood has always been exploitative of true sources of talent and frequently writer directors come unstuck when those wells dry up (e.g. The Matrix sequels). Please forgive me Mr. Lucas if I misjudge the situation.Thus there is a discontinuity in the quality of the story, in addition to the fact that the Star Wars Saga is basically being told through the antichrist eyes of a rebellious faction Lucas has wrongly named Jedi (beloved of God). You guessed it. The Emeperor is supposed to be the analaog of God, Anakin (the chosen one, born of the midiclorians) is supposed to be Jesus and I'm sure you can work the rest out for yourself (considering Luke is named Luke).Nevertheless, these movies make for a unique and exciting series of adventures that retain the merits of the original vision behind them, regardless of any clumsy tinkering that may take place and especially when you comprehend what they are (and were) actually supposed to mean. At least then you can understand why the prequels seem tacked on to the originals.In any event, watching these movies in French or Spanish could be a useful way for those who know the lines to pick up a new language."	5.0	Wannabe Emperor Has No Clothes?	2004-08-19	9	0	9

No matter what he does to his films they will still be the greatest movies of all time. I know people say this a lot but it's true: they are his movies and he can do what ever he wants with them.I'm so sorry for the fans that feel betrayed by Lucas because he made changes that please him (the only person that matters by the way). Why don't you all go gather up some money and make a movie that you wont complain about so you don't have to make the rest of the worlds ears bleed with your uninformed whining?Everyone who writes a review saying that he shouldn't have changed his original work is a hypocrite. How many of you can honestly say that you've never been a little disappointed with something you have done and wanted to change it? George Lucas just has the power to go back and change the things he feels he couldn't get across in the originals. All of the things he's changing are the things that he originally wanted in the films; he just didn't have the money or technology to put them in.To all those people who still think Lucas is Satan for changing his vision on what he thinks Star Wars should be I have only pity for you. You can't even enjoy something that has changed the entire film world for its brilliance. To everyone else I hope you enjoy the Star Wars trilogy when it comes out on Sept. 21. It should prove to be the highlight of anyone's DVD collection!	5.0	A God Among Mortals	2004-09-12	15	2	13

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A10ODC971MDHV8	John Farr	"The genius of Lucas's epic space-action saga is the way he draws on sources both popular (Flash Gordon, Westerns, comic serials of the 1940s) and refined (Kurosawa films) to create a universally endearing fantasy of unrivalled thrills, unexpected twists of fate, and plenty of hearty humor--not to mention spectacular chase scenes. The franchise is still going, but the first three films--tracing the exploits of the ragtag rebels in their quest to topple Vader's Empire--remain the best. Harrison Ford, as a roguish mercenary piloting a beat-up ship, steals nearly every scene he's in, especially playing off Fisher's feisty princess.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3Q52FZE0LFZ8Q	John Feider	This review is especially aimed at those who are whining about George Lucas and how he ruined the three classic Star Wars films.  Who cares if Lucas changed a few things in the film so long as it doesn't ruin the actual content and storyline in the film.  Sure, you get a few CGI scenes here and there, but honestly move on already with how Lucas destroyed a classic.  I'd probably buy the original versions if they came out on DVD, however, it isn't going to happen.  Nit picking over the details they changed in the film is ridiculous and seriously do those things really matter in the big scheme of the film trilogy?  When you saw the film when you were a child the impression it left on your memory is more positive than seeing it as an adult because everything is cool when you're a kid.  The trilogy should be in any sci-fi geek's collection and the scores by John Williams will still be considered classics decades from now.  Star Wars was one of the most defining films in the sci-fi business and it has all the components that make up a great movie.  If you don't like watching the extra features then skip out on getting the Bonus Disc which will save you a couple of bucks.	5.0	all your bases belong to us	2006-04-01	11	4	7

Star Wars remains one of my all time favorite movies and I've owned the movies on multiple formats including VHS. I currently own the both the ""raping of my childhood"" edition, but more importantly, I own the laser disc ripped version Lucas released with the Collector's Edition which came out a few years ago.The laser disc ripped version will be the version I show my children, and I would love to be able to show them that version in the most pristine quality possible. That's why I'm joining my voice to George Lucas, to give us back our childhood, and release the version that so impacted us growing up.There is a market for the version that doesn't include the shoddy ""Han jerking his head"" at the last second, and I will purchase Star Wars, yet again, if that becomes a reality.After watching Star Wars in HD on SPIKE, I really want a HD version of Star Wars... but I want the option of having MY version of Star Wars, not what currently exists. The Star Trek: Original Series Blu-Ray did something clever, where they have both the original version and the enhanced version of the episode available, allowing the viewer the option to choose which version they want to watch.I won't be buying the Star Wars Prequels on Blu-Ray, I only own one on DVD (and I think that was a gift), so unless the original theatrical version is released on Blu-Ray, the Collector Edition DVDs will have been the last version of Star Wars I buy. In other words... release the theatrical version on Blu-Ray, and you get my money, don't and I keep my money. Sale lost!"	5.0	Release the theatrical version and make gobs of money	2009-08-16	22	16	6

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3CBJZBXXSRWXC	John	"I am tired of all the outcries over this boxset, so I'm going to give you all a bit of insight to what went on behind the curtain.First of all, let me explain why Lucas released this set. Demand was very high, and DVDs were going to be phased out in the near future. He wanted to please the fans, and give them something to tide over with until the BD/HD-DVD set hits stores in 2007.Long story short, we had a lot to do and a very short period of time to do it in. Most of our resources were busy with Episode III (both the release and the DVD for the film). We were strained to begin with. Add putting the entire star wars trilogy on DVD with only a little bit over a year to restore and master it, and you have a race against time.We would have liked to re-color the lightsabers, re-color Jabba, spend more time on the audio/picture, and everything else we wanted to do, but WE HAD NO TIME TO DO IT.In addition, we only had time to work on one version of the film. We had to choose: the originals, or the special editions. Lucas chose the SE. Lucas didn't want to shell out the millions, and divert time and resources to them when they would be released in 2007.Yes everyone, the originals are coming to BD/HD-DVD. Seeing all this moaning and groaning makes us wonder if anything will please you guys. The film team is curious if this High-Def set will fill you with joy, or make you all whine further. Why? Because we are already having to make alterations to the film. The restoration is screwing with some key elements, so we are having to go back and manually insert some things. For example, the lightsabers. Yes, they will look like the ones from Episodes I-III, because the High-Def conversion/restoration downgraded the appearence. We had to fix it, and couldn't give it that ""70's look"" so we were forced to make the sabers look like the more modern ones seen in the prequels.I'm sorry for all the pain this DVD set has caused some of you. Had we had more time, things would have been different. Now we have a substantial amount of time to work with. With this additional production time, we can now include everything (such as deleted scenes) in the BD/HD-DVD set that we could not include here. You will have your original films (HAN SHOOTS FIRST) and a new directors cut (with more changes) in High Def very soon. Please be patient with us. We hope you can enjoy this set while we work to blow you away with our finished product in 2007. Thank You.EDIT: It seems some people are paying no attention to my words, but thats ok...Continue to make an outcry over the set if you want. It will convince Lucas further that the originals will sell (he feels everyone will prefer the DX over the originals). So go ahead and bash us if you want, but try to be somewhat respectful about it?

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1V1Z6DN289T3V	"John ""jjad10"""	Okay, I waited a day to make my purchase to let the craziness settle down at the stores. Oh, I should tell you that I'm a fan but not an insane one.  I've enjoyed growing up watching the orignials many times but have never dressed up or anything!  So, I've been reading everyone's reviews the past couple of days and decided it's time for me to chime in.  I can't make a decision about all the changes and I'm not here to take sides on that issue.  I agree partly with Lucas and partly with the fans who love the originals, though if I had to choose I lean towards the die hards & the original films.With that said let's talk about the audio and video.  How can you really complain about the picture quality?  I have a widesceen tv and surround sound, there is no comparison when it comes to the picture quality, it's ten times better than vhs and looks great!!!  I can't compare to laser, have never seen them on laser.  Now the audio is where I have my beef.  Is it me or is the first half of A New Hope almost unwatchable because of the audio?  The Background noise heard off an on is terrible.  It's not even!!!  It sounds like two recordings, one for the voices and another for the sound effects.  My sound was just going in and out, static, fuzz, hissing, call it what you will.  It was like cuts or splices in the audio.  I tried ignoring it but couldn't.  It was happening during all the dialoge, like someone was flipping a switch off and on when someone started talking and then finished.  Either I'm nuts and overly critical or it's a horrible transfer.  I'm assuming other fans out there are aware of this.  Are You???  I had to take away two stars because it was so annoying.  I thought it should have been better with the technology Lucas has.Okay, stepping off my soap box I will still watch the movies a million more times but will still be asking myself how the audio transfer went so wrong in A New Hope.  Maybe that is the only way they could clean it up?  Didn't work for me...Audio seemed to be better in ESB and ROTJ...  Star Wars Rules!!!

I waited months to check on reviews on the 2011 release in Blu-Ray.  All I can say is the video and DTS6.1 audio are fantastic for the Episodes IV-VI (the earlier movies).  The one-star reviews/complaints that 'original' theatrical release is not shown, and 'some' video editing has ruined the movie to me is purely an edited review.. not the QUALITY of the VIDEO or AUDIO.  The 'old' SWs IV-VI are like watching brand-new movies.  Maybe the complainers do not have proper Video or Audio (7.1 surround) to enjoy the new benefits of the Blu-Ray release ??  Just love it.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A27GICWXIP39ZO	John Lange	My complaint regarding this boxed set has nothing to do with the picture quality, sound, or remastered special effects in the films. It has to do with the harsh reality that the Star Wars films that I loved growing up have been forever changed, and I am afraid that most of these changes are not for the better. To begin, the 1997 special edition scene in A New Hope where Han Solo steps on Jabba's tail is out of place and it does not belong in the film. Perhaps a 3-year old would find a scene like this to be funny, but it does not play well for mature audiences.The scene in the Empire Strikes Back with the new Palpatine is rather strange because the pacing of the acting seems to be off (why does the Emperor pause in between his lines?) It appears that Mr. Lucas has sacrificed the charm of his Star Wars movies for special effects. As a purist who likes to see movies PRESERVED for future generations instead of tampered with, I feel that Mr. Lucas has done a disservice to Star Wars fans and movie fans alike. As the buffoon Jar Jar Binks would say...Mesa thinks these changes bombad!	1.0	Release the Original Trilogy	2004-09-28	24	18	6

George Lucas's masterpieces of epic adventure in space. The first movie ""A New Hope"" is tells the tale of a farmboy named Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamil) whom joins up with two robots, a furry wookie and captain Han Solo ( Harrison Ford) to rescue the lovely princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher) then try to defeat ""Darth Vader"" ( played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). The second chapter "" Empire Strikes Back"" is after the events of ""A New Hope"" with Luke being trained by master jedi Yoda ( voiced by Frank Oz) to become a Jedi and discovers a dark secret that has been kept hidden from him for years. And finally ""Return of the Jedi"", deals with the final battle against the empire as Luke dukes it out with Vader and The Emperor in a effort to save the universe.Three classic sci-fi/fantasy movies that made it into the greatest trilogy on film next to ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", they grossed millions of dollars at the box-office, excellent acting, inspiring special effects and good plotlines help this movie, nothing can't beat the holy trilogy of movies.The DVD has finally came after years of waiting! i can say the DVD boxset totally delivers all the great stuff like remastered picture & digital sound qualities, commentaries by George Lucas and a great 4th disc with great extras like featurettes, a look into the year's anticipated ""Episode III"", Publicity and more.These movies definitely belong in every DVD collection and is a satisfying DVD boxset for everyone to have."	5.0	The holy grail of Sci-fi trilogies finally on DVD!!!!	2005-01-13	10	6	4

The box set includes on VHS each of the first three films--Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi--in the Special Edition versions re-released in theaters for the twentieth anniversary of this cultural phenomenon.Like or hate the updated effects and footage of the Special Edition films, the cleaned-up video and sound quality resultant from the restoration of the original prints are a necessity for the true Star Wars fan.  Older versions of the films watched side-by-side pale in comparison, and televised, pan &amp; scan versions cannot compare to the theatrical widescreen presentation.  Simply watch for the Sand People scene in Star Wars when Luke says, &quot;I can see one of them now,&quot; to see WHY films should always be presented in their original aspect ratios!Finally, what true Star Wars fanatic can be without even a single edition of the films?

George Lucas takes you on the fantastic adventure in a galaxy far far away. Fans on this epic trilogy will not be dissapointed with this DVD. It is kind of too bad that Lucas added more special effects and scenes to make it better. There is no need to put the new special effects in it. The special effects of the 70's and 80's movies is what made the films so great. By adding those scenes he is taking all the magic away from the original film.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A108LFCFKM4SL	Johnny Mordal	The stupidest argument I hear from pro-special edition people is that George Lucas couldn't stand the originals and wanted to make them how he wanted them, that's just rediculous, many artists hate what is generally considered their best work, Anthony Burgess never understood why people liked 'A Clockwork Orange' so much, he made it just to pay the bills, Tchaikovsky despised 'The Nutcracker Suite', and John Lennon generally disliked everything the Beatles did. I originally didn't mind the special editions, I didn't like them, but I figured I didn't have to watch them, I still had the old ones, but now George Lucas is trying to rewrite history and make it seem like the originals never existed. When you release a work of art, it then belongs to the public, when you take it away, it's like stealing, George Lucas stole the Star Wars Trilogy from us.	1.0	George Lucas is an ignorant man.	2004-09-18	4	3	1

The Cgi looked Cgi. The miniatures in Original Trilogy looked more real. The acting in the prequels were horrible. *sigh* I don't know, the only thing I did liked in the Prequels were the Jedi/Sith sword fights scenes. That's about it.. I love the Original Trilogy and I consider them to be Masterpieces.George, I know the Original Trilogy was not your true vision and of course you own the rights and they're your movies but once you change something that is not cool, not cool at all!! Those are the films we grew up with, which are the Originals Films. Don't do no more changes, PLEASE! They are fine the way they are. NO MORE CGI!!!Learn from Ridley Scott, who is releasing like 4 different versions of 'Blade Runner'. Now that's how you do business! That's how you give the public to choose from. The public needs...WANTS the old classics back! PLEASE, release the Original Star Wars in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound!! I want to make you rich! Don't you want that?!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AYUFQY3XG4ZBR	"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man"""	"...and he must be stopped.It's bad enough that ""Star Wars Episodes I & II"" have been absolute torture to sit through (I own them, for reasons even today I can't quite fathom) with lukewarm storylines, pathetic character development (despite unquestionably talented actors filling the important roles), and dialogue that would embarrass even the English dubbers of Hong Kong kung fu movies to put onto film (friends SWEAR that the only way to watch the newer ""Star Wars"" movies is with one of the foreign dialogue tracks on and English subtitles).That subsequent efforts 20 years hence the initial effort are substandard is unfortunate but perhaps not entirely unsuspected; how many times can lightning strike in the same place?  Even by the time of ""Return Of The Jedi"" it could be said that inspiration was running thin.But these are the films that dared to show the broadest extention of what was possible; they reinvented the genre of science fiction-based action/fantasy and set the standard so high that only George Lucas himself was capable of reaching it.  Seeing the original ""Star Wars"" for the first time in 1977 had to be akin to listening to Jimi Hendrix for the first time in 1967; it was a threshold moment that clearly defined ""before"" and ""after"" along the timeline of both film and popular culture.Which is why it is so VERY important that the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy be presented in the way it initially appeared in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  Re-issuing the films in 1997 on the 20th anniversary of the release of the original film with the restoration of some scenes cut from the original theatrical productions and with digitally enhanced and altered scenes that were unable to be realized for whatever reason (technological limitations, mostly) was a questionable enough decision, but it proved to be a stroke of marketing genius and introduced an entire new generation of fans to the series (such as my stepson, now 11 years old himself).And now with the (LONG overdue) release of the series on DVD, Lucasfilm and/or 20th Century Fox had the opportunity to do the right thing...which was obviously to release both the original theatrical cuts of the movies as well as the 1997 (and 2004) versions that Lucas so selfishly indulged himself with reproducing regardless of the wishes of the fans of the movies, the fans whose love and devotion to his work put him exactly in the position to so wantonly disregard our emotional attachment as he has done with his decision to instead release only the doctored versions of the movies, giving the experienced viewer the opportunity to compare the brilliance of the guerilla technology available from the mid-1970's through the mid-1980's and the skill by which human endeavor was able to fashion an entire universe seemingly from thin air to the soulless technology that did all it could to cover up the shortcomings of scripts in ""Episodes I & II"" and looks so blatantly artificial and out-of-place amongst the organic beauty of the first three movies.I bought the ""Trilogy"" set, of course...I would probably pay the price for ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" by itself.  The other movies to me are bonus material unto themselves, and the fourth disc is a magnificent collection of historical and anecdotal material that is a welcome addition to the set.  But...this could've been done so much better.Witness the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" set (also from 20th Century Fox) as a prime example of how this set should have been done; there were original theatre cuts AS WELL AS ""director's cuts"" of each of the four movies in the ""Alien Series"", as well as a separate bonus disc of archival material.  The asking price for the entire set is considerably higher than that of the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" set, but it is obvious that the market of Star Wars fans would pony up the money for the extra material without a second thought (the ""Alien"" series is also available on a movie-by-movie basis for those who aren't interested in owning all four movies, another concept that Lucas can't seem to grasp).In short, I am doomed to be disappointed by George Lucas and his ""director's vision"".  He has lost sight of the notion that art no longer belongs to the artist once it reaches the level that ""Star Wars"" obviously has; it belongs to everyone, and it is obvious that Lucas cares less about those who have come to love and appreciate his art than he does about his own designs; imagine if Botticelli had decided that his ""Venus"" would have looked better in a hot pink negligee and high heels...and decided to go back afterward and paint them on, never to be removed.  Lucas has effectively done that with the DVD edition of the Star Wars trlogy, and it is just an awful shame, because he could have done the right thing and made everyone happy."	3.0	George Lucas is slowly destroying the legacy of my childhood	2004-12-13	19	16	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1EW85BQIMCVN4	John Porter	Finally Star Wars is on DVD!  I was so excited to pick my copy up and while, like any geek I hate the changes, the overall viewing experience is so good that I'm happy to own this set.I'm sure you've heard of the changes that Lucas has been making to these films since the SE release in 97 and he's done more in this DVD set.  However he's also cleaned up the movies so well that they look and sound absolutely incredible.  The supplemental DVD is full of so much interesting information about Star Wars that it was worth the purchase just to get it!My biggest problem is that the way the viewer experiences the movies has changed because of the prequels.  When Darth Vader revealed that he was Luke's father, it was monumental!  However for a new generation that starts with Episode I, it will not be be as it once was.  They will already know who Luke's father is and it will completely ruin such an amazing scene.Another problem is Greedo shooting first (I know I know) but it really was a big part of who Han Solo became.  In A New Hope he was a pirate, a scoundrel, who by Return of The Jedi was a good person who cared about others.  Him shooting Greedo first showed that he didn't care for anyone except himself and that he was cavalier in his attitude about life.  Removing this pivotal moment really dilutes the way he evolved into a better person.Otherwise a great set and I'm glad we didn't have to wait until after Episode III to enjoy it.	4.0	Finally!	2004-09-30	6	2	4

A ridiculed set of DVDs, except for the outstanding Bonus Material DVD, which has been universally praised.  However, this set is not ridiculed nearly as much as the 2011 Blu Ray set of the entire six movie saga.  In this 2004 set you get regular non Blu Ray DVDs, but the picture quality is great, in my opinion.  The sound suffers in certain parts, particularly in The Empire Strikes Back, but overall it's great picture quality and good sound quality.  George Lucas made several changes to each movie.  This is controversial and has been ridiculed.  Lucas should release the original unaltered theatrical versions of all six movies some day, sooner rather than later.  Customers are getting impatient.  Lucas should give the people what they want.  I was fortunate enough to see the original Star Wars in the theater when it first came out in May of '77.  Back then the opening crawl did not have ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" in it.  Instead, it was just the background story.  The star destroyer that flew overhead that was chasing the rebel ship was so memorable, as was C3PO, R2D2, the stormtroopers, Princess Leia, and of course Darth Vader.I took off half a star due to some of the changes that I didn't care for, such as Greedo firing first in A New Hope, Jabba The Hutt appearing in A New Hope, Ben Kenobi's call to scare away the Tuskin Raiders in A New Hope, and Darth Vader exiting his shuttle in The Empire Strikes Back.  I also didn't care for some of the dialogue changes.  One change that I embrace is Ian McDiarmid's hologram image as Emperor Palpatine in The Empire Strikes Back as well as the change in dialogue.  It matches up better with how the Emperor looked in Return Of The Jedi and closes a hole in the original dialogue from 1980.  I do, however, like the original Emperor in the original 1980 movie as well, played by an uncredited woman and voiced by Clive Revill.The Bonus Material DVD is great.  There are several documentaries, including Empire Of Dreams, The Characters Of Star Wars, The Birth Of The Light Sabre, and The Legacy Of Star Wars.  Even with the three prequels being the weaker of the six movies in the saga, the Star Wars saga is easily the most popular space adventure series of all time.If you're not too picky when it comes to picture and sound quality and can handle some of the changes (mostly minor) that were done to these movies, then I recommend this DVD set if you can still get your hands on it somewhere."	5.0	4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5	2012-08-20	4	3	1

This was the first movie I saw more than once at the movies, 10 times to be exact. I couldn't get enough of it, but the more I saw it, the more flaws I noticed with the special effects. But that didn't bother me because the movie itself had a sound structure where the effects flaws could be over looked.Then it was on Cable TV, then the flaws were more prominent and annoying more than anything but still, the structure was as sound as solid as a rock.When I heard Lucas was going to digitally tweak the film I was a bit perturbed. Why would you fool with a perfect film? But it's only a movie I thought. The buzz around this new version was high and my curiosity was aroused where I had to see what he had done.Again, I was blown away. I felt that the ""special edition"" of Star Wars IV had somehow become more perfect. I felt like the 13 year old kid again seeing this masterpiece for the first time. The new effects didn't take anything away from the ""original version"" in fact it added much more.Believe it or not I wasn't much of a fan of The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi because they didn't capture the originality of the first one.

And indeed the visual and audio quality is superb - the old VHS editions just don't do the films justice.Now the real problem emerges when you start talking about Lucas's changes. First he comes out with the ""Special Editions"" in 1997. We get CGI stuff added to Mos Eisley. These effects are cheesy, and you can tell they're from '96 or '97. Although Star Wars fans grimaced, we probably could have tolerated it if Lucas had stopped there.But no - he decided to tinker his movies further with this DVD release. He gets rid of Boba Fett's awesome original voice, instead using the guy from Attack of the Clones who played Jango. He adds a ridiculous scene in Jabba's lair with some CGI weirdo. I would say this scene is worse than anything Jar Jar Binks ever did/said on screen (which is saying a lot).Even with all this stuff, SW fans STILL would probably accept the films...but then Lucas adds Christiansen at the end of Return of the Jedi. I personally don't really mind...but I don't understand it either. What difference does it make if Christiansen or Sebastian Shaw is seen at the end? Why not replace Alec Guiness with Ewan McGregor too? It just doesn't make any sense.In my mind this whole debate would go away if Lucas would just release the original versions on DVD. Then fans could choose for themselves. I think they will, someday. Lucas at first was reluctant to put even these versions on DVD, but he was forced to when people were getting them by bootleg. Same thing is going to happen with the originals. Lucas is going to cave someday and release them...maybe at the same time he releases a ""super"" set with all six episodes.Lucas has said these are his movies and he can do what he wants with them, and that's fine. But I think any more alterations to the movies will cause open revolt against Lucas :)I love the movies, and if this is the only version I can have on DVD then I guess I'll live with it."	5.0	Mixed feelings	2005-04-11	15	13	2

"Computer generated imagery looks great in lots of recent movies, but it just looks stupid inserted into 20 year old movies.Editors are supposed to piece together films so that they flow smoothly and create a seamless story.  The CGI additions to this version only remind you that you're watching a movie.  Not only that, but you are reminded that you're watching a movie that's been ""enhanced"" twice now.  It just doesn't fit together.I could understand George Lucas' desire to clean up some of the special effects from episodes 4-6.  There were always some scenes that needed work.  Tie fighters with obvious dark squares around them during the death star battle in ep. 4 and the annoying little black ""slugs"" noticable on the emperors head in ep. 6 were always annoying.  I would want to fix those too if I were George Lucas.  Unfortunately, he didn't bother fixing the glaring errors like those.  Instead, he decided to change the dialogue and voice acting, added scenes that don't belong, and exchanged good songs for stupid CGI music videos that completely destroy the integrity of the films.  (Dancing bugs singing ""Rock the Jedi"" belong in a Disney cartoon, not Return of the Jedi)  I won't even get started on my disappointment at seeing Hayden Christiansen (as Anakin) standing with Yoda and Obi Wan at the end of Ep. 6.  That's too much.I could write a too-long list of reasons to reject this version of The Star Wars Trilogy but the best one is this.

Politics? Everyone seems to think Lucas is some sort of genius, but if you look at he ideas presented in the films, you can see he took ideas from all across the map. He took from Doc Smith's Lensman books, Samurai movies, Kurosawa, followed Joseph Cambell's works to the letter. He even used ideas and dialogue from ""The Dam Busters"" a film about WWll.(Look it up!) Sequences like the trench, bombing runs at low altitude, and even some of the dialogue from that movie were almost verbatim! One pilot even says to the other  ""How many guns do you think...?""  The other responds  ""I'd say about 10 guns- some in the field and some on the tower!"" If that's not plagiarism, i don't know what is. Anyway, apart from stealing ideas from all over, he did make a wonderful movie- in 1977. The special editions are a little too much for my tastes, (I feel there are way too many CGI effects nowadays. What happened to the slight- of-hand and tricking the eye- it gave more realism. You looked at it and said- How'd they do that? Now everything is in your face and obvious.) and I do look at the original Laserdisc versions from time to time, But I did buy this because I was terminally curious. I had hoped to see some of the cut scenes form the original in the special features, particularly the Anchorhead scenes, but there are none. The 4th disc really isn't that interesting, with some of the material already having been released before. I probably won't view the documentary again. The films themselves seem a little darker than before, and the colors seem stronger. That's a plus, but you can see easily that they were all digitally enhanced. 3Po has a fuzzy halo around him in the desert scenes! Some things appear blue when they shouldn't be (The escape pod lid, etc.) The stuff that was added for this release, I'm not sure of. I don't get the Hayden image superimposed onto Sebastian Shaws' image at the end. He was redeemed as an old man, right? How come Yoda doesn't look young or Obi-Wan. I'm not trying to nit-pick, I just want an explanation why. It doesn't make sense to me. At least make Christensen look like an old man there. Will Lucas redub all of the stormtroopers' dialogue with an Australian accent once it's revealed that they are all clones of Jango Fett, too? Anyway, yes, this will make more sense if you view them 1 thru 6, and I guess it will be more seamless. With the dialogue between Vder and the Emperor changed, it presents a softer, lighter Vader than ep 4, rather than the original megalomaniac we all thought he was. In the new version of Empire, he seems to want to protect Luke from being killed. The revamped Jabba in ep4 looks more like the one from ep 1 rather than from Jedi. This seems strange because there are about 20 some odd years between ep1 and ep4 but maybe only 1 year max between ep 4 and 6. Did he change that much in 1 year where there is no change in 20 yrs? The puppet looked better anyway. Anyway I can't tell you or George Lucas what to do, so buy it if you want or don't. I don't believe the nonsense about those are his films, he can do what he wants. I don't believe that is entirely true. Once he showed them to the paying public starting in 1977, they became part of the public consciousness, and part of all our youths. Yes, they are not he same films from when I was 9 years old, and would prefer both to be released, but whatever. I'm not 9 anymore, and so what. Yes I lived and breathed Star Wars when i was ages 9 thru 12, but you know what they say- You can't go home again. Oh, well."	3.0	Too much compaining on both sides	2004-09-22	10	5	5

The picture quality was great, sound is disappointing to me, either the music & effects are too loud or dialog is too quiet.  I found myself constantly adjusting the volume.  My MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT was that this was not the item I expected.  I understood that I was ordering the Blu-Ray version of the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE and this ain't it.  This is the version Lucas ""tweaked"" by adding the extra bits that don't thrill me.  I'm keeping it, but I'm somewhat disappointed.  Thank heavens nobody messed with my copies of ""Forbidden Planet"" & ""War of the Worlds"" (1950's version- yeah, I know it doesn't really follow the book, but I'm talking about theatrical releases and OCD directors).

Mcclain ""Jon McClain"""	"Everyone seems upset about the special edition computerized effects that Lucas added to these films, but these ARE his creations, so let him do as he pleases.  Lucas is currently modifying the first film for the next ""Even More Specialer Edition"" which is coming soon in 2010, and after speaking with him directly, I am very excited about the new changes!In the upcoming release of ""A New Hope,"" Greedo will not only shoot first, but he shoots every creature in the bar scene, except Han.  Han will no longer fire his weapon, because Greedo fatally shoots himself in this version.Lucas has also decided to convert all Stormtroopers into pro-football players, and being a lifelong fan of the Houston Oilers, he has chosen their defunct uniforms as the model by which his squadron of computer goons will work with.  I feel the super-imposed uniform colors will contrast perfectly with the Empire's lifeless gray and black uniforms, as well as making the old stormtroopers' boring white outfits a thing of the past, just as Lucas had envisioned originally but was unable to do in the 70's when the Oilers refused to allow their uniforms to be ""commercialized"" in such a manner.  Bet you didn't know that, did ya?Chewbacca will be replaced by Jar Jar Binks, in a move motivated soley by the immense popularity of Jar Jar, and the fact that wookies have always been considered the least popular characters amongst true fans of the Lucas logic.  The original Chewbacca outfit has since been destroyed, so forget about looking online for this collector's item because it's gone.The Milenium Falcon has been converted to a hot air baloon, in order to lengthen the escape scene from Mos Eisley.  This was secretly Lucas's favorite moment in the series, and he has plotted to expand the run time of the scene for years.  The hot air baloon will take approximately 20 minutes to fully inflate, and an additional 15 minutes to lift off.  I personally cannot wait to see this cinematic triumph for myself!George asked me not to divulge any more information, but I'm sure you're all excited for these new changes!!

I still remember that at the end the entire audience clapped for several minutes!!!! What film have you ever seen that the entire audience clapped at the end? The only film I have seen since then that the audience clapped for was Titanic and the clapping at the showing I attended was not nearly as loud or as long as for Star Wars. This tells you a lot about this film. People seeing this film for the first time now do not get this same feeling because they have been subjected to so much high tech that it appears to be below the standards. But those that saw it when it first came out realize that it broke new ground and the special effects were wonderful and ground breaking at that time.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AUR8RZIHJBNHT	Jon Zabriskie	Dear rebel scum (or new Republic, whatever),I was watching Episode 4 (New Hope) the other day and realized how close (as usual) the good old Empire came to ending that impetuous rebellion once and for all. I think it boils down to bad planning. The example? Look no further than the climax of said New Hope: the Death Star is moving into position to attack/blow the crap out of Yavin, where the insidious Rebels are residing. But, oh! the Empire must first get the Death Star around this red planet which is blocking their shot. Wait, read that again with emphases (more than one emphasis) on 'planet' and 'blocking their shot'. Could the Empire have concocted their own demise any more efficiently? I mean come on, they have the friggin' DeathStar (tm), which is made to what? Blow up planets, not go around them. It's like asking Cris Carer to throw the ball to himself to get the touchdown, when what he should really be doing is just catching the ball and catching touchdowns.See what I'm getting at? Maybe we could've used the Death Star to blow up the red planet, therein saving time in navigating it, and then we would have a clear shot at the rebel planet. Were we saving our shots for a later time or something? I think the rebellion, though rather childlike in nature, was a pretty big deal at the time, and one of the imperial officers even informed Tarkin of the potential danger in the attack patterns of the uneducated rebel pilots. But nooooo, Lucas had to make our military leaders Arrogant and Headstrong and the Bad Guys. I mean, honestly, the movie was all believable up to this point, and guess what? The Empire gets creamed for being dumb, not because the rebels were lucky. See, if the Empire does the smart thing and blows up two planets instead of one, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. No; we would all be under the rule of Darth Vader (who we all know would have usurped the Emperor anyway, let's not kid ourselves), who by the way would also have been better off if the rebels got creamed, because then he would never have gotten in touch with his softer side when 'getting to know' his kids, who would have been destroyed with the rest of the pest-like rebels.I do like Episode V, however, as I have a starring role in it, and it ends pretty well too with us bagging Han Solo and Luke's right hand. I generally like to end the series there, as it all goes to crap in Episode VI, what with Vader switching sides, the Emperor 'falling' down a giant hole, and oh, those fuzzbucket Ewoks, who help (why?) the impotent rebels to blow up our shield generator (which is what I was so gloriously doing to the rebels' generator in Ep.V). Really, things came back to bite us rather quickly after that first Death Star, which goes to show that if there's something really important to be done (say, blow up the neanderthal rebel base on Yavin), you should have your top man, for instance, me, making the important decisions. Never you mind where I was at the time of the first DStar exploding (definitely NOT crashlanded and marooned on Yavin, for example), the point is I would have made an excellent Grand Moff, but now all I get to rule over is the kiddie pool in the backyard. It's no Death Star, but that Imperial March really carries well across freshly mown grass and the doghouse. In case you're wondering, I did not die at Balmorra, I simply survived like Gloria Gaynor, and now I 'get jiggy wit it' like Will Smith, despite losing my legs when they blew up my AT-AT at Hoth. Oh how I miss you sweet AT-AT, and how I curse you Rebellion! Long live the Empire!General Maximilian Veers	5.0	Entertaining movies, but what was my Empire thinking?	2005-12-04	9	3	6

True, George Lucas screwed with it again. True, it may be advertising Episode III a lot. But not only is this the most anticipated DVD box set ever, it is a collection of movies that are a cultural phenomenon. These movies changed history, not just movie history, but cultural history as well. And I have to say, I think they are damn fine movies. The newer ones excluded. Enjoy them for what they are because they are finally on DVD with excellent special features and can now be seen on the excellent quality of DVD format. Enjoy them for their excellent storytelling techniques and the vision and creativness that went into making them. Enjoy them for the sadness and happiness they make millions around the world feel. But do not dislike them simply because Lucas changed a little bit and it is advertising his next movie.

It's not clear at this time if we're going to get the re-released version done a few years back or a completely new re-release that we've never seen before.I really only had a few problems with the ""Special Edition"" releases:1) Greedo did NOT shoot first. OK? It was poorly edited, looked bad and made you think Han was never in any real danger.2) The Jabba scene added to Star Wars was not needed. The dialog was all repeated from the Greedo scene and Jabba, frankly, looked TERRIBLE. Nothing at all like the original from Jedi or the cleaned up version from Phantom Menace.3) The rancor scene from Jedi looked just as bad as it did back in 1983. What's the deal? You make a lot of noise about cleaning up the effects in the movies and that scene is left untouched? Come on...It's possible the DVD will fix these problems, it's possible that it won't.

When a movie star is insecure, what does he do? He gets a nose job. Now, when an actor gets a good nose job, it doesn't mean he becomes a better actor. The reverse, however, is not true. When an actor (or musician, in Michael Jackson's case) gets a bad nose job, the performance suffers because the audience is distracted. That's what has happened with the SE SW trilogy. The shoddy, pre-Jurassic Park CG ""enhancements"" are as subtle as the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man in the New York City skyline.But what's really happening here is George is intentionally trying to distract us. From what? The storytelling. His insecurities as a writer have demanded that our attention be diverted from what's really important---the characters and the plot---to the pretty CGIs. This is completely unnecessary, at least for the original three movies. The original three demonstrasted his understanding of classical mythology and his ability to retranslate them in a modern-day setting. Mythologist Joseph Campbell said that all classical stories need to be retold in each generation, and George has done that for us. Like Greek myths, SW is simple on the surface and extremely complex underneath. You can easily tell someone what Episode IV is about: a young man must save a princess and destory the enemy's stronghold. Simple, efficient, classical. Episode I and II, on the other hand, cannot be explained so easily. Where do you begin? Because George knows this, that the stories are weak, he feels that he must compensate by adding layers upon layers of make-up. Remove the make-up, and alas, it's not a pretty sight . . ."	3.0	Enhancements hide Lucas' insecurities	2004-07-11	19	11	8

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3K44QD7MBKN19	joseph mysliwy	"The way I think it is is that George Lucas felt during the 90s that he needed to do something.  Since most movies had been relying on special effects to tell their story In think George thought it would be neat to see his classic films updated with special effects.  That's where it should of stopped.  Just adding in visuals to help tell the story.  There should have been no plot changes.  The Solo/Greedo scene should of stayed the same.  IFf George would have done this scene in the original film I would have no problem with it.  But he went and let Greedo shoot first(whose shot was worse than a stormtrooper!)because he thought it wouldn't look like a cold blooded kill.  That minor change made the whole Star Wars trilogy change.  C'mon George!  If this stuff about Hayden making a CGI appearance in ROTJ DVD is true why don't you just have Luke accidently die in the Sarllac pit and have Artto and Threepio fight Darth Vader!  I think George should stop updating and let the films update themselves.  These sre movies everyone loves.  If you go and change them all the time people will eventually loose track.  Some one will ask you if you watched Star Wars and you'll say what edition.  Oh just SW SP IIV.  He'll say ""Oh, the one where Halle Berry is CGI inserted sas princess Leia.  George, these movies colud end wars someday.  Don't take that away.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A18J6KOOEFMAWX	"Joseph Satawa ""Eternally Single"""	This box set includes both the original movie releases and the new updated versions. It's great to be able to choose which one you want to watch. The only down side is the quality of the original versions. They do not fill a wide screen TV, they were recorded for the older 4:3 screens. You end up with black bars on all four sides, and the quality is not full DVD. But you have to realize they were not edited, remastered, added to or anything. You get what everyone saw in the theater. If you're looking for better quality, pop in the remastered version and enjoy some of the new features and better sound. Either way, this collection has two ways to enjoy a great movie trilogy.	5.0	Star Wars Trilogy: the Original Movies	2010-12-31	1	1	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	Like many others who have already reviewed this set, I have been a fan of Star Wars since the beginning. I remember back when we called it plain old Star Wars and not Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The earliest memory I have is going to the drive-in here in Phoenix, Arizona with my parents and seeing Star Wars. My mom says I had a grin on my face for days. We saw it many times after that. And with each sequel I was there in line waiting in the heat to see them. Star Wars is/was a big part of my childhood and I have watched the original trilogy numerous times over the years. So when it was finally announced that George Lucas was finally allowing his original trilogy to be released on DVD I was ecstatic. Finally I would be able to watch the films on my favorite format and I could sell of my numerous VHS copies. Now I admit I was a little diappointed to find that only the Special Edition versions of the films would be released. I myself prefer the original versions of the films but I somewhat understood why Lucas wanted to add to the films. I like some of the added backgrounds, the improved special effects and the better sound. What I don't appreciate is Lucas messing with scenes that we have grown to love over the years. Scenes that shaped the characters into how we knew them. I think you all know I am referring to the infamous Han and Greedo scene. Also I am not a fan of the added Jabba scene. But I still enjoy the Star Wars films and watch them faithfully. I have since sold off all of my VHS copies of the Star Wars triolgy except for one. That would be the set with the old versions of the film. I will be holding on to that set until George has a change of heart and decides to do the right thing and release the original versions of the films. But until that time I am happy to have them on DVD any way I can get them. They look great, sound great and the bonus disc included in this set has some great documentaries. Lucas really put a lot into this set and for that I am thankful. There are those out there who like to refer to fans like myself as Star Wars geeks, well I am more than happy to have that title. Because to me Star Wars is a big part of who I am and I would not deny that for anything. May the force be with you....always!!!	5.0	Glad to finally have these on DVD but now Lucas needs to release the original versions as well	2005-09-11	10	9	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ALAY1HPO37V5Q	Jos Gabriel Yez Nepote	"The fifth star that I give to this product is for the release on DVD of the Star Wars Trilogy (DVD at last! wahooo!!) but for the movies itself I'm giving four stars (but that is exactly my ranking on all releases I've seen; some pros and equally cons). Honestly, I think the people that will like this particular release will buy it and those purist that will hate it will not. All we know already Lucas' willing to change over and over this trilogy. So really it is of no surprise any change on this box set.But no worry, I think Lucas is a master of merchandising so I'm sure he will release a ORIGINAL-TRILOGY box set, a FULL STAR WARS SAGA box set and maybe an indivual episodes release (I based this teory on last decade's products on VHS: ""Original for the Last time remastered"", Special Edition, Special Edition w/ Episode I -or II?- previews). Besides, somewere in the future Lucas will be one with the force and, perhaps, the Star Wars rights will be on hands of many guys who will pay too much money for make their own additional changes for our children, grandchildren and so. There will be Star Wars for a long time yet.Of course no release will be perfect for everyone, I belive if some Original Trilogy with only remastered audio and video were avaliable, there will be, also, a few purist that could think of those remastered features as ""a destruction to the efforts and fights of those who worked so hard on a first class audio/video quallity on 1977"" or they could say something like it was a natural response of a specific idology on a specific time with specific technoogy and any change on it will represent a violation to its integrity or... well anything.My advice: Buy it if you feel it's just right with your own appretiation of the Star Wars Saga. If it is not, wait for a release that will... I'm quite positive it will happen."	5.0	Still, is the only DVD SW Trilogy avaliable	2004-10-24	0	0	0

Besides, DVD is just another format that has tended to spoil a lot of us into thinking that VHS should be gotten rid of completely.  That's bogus!  Lucas doesn't have the time right now to even THINK about the DVDs.  He wants thought put into them so he can put lotsa' great extras into them.  He doesn't want to rush them.  I applaud George Lucas to take the time to make every one of his products special and precisely thought out.  He's busy enough with making Episodes II and III as it is!

Hopefully one of them shows the version fans, historians, and critics want to see on DVD.The original theatrical releases deserve 5 stars. This one the other hand, doesn't.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1DX4HZSAUQ83H	Joshua Etarbelak	"Obviously, we are all aware that this DVD release is of the ""special edition"" movies and not the originals.  I would like to make several comments about that.First of all, one has to be puzzled by the mind of Star Wars' creator, George Lucas.  He created three movies that consistently rank among the greatest and most influential movies of all time.  The trilogy has spawned a marketing empire and set the tone for decades of science fiction films, few of which have come close to achieving what these films did starting way back in 1977.Undaunted by this extraordinary success, Mr. Lucas was apparently not satisfied with the movies, re-releasing his special editions of them in 1997 with added footage, enhanced sound, and new CGI effects.  (Rumor has it that he is re-working them again for the DVD, but time will tell if that's true or not).While we would all like to re-work things we have done in the past, Mr. Lucas actually had the luxury of doing it.  Good for him.  I'm sure writers, artists, musicians and filmmakers go through that all the time, wishing they could change something they created in their youth.  But I would like to say, on behalf of anyone who agrees with me, that the original films were really good.  They weren't perfect, but I don't care.  I like them just the way they were.Now, what is clear from reading other reviews is that fans are divided as to whether Mr. Lucas' new changes have enhanced or detracted from these classics.  I happen to the think the Star Wars special edition detracts from the original, while the two other special editions added some nice touches.Whether you like, love, or hate the special editions, what we all should agree on (with the possible exception of Mr. Lucas and those who profit from endless re-releases of these films) is that the original versions should also be made available on DVD.Let's put this in perspective.  What if the DVD releases of Casablanca or The Seven Samurai were colorized, and you couldn't get the black-and-white versions?  How about a special edition of The Godfather: Would you really want to have scenes altered in a classic like that (maybe they can make Moe Green pull out a gun and shoot first before getting shot in the eye)?  For that matter, let's just shelve all science fiction movies made before the advent of CGI until we can add new special effects.  Sound ridiculous?  It is, whether you shelve a thousand movies or just three.While alternate versions are interesting, fun to watch, and sometimes improve on the original movies, they do not necessitate burying the original movies in a vault.  George Lucas has created something that is a part of film history, something that has become a part of millions of people's lives.  Why he insists his 1997 vision is so much more evolved than his 1977 vision is inexplicable.  Let's face it: there's absolutely no reason to hold back the original movies apart from money or foolish pride.  DVD is the perfect medium to give loyal fans everything they want.  Give us both versions of these movies please."	5.0	I'd like to see the originals on DVD too, and here's why.	2004-04-09	0	0	0

I bought the original trilogy at midnight the day it came out on DVD, and watched all three movies that I love as soon as I got home.  But even though I love the entire saga, I still haven't bought the prequels, because I know that at some point, a huge set will be released that contains the 6 movies, the animated movies, and maybe even the Ewok movie, along with all the discs of supplemental material that I know they have the material for.  Yet, here is another RErelease of the trilogies, (separate of course.)  We have all been so faithful to this series from the beginning, and you know they realize that a complete SAGA collection is what we want, but they refuse to even talk about or mention it.  How many dips are they gonna take into this before people realize that as long as we buy the movies separately, they are never going to give us what we the fans want and deserve.	1.0	Where is our SAGA!?	2009-02-21	16	9	7

Back then, it just sounded like an old movie, but now, it sounds like it's just been made.  They've added bonus sceens, which I like, because it gives more meat to the story.  Vader's voice, is wonderfull, and they've redone sceens with the Emperor (my fave charactor).  All in all, this trilogy is well worth the 40 bucks I paid for it.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A24T281QR4MP0C	Joyce	You all know the story, so I won't review that here.You all know about the changes, and they're not too bad. There are only 3 irritating changes, and 2 of them last only a few seconds. The Jabba scene is the only long change, and you can just skip that chapter with your remote.For the most part, the DVD transfer of these films went extremely well. The video looks crisp and clean. The CGI is beautiful. Honestly, I must agree that this is the way these films should be made. I AM upset that Lucas isn't releasing the OT, but if he did, I'd probably watch this version more often than the other. It's beautiful.That said, there are some serious quality issues here!!!1) When the Millenium Falcon is leaving the Death Star in Episode IV, the graphics on the TIE Fighters are messed up: There are grey bounding boxes around the fighters as they fly through space in some of the scenes. It goes by too fast for most of it, but when you notice it, it is very jarring.2) The audio for speaking parts is absolutely horrid in some places. Voices change from being muffled to tinny to muffled all within one scene. This happens the most on A New Hope. It is very irritating and jarring. For the most part, it damages the movie watching experience a great deal.3) Lightsabers. While most of the lightsaber scenes look better with the new graphics, several look horrible. The saber colors are muted, or they appear colorless, etc. Very sad considering that this was supposed to be a major selling point of this release.Overall, I am pleased, but I would not pay full price for this when the price goes up. It is ok at the sale rate you can get it for now, after the release.	3.0	DVd transfer not perfect, but mostly OK.	2004-09-15	26	18	8
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1XDH30R4OVZBN	"""jozq"""	The Star Wars trilogy.. one of the most known sci-fi movies ever, are released as a enchanted VHS -edition. This Lucas's re-release ( better picture quality, better sound quality, enchanted special effects and few new scenes ) makes few questions:1) First these special editions were meant to be only teathrical, to get Star Wars back to movie screens. Why change plans and release them on VHS tape?2) Is it a good thing to mess with a classic ( because someones like the &quot;old&quot; feeling of movies, so it shares opinions: do star wars have better atmoshpere as old classics than new enchants? )I think this release is perfect. I've always loved Star Wars and always will. Producing Episode 1 sounded like a good plan first, but then when I saw it I was disappointed. Why they did everything with computer? Why characters became so flat? Why did it have so weak plot? Why Darth Maul was the only cool thing? Why Jar-Jar? So only ep 2 and 3 can save the first one. If they're gonna be as bad as ep1, I say that Lucas should have left the Star Wars subject and leave it as a classic.But buy this before watching ep1, because you'd see the &quot;dark-emotionless-computer-effects&quot; side of SW...This bears old memories back and brings heavy emotions on screen.. and the actors are GOOD!	5.0	Star Wars trilogy.. a cult classic	2000-10-15	6	1	5

Don't get me wrong, I like the new episodes, but they definitively don't do justice to the old ones, and as I told you, I am 17 years old, so ""new generation"" tastes are no reason (unless you just want money) to keep you from doing good movies, and to keep ART being and ART, not a money machine.

I am surprised it wasn't immediately reflected on the Amazon.com website, but I am sure that the details for this are forthcoming.Based on the EP 1 and 2 DVD's, I trust we can expect some real quality DVD's.  So the Five Stars is a guess right now.  It is supposed to be a four disk set with commentary, and normal DVD extras and also a &quot;most comprehensive feature-length documentary ever produced about the Star Wars saga and never-before-seen footage from the making of all three films&quot;.  I expect superior quality sound and video, like we have come to expect.  But they are older films, so we'll have to wait and see just how good they look on DVD.  And lastly, it should be the Special Edition versions, which came out in the late 90's.Sure, this is a lot of guesses right now, but the timing for a Sep release of the original trilogy lines up nicely with the May 2005 premier of the Episode 3. . .  something to watch for.	5.0	STAR WARS Trilogy available Sep 21st 2004!!!!!	2004-02-11	2	1	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3I57D687EZ95H	"JP Spielsawa ""Music and Film Afficionado"""	I admit that I was a little upset when I heard about the enhancements made to the DVDs before the release.  I realized, though, that these movies, changes or not, were my childhood and are still a big part of my life.  When I got the DVDs, I was pleased that the changes (outside of Hayden's appearence as a ghost) didn't really affect the experience.  Sure, Han still doesn't shoot first, but at least they made it a Leone-style shootout rather than the travesty that was in the Special Edition, and even though Hayden Christensen is now the ghost of Anakin Skywalker at the end of Jedi, it doesn't change how emotionally satisfying the end is.  The clarity of the video and audio, while still not perfect (rumor has it that Lucas rushed Lowry Digital to make the release date), is the most crisp the movies have ever been.  Now that they are in digital format, they can clean them up even more without worry of deterioration.I have always been a Star Wars fan since age 7, and nothing was more satisfying than actually having the original trilogy on DVD in my hands.  These were my movies, changes or not.  So what if Greedo is a bad shot, Jabba's digitized form in A New Hope still looks a little anemic, and Hayden is a ghost?  Star Wars is Star Wars, be it the original releases, the Special Editions, or the DVDs.  It will always be worth buying.  It will always be worth watching over and over again.  Without these movies, pop culture, as well as the lives of many people, would be drastically different.  Owe it to yourselves to pick this up and enjoy it for what it has always been, a culturally-significant experience and a sensory explosion.  Long live that galaxy far, far away.  May it never dissipate.	5.0	It's Star Wars, no matter what changes...	2005-09-13	0	0	0

Lucas is releasing these now, instead of after Episode 3 comes out because by then, there will be a new DVD format (BluRay) and lucas will have missed the chance to cash in a few more Hundred million dollars with the current format.  Blu Ray releases in 2006/2007.  Can't fault him though, I'd do it.EDIT:  Who knew lucas would release these at least 2 more times on the DVD format.	5.0	Great Movies	2004-09-15	9	4	5

Lucasfilm is a business, and George Lucas is all about business, not about the fans, but to sell more product. What is it the fans want? The original, unaltered trilogy but with remastered picture and sound, and special features galore, including deleted scenes. Sure, Lucasfilm could easily do this, creating a true ""ultimate edition"" - but, these flimsy re-releases still sell, so if they release the ultimate edition, especially on Blu-ray, these fans will have all they want. Lucasfilm will sell these well, but it doesn't bode well for the future. That's why they continue to sell these on DVD only, and in about five years (as another on Amazon has commented on) they will finally come to Blu-ray, but - I guarantee it - they will only be the special edition versions that the fans do not want.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AV9SRGPNOD73Z	JR Media Freak	This set is obsolete. Now you can get this same set with the second disc for each movie including the originals unedited.The overall look and feel of the Original Trilogy Special Edition DVDs is just like Episodes I, II and III on DVD in terms of the menu screens. The picture quality of the DVD is really superb.I do not like the added Jabba scene in Episode IV, which is redundant after the Greedo exchange with Han. Not too mention, the silly song at Jabba's palace with a newly added Joe Cocker looking/sounding alien in Episode VI. I have no complaints of the new special edition version of Episode V which is my favorite Star Wars movie. For example the scene in Episode V where Darth Vader talks to a holographic Emperor, the new version has the same actor playing Palpatine with his voice and image appearing to communicate with Lord Vader. The other thing that was kind of cool was the appearance of the actor (Hayden Christensen) from Episode II and III as Anakin in the final scene of Episode VI. I am sure the actor who appears originally is not happy with the spirit version of him being deleted. Plus it looks a little goofy since the man behind the mask and his voice are different only in the scene with Luke on the ramp to the shuttle where Darth Vader dies.Overall, the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is worth it for the sharp picture of the movies and just the version of Empire Strikes Back alone. The bonus disc has some neat things, but after one viewing I don't watch it anymore.But again...you can get this version of the movies along with the originals now as a second bonus disc. Those versions are more worth the money.	5.0	I love Star Wars!  But this set is now obsolete...	2005-01-05	12	3	9

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AA3UIRH39FZ7P	"J. Sheldon ""falcon710"""	The original Star Wars Trilogy is probably the most popular cinematic trilogy of all time.  With good reason, of course.  Luke and Leia Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader...these are all heroes and villans who have beem emulated since they first appeared on the screen.  But more important for our purposes now is to discuss the DVD.  First, the sound and picture quality are immensely superior to past versions on DVD.  The new digital transfer creates a picture and sound that is unsurpassed.  Star Wars has never looked or sounded this good, hands down.The extras are pretty good too.  The Empire of Dreams special was on television, but the version on the DVD is expanded.  It's the most comprehensive behind the scenes look at Star Wars out there.  The other featurettes are much shorter, but are still fun to watch.Yes, the rumors are true...Lucas did make additional changes beyond those made in the Special Edition released in 1997.  At the end of Jedi, Hayden Christiansen now appears as the ghost of Anakin Skywalker alongside Yoda and Obi-Want Kenobi.  Also, Clive Revill, the emperor from Empire Strikes Back, is replaced by Ian McDiarmid.  The conversation between him and Vader is slightly adjusted in order to tie in the prequels.  Many other changes are much more subtle...Temuera Morrison's (Jango Fett) voice is now heard for Bobba Fett and the Storm Troopers.  Digital effects are cleaned up in scenes for all three films.I know that many people objected to the changes that Lucas made the first time around and they are sure to do so again now.  Nevertheless, the trilogy is still three great films and anyone who considers themselves a fan of Star Wars must own this trilogy.  It hasthe definitive extras and version of the film.	5.0	Finally, the greatest film trilogy of all time comes to DVD	2004-10-15	14	7	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2ZLT0H2YZYBMI	jsp	I am writing about what appear to be defects in Episode IV: A New Hope.  The defects are video and audio glitches in chapter 26 and 27.  This is the scene where Governor Tarkin is about to blow up Alderaan.  It continues after the planet is destroyed when Obi Wan feels the disturbance in the force.  The video seems to pause and skip about 4 times over about 10 minutes during the two chapters above.  I returned my first copy, got a second one and the exact same glitches appeared at the exact same spots as the first one I returned.  I was wondering if anybody else noticed this, if it's a widespread defect.  I tried playing the disc on my other DVD player and the same defects were present.  Also, the audio is not very good.  Some of the dialouge is almost impossible to hear and if you raise the volume, the music is too loud.  I haven't played the other movies yet.Overall, it looks like the collection is great, but until I see the other movies, I can't say for sure.  I was going to return my second copy, but I am starting to think that the defects are widespread.  Anybody have any info on these defects?	3.0	Possible defects	2004-09-27	5	5	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AF41VDC2KK5ES	"J.S. ""road runner"""	"Seven years after the Star Wars: Special Edition came out on VHS, the original trilogy finally arrives on DVD! I can say that the transfer from the original negatives into the DVD format is nothing short of amazing! The quality of the film is practically perfect, with none of the dust, grit, and other particles you'd see from most transfers into DVD. You could almost swear the trilogy was filmed digitally, because the colors you see looks amazingly vibrant, even in scenes where there's little color. The sound quality is amazing as well, though as with what some people noticed, the only quibbles I have (mainly in ANH), is some instances the sound channeling are positioned oddly, in one instance some dialogue sounds muffled (Tarkin's line: ""You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system."", you'll see what I mean). Beyond that, those are my only quibbles sound-wise.As for the movies themselves, again, some changes were made to improve on what was added in when the Special Edition was released. In ANH, as Luke's landspeeder was entering Mos Eisley, more detail was made to the speeder and the occupants (ie: C-3P0) to make it more realistic. The Han/Greedo scene was changed somewhat to make it a much closer in shots and Han's reaction was more believable. Jabba was redone to look more like the Jabba in Episode I. The tractor beam display that Obi-Wan Kenobi shuts down was changed to ""Imperial"" writing, and finally the lightsaber blades were ""rerotoscoped"" in the Darth Vader/Obi Wan duel to be more consistent with the rest of the Star Wars movies. In ESB, the two I noticed the most was the Emperor was changed to Ian McDiarmid's portrayal, and the dialouge was changed a little. The other part was Temuera Morrison voice was put in for the small amount of dialogue (4 lines of it) that Boba Fett speaks...to be more consistent with the prequels. In ROTJ, the majority of the changes was near the end, as Sebastian Shaw (who played Anakin) doesn't have his eyebrows anymore when the mask was removed (which makes sense). Naboo is added in the celebrations, and the ""Jedi ghost"" of Hayden Christensen's Anakin replaces Sebastian Shaw's version. That last one might offend some diehard fans, but after thinking about it for a bit, it would make sense as far as continuity between the prequels and the originals are concerned.The bonus disk is a treat to see. My glaring complaint is that they didn't include deleted scenes that most fans like myself always wanted to see. In my case, I always wanted to see that Wampa attack scene in ESB (you see a smidgen of that deleted scene in the ESB trailer), but sadly, it isn't here. Despite that, I especially enjoyed seeing the ""Empire of Dreams"". I never knew how close to disaster A New Hope was from never even making the screen, and how much of an impact that movie (and the subsequent two) had made to the genre, the style of moviemaking, and visual effects for years to come. If none of the groundbreaking things never happened, hard to say if other movies that made an impact decades later (Lord of the Rings trilogy, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc.) would've turned out the way they did if it wasn't for what Skywalker Ranch, LucasArts, ILM, Pixar (yes, the same Pixar that brought about Toy Story and so on...), and THX have done to move the industry forward. And in addition, made a difference to those aspiring filmmakers that wanted to be independent from movie studios...as George Lucas is arguably the most successful independent movie filmmaker of our generation.After seeing the originals when I was a kid, it is amazing (I know, I use this line alot ;)) after nearly 30 years how much the movies look as good as they do today, and after the additions put in, how much better they now fit together with the prequels. Like or hate Lucas, he is and always will be a good storyteller. I hope that when Episode III comes out, that it will tie everything together and have that little bit of that ""character"" that the originals have, which the prequels are sorely lacking...well, Attack of the Clones was on the right track, but it still has a long way to go. At any rate, I will be looking forward to that series-tying arc May 2005. :)"	5.0	"""At last! Where have you been?"""	2004-09-27	5	3	2

The effects are better from the original Special Edition. However, ROTJ would look better if acid was on the film where the Jabba's Palace dance routine takes place. There's this ridiculous song, Animaniacs-styled animation and added actors who are clearly shot in another room. It ruins that film and one of the its best scenes far more than Yoda/Ewoks/GunGuns ever could have. It's the only added scene that blows it all and frankly, Jesus wept.The extras include one great 2 hour+ documentary (which looks like WWII propaganda for George Lucas as a great dictator) and some dull trailers and ads for game systems and ILM.On the commentary, Monotone voices repeatedly stress on each disc how things have never been done before, how it's like music, how high off coke Carrie Fisher was at the time, the inspiration and useless information like how sounds were taken from a California freeway. I lose respect when the people behind the curtain want to come out from behind it, for whatever reason.The only shot that still needs work is the Jabba's Palace scene.	3.0	Getting better... still inferior	2004-10-18	11	5	6

This is the set for anyone who wants nothing to do with the special editions that add unnecessary CGI or digitally add Jar Jar and Hayden Christiansin to ruin good movies. Bare bones original, no CGI just puppets and practical effects. Its kinda like drinking coffee black you get the full taste, add to much of anything else and it becomes milk.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"In 1977, George Lucas began crafting a series of movies that would shape the way modern cinema was made for generations to come.  That series was none other than the 'Star Wars' saga, though he began his saga in 1977, the first movie was actually the middle chapter in a 6-part story.  After the success of ""Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope"" (then it was known only as ""Star Wars""), George Lucas crafted the final 2 chapters in his epic space saga, ""Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi"".  Upon completion of 'Episode 6', George took a hiatus from the grand universe he'd created, a hiatus that would last over 25 years, and would leave fans foaming at the mouth with anticipation.  During the mid-nineties there were rumors abound that George was working on the first 3 chapters of his space saga, a rumor that was further fueled by the 1997 theatrical re-release of the original trilogy with new CGI effects and scenes added in.  Finally in 1999, the time had arrived for the unveiling of the first chapter of the 'Star Wars' saga with, ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"".  Three years later he released ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"", and in 2005 George Lucas brought his series full circle with the much acclaimed, ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"".  I have already reviewed the 3 films that comprise what is known as the prequel trilogy, and now it is time for me to finish my series of reviews based on the 'Star Wars' movies with my review of the box set of the original trilogy.  The following will be a synopsis of the basic plotline for each of the 3 films from the original trilogy, followed by the overall review of the box set.  If you are already familiar with the stories for this series, then feel free to skip the next 3 paragraphs, for those of you that may have been living under a stone for the last 25 years, continue reading the next 3 paragraphs.""Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope"" takes place approximately 16-20 years after the events of 'Episode 3'.  The galaxy is in turmoil under the iron fist rule of Emperor Palpatine and his Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader, who together are in complete control of the evil Empire.  Their are very few heroes left in the galaxy, with almost all of the Jedi exterminated during the 'Jedi Purge' that was perpetrated by Darth Vader, all that remains of the former glory of the Republic is a growing group of rebels that hope to one day bring down the evil reign of the Empire.  Assisting the Rebellion, led by an ambitious Princess from Alderaan, named Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), are an old man, who just so happens to be former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, a young farm boy from Tatooine, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and a space pirate named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookie companion, Chewbacca.  Together this rag-tag group of unlikely heroes hope to bring down the Empire's newest weapon, the planet destroying 'Death Star', and the key to this mission rests in the most unlikely of places, with that of 2 droids, C-3PO and R2-D2.""Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back"" picks up about 5 years after 'Episode 4'.  The 'Death Star' has been destroyed by Luke Skywalker, the Rebellion seemed to be on the upswing, but luck would not last forever, as the rebels have been forced to flee yet again to the ice planet of Hoth.  Luke and Han have become formidable pilots for the Rebellion, though Han and Chewie are looking to leave in order to pay off a bounty on Han's head, and Luke continues to strive to learn more about the Force, though his mentor and guide Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed at the hands of Darth Vader.  For Luke to learn what he must to become a Jedi, and assist the Rebellion in overthrowing the darkness that is ruling the galaxy, Obi-Wan appears as a 'Force Spirit' to Luke and instructs him to seek out an old Jedi Master named Yoda who has exiled himself to a swamp planet called Dagobah.  Will Luke be able to become the Jedi he is destined to be, or is it too late to hope for the galaxy?""Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi"" takes place a few months after 'Episode 5', as Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca are planning to free their captured comrade Han Solo from his Carbonite prison and from the clutches of the vile, sluggish-gangster, Jabba the Hutt.  Once freed can Han and his friends in the Rebellion manage to destroy the currently under construction 'Death Star 2' that is being personally overseen by Darth Vader and his master, Emperor Palpatine.  Will Luke become a true Jedi Knight, and lead the galaxy out of it's darkness that has bound it for so long, or will he succumb to his anger, and embrace the legacy laid out by his father, Anakin Skywalker, by becoming a Dark Jedi?  The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.The 'Star Wars' saga has been by far one of the most influential film series' ever created, and after viewing the entire 6-part saga all together, it really comes as no surprise.  With groundbreaking special effects, and leading the way from film to Digital media, the 'Star Wars' saga has paved the way for how many films are created today in this modern age of cinema.  The 'Star Wars' saga has something for everyone in the family to enjoy, from it's epic 6-part story, to it's awe-inspiring battles and space flights, with some comedy and romance thrown in for good measure.  This series is not one to be missed, and without a doubt is one of the greatest movie series' of all time!""Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope"" is rated PG for violence.""Star Wars - Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back"" is rated PG for violence.""Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi"" is rated PG for violence."	5.0	The Original Sci-Fi Masterpieces...	2005-08-25	8	3	5

There's more at stake here than artistic freedom. I'm happy for Lucas to put out the ""special editions"" as alternate versions, but he has a responsibility to preserve the originals, too.  Failing to transfer them to digital format now means that, eventually, they will be GONE FOREVER; that we will lose one of the most significant pieces of twentieth-century popular culture.  The fact that Lucas seems quite happy for this to happen is sickening.  It shows he has no real understanding of the place of his work in the public culture.  Once you do something as big and as loved as ""Star Wars"", in a very real sense it doesn't belong to you anymore.  It belongs to the culture.  It belongs to history.  What's his argument against this?  ""I want it my way.""  One would have thought that a man who has traded on a Jedi philosophy that paints ego, selfishness and the love of power as the paths to darkness would have been a little less selfish than this.  And forgive me if I can't take Lucas's claim to ""artistic integrity"" seriously - after Jar Jar, he clearly has none."	1.0	The destruction of cultural history	2004-09-20	34	20	14
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AKRZGTP9N7EFY	Justin	Thank god I have the real originals on VHS. I didn't buy this crap but I heard enough about it to know that they kept the extra stuff they put into it after they remade it in 97 and added more. That was enough for me not to get it. I don't mind them cleaning it up and making the picture look better but when you start to add stuff, its like why, it was fine the way it was. I don't know what is wrong with Lucas but he has lost it as Episode 1 and to some degree Episode 2 show. He no longer has the creative force with him. He has gotten so greedy which is why I call him Greed Lucas. I'm just going to wait till the price of VHS to DVD copyers go down then copy the moives to DVD.

I'm only giving it one star based on what Lucas added to this presentation.  If you already own the trilogy don't bother about rushing out for this one.  The added section for Star Wars Episode 2 is not worth the money.  All you get is a brief summary of information we already know about given to you by Lucas himself.  A brief interview with the actors playing Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, as well as a talk with Anthony Daniels who says how great it is to be playing C-3P0 after all these years.  The only fresh insight provided is telling us that C-3P0 will appear in a middle state where he has some of the look he will have in episode 4 but made up of spare outer parts.  If you are one of the few people that don't own the trilogy yet, by all means purchase it, is a wonderful set of movies that you wont have a chance to purchase for another 3-4 years.  But if do, and you just want a look at some episode footage rent don't spend the money again.	1.0	Star Wars is always great but not another trilogy	2000-11-09	42	29	13

Don't tell me we can't get it on the same disc, and if that is so put another disc in the pack.  I didn't mind the special edition versions but the original holds up just as good if not better. Protest this box set, do not buy this peice of s**t until it is finished and we get the real first three movies.  My only solace is that I already own the real Star Wars on vhs tape.  I just pray that my tapes lasts long enough until they complete this garbage, I mean we waited this long for what, really what was the big effort that went into it.  I for one am not buying this and any true fan wouldn't either.  My guess would be that six mounths from now there is another set released, can anyone say money grab.  DO NOT BUY THIS I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS.  As fans we deserve it all,  we waited long enough.  If we don't buy this and demand more they will have to give us what we want.

Now, about the digital changes? I'm too young to have seen the originals in the theatres but they still bug the hell out of me! Not because they're ""messing with classics"" but because they just plain look like crap! I cringe everytime I see the CG, it just looks awful and amaturish. It completely detracts from the viewing experience. If someone were not to have seen the earlier versions at all, they could still EASILY point out what was changed. Unless lucas can make the changes transparent, then he should not bother, it only makes the movie harder to watch! I prefer the look of the plastic models and low budget sets to the pristine digital look that has been chopped into the original trilogy and plagues the prequels. I mean what's the point of having some CG monster walk in front of the camera (completely blocking the action on screen) other than to say ""look at what we can do!""

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2LYCUB4DKNOHG	"Justin ""The Claw"""	"""This will be a day long remembered."" This quote from the first Star Wars film, known since 1981 as ""Episode &#8547;: A New Hope,"" describes the feelings of myself, and countless other Star Wars fans on the eagerly awaited Blu-ray release of the Star Wars saga. I just received mine about two hours ago as of this writing. But with every new release of Star Wars comes a looming question: What will George Lucas change this time?This was not always the case. Fifteen years of home video releases saw the trilogy presented exactly as they were seen in theaters (albeit usually in panned and scanned versions formatted to fit a standard television screen), and with the release of 1993's THX edition release (available in widescreen for the first time on VHS), it seemed the movies would never be better than they were.The work Industrial Light & Magic did for Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park changed all that. Lucas admitted that he was never happy with the way Star Wars came out, due mostly to restraints of time, money, and ILM's pioneering, yet crude technology, and announced that with current computer graphics, he could finally go back and complete scenes from the original trilogy that had bugged him for years.1997 saw the release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, a theatrical (and eventually home video) re-release of all three films with newly enhanced special effects, and a handful of additional scenes. To say the reaction was mixed would be an understatement. Nearly a decade-and-a-half after they were revealed to the world, many of the changes Lucas made have been heavily criticized and hotly debated. Those who grew up on the originals felt that the new additions ruined the movies. Disappointed fans took solace in the fact that at least they could still watch the original versions of the films at home on VHS.Seven years later saw the DVD release of the ""Original Trilogy"" as it was now known, following two prequels, with one last film on the way. Fans pleaded and prayed that Lucas would see fit to release the theatrical versions alongside the Special Editions, which were now said to have even more changes to better tie in the Originals with the Prequels. Not only did they not get their wish (at least not until a few years later), but many fans scoffed at some of the newest changes made to the series, believing the prequels to be further ruining the series, and any changes made to accommodate those films would be even more detrimental to the dignity of the Original Trilogy.So here we are today. I have my Star Wars Blu-rays laying on my sofa, awaiting their weekend marathon. I have heard rumors of even more changes to Episodes &#8547; through &#8549;, as well as a few for &#8544; through &#8546;. These rumors include deleted scenes incorporated into the films, a new CG Yoda to replace the puppet (I knew they were doing this for Episode &#8544;, though I'm still unsure about whether this plan also includes Episodes &#8548; and &#8549;), and the possibility of Han once again shooting first. I will thank anyone who has knowledge of exactly what changes have been made to keep quiet. I want to be surprised.The thing is, after all these years of changes and complaints, I still don't see what the big deal is. There are very few changes to the Original Trilogy to which I strongly object, and none of those changes affect the over-all film in any way. What difference does it make whether Han or Greedo shoots first? As long as Greedo misses, the other approximately 13 hours, 20 minutes, and 59 seconds of the saga remains roughly the same. Sure, the Jabba the Hutt scene in A New Hope seems redundant and unnecessary in terms of the single film, and maybe it ruins the ""big reveal"" of Jabba in Return of the Jedi, but since Jabba already appears in The Phantom Menace (canonically the first film in the saga), and that scene was always supposed to be in A New Hope in the first place, it hardly ruins anything. I will agree, Jedi Rocks sucks, Lapti Nek is better, but since it is only a nonsensical musical number with no relation to the plot, whichever song they use is more personal preference than pertinence. Speaking of music, I also prefer the instrumental music and galactic celebrations used at the end of Jedi now to the ""Yub Nub"" teddy bear picnic from the original. And as for replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen... it could have been done better, but again, it's only a few seconds of footage, and for the new generation of Star Wars fans who have grown up with the prequels, it does help tie the whole story together.I have yet to even look at the Blu-rays (as of this writing), and I will not see anything from Episodes &#8547; through &#8549; until Sunday, but when I do I will reserve judgement, and determine for myself if anything ""ruins"" Star Wars. I doubt anything will. I might not agree with some of Lucas' decisions, but when it comes right down to it, they're not my -- nor anyone else's -- movies, but his. I challenge anyone who says that they could make a better movie than George Lucas to do so. Making fan edits and indie movies based on the Original Trilogy do not count as creativity. They are just stealing a brilliant idea from a more successful person and modifying it to fit someone else's tastes. The original movies were not perfect -- they have always had flaws -- but if the man who created them feels that the current versions are the best versions, that is his prerogative as their creator. If you don't like them, create your own multi-billion dollar franchise, and make them your way. These are his movies, and as long as they are his, they are mine too. Besides, they are only movies...UPDATE: I have just now finished watching all six movies and I can now confirm that more than ninety-nine percent of the saga appears on Blu-ray exactly as it appeared in theaters (Episodes &#8545; and &#8546; are, as far as I could tell, identical), with most of the alterations being to Episodes &#8547;-&#8549;, which are still nearly ninety-nine percent the same as their theatrical versions.How do I come to this conclusion? Simple arithmetic. The combined total runtime of the entire saga is 805 minutes, 418 for the Prequels, 387 for the Original Trilogy. The only noticeable changes to the prequels were the aforementioned CG Yoda, and a brief fly-through of Coruscant, both in Episode &#8544; (the fly-through was included on previous home video versions). By my rough estimate, there are approximately 4-5 minutes of significant new footage to Episodes &#8547;-&#8549; combined: about one minute each for the Jabba scene and Jedi Rocks, about 30 seconds each for Mos Eisley and the Victory Celebration, and about a minute or two of scattered CG enhancements like the animated Dewbacks, Rebel fly-by, Cloud City expansions, Sarlacc, etc. (The infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" shot is literally eight frames -- or one-third of a second -- long, in which Greedo fires an imperceptible two frames before Han. I counted.) Figuring conservatively that's approximately 98.7% of the Original Trilogy's footage left intact, all of which is story and character-based, meaning nothing even remotely alters the original plot.Since the Special Features discs were not included in the individual trilogy box sets, you'll find my review of those onStar Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]."	5.0	"""I am altering the Original Trilogy.

Anyway, seeing how this is the blu-ray/DVD combo pack I was under the impression that it was the first ever release of the blu-ray versions on DVD (I also read that elsewhere online). The picture is probably the best I've seen on DVD so far and looks great on either an HD screen or even an older SD tube TV, and the sound is so good that if it's turned up enough the explosion of the Death Stars could blow out your windows. I also like the 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio because it widens the picture virticly and narrows down the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen so it's easier to see the movie (I've never really been a fan of widescreen). The only quip I have is that I understand that the blu-ray versions are supposed to contain scenes that were originally missing but they never showed up on the DVDs of what is supposed to be those same versions, the only blu-ray exclusive I did notice was Vader's new line at the end of episode VI. Are those scenes only on the blu-ray disks or do I have to get the special collector's edition blu-ray set? And of course a blu-ray player so that I can watch them. That is the only reason I gave this four out of five stars. If someone out there could clear this up for me I would appreciate it. Thanks.	4.0	The Force is strong with this one...	2014-05-13	2	1	1

For many years, since DVD technology came out, I waited for these movies to be released on DVD. However, over the last many years, I have given up on Lucas and anything he plays a part in. It is not about creating a masterpiece for all to enjoy. It is simply about the money. He stalls and delays to make more money. He releases multiple versions of these movies to make money. I am also very dissapointed that the original versions will not be included in this set. So much so that I am going to pass.Why am I going to pass them up? Simply because Lucas is only doing it this to make more money. He does not care about the consumer. Think about his mode of operation over the years. If you think about it long enough, you will be able to guess his next move. No matter what he says right now, the original versions will be released in the future. When we will never know, but they will be released when the timing is right to be able to make the most money.  Why include the original versions when you can sell the altered versions now, wait for a long period of time, and sell the original versions for a premium later.I will miss seeing them and do not like missing out on the DVD versions. However, I am not the type to fall for someone's propaganda and devious marketing ploys.  I may be in the minority on this in the long run, but Lucas' coffers will be a few dollars less then it otherwise could be.	1.0	Think About It	2004-08-31	64	30	34

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3NINFQUHPEERD	JZ	Mr. Lucas achieved no small feat when he created a myth that pervades modern social consciousness. Perhaps the special editions will be judged well by posterity, perhaps not. Observations from my household are this: in the last few years, my Star Wars viewings have essentially stopped. Correlated with this is the failure of my VCR, leaving access to the special editions only, versions that I don't enjoy as much. I'm saddened that I don't visit that galaxy far, far away as often as I used to, and that when the kids in my family come over and we watch a movie, it is never Star Wars anymore. As such, the power of Star Wars that I felt so keenly in childhood is not felt by my young family members. The transmission of the myth to the next generation has been interrupted, at least in my family. I could blame Mr. Lucas and be angry with him, but I remember the words of Yoda and Obiwan, and the example of a farm boy from Tatooine. I have no plan to buy any edition of Star Wars that does not include the original theatrical versions. Its as simple as that and its nothing worth getting angry over. As for the children in my family, there are other stories with fantastic people and high adventures I can share with them to impart the values important to me.	1.0	The Power of Star Wars	2011-01-17	18	13	5

I'm not middle aged and wasn't alive for the theatrical release of 2/3 of the original movies.  However, I grew up watching them on tape (beta in fact) all the time, my sisters and I would go outside and play Star Wars in the yard and avocado grove.  I loved the Star Wars movies.  And I still do. I was so excited when the new movies were coming out, thinking it would be a wonderful addition to the story line.  As we all know, well, it wasn't. Let's just leave it at that.  Then the ""updated"" editions of the original, actually I can't remember which came out first, but either way, they are HORRIBLE.  It's like watching a movie you know and love on tv where they chop it all up for time and editing. And you can't sit through it because you know it too well.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3A3QSNJBKFWFZ	"Kailey S. ""Kailey"""	"This trilogy addition highlights a major step in science fiction movie production.  George Lucas's genius vision has allowed all of us to experience the rich and wonderful ideas that only a true visionary could have originated.  A genius is defined as someone who changes the course of human history and culture, and George Lucas does exactly that.  Unfortunately, George Lucas's vision was not able to be completely fulfilled due to lack of technology when the originals were first created.  He always felt his movies needed the finishing touch that CGI allows, and I think it's amazing how he has incorporated that into his movies.Star Wars is meant to bring out the inner child in all of us, and I'm sure that George Lucas felt that that feeling was tampered with when the plot was changed so that Han Solo shot a concenrated beam of light through Greedo's head, unprovoked.  Adding the initial Greedo shot gives a need for Han Solo to defend himself, and makes his character seem more virtuous.Lucas meant for his movies to be timeless, and not brutally criticized for the newly added special effects.  When you think about it, plot and character developement are what makes or breaks a movie.  They are the two main factors that make Star Wars a cultural icon. The special effects also play a lesser, but still important role.  Lucas propelled special effects to their max, in the originals, but they never reached the complexity he wished.  With the new tools now available to him, he was able to put in the intricacies and detail that he always envisioned.  The older critics need to get over their obsession with the original versions of star wars, because they are not Lucas's initial vision.  They are merely a ""rough draft"" eclipsed by the special editions now available.I'm sorry that the original generation of Star Wars fans were not able to experience CGI initially.  They need to allow the new generation of Star Wars fans to fully enjoy Lucas's full vision."	5.0	A Beautiful Finishing Touch On A Major Cultural Influence	2006-06-02	9	7	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A7EWPBW8IEBA6	Kaiser	This is not Star Wars: The Original Trilogy. It is a derivative work, with most of the original material, but you will also encounter different visual and audio effects, music, script, and actors. Certain character arcs, dramatic beats, and major story points have been altered. Two of the films were modified without the director's control or assent. See my review ofStar Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray] for further discussion.I give this set one extra star because it is not weighted down by the lugubrious prequels. The extra star should not be construed as advice that you purchase this set.BTW, Amazon seems to have conflated this review with various other Star Wars reviews. I don't know how they manage to sell people the things they click on, yet mix the reviews up so badly.

I still have mine, thank God, since Lucas never released the theatrical versions on DVD. Instead he released his tarted up version. That's his prerogative as director.He said he wouldn't release the originals until the technology caught up with his vision, or some such nonsense. Okay, Mr. Lucas, Blu-Ray is here. Now will you please release them? You can include your CGI-filled versions and still have plenty of room to include a remastered update of the theatrical versions.Hell, why not throw in the unremastered versions, too? I get a kick out of seeing some of the imperfect effects and remembering how state-of-the-art it was when I saw it in the 1980's. What's wrong with that? Why should Lucas kill our nostalgia because he can't leave them alone? I know they're his movies but he would make plenty of money from giving us what we want. Considering all the merchandising from Ewoks to Xbox games, he doesn't mind raking in the cash.Also, on a separate note, Amazon's ""First to Know"" function is not letting me submit my email to be notified if and when it does come out on Blu-Ray.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ABX4OG4W6Z670	Katherine	I have not purchased this trilogy on DVD and I will not.  Mr. Lucas either has forgotten, or does not respect the people that flocked to the theatres and made him the zillionaire he is today.  I do not begrudge the special editions to anyone who loves them and wishes to purchase them, but I will never, ever understand why Mr. Lucas refuses to release these movies as they were originally shown.  I'd be willing to bet that Stephen Spielberg would never disrespect the fans of his movies this way.  Of course he wouldn't, that's why I have all three original Indiana Jones movies in my DVD collection.This review is being edited because Mr. Lucas did release the true originals for DVD and I am now a proud possessor of all three.  My other thoughts remain the same which is why I will not purchase the movies in Blu-Ray.  I'm a little sorry about that too.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1ZKPI8BAGOJCE	Katie	I love Star Wars, and I always have.  It's the original sci-fi saga.  You can't even compare it with Star Trek because it's so much better.  I'm sorry, maybe I'm a little biased.  But Star Wars has, is, and always will be my favorite science fiction series.It's not just the fact that the acting is superb, the plot is riveting, and the settings are realistic (despite that the movies were produced in the 70s [i think? - i wasn't around back then]).  Somehow, the trilogy is understandable and easy to relate to (unlike Lord of the Rings, for instance).  You fall in love with the characters in Episode IV, and that's what holds your attention more than anything else for the rest of the trilogy.Some might suggest that you watch Episodes I-III first, before you get to these.  I suppose you could do that, but I maintain that you don't need to.  These movies were made to stand alone, and they have.  You don't need to watch episodes I-III before you get to these.  In fact, I am of the opinion that you should watch the older movies first, because I think that the first three episodes are far more confusing.  It would be easier to understand if you've already seen the originals.Regarding plot, it is a bit confusing, but not too badly.  First, the emperor aand Darth Vader have pretty much taken over the Universe and destroyed all thats left of the Jedi (except for Obi-Wan and Yoda).  To go into that, the Jedi use the Force for good and the Dark Side use it for bad.  Thus, the classic theme of good v. evil emerges.  Anyway, two droids land on a planet and meet up with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).  There's a message from a damsel in distress on one of the droids, and Luke takes the droid to Obi-Wan, who lives nearby.  Returning home, Luke finds his aunt and uncle dead, killed by imperial troops.  He then decides to join Obi-Wan in his mission to help the Princess Lea, who has been captured by Darth Vader.  From there, the plot is obvious.  Luke joins up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to help the rebels (another facet of the good side fighting against the Empire).  And the story goes on from there, until predictably, the Empire is defeated.Of course, there's a lot of drama and action and revealed information in between.  That's what makes it good.I love all the characters in Star Wars.  My favorite, I must admit, is Han Solo.  He's just that cool.  Luke's character is also well done, as is basically everyone else's.  The director even takes the time to develop the droid's and Chewbacca's personas.  The character development is what makes this movie great.Action scenes are superb for the time these movie were made.  Special effects are amazing and seem real despite the fact that most aliens are people in costumes.  Whereas the new Star Wars movies rely almost totally on digital animation (the biggest problem i have with the new movies), the old ones rely on acting and just plain, good old-fashioned costumes.I won't even get into the new movies here.  The old ones are SO MUCH BETTER!!  I LOVE THE OLD STAR WARS MOVIES!  The new ones were decent, I suppose, but they could have been so much better.  The acting was mediocre, and although special effects were good, i think that they should have modelled the new ones after these three originals.  After all, you can never top the original, but you can at least try to imitate it!	5.0	You can't top the original!	2005-06-08	8	7	1

Like millions of others, Star Wars was a big deal for me while I was growing up and had a significant influence on my imagination.Back in the 90's, I was pretty psyched when the ""special editions"" came out in the theaters. They were fun, but I had to admit they really didn't add or improve upon the originals, which even then were considered classics. When I heard that Lucas was making the prequels, I was REALLY psyched. Of course, after seeing Episode 1, I realized that none of these new efforts were going to come close to the magic of the originals.So now, finally, years and years after buying my first DVD, ""the Original Trilogy"" comes out in the format and box-set we've all been waiting for. But actually... its not the original, but the special editions with even more extra ""revised"" stuff pasted in... Huh?Don't get me wrong, I'm all for preserving and restoring films so we can view them again with the best possible picture and sound, but that's not really what's going on here. Instead, the original is out of commission and no longer available to see (you know the original, the one that inspired the fanatical devotion, and in turn a billion dollar industry over the last 30 years?). Now its the new ""revised"" version, or nothing. I think there is something wrong with that.So anyway... I enjoyed these movies, but I guess that's it for me.

If you enjoyed the 1997 revised versions of the original trilogy, then you will enjoy these DVDs. If you hated the new movies, you will hate the DVDs. The simple fact that so many people seem to be missing is that regardless of whether or not you feel ""betrayed"" by George Lucas, the man created the Star Wars universe and can do with it as he pleases. Threatening a man who has over $300 million with the fact that he ""won't get a nickel from me"" is sad and pathetic.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A27ED64SFF2DBA	Keith Helinski	If you are like me and is only out for the picture/audio quality, I recommend getting both trilogy sets rather than the overpriced `saga' set (I myself got both sets under 25 dollars in the Marketplace section).Yes, the movies look great and sound great.  Unless you've been living in Yoda's hut, you are fairly aware that these are the altered sets.  I am sure if you do your homework; you know what kind of changes was made here.After doing my own homework of the various sets, the consistency is the movies look great/sound great, and the saga set does have bonus stuff these trilogy sets do not, but it's the quality of the bonus material that's lacking.  Considering there is 1,000+ 1 star reviews on the saga set, and 1,000+ 5 star reviews on this set (as well as 700+ 1 star reviews on this set), you make up your own mind whether you want to buy this set or not.On the merits of the Blu Ray set, I got what I paid for. Maybe, someday, when a REAL COMPLETE saga set is unleashed to the world, I will shell out the extra money.  Until then, I am content with what I bought.  It didn't break the bank.  I did not have to ask for a mortgage. And I still have the 2004 DVD set for the superior bonus material, and burn DVD copies of the original ORIGINAL trilogy.	4.0	...should I...or shouldn't I?	2011-10-19	1	1	0

Now that I get to hear it in 5.1 and see the picture in amazing clarity, I am a happy camper.As for the changes, now Greedo and Han shoot at the same time, which isn't too bad.  There is different dialogue with the Emperor in Empire, but that seems to be more consistent with the current Star Wars movies.

Those complaining have seen it 20+ times so they can't really be getting confused. When star wars first ran on HBO i was 15 and managed to get my viewing count up to the mid 30s. ESB and ROJ weren't far behind. I had the toys, i had the cards, yada yada yada. I loved them then. I love them now. If they've been tweaked a little here and there, it just gives it a bit of a bump to make me more likely to spend yet another 7+ hours watching them. I like the  prequels (not nearly as much as the originals but they're ok). PLus, why are there 900 reviews for DVDs that haven't come out yet? If you don't like the fact that george keeps rereleasing them, don't buy them. It doesn't change the fact you liked the originals. But now, due to the magic of digitalness, you'll be able to watch your favorite scenes over and over without having to wait for the vcr to rewind. Yea! And as to the special bonus never-before-heard behind the scenes stuff. How can there be anything new to say about the making of these movies. Sure, I'll watch them and probably enjoy it a whole bunch, however, we've been watch star wars behind the scenes specials for over 20 years. I guess what I'm saying is, if you like em, great, if you don't, don't buy em. Star Wars really doesn't need to be something to argue over or to get upset about ""changing"".

It does not have the original cut of the trilogy, but I knew this when I bought it.  What I got it for was the much improved artwork on the box and I was expecting the same for the DVD's inside.  Unfortunately, the artwork inside hasn't changed.  Too bad because I loved the original artwork used for the packaging of the VHS versions when they were first issued.  It was basically the miniature version of their movie posters.  Oh how I would've liked to see the original  Empire Strikes Back artwork for this DVD.

For those of us though who repeatedly watched Star Wars over and over in 1977 in movie theaters, who sat in line at 6am the first day when Empire Strikes Back was released, and then once again when Return of the Jedi was released, there was a magic to those movies at the time that has stayed with us all these years.When the Special Editions were released in the movie theater I will never forget sitting there and hearing the music, in a movie theater, reading the words scroll up on a big screen once again, I was nine years old all over again and it was 1977 again. The movies looked great, sounded great, and Empire Strikes Back blew me away all over again.The couple added scenes that he directed didn't bother me and for the most part all the new special effects were great, jarring to be sure for those of us who have seen the three movies hundreds of times but it looked good. I won't bother to bring up the old argument ""Han shot First..."" change, its pointless. To be honest the only part that really irritated me was at the end of Return of the Jedi. Instead of this small celebration with those who survived the battle on Endor and the admittedly cheezy but classic song, Lucas had to show the whole empire celebrating with fireworks, etc, and added new music over the old which to this day if I watched the video I would turn it off because it is just so annoying.What it comes down to is that Lucas has forgotten one thing, the most important and only thing that matters in movies to us who love them, especially Star Wars as we sat in theaters in 1977. Star Wars was magical to us. His obessive changing scenes, switching scenes, adding new special effects, etc, doesn't make any one of the three movies better. Just because you can change something, doesn't mean you should.Now he changes the movies again? I'll reserve judgement when I watch all 3 DVD's a week from Tuesday. What Lucas does now he does only for himself. It's his way of telling all of us Star Wars fans that made him the rich in the first place that he can do what he wants with his movies. This is true, they are his movies, but along the way he forgot what made them magical in the first place.The Star Wars Trilogy is finally gonna be out on DVD. Of course im gonna be at the store pounding on the glass for the doors to open. I'll run home and pop them in the DVD player one at a time, watching them with friends. I'll watch them over and over and over.Hey, George Lucas may have forgotten about the magic, but whatever he changes or doesn't change, everytime I hear the music, and watch the words scroll up on my screen, its 1977 again and Lucas will never be able to kill that magic."	5.0	The magic of Star Wars	2004-09-12	10	7	3

It seems George is so obsessed with changing and ""improving"" his landmark film, his crack technical crew removed a missing sound effect in the big final trench battle at the end of the movie.  Check out the 1:56:57 mark when Han Solo appears and fires at Vader's and his henchmen's ships.  One of the henchmen's ships flies to the left of the screen alongside the trench and there's a big explosion......well visually there's a big explosion, but no sound effect of the explosion.  Maybe Lucas intended it to be silent because he...uh...well...maybe his vision was that the sound of the explosion should be left to our imagination.  In any case, I didn't think the BluRay editions of these films, doted after and prepared with painstaking care, should have technical mistakes in them.  Look at the previous release of this film and the explosion is there in sound.  Ok, I guess I am one of those middle-aged malcontents who cries at every change George Lucas makes, but I didn't think he made blatant errors like this.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2MH0QDRZFWF2S	Kenton Larsen	"To misappropriate an old quote: a person who doesn't like Star Wars doesn't like life.What is there not to love? Star Wars is perfection in celluloid form, a gourmet blend of comic books, pulp sci-fi novels, soap operas, westerns, swashbucklers, sword and sorcery, the Wizard of Oz, and the best of our own cultural mythologies. As a result, it's one of the few ""space"" movies where being a science fiction nut is not a prerequisite to enjoying the film.To call Star Wars ""technically innovative"" is an understatement for the effect it had on audiences in 1977. No one had ever seen anything like Star Wars before: when I saw it for the first time that year as a 10-year-old, my mouth dropped open within the first five seconds of the movie and didn't shut until well after the final credits. It must have been the same feeling for audiences the first time a ""talkie"" replaced a silent film -- sheer, unadulterated joy at seeing something that had never been seen before.I saw Star Wars in the theatre a good 25 times on its initial run, and it never lost one iota of its power and fascination for me, or for the rest of the audience, who applauded after each showing, even after it had been playing for well over a year.In fact, Star Wars just seemed to get better -- and more real -- with each viewing. Although everyone knew that it was ""only a movie"", what kid didn't want to live on Tatooine, and join the Rebel Alliance to go after the evil Empire? To this day, there is an entire ""Star Wars generation"" who can't pick a stick up off the ground without thinking of the sound a lightsaber makes.And that's part of the fun of watching Star Wars today. Not only does the film have the power to transport you to that galaxy far, far away, it's become so ingrained in our cultural consiousness, it's impossible not to also be transported back to childhood and the first time you were ever mesmerized by that giant Imperial Star Destroyer as it swooped down from the top of the screen.Star Wars' story is deceptively simple. The good guys fight the bad guys for control of the galaxy and get in and out of scrapes along the way. Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are the prince charmings, Princess Leia is the damsel in distress (with attitude), Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi is the father figure, and R2-D2 and C-3P0 are the comic relief.The film's grandeur, however, is mostly in the details. Starting the series at ""Episode IV"" was a great way to build buzz for Episodes I to III a good 20 years before they'd even be a glimmer in Lucas' eye, but it was also something more. It gave the film an instant ""history"" -- that we were unaware of that history made the ""mystery"" of Episodes I to III that much more compelling.The worn-out look of the spacecraft and vehicles only added to that mysterious sense of history. The X-Wing fighters looked like they'd been kit-bashed from nine or 10 different spacecraft and Luke's landspeeder reminds me of the 1977 Chevy Nova I drove in high school: pretty in its day, but well past its prime by the time I got my hands on it.Nowhere is the scope of George Lucas' vision more vividly presented than in Star Wars' famous cantina scene, which features aliens of all shapes and sizes, some drinking, some fighting, some falling in love, and some just hanging around -- one look, and you know the possibilities in the Star Wars universe are as big as the universe itself.Star Wars is one of the few films ever made that's at once artistic and entertaining, ground-breaking and familiar, critically acclaimed and popular.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A26G35WR7QCFR2	Kevbo	I remember being about 5 or 6 years old when I saw my first Star Wars movie in the early 1980s.  I also remember running to the back of the theater screaming when Darth Vader appeared on the screen.  Mother had to come get me as I was trying to hide behind a poor couple's seats.Now I am 30 years old and had the chance to see the digital re-makes and upgrades that George Lucas did over the years, plus his legendary prequels over that same time.  The news about Lucas Films digitizing everything (including the first movies) around the time Episode I was released only intensified the fervor of Star Wars mania some 20 years later.Now that I am a respectable and employed adult, I decided to drop my cash on this fine trilogy as I wanted the first movies for my home set.  I knew what I was getting into: these are not the original releases.  For me, I prefer that, because watching 1970s and 80s technology is not as appealing to me as 2000's technology.  And besides, these movies now tell a better story as a result of George Lucas' upgrades.So let me review the darn package after all that now!For about $50, you get three movies and a bonus disc.  That means each disc will cost you a little more than $12 each, together.If you are wondering if the bonus disc is worth $12, I would give an emphatic Yes.  The disc chronicles the making of the movie and all the side business, the science of creating the movie, and actors'/directors'/etc. viewpoints on the whole thing.  It lasts over 240 minutes, and every drop of information will rile even the slightest Star Wars fans.Next, on the question of digitization, the three films (Episodes 4 - 6) not only had a slick digital transfer (making them compatible with today's machinery and offering the capability to excel over yesteryear), but they revamped certain scenes that could have used the facelift.For example, now the speeder coming into the Mos Eisley spaceport doesn't look like it was a 1977 carousel.  It actually looks futuristic in its movement.  Also, they replaced Anikan Skywalker with Hayden Christensen instead of the original fellow when his ghost looks upon Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi.  (That was the best addition/change, I think.)I like action/adventure movies, so the digital upgrades Lucas did are welcomed by me.  I know there are purists out there, but they tend to follow a religion more than the excitement of the movie.  (Reminds me of people who do not like the Designated Hitter in baseball, now that I think about it.  But I digress.)To close, I recommend the purchase of this trilogy if you were in my situation: you didn't have any of these movies.  And I mean the digitized versions.  Get them.  The old ones are collectibles, but if you want a completed collection to show your kids, this trilogy fills the gaps, and the bonus disc is worth it as well.  Also, if you can beat $12 per disc individually to complete your collection, I'd say go that route instead, though you may have to forego the bonus disc.	5.0	This Trilogy Package Rocks	2006-11-27	47	38	9
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A94H0RQW2W4AA	"Kevin Brearey ""nivek2112"""	"A lot of people are bashing Lucas for this mess, and I happen to agree with a lot of the points that they raise.  On the other hand, I also understand that Lucas, the artist of these films, wants to retouch his work to make it more to his liking.  He has a right to do that, and I will never deny him that.What I don't understand here is that he has a lot of people who are and were willing to give his re-realized versions a chance.  Hell, in 1997 I was as extatic as the next guy to be able to see the first film on the big screen, seeing as how I was born in 1978, a year after the initial release.  With all of the added effects, I found that, although the experience of seeing the film at the theatre was great, the magic was gone....rather it was kinda' handed to me.  What I mean by this is, with the original Theatrical version of the Trilogy, there was a fanciful air about it.  The effects weren't perfect, but this allowed a generation of fans to imagine and suspend disbelief, because they believed so wholeheartedly in these films and the originality of the presentation.  We invented worlds within ourselves to explain all of the backstory and all of the creatures that weren't there.Come 1997, we were given the creatures that weren't there.  Handed to us on a silver platter (or, in this case silver screen).  I don't know about many of you, but the creatures that I was handed were a long way from what I had imagined.  Still, however, like I said earlier, it is his right to retouch his work...he is the artist.However, my argument is this...Although he has the right to touch the films and present them in a new way, we as fans are the ones who gave him that chance to retouch the films.  These films could have been like an old painting sitting in an attic collecting dust...but a generation of crazed fans wouldn't have it that way.  We loved it...and we wanted more, but were happy with what we had.  That same generation longs for the ability to view the painting as it once was.  Like going to a store and buying a print of a painting, I long to be able to go to the store and buy a copy of the artwork that I fell in love with....or at least to be able to purchase a set that has both realizations included so you can view what you prefer.A few years back when Terminator 2 came out on Laserdisc, there was a Special edition of the film released.  This special edition allowed you to view the original film or the extended cut.  One may prefer one over the other, but you had the choice to view your prefered version.  We Star Wars fans have not been given that choice.  We who are so willing to give our hard earned money to the man who helped a generation imagine something great...to live a story that never actually happened, but was so believeable that it could have happened.  We are still that willing...I know I am.  Even if he repeackaged his new realization, which I already own, with the original cuts of the films, I would purchase them in a heartbeat.Instead, what we get here is a lame attempt to swindle the very people who made the swindling possible.  George, this is a travesty...an outrage, and I for one am not going to stand for it.  I will not purchase this mess and neither should anyone else.  We have given you every chance in the world...with those rediculous prequels and the destruction of our beloved childhood memories...why would you not give us the chance...the chance to decide for ourselves which is the better version.  I don't think any of us would deny you (whether we can or can't) the right to ""update"" your work...we wouldn't want to.  Just give us a chance...a chance that our many millions of combined dollars, in my opinion, has earned us."	2.0	These are not the films you're looking for...	2005-12-10	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3H4KO53O0OUEU	Kevin Van Natter	Yikes! George Lucas is changing Star Wars. Who would have thought!? But as we start to try and get past things we cannot change (hey, its part of being an adult), we have to actually look at the quality of the release and not fall victim to the little whiny brat inside all of us-- I call him Hayden.So, should you buy these on Blu-ray? Good question. Do you own an HD TV? Do you or have you ever loved Star Wars? If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then I'm afraid that I have to tell you that you should indeed give George Lucas more of your money. Changes aside, the quality of these discs is unparalleled. These are the new demo discs for your home theater. Previously, these films have only been available in 1080p on Cinemax (what an awesome promotion that was) and then on Spike (which I'm pretty sure is also 1080p but you get commercials so...). Prepare to see details that you've never seen. SEE the finger print smudges on Luke's lightsabre as it is in the clutches of the Emperor. FEEL the roar of the Millienium Falcon as it flies through an asteroid field. The weird thing about Star Wars in HD is that it makes you appreciate the detail of the original films despite the changes.Look, these changes are horrible. We know that. But the Darth Vader thing becomes more tolerable each time I see it. The Ewoks blinking is a little distracting because you might find yourself looking at the amount of blinking that every character, Ewok or not, is doing on screen. And I'd love for Lucas to have Han shoot first, but he doesnt and if you're really being honest with yourself, this is the best incarnation of that scene yet. Before, it looked like Han was doing some weird head move. That's fixed.The bottom line is that these films have never looked better and the difference in quality is certainly worth the price whether you hate the changes or don't really mind. Personally, I hate them...but you try to get over things when you're not 12.	4.0	Change is bad, Blu is good!	2011-09-08	21	6	15
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"This is a nice boxed set.  It has a lot of nice extra features on one of the discs.  The other three contain episodes four, five, and six of the ""Star Wars"" franchise.  Sure, they've been tampered with by Lucas, but they are HIS movies.  Gripe over it all you want, but at the end of the day you're going to buy this set because you want it, no matter what changes Lucas has made.  I don't like all of the changes, but some of them are very good and add to the story.  Other folks have cried about the ""original"" versions of these films.  The originals were great, and they deserved to be recognized as such.  However, there have been advancements in special effects and Lucas has every right to tweek HIS films any way that he wishes.You already know these stories, and some of you probably dress up and play them out frame by frame.  The sad thing is is that no matter what Lucas does, the purists will not be satisfied.  Some of them want the old film blurbs in the scenes, others don't.  Some folks want more scenes with Biggs in ""A New Hope,"" others don't. Blah, blah, blah.  Once you realize that Lucas has already made more than enough money on these flicks(and every tie-in known to man), maybe then you'll see that he doesn't care what folks think anymore.  He's going to do what he wants because he can, and that's his God-given right.So, in closing, if you loved the original films and hate the great Satan that is George Lucas, don't buy this set.  If you liked the updated versions released in the 90's and altered by billionaire George Lucas, buy this set.  If you're just collecting anything ""Star Wars"" in your parents' basement so that you can pretend to be Luke when you get off of work at the comic shop and pray at the foot of your altar to Boba Fett, get this set.  If you take this stuff way too seriously and want to off George Lucas for his immoral raping of classic cinema, skip this set and find a good shrink.  If you're just an average person who likes good action/sci-fi/fantasy with a great storyline who is willing to look beyond all of the changes made by a guy named George Lucas, get this set.Hope this helps out everybody.

I really enjoy this because you can see the versions of the movies that I saw in the theatre when I was a kid. Then you can see the touched up version. It is sad to see so many people slam this. I truly believe that if Lucas Arts would have touched up the original versions people would complain that you don't get the original affect when these movies came out in the 1970's and 1980's.

I would wait till you can buy they whole series 1-6 on blue laser dvd which has recently been made available. Blue laser dvds have a much greater storage capacity and as time goes by they could probably put all six films with all the extras on one dvd. Speaking of extras there are still a considerable amount of sceans that Lucus never put into the originals and most likly for the new ones as well. Like a new hope has a different beginning where it shows luke watching the star destroyer chase from the planet, in Empire there is a whole wampa/ snow creature plot where 3po uses the creatures to kill storm troopers, their is also more footage of luke recovering and he almost kisses leia. ROTJ also has extended sceans such as after jabbas death where all the companions meet to board thier ships to head back to the alliance. All of these sceans were fully produced and were available on the starwars behind the magic CD. It is sceans like this that make DVDs worth buying and if they were incorporated into the films Star wars would be amazing and it would give fans a whole new appreciation of the films.

What few seem to realize here is that Lucas is trying to make a six part movie. In order for this six part movie to make sense, changes have to be made.Case in point, someone was decrying the fact that Jabba appears in ANH, and that it ruins the suspense of knowing who Jabba is. But if you watch Episodes I through VI, you will have seen Jabba in the first movie, so either way it doesn't matter.Ian McDirmid, who plays the Emperor in FOUR movies (I, II, III and VI) would not be in V if not for the changes. How much sense would it make to have a woman with babboon eyes filling in for Ian in part V, and ONLY in part V? Whether the changes make sense or not doesn't even seem to matter to these nuts.Here is another example: virtually everyone seems to hate the idea of inserting Hayden Christensen at the end of ROTJ. But just how upset would anybody be if the Star Wars Sextet were released in order? Wouldn't it make more sense to finally see the actor who played the ""good Anakin"" in Episodes II and III make a cameo appearance? This would not only bind the six movies more closely together visually, but it would also be a nostalgic look back at the actor who first portrayed Anakin. Sebastian Shaw did a fine job playing the dying, deformed Anakin, but having him as a ghost doesn't really make sense. Think about it, Anakin as a ghost would appear as an old man who NEVER existed. Anakin, as an old man, never had hair, never aged to such a state as he appeared in the OT. Obi-Wan Kenobi made it pretty clear to Luke that his father had suffered a ""spiritual death"" when he became Darth Vader, so invoking the image of his ""good self"", portrayed by H. Christensen, an image that actually existed in physical form, just makes sense. The only reason many of you hate it is because it's new.The truth of the matter is a lot of people here are bitter 30 and 40 year old guys still living with their moms, and simply cannot accept the fact that they are no longer 12 and the reality of Star Wars isn't quite what they remember. My nephews, on the other hand, who are 7 and 9 years old, are loving every minute of the new DVD's and could never even comprehend the incessant rambling of these old gasbags.

This review is about the many DVD releases.The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the ""Limited Edition"" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release.Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him.One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one."	1.0	Lucas Strikes!	2006-10-03	9	7	2

I can't believe the puritanical self-righteous swipes taken at this release due to the fact that it won't be a certain edition relative to the original theatrical release. I was there for the cinematic debut of a New Hope. I knew nothing about it until the trailers on TV, a week before I saw the film. No film experience has affected me as much. BUT...! That was 1977 film tech. DVD is capable of much better quality than could be displayed from the original release. Peter Jackson said that LotR couldn't be made until 2000 FX tech. Lucas made Star Wars upon inspiration with existing tech, and some of his own invention. The fact is... Star Wars is a project in development!And I welcome the opportunity to see Lucas' original concept further developed and refined as film FX develops. I have purchased many of the VHS versions to reflect upon nostalgically. The only advantage to having the pristine original version on DVD is the convenience of DVD over VHS bulk. I have 5 different copies of Army of Darkness on VHS and DVD. Overkill? Consumerism?""Sticks and Stones!"" I say, bring `em on!  The fact is ... there still hasn't been another Sci-Fi or Fantasy film experience to equal the Star Wars phenom. More versions allow a new rush on an old subject.Bottom line is that the Star Wars product line isn't complete. Surely the ""Directors cut"" will be followed by the ""Fundamentalist cut"" sometime there after... and I'll be there in line for that too.Let George finish realizing his vision and let us enjoy the process.This isn't world diplomacy, feeding the hungry or spiritual salvation... its fun!If you don't want to buy this release... that's OK.

My father was a big fan, and I remember that as a small child I would BEG my parents to get me my very own Ewok.My husband is also a huge Star Wars fan, and he begged and pleaded for me to get the DVD triology for him for Christmas, even though we already have the VHS version.Please know that this is NOT the original!  Yes, some of the changes are quite good...the better picture quality, improved special effects.  However, other changes were rather disappointing. Maybe Lucas never heard the saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  For one, my husband was quite mortified that the ""Han Solo shot first"" scene was changed.  After all, that was a big part of his character!  I, on the other hand, could handle the small changes on the first two DVDs...it was not until the end of ""Return of the Jedi"" that I became outraged.  Okay, I can handle the extra celebration scenes...I can maybe even understand changing the Anakin Skywalker image to coincide with the new movies (although, I do agree with another reviewer...this itself was quite a stretch...how does Luke even know him?)  But HOW DARE THEY mess with my Ewok song?  What was wrong with it?  I kept waiting and waiting...and it never came!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2W4BX2P3AKDIC	K McK	"I grew up on the Star Wars films, and was really looking forward to these DVDs. Of course, I still enjoyed the unchanged stuff, and some of the changes as well - but I'm very, very unhappy about not even having the option of seeing the original theatrical releases.When it comes to the changes from the original theatrical release, here are my opinions:The Good:- The updated SFX for the fight and space scenes were nice.- Some of the new CGI creatures were a nice touch - added a new sense of the alien to the movie.- I liked the added celebration scenes at the end of RotJ. Nice tie-in to the prequels, and adds an extra sense of how widely the fall of the Empire is celebrated.The Indifferent:- Regarding the infamous Han/Greedo scene - I probably wouldn't even have noticed if it hadn't been pointed out to be beforehand. The original does add a nice bit of character development and set Han up as a cold mercenary... but it's not the only scene to do so. If children see only this version of the movie, they can probably still figure out that Han is a cold mercenary from other scenes.Really, the only bad thing about this scene, in and of itself, is that Greedo shooting Han first doesn't make any sense from the dialogue leading up to it. There's no lead in to it. Greedo apparently chooses a completely random moment in the conversation to shoot Han.- I wasn't sure about the thriving metropolis with the shiny new droids that was suddenly Mos Eisley. I suppose I could get used to it with time, but it's a bit jarring.The Bad:- The music changes in RotJ. No. Just no. When it got to the end and they'd changed the Ewok celebration song, I just sat there with my mouth hanging open in disbelief - WHY? I loved that song! It was so fitting for the Ewoks, and so happy, and when I was a kid, I would rewind the VCR just to listen to that song again and again. Why would anybody change it?Also, the song at the beginning of RotJ was just too incredibly wrong for words. Most of the allure of Star Wars is the alien nature of everything in the show - if you stick in a rock song with words from American pop culture, this completely destroys the effect.- The added Jabba scene in ANH. It adds nothing to the story, and it's incredibly jarring because, if you grew up with RotJ, you can't help but notice that Jabba has apparently somehow wound up inside one of the gadgets from ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". Seriously, in both height and girth, he is less than half the size he's supposed to be. Did Lucas think that the thousands of viewers who grew up with the films would just fail to notice these things?That's about it for the changes that made any kind of impact on me. The story itself is thankfully largely unchanged, and so the films remain as entertaining, exciting, and inspirational as they always were.I just really, really wish they'd gone the LotR route. I have all of the theatrical release LotR DVD's, as well as the Extended editions, and while I mostly watch the Extended editions, it's still nice to know that I can watch the original theatrical release of LotR when I want to. Likewise, I would still have gotten the special editions of Star Wars, but I would have been a LOT happier if I'd known that I could still watch the old Star Wars movies that I know and love if I wanted to."	4.0	Still good films, but I could have done without some of the changes	2005-09-25	8	8	0

In other words, you will be able to purchase the high definition versions shown on HBO but with better compression technology. Because of the weird color screwups and other errors (the rear surround channels are swapped on A New Hope), that alone is more than enough justification for 1 star.I don't know about you but it doesn't seem worth $70 ($45 amazon sale price) just to upscale the versions I already have and don't want. However, a state of the art 16x9 HD transfer of the original and 1997 versions with all sound mixes would be a must own.Yes it's true there will be new extras including the deleted scenes at last but those are not in this set. If you want those, you have to purchase the even more overpriced complete set that includes the prequels.If you'd rather have the original versions, get this MUCH CHEAPER ($25ish) set instead.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	With REVENGE OF THE SITH in cinemas, the final chapter in the SW saga has been widely recognized as the best of the prequels, but still lacks the special touch that these 3 classic films have. George Lucas' THX-1138 was cool, American Graffiti showed real talent and Star Wars: A New Hope is generally regarded as the greatest movie ever made. Why? Well, what's not to like? From the opening shot of the Blockade Runner accompanied by that great theme tune by John Williams, you know you're in the unique world of the STAR WARS universe. Before George's lackluster prequels THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, A NEW HOPE was known only as STAR WARS. Audiences had never seen anything so original and amazing. Now, the series has entered into the fanboy culture all over the world. In comparison, Episode 4 seems somewhat tame compared to Revenge of the Sith in terms of action, but it's still superior in terms of story and acting talent. And now that ROTS has finished the saga, it has to be said that these 3 films, despite being made 20 or so years ago, they still stand up today and the new generation of kids love these movies.From Hero Luke Skywalker's symbolic journey from his home Tatooine to the moment of victory at the finale, we are greeted with a myriad of fantastic characters, especially Han Solo, played by a pre-Indy Harrison Ford and his buddy Chewbacca. And the ultimate incarnation of evil, Darth Vader. And that, more than anything, is what made TPM so hollow. While the action was impressive in parts, the lack of good characters is disappointing. But ROTS has regained much of the sense of adventure that this film started off.Lucas' grand vision illuminates the entire film, with inventive creatures and events. Several scenes that are my favorites are Obi Wan's conversation to Luke about the Clone Wars and Vader, Solo's disposal of Greedo, Obi Wan and Vader's last confrontation and the battle of Yavin. One of my all-time favorite films, STAR WARS is THE great adventure.Directed by Irvin Kershner, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK moved away from the high-spirited antics of the first film and took a step towards the dark side. The Empire is preparing to seek revenge on the Rebel Alliance, C3P0 gets blasted to bits and Luke Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his dad! Even John William's score is much darker in tone than his previous efforts. But the film is an excellent adventure that many fans consider to be superior to the original. Mark Hamill returns as Luke, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as the sardonic Han Solo. And we are introduced to the wise Yoda, who trains Luke about the ways of a Jedi. The action ante is upped considerably, with fantastic chases through asteroid fields, battles between snow speeders and the AT-ATs and Luke's rescue mission. And the Bespin Duel, where the confrontational battle between Vader and Luke ends with one of the most shocking revelations in movie history (Even if it's somewhat un-surprising for future fans who watch all the completed films in sequence).The weakest of the 3, RETURN OF THE JEDI starts off with Luke and Leia rescuing Han Solo from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While the film is less exciting than it's counterparts, it does have some good action, including the rescue on the desert skiff, the speeder chase through the forest of Endor, the dark final battle between Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Luke and the destruction of the second Death Star. The lightsaber fights are some of the best in the Star Wars cannon and Princess Leia is hotter than ever! John William's score is even more exciting than ESB. If I were to place the Star Wars films in order from best to worst, they would go THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, A NEW HOPE, RETURN OF THE JEDI, REVENGE OF THE SITH, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and THE PHANTOM MENACE.This presentation is very impressive, with added scenes and improved SFX. I like that Temuera Morrison's lines are dubbed over the original Boba Fett lines, and Ian McDiarmid in Empire is satisfying. The digital touch up is excellent and the DVD extras are exhaustive and impressive, especially the making of documentary. Watching these movies, one wonders what happened to Lucas' talent.	5.0	Classic Star Wars better than lackluster prequels	2005-06-17	15	10	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3B2U5Q219BI2C	K. R. Jones	"I really don't like what's happened to Star Wars. Eps 1-3, on their own, were poor films. They weren't unbearable, they were pretty enough (amazing production, design and effects) but lacking any kind of charm, urgency or tension. Taking them as part of the Star Wars whole, they are in worse shape. Not just because of the unfavourable comparisons they draw with the originals. But because of the undermining effect they have on characters and plot devices we're all familiar with (Darth Vader being whiny & sullen, the Force being a blood disorder etc).Eps 1-3 remind me of a modern extension built onto an old house. Not only does it look wrong but the builders have also broken the original plumbing, made the roof leak and now there's a draft. Bigger, sure, but not as nice a place to live. But that's almost beside the point. What really bothers me about Star Wars is how the Special Editions of the original trilogy have supplanted the original prints forever. As George himself puts it (regarding the Ep IV re-release):""I think of the film as The Special Edition. I don't think of it as the early version, any more than I would put early rough cuts on. I could put four or five rough cuts onto the thing and say, 'This is how it advanced.' I consider The Special Edition as being the final version at this point. I don't even worry about the other ones, because it went through a lot of incarnations to get to the final stage.""I can understand wanting to tinker and refine something you've done in the past, but I want to watch the films I watched as a child, and I am very uncomfortable with it being revised (something which George himself understands):""(Talking about the colourisation of black and white film) I am very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved so that my children can see them.""There have been other examples of re-edited versions of films supplanting their original incarnations but I can't think of any example so well known and so important to modern cinema. Given George's own views I find these sweeping revisions, twenty years after the fact, baffling. I do still own copies of the ""early versions"" but the tapes in my VHS Star Wars boxed set are getting a little crackly, Empire is chewed up a little on the opening crawl (and my VHS player as seen better days too). Now as I don't have a Laser Disc player and probably couldn't afford to buy the disks on eBay that's as good as I or anyone else, is going to legally get. The films as they were no longer exist in a legal, sustainable form and that bothers me. George, of course, has the legal right to change his IP as much as he wants, but I think it damages cinema as a whole for him to do so.There is a guy, a SFX professional called Mike Verta who is re-mastering the original Star Wars in his spare time. In his website's editorials he talks quite eloquently and personally about art and the responsibilities of those who create it:""There's a lot of talk about artists' rights these days, but very little talk about an artist's responsibility. It's true that George Lucas can round up every remaining print of Star Wars and fire them into the sun if he wants (die hard purists feel he's pretty much done this already), but that doesn't mean it's a good idea, and to me, it's an abdication of an artist's first responsibility.I often use this analogy: When I was 4, I drew a picture of our family and gave it to my mom. It was very crude, but she cherishes it to this day. I never intended it to be something special, but it came to mean the world to her, for all sorts of reasons. Today I could draw a much better picture. But if her drawing was fading, if the paper was disintegrating, and I was the only one who could preserve it, and I replaced it with one I drew today, it would crush her. It would never be the same. I'm the artist - it IS my right to change it. I can do whatever I want. But it would be almost cruel to do so. Now, as much as my mom loves that drawing, it didn't change her life; it certainly didn't change the world. But Star Wars did change the world - in countless ways.I consider Star Wars every bit as historically significant as Romeo and Juliet, and while many people seem content to witness the obliteration of the original version of this movie, there are very few people who would advocate Shakespeare's writing in a wacky sidekick for Romeo, if he could. With our VHS tapes disintegrating, and our laserdisc players not able to be serviced anymore, this incredibly important piece of history is in danger of being lost forever.The poet Paul Val&eacute;ry said, ""A poem is never finished, only abandoned."" To the artist, this means that you may be forever dissatisfied with your work... fighting the desire to change it as your life experiences change you, and you increase your mastery of your craft. The temptation to do so is sometimes nearly overwhelming. But the subtler message of this quote is that the world is full of poems... so abandoning them is necessary, if they are to make an impression on the world."""	1.0	+5 for the originals, -4 for the 'remakes'	2005-06-19	32	26	6

We've discovered what we believe are serious audio defects on Episode IV - A New Hope. We've updated our DVD review of the set accordingly with the details as follows:[Editor's Note: since we initially wrote this review, we've detected a number of audio/mixing errors on the DVD version of A New Hope. They are as follows:1) The familiar Force theme trumpet fanfare that used to play right after Red Leader says: ""This is it!"" and just as the X-wings start diving towards the Death Star's surface has been dialed back in volume so that it's almost inaudible - it's almost completely buried in the surround mix.2) The audio quality varies wildly as Tarkin says the line: ""You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system."" - almost as if the master sound element was damaged. It's very distracting.3) Possibly most critically, John Williams' entire score for the film has been flipped in the rear channels, so that what should be the left rear channel is playing from the right rear channel (and vise versa). What this means is that the rear channels don't match the front channels - instruments heard from the front right channel come from the left rear instead of the right rear. Again, this is very distracting once you notice it.These problems are certainly severe enough in our opinion to merit a repressing/exchange of the disc. We're waiting to hear back from Lucasfilm on this issue and we'll update this review with the details as soon as we do.]"""	3.0	Audio Problem!	2004-09-20	55	49	6

Mainly, the fact that the light sabers in Episode IV are now actually blue, green, and red, as opposed to how they looked in the original.  I'm glad that the one scene of the Emperor of Episode V has been re-done.  I loved the fact that Hayden Christensen appeared at the end of Episode VI instead of some goofy-looking old man.  I mean, I will admit that Hayden Christensen is the worst actor in the world, but he's still Anakin.So, everyone get over yourselves.  Watch, love, and enjoy the DVDs because they are the best.	5.0	The Best Versions Ever	2004-09-26	13	5	8
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2VWPJGE6YSGAN	Kurgan	"**Update: There is little point in buying this set, now that the 2006 ""Limited Edition"" sets are out... all you get with this package is the ""Bonus Materials"" disc (which can be ordered separately here on Amazon most of the time, or Ebay) and a cheap, flimsy cardboard box to put the three packages in. If you can't stand the Special Editions, avoid this set and get the 2006 sets instead. Although those sets are ""Limited Edition"" they are still being sold as of this writing**First off, yes, I am a Star Wars fan, and yes I own these films on DVD, VHS, and watch them regularly. This is NOT a rambling denunciation of the Special Editions or a rant against George Lucas, so please bear with me if you are an honest customer seeking real info, let me explain myself:Of the official DVD sets that exist currently, this is the one to get. Why? It includes a fourth, bonus disc, that is great for the 3.5 hour documentary ""Empire of Dreams"" and the smaller mini behind the scenes specials. The ""Episode III Teaser"" is fluff, as are many of the other ""bonus features"" which include the space filler Star Wars Battlefront II trailer and Xbox only 1 level demo.. an overhyped and sadly buggy game, and a fluff video for the overhyped Episode III:Revenge of the Sith console game). The screenshot galleries are nice, but everyone who wanted to see deleted scenes was disappointed, though many little hints can be found in the nice trailers section).In 1997 George Lucas released the Star Wars Trilogy on the big screen again after 11 years (since the last re-release of Return of the Jedi). Many fans were upset over the Special Edition changes like Greedo suddenly taking a wild shot at Han Solo, some CGI Banthas wandering around for no reason, Jabba the Hutt's new musical theater, flute music replacing the Ewok song, a poorly done Jabba the Hutt scene with redundant dialouge and many other goofs as well as nice things like pretty new skylines on Cloud City and enhanced CGI space combat around the Death Star.Seven years later, Lucas decided to release the films on DVD, but he would not just release them as the 1997 Special Editions, but as a ""new"" set that was supposedly even closer to his ""original vision"" and what he ""always intended"" the movies to be.But that is NOT what I'm going to get into with this review. That debate has been beaten to DEATH, and the most serious fans have already encoded their Laser Disc versions of the ORIGINAL original trilogy and made them into home-made DVDs, and even made fan edits of their own ""special edition"" to view alongside or instead of these new incarnations.Some will complain (as Roger Ebert does) that these movies have lost some of their ""film quality"" in the transfer process. It is well known among cinemaphiles that Films (that is, movies shown on celluloid) have natural imperfections in the medium, commonly known as ""film grain."" This ""gritty sand"" that is subtly noticable in movies is normal. Movies shot on Video tape (commmonly called ""video"" as opposed to ""film"") do not exhibit this texture. Likewise digital video such as movies shot entirely on digital ""tape"" like Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith do not have film grain. Perhaps in an effort to make the visual look of these movies more closely ""Match"" the prequels on DVD, the grain was mostly ""removed"" from this set. Some purist may criticize this. It is not my desire to do so in this review, but it is something worth noting. If film grain is something you can't live without, avoid this set.Rather (sorry to get through this long introduction but this is Star Wars, the product with the most replies, I might as well make this UNIQUE right?), here are the reasons this set FAILS to be the ULTIMATE HOME EDITION OF STAR WARS we've all dreamed of owning:1- The colors. Yes, Lowry Digital did a bang up job ""restoring"" the Trilogy so that they almost look like modern movies shot last week instead of movies shot 20 years ago. However, they used an automated process to save time and money and unfortunately this system was not quite perfect, so the color timing is way off in many scenes throughout the 6 hours of the Star Wars saga. You want examples? Sam Davatchi's page has well documented these but sadly his web page is down, but many thumbnails of his pics can be seen via google image search. But in any case, they exist, and here are some examples:- Blue Rebel Soldiers. In a few shots of the Rebel soldiers who try to hold off the Stormtroopers in Episode IV, their outfits look blue. They are actually supposed to be gray, but some shots the blue level is too high.- Weird lightsaber colors. This is most commonly noticed with regards to Darth Vader's lightsaber (which is supposed to be RED). Often times it turns pink or violet for no reason, and then will be red in the next shot. Too much blue, or not enough red. In a few shots in Episode V, Darth Vader's saber turns orange (when he leaps at Luke in their first fight in the ""carbon freeze chamber"" and when he puts his saber up to Luke in ""the cave"" on Yoda's Dagobah). Luke's lightsaber in Episode IV, while on the Falcon appears green in the far shot (compare this to the menu version of the same shot on the Bonus Disc, also compare to animated menu for that same scene in the ANH menus), when it should be blue. Luke's saber (the one Ben Kenobi says belonged to his father), is shown blue when he first swings it around in Ben's hut at the beginning of the movie. It's then bright green on the Falcon. Then it turns a blue/green color for the rest of the scene, except the last part of the ""wearing the helmet with the blast shield down"" training scene where Luke ""starts to get the hang of it"" when it is the proper blue color. In the original versions, the lightsaber was always blue, though the color faded over time to almost white in many of these shots. The automatic color balancing tool they used obviously decided green was the proper color and goofed up most of these shots. One can compare the lightsaber Luke uses in Episode V (storywise it's supposed to be the same one, and it's ALWAYS blue). Finally, in Episode IV, in the otherwise awesomely done ""enhanced"" lightsaber battle (the lightsabers are recolored to match the rest of the movies) between Vader and Kenobi, Vader's saber appears violet/pink in several shots, while red in a few others. There are one or two far shots (when the Stormtroopers are coming over to watch the fight) where Vader and/or Kenobi's sabers are still unpainted where Lowry Digital forgot to repaint them as they did all the other shots, so they appear as white sticks. In a quick shot where Kenobi's saber infamously ""shorts out"" as he's facing the camera and swinging at Vader, Lowry Digital added a glow, but forgot to color the white ""core"" of the saber, so it still appears to be a prop rod, rather than a fantasy energy blade.A final lightsaber note. This is just ""one scene"" and so it has been heavily critized by some fans as being unimportant. I could argue for dramatic and story purposes it is VERY IMPORTANT, and so to screw it up visually is unforgiveable here. In any case, in the scene in Episode VI, when Luke swings his lightsaber at the Emperor and Darth Vader ""blocks"" it with his own lightsaber, and the two blades ""cross"" in front of the Emperor's cackling face... something strange happens. In previous versions, Luke's green blade is blocked by Vader's red blade, and they merge into a ""white"" area. The Emperor's face is lit up, and what appear to be black ""slugs"" appear on his face (this was actually a last minute touch up during the original film to cover open areas of light reflection off the unmade-up portions of the actor's face and hood). Probably in an effort to remove the ""Emperor's slugs"" (the fan name for these odd black blobs that appear on his face) Lowry Digital's tool made the scene very very dark, much darker than normal. As a result, the lightsabers appear more ""solid"" and less white. In fact, so much so, that Vader's saber appears to be IN FRONT OF LUKE'S (that is, Luke's green blade is closer to the Emperor's face than Vader's). This would lead some to suspect that the story has been changed... Luke was not trying to attack the Emperor and Vader defending. Rather Luke was ""blocking"" Vader from killing his own master! Wow! And all this because they wanted to remove the slugs by making it too dark, rather than removing them digitally (cheap way out leads to a greater problem). Now on the user end one can ""fix"" this problem by upping the brightness of their display considerably, and the lightsabers appear correct. However this makes the rest of the movie too bright, and makes obvious ""garbage mattes"" (VFX artifacts that appear as light green, blue or gray ""boxes"" around starships as they were blue/green screened into composite shots) that would normally ""disappear"" in a properly darkened screen stand out like sore thumbs. One more visual glitch that detracts from an otherwise phenomenal experience.- Pink or Red? Like the Darth Vader lightsaber issue, this one is all over the map as well. When ""blasters"" or ""turbo lasers"" fire red shots (everybody fires red except for Imperial starships and starfighters which fire green), they are sometimes the proper red, and sometimes a more pink/violet color. This goes also for explosions which appear violet that were previously red/orange in other releases. But the blaster shots are the most obvious gaffe since they are supposed to be weapon that doesn't change color at random (just like Lightsabers).- Tammy Faye Leia. Look at Princess Leia's makeup job in the early scenes in Episode IV. Also look at her makeup when she dons ""forest gear"" for their mission to Endor in Episode VI. That makeup looks REALLY caked on. She's like a white ghost. Her skin is pasty and pale. She does not look this bad in the originals. Rather this is due to the color balancing goofing up with either too much white (light balance) or too much pink. In the shots in Episode IV, her face is often the only ""colored"" object in the room (everything else is either white, or black like Vader's armor). They mistimed this.- True Blue R2. This is primarily confined to Episode IV, but watch those shots of R2D2 wandering in the desert after the droids' ""escape pod"" lands. R2D2 is a frighteningly bright shade of blue. This is not correct. The original prop/costume (whatever you want to call that rig they forced Kenny Baker Jr. to ride around in for his part) is not bright plastic blue, but a kind of dark blue finish that appears almost black except when the light shines on it. The color timing obviously made a choice thinking this was ""wrong"" and upped the blue, making it now loud and painful on the eyes. The same can be see with the blue object attached to the escape pod noticable in the shots when the droids are first setting out into the sands. It is the same blue color as R2D2. Originally it was much darker in color (I assume this is supposed to be a ""parachute"" of the pod). Lowry made sure to fix a few ""space"" shots of R2D2 that originally showed him with Black decals (this was because the blue screen effect used sucked all the color out of R2D2 and they didn't have time to painstakingly put it back in the originals). But they neglected others. So as a result you will sometimes see the exterior of Luke's ship with R2D2 and he's bright blue. Other times, he's black (and not the dark blue he should be always).- Yoda. Yes, Yoda is made to appear VERY green in Episode V and VI. However at the expense of the rest of the scenes he's in. He was actually a bit more blue and even brown in the original movies. As a result, everything else in the scenes looks too green. They probably did this in the hopes of making him look as vibrantly green as he was in the Prequels. But it's not quite right, and jars with the otherwise drab blueish background of Dagobah. Much of Empire Strikes Back relies on the blue color scheme, which is now a bit more green than before.- Death Star explosion. Okay this one really bugs me. Take a look at the explosion of Alderaan in Episode IV. It's a big orange/red/yellowish fiery blast. Okay. Now compare the Death Star blowing up in the same movie. It's WHITE. Okay, some people said ""well the death star is a cold artificial thing, so maybe it just blows up white."" The trouble is in the earlier verisons of the movie the Death Star explosion was the same color scheme roughly as Alderaan. And now check the Death Star II explosion on this set, and what do you find? Nice red/orange/yellowish fiery explosion again! So this was another color timing error. And for those who still need proof, watch the Episode IV Death Star explosion closely. On the outer right edge of the explosion you'll see some obvious, bad blue screen artifacting (looks like blue glow). That wasn't there before! Lowry Digital screwed up again.2-Sound issues:Now this one 20th Century Fox actually commented on, and many of us smelled BS. Basically here is what they said:""Thanks for being so observant, the audience really is listening, these were DELIBERATE CREATIVE DECISIONS."" And then just turned away.Here are the issues, and I'll explain why their excuse is suspect (these are all relating to Episode IV):- In Episode IV, the stereo channels are reversed. Why is this a ""creative decision""? Isn't it rather, ""incorrect""? An object you see moving on your right, but sounds like it's moving on your left is a gaffe, isn't it?- When Govenor Tarkin is talking to Princess Leia on the Death Star, he says ""You prefer another target... then name the system! I grow tired of asking..."" notice in his speech that the vocal quality of those lines changes rapidly. Sometimes there is a noticable ""hiss"" behind his lines and other times not. The DVD authors forgot to balance the lines properly so they are all at the same vocal level. This was not part of earlier versions of Star Wars. Likewise notice that whenever Leia speaks in the parts of this conversation suddenly you hear a tape hiss in the background of her lines. It's very noticeable if you have your speakers turned up. Is this also a ""creative decision"" to make the lines sound more like artificial recordings than natural speech?Finally, the biggest complaint people had, which is most easily recognizable and puts the nail in the ""creative decision"" excuse's coffin, is that ""horns"" incident with the attack on the Death Star. This is often referred to as the famous ""Force fanfare"" (I think). When Red Leader is saying ""...wait for my signal to start your attack run"" and then you get a dramatic shot of the X-Wings looping around in formation to swing into the Death Star trench for the first time. You here a big ""DUN DUN DUH DUN DUN DUN!"" in the music. But in the regular audio tracks, this is completely drowned out by loud engine noise from the fighters, so it almost appears to be WITHOUT music (it's actually still there, just much quieter than before). Creative decision? At first glance, however if you switch from the English to the FRENCH sound track (which is available on Region 1 DVD's at least), suddenly you hear the proper ""horns"" playing during this same section.So is Fox saying that French people must hear the scene as it was for twenty years, but English and Spanish speakers must now get only loud engines? Something is fishy at Fox studios!One could go on and complain about the poor line delivery of Ian McDiarmond (compared to Clive Revil) in his new scene as the Emperor (his voice actually cracks when he says ""he could destroy us"") or the bored mechanical way that supposed villian Boba Fett delivers his lines in the redubbed by Teumora Morrison scenes also of Empire Strikes Back, but then certain fans could get the satisfaction that I'm complaining ONLY because Lucas keeps altering his movies, and I must just be upset about the Special Edition. So I won't. Rather, I comment on the actual GAFFES in this release, which were not in previous Special Editions, but are NEW, that we the purchasers of these DVD's get to experience for the first time, which should have been caught before release in testing.These color and sound issues issues are things you can't simply ignore when watching the films, so people buying this, even if they are devoted Lucasphiles who love every change he's ever made to Star Wars, need to consider this before they plunk down their change, thinking this will be the definitive home set of these classics.As a self-proclaimed ""visual filmmaker"" Lucas can't ignore these things, and really I think the rush-job to release these new DVD's out in time for a simultaneous release with Star Wars Battlefront (LucasArts actually reported a sales figure that COMBINED sales of the Trilogy DVD box set and the video game, and used this to claim that Star Wars Battlefront was the ""#1 best selling Star Wars game of all time""... can you say, fudge marketing??). It's too bad they didn't go back and repair the damage in the 2005 re-issue.I would recommend this WideScreen set over the ""2005 (repackaged) Edition."" Despite much of the bonus disc being fluff and lacking many features fans truly wanted (like actual deleted scenes and commentary that wasn't 50% Ben Burtt gushing about his sound effects skills, which are admittedly amazing of course).Also, this set, despite the cool looking silver packaging, is actually rather cheaply put together. It's thin cardboard, and you'll be lucky to purchase one that isn't already dented and banged up some by the time you get it home. Thankfully the amray cases inside are just fine (the artwork may not be to everyone's taste, but fan covers on the internet are plentiful, I wouldn't recommend buying the 2005 edition just for the artwork, unless you think losing the disc of extras is worth it).So let the Buyer Beware, and don't shoot the messenger! ;)"	3.0	Star Wars Special Edition Version 2.0: Glitches Marr an Otherwise Awesome Set	2006-04-06	24	20	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1HY4CVW8K1QFQ	Kurt Lennon	"With the progressively worsening prequel trilogy about to end, it seemed only fair to release the original trilogy masterpiece as it was released in 1977. Imagine the collective gasp of all true fans when the beloved trilogy was released twenty years later in a ""special edition"" that continued Lucas' penchant for overwhelming computer effects. Tampering with history and many peoples' beloved past and childhood memories.The news gets worse now that the long-awaited DVD release of these movies comes ONLY with these special editions. I am sure I'm not alone in thinking that the special editions did very little to improve the movie, and actually did more damage than benefit: you might as well go back and re-touch ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Citizen Kane"". It would seem trivial to many, but to huge fans of the movie that brightened up their Saturdays so long ago, it is close to criminal.Apparently, the '97 editions were themselves works in progress, with huge changes expected for the rumoured ""Ultimate Collection"" or whatever it's called once the prequel trilogy is completed. If this is the case, I certainly won't be buying that box set: it's already bad enough to be subjected to the '97 editions as the only choice for a DVD purchase. The three stars I'm assigning this project are purely for the original trilogy's genius. George Lucas had captured lightning in a bottle in these three movies, and has gone to great lenghts to tear away at their legacy and brilliance. Terrible prequels that might as well have no real actors at all; increasingly wooden dialogue (even more than the original, that was their only minor flaw); tampering with the originals as the only options for a DVD purchase: stop screwing us over, Lucas."	3.0	Why the '97 Special Editions??	2004-04-04	12	10	2

I liked the improvements. I saw them as mostly aesthetic. I see the WHOLE MOVIES as mostly aesthetic. The plots aren't all that complex. The reason they're so mythological is because, at their core, myths aren't all that complex. They don't need to be. I don't want to analyze Han Solo's motivations; I want to see him blow stuff up. Some people obviously disagree, but that's because they're so far into this &quot;Star Wars is our modern mythology&quot; baloney that for them, changing Star Wars is like changing the Scriptures. As the producer, George Lucas reserves the right to tweak his movies and characters any way he wants. He can turn Han Solo into a good guy, bad guy, or even make Chewbacca into Han's girlfriend if he wants to. If we don't like it, too bad. Why are we putting all our mental energy into the Star Wars universe when we should be making up our own universes anyway?	5.0	It's not even released yet...	2004-08-02	17	7	10
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A32MLC9P9ULQXM	K. Wood	"The bonus discs contain the real version of the movies. The scrolling text at the beginning of Episode IV doesn't say ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" just ""Star Wars."" It's even the ""old"" Anakin beside Kenobi and Yoda at the end of ""Return of the Jedi,"" not the ""new"" Anakin from the prequel trilogy. Especially since I largely just wanted to get a good condition version of our old VHS tapes, I was happy to find the movies here, even if I had to buy the ""updated"" versions, too.The quality of the video might not be ""HD pristine"", but it's way better than our muddy VHS tapes, and on our screen they look great. Now we can actually see what's going on enough to just enjoy the story. Whether you like the light-saber battles, the weird creatures, the spaceships, or Leia's hairstyles, now you don't have to squint through the murk and guess what's going on. (Then again, maybe your VHS copies aren't as bad as ours...I can make no judgement on that.)Regardless, if you're looking for an undoctored copy of the movies that have become a major American cultural icon, this is probably as good a place as any to get it. The container tin is cool, and holds the three separate cases of discs. Plus, as a sort-of ""bonus feature"" you get the updated versions of the movies on the ""main feature"" disc, if you care about that."	4.0	It's the Original	2012-12-25	2	1	1

Gendron	"For those who are ""complaining"" about these really are not the ""origional"" versions of Star Wars, keep in mind that when George Lucas first made Star Wars: A New Hope, he made an incomplete movie. He knew that there were some scenes in this movie that he would not be able to finish the way he ""origionally"" intended because of the limited technology back in the mid 1970's. Now some 25 years later, technology has advanced enough that he is now capable of completeing the movies the way he intended.These are George Lucas' movies. He wrote and produced them and even directed the first one. They are still his movies and now he is completing them the way he wants.Don't forget about the scene in A New Hope when Han Solo meets up with Jabba the Hut at Moss Eisley Space Port. That scene was not in the origional theater release, but it was filmed during the making of the movie fully knowing that that scene would not be able to be completed for another 20 years.The DVD version of these movies will be great. I couldn't wait to see the movie when I saw the first trailors back when I was a kid in the 70's and now I can't wait till Sept 21 for the DVD release."	5.0	Loved it then, will love it now	2004-07-19	10	1	9

We PAY HIM for the PRIVELEDGE of watching them.""As for the SE, they are all superior to the originals.  As for the ""Greedo shot first, so Han was defending himself, and wasn't redeemed at the end"" argument.  GREEDO WAS POINTING A BLASTER AT THE MAN IN BOTH VERSIONS, IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE EITHER WAY (if you have any other arguments against this please e-mail me...seriously, I don't believe an argument that dumb could be what's fueling this complaint, I must be missing something)!Now, while I was re-watching these movies for the Idon'tknowhowmanyeth time (although I haven't watch them much in the last few years, since my copy of ANH broke), something happened.  While I have always enjoyed both trilogies, they finally came together.  And not just the Special Editions, but scenes that remained exactly as they were in the original became part of a larger saga.  Suddenly Darth Vader was transformed into Anakin Skywalker (as was reinforced by the new ending).  I began to see touches of Amidala in Leia, and Luke became a mixture of his father from both ""Phantom Menace"", and ""Attack of the Clones"".These movies are the greatest ever made.  In fact the Star Wars saga is currently composed of the five greatest movies ever made in reverse order (""Return of the Jedi"" being the best, and ""Phantom Menace"" being number five).By the way, Jarjar is no goofier in the new movies than C-3PO was in the old ones."	5.0	LONG LIVE THE SPECIAL EDITIONS!	2004-10-11	22	7	15

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2OG4TLCXX4JV9	Lambros Panayi	"It's here at last, the original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. As you all know George Lucas originally insisted that these films wouldn't see the light of day on DVD until after Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. But he found time, and I am pleased to say that they look better than ever!The picture and sound quality on each of the films is nothing short of breathtaking! They genuinely do look like new films. I think that Episode 4: A New Hope has still faired better, though. Like that bit when Vader force chokes that man on the Death Star. The loud humming in the background whilst he is doing it nearly broke my speakers, and it is quite scary. I think that's the sound of his dark power.Obviously, as I'm sure everyone knows, these are not the original editions, but the special editions with a few more fixes. And what is my personal opinion on that? THANK YOU, GEORGE!I think a lot of people seem to be forgetting that these are not OUR films, but that they are GEORGE LUCAS' films. Yes, even the two that he didn't direct. They belong to him. He's an artist, and he is welcome to keep on making more fixes until he is happy with how they look.It makes me sick when I see people who state that they love the original versions, and then they give these DVD's one star ratings. Why, may I ask? They are still the same films that you grew up with, it's just that visually speaking they are now ten times better.Okay, I'll level with you. I wasn't even born when any of the originals came out in the cinema. But when I fell in love with them, which was in the early 90's, it was with the original editions. So the special editions in 1997 were the first time that I ever saw them on the big screen. And I remember thinking to myself, ""Wow, George hasn't only cleaned up the picture quality and the sound, but he's genuinely made them much better films, even though they were flawless to begin with.""Oh, and just for the record, the change at the end of Episode 6: Return of the Jedi makes a whole lot of sense. You can really see what George is trying to say about the Anakin/Vader storyline. And also, this change fits in very nicely with the new Emperor dialog in Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back.So all in all, these DVD's are great! I am so pleased that the HOLY TRILOGY is finally on DVD. In my opinion, these are the definitive versions of the original trilogy. At least for the moment, anyway. Does 2007 ring a bell with anyone? It's the thirtieth anniversary. That's all I'll say on that matter.Enjoy."	5.0	Star Wars Trilogy	2004-09-24	17	7	10

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1004AX2J2HXGL	Lao Che	"I wonder if the changes were made to intentionally detract from the quality of the originals, bringing them a little closer to their deformed second cousins, the prequels.  Yes?  No?  I will admit a few of the cosmetic adjustments were nice.  However, most of the obvious changes, especially to IV, were bad.  Greedo shooting first and the additional scene with Jabba, for me, were reminiscent of the kind of stuff found in the later prequels.Han is a survivalist, who happens to have a bounty on his head.  Shooting first when confronted in a life-threatening situation is par for the course.  Right or wrong, it's the world he comes from; part of what makes him a compelling character.  Greedo shooting first deflates Han's first big ""solo"" scene on top of being poorly ""updated"" by Lucas: Greedo takes his shot while sitting only a few feet from his target, his blaster already drawn and sighted -- and managed to only hit the wall?  Then there is inserting Jabba into IV.  Why?  It added nothing and detracted everything.  Introducing a character far in advance of them making an actual appearance gives them more dramatic weight (no pun intended); Jabba was more affective as the unseen menace before his entrance in Return of the Jedi.  Besides, we receive all the exposition we need about Jabba and Han in the scene with Greedo; so why add a scene that just slows the story?  Finally, like the scene with Greedo, the CGI is poorly done: Jabba looks more like a cartoon character found on a cereal box than the ruthless, sniveling monster we later see.Recently, I caved and bought the Blu-ray set with just IV, V and VI, which look stunning on Blu-ray.  The three-pack only has the commentaries and includes DVD of each one.  The prequels have a couple of great moments, however I found them ultimately unsatisfying and over-produced.  I'm guessing George Lucas just figures the original versions will fade away from the collective memory, overtaken by his Disney-fied reimagining of them.  Luckily, I grabbed the Star Wars DVD releases that contained the unedited versions as bonus discs back in 2008.Whimsical aside: I once imagined Jar-Jar sitting on the floor in front an enormous, blazing fireplace at Skywalker Ranch, dumbly picking through the pieces of a child-sized jigsaw puzzle; George Lucas looks on lovingly from a distant staircase, reimagining his beloved in a new movie from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."	3.0	Triumph of the Shill	2013-10-27	8	5	3

As you can probably tell , I already did MY research and found out that the original movies were not going to be released but the 1997 ""special editions"", with their awful CGI effects as well as a few new ones. You all know what I mean by now. And I swore that I was not going to fall into that trap and spend 42.99 for the  altered versions and would rather go to my storage space and dig up my laserdiscs of them instead and watch the ORIGINAL films. But since they stopped making laserdiscs back in 1997 and it was no way as popular as DVD, most of you don't know that laserdisc had a much better picture than VHS and had analog video and digital sound.So if all you loyal , faithful fans of the original films want to see the ORIGINAL films, instead of these bastardized versions, just go on ebay and get a used (or I've even seen New) laserdisc player and all 3 films on laserdisc, so you can watch them over and over again.The originals with a much better picture than VHS, iI said!It will cost you more than 42.99 or whatever you paid for the DVDs with their alterations, but will be worth it."	1.0	Original versions available on Laserdisc, remember them?	2004-09-23	12	0	12

Yes, you get the original, un re-mastered version on one side, and the newly re-mastered on the other side. Don't get me wrong, the re-mastered version looks amazing, EXCEPT it has the deleted/additional scenes in it that weren't in the original.  I think the deleted addional scenes are stupid and ruin the films. George Lucas has become an expert at ruining his classic works of art with the new trilogy as well.  So yeah, I may still have the original version on one side, but it's not remastered and it looks like I'm watching it from a VHS. Why they couldn't just take the re-mastered version and cut out the stupid scenes is beyond me.  I was so excited for this to come out....what a bummer	2.0	Big Disappointment	2008-11-08	4	3	1

If these Ewoksplayed such a huge part in the Return Of The Jedi movie, then whycan't these 2 movies be considered episodes 8 and 9? They are thesame Ewoks, not a cheap cartoon, and deserve to be part of thecontinuing saga.)Since George Lucas has now declared there will not be anymore Star Warsmovies, just the continuing cartoon series, like The Clone Wars, I have declared the above 9 episodes to now be the complete Star Wars chronicles- and it cannot and will not ever be changed.***** UPDATE:  July 1st, 2013 - It now seems that after 4 seasons of the animated series THE CLONE WARS, George Lucas will now allow Hollywood to make more sequels of Star Wars... he was paid millions.

These were the films that ignited a science fiction craze that continues over three decades later.  Good vs Evil, heroes and villains and a heroine with spunk.  Robots that elicit humor and incredible battle scenes and deep human emotion.  Lucas can retouch them with new and better sfx but the basic wonderful films are there.  For me the best will always remain THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  A must for any sci-fi library.  Funny when you realize this came about because Lucas couldn't get the rights to do FLASH GORDON !!!  Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Lia, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader ... classic characters for the ages. A Young Man who becomes a Man and goes the path his Father could not follow.

It is probably better quality but I don't have BluRay and never will.* This set of the original Trilogy has both versions of the movies: 1) The original version seen in the theater, 2) The remastered versions with new scenes released in the late 1990s.  There are two discs for each movie.* The movies are in letterbox format so they do not fill up a modern wide screen HD television.  Its a negative if you are one of these over-the-top people whose life is consumed by not getting everything you want all the time.I gave this four stars only because of the dated letterbox format.  Otherwise, the picture is great and the sound is great.  My kids love it and I love it.Also, we bought a used version which from this seller seemed brand new and was shrink wrapped.

"I recently rewatched the entire Star War trilogy ('Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' & 'Return of the Jedi', in that order) on cable TV, which I had watched in the cinema in the late seventies & early eighties.  'Star Wars' movies have never ceased to entertain as well as inspire me from the very beginning & I have always thought that they provide valuable learning points, especially in terms of life (survival) skills.Among the three movies, I would like to single out my favourite, 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', especially some related scenes involving Luke Skywalker & the Yoda Master. [The story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo & his sidekick, Chewbacca, the droids R2D2 & C3PO, Princess Leia and the rebels didn't end with the destruction of the Death Star in the earlier movie - it continues in 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', where the battle to save the galaxy from the evil Darth Vader rages on.]Luke was unable to get his X-wing fighter out of the swamp. Yoda, using the Force, effortlessly got it out of the swamp. Witnessing the scenario, Luke remarked: ""I don't believe it!"". The response from Yoda was fast & to the point: ""That's why you fail!""A lot of the times in life we fail to achieve what we have set out to do is because we fail to believe we can do it.  This is very true, especially for kids & teens when they encounter stumbling blocks or set backs in their path to achieving their fondest dreams.That's why, Anthony Robbins, a top-ranked peak performance coach in the industry,& author of 'Awaken the Giant Within', often shares this profound observation in his books as well as his Mastery University seminars:""Personal breakthroughs come from change in personal beliefs!""When he was nineteen years old, Arnold Schwarzenegger, came to United States with only a dream & a belief that he could become Mr Universe. [He achieved the title five times.]  He revealed in his autobiography, Education of a Body Builder: ""As long as you can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it - as long as you really believe it 100 per cent.""There are other interesting learning points from the Yoda Master: (Here are just some of them)- Yoda: ""Conbtrol, control. You must learn control!""- Yoda: ""You must unlearn what you have learnt.""- Yoda: ""Size matters not..."" (as he responded to Luke: ""I can't. It's too big!"")- When Luke yelled: ""All right. I'll give it a try."" The rebuttal from Yoda was fast & furious: ""No. Try not. Do or do not! There's no try.""Even the primary antagonist in the movies, Darth Vader, has something to share with all of us:  His character trait of laser-focused, singled-minded, dogged determination to pursue & wipe out the rebels - no matter where they are -is worth emulating! Although he deservedly failed at the end, he practised what he believed!So, Mums & Dads out there, if you want your kids & teens to learn valuable life (survival) skills, go & watch the Star Wars trilogy with them!"	5.0	You can learn a lot of valuable life (survival) skills from Star Wars!	2007-02-05	4	2	2

Everybody seems to hate them! Personally I think they add a whole new (better dimension) to the movies and make them more of a joy to watch. They can help you connect more between the prequel trilogy and the original which simply wasn't happening with the original theatrical version. I especially like the scene from The Empire Strikes Back which they've touched up. Instead of having some other actor playing The Emperor as it was originally they have the proper Emperor (Ian Mcdiarmid). This scene was only short and the Emperor was a hologram speaking to Darth Vader but none the less, the scene is much much better now! There're many other scene's like this as well which really makes these DVD's a thrill to watch for the first time. And as for you people criticising George Lucas? If it wasn't for him you wouldn't even have the theatrical versions alright? Just you try coming up with a multi-million dollar film franchise! And anyway, they are his films to change if he wants to change them. His!But for those of you seeking to perhaps buy a copy, please (if you've got the cash) just go out and get the bloody things! They are three fantastic films which can be enjoyed over and over again and the special features are really interesting to watch (sneak preview of EPISODE 3!).

Maybe an ""artist"" does have the right to change his own work, but I think it's a shame that so many fans are being robbed of these beloved classics.

I consider the original Star Wars films to be classics, but my knowledge of the Star Wars 'universe' is hardly up to expactations. Even so, I consider Lucas's edits and changes to be offensive. So... All you psychologically abused elitists who rant on about ""LolO sTOp coMPLainiGn StAr WErs NerdS"" can be quiet.As one 'genius' raves, ""GORGE LOOKAS HAS TEH ARTISTIC FREEDOM!! HE MADE TEH MOVAYS NOT U!""Very true. He has the right to make his movies crap, and we, the consumers, have the right to state the fact that these new 'special editions' ARE crap.Everyone I've seen ranting on about 'artistic freedom' completely miss the point, because they're too busy consuming Lucas's half-*ssed edited garbage.Overall, Lucas is an egomaniacal hack who refuses to put in minimal effort to please his REAL fans.. Instead, he'd rather advertise his terrible prequels in the context of once-great films, and edit ""ADULFT CONTENTW@1"".Absolutely terrible.

Was waiting for a 3D version but gave up.  Looks good on a large flat screen as hoped.  Color and clarity are good, sound level of music and weapon battles has to be toned down from voice speaking levels at times (not to disturb neighbors)  but is probably how it was in the theater.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1SMK9VPCB6LLP	Linwood Little	For fans of the trilogy the first noticable edition besides clean up, has been complete scene touch ups. One key scene (one that this writer was glad to see) was the redux of Vader's conversation with the Emperor from Empire Strikes Back (V). That bug eyed version of the Emperor is no more! The Rancor scene (the creature attempting to have Luke for lunch in VI)has been enhances. The original scene had noticable black lines in shots with Luke (Mark Hamil). Some add-ons raise a brow even among huge fans. The inclusion of a young Anakin (Hayden Christensen)standing next to a much older Obi Wan, and Yoda doesn't add up when you consider that Anakin died an older man. It wouldn't be the first time that George Lucas made a questionable change. The Special Editions (once officially part of the saga) were themselves the debate of both fans and fellow directors. Lucas will likely continue to make changes as he sees fit. As fans will simply stand in line. Changes or no, it's Star Wars and that's all I need.	4.0	The special edition's special edition	2005-04-24	7	5	2

"I was too young to watch Episodes IV and V in the bigscreen, but one of my most vivid childhood memories consisted of watching Episode VI in the theater and being utterly amazed.  I will always remember the Episode VI musical numbers with great nostalgia, for all their corniness and camp.Though I understand the frustration that George Lucas must have felt when he couldn't realize his vision completely because of a lack of technology, I still wish that he would have had more consideration for his original fan-base when he released, under great anticipation, the Original StarWars Trilogy.  It was disappointing to  see scenes that were particularly nostalgic for me doctored up or just eliminated.  While I understand that the new version of the films maybe closer to Lucas' original vision for the films and that new fans have been exposed to a wonderful trilogy because of these advancements, it would be nice if Lucas could follow Peter Jackson's approach regarding film versions.  Both versions of each of the LOTR films are available for fans and Lucas should follow suit.  I'm not quite sure why he hasn't adopted this policy, since it would only provide him more money in the long run, as well as pleasing both the old and new fans.Until that time, however, when I want a DVD experience, I watch the new version, fast-forwarding through the new scenes that have replaced the ones I dearly missed.  Yes, I miss the lippy muppet lady singing in a strange language that seems an odd mix of Spanish meets Russian.  Being a musician, I think it a more creative and musically more interesting composition than the new musical number. But when I want to relive those special scenes, the scenes that enspire that wry grin that recalls ""youth"", ""silliness"", and I believe Lucas' ingenuity to make due and create a wonderful story with what he had, I revert back to a set of very old, very worn video tapes.  Thank goodness they still make VCRs.  Don't get me wrong, there are parts of the new version that I think are great; the addition of more creatures being one.So, please, new fans, don't think that we old fans are nuts or just not open to change.  Just imagine, in 15-20 years, when there is a new form of video technology and Lucas comes out with a new version of STARWARS, and again changes the movie, and doesn't release the version you grew to love and respect.  Maybe then, you'll understand why we are so disappointed and sad, and why we've reviewed this trilogy so poorly."	3.0	Growing up with the old version...	2005-07-22	6	6	0

Where another reviewer chastised ""old school"" Star Wars fans for not liking this change, he kept commenting about how the old films looked worse than today's films, as if that justified such a change. He missed the point.The point being that new, better looking special effects do not a story make. Maybe some equate eye-candy with quality, but for those with more discernment, we realize that the story is the story, with or without fancy special effects. We don't need to see Hayden's face to appear in Jedi to connect the prequels with the ""old"" films. Alas, maybe some do, but for those of us who grew up with Star Wars (or just grew up), we can bridge the gap and see all six movies as one whole. I would challenge the previous reviewer to recognize that Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is a character, he's not Hayden C. Hayden C. is an actor. Hayden's face does not need to be seen for grown-ups to realize that Darth Vader once was Anakin Skywalker. Lucas' addition of his face is basically saying to the fans: ""I think you're all too stupid to realize what's what unless I spoon-feed you and use imagery to hold your hands, since seeing a different face on the 'restored' Anakin in Jedi will confuse you all."" In the case of those who like this change, maybe he's right...I wonder how long before he re-releases another set of DVDs with the current Obi-Won's face superimposed over that of Alec Guiness. After all, wouldn't that add to the continuity as well? At least, for those who need it?"	3.0	Some People Just Don't Get It....	2004-09-10	34	29	5

Star Wars was originally a feat of innovation, and relying on cgi effects is far from the brilliance Lucas and co. were once forced to conjure.I pay close attention to sound, and I noticed that sometimes the voice overdubs, mainly on Lea's, will sound crystal clear, and some of the other characters have that muffled, 70's film quality, which I don't mind a bit. I just say do them all over or don't do them at all.Also, pay close attention to the Millennium Falcon vs. Ti-Fighters and you can see flaws around some of the Ti-Fighters as they fly around Han and Luke.It's a DVD for chrissake!

And Jedi had a fine and compelling plot, the Ewoks were comidy relief.  Some critics should take a refreasher course in theator, drama, and the newances of plot.  Perhaps I'm not a tipical Star Wars fan--I liked Jar Jar Binks too--but I see no reason why the special edition should be considered any less than the original.	5.0	May the Force be with you!	2006-12-04	13	6	7

Mcgee ""movie maven"""	I recently viewed the new 2004 Star Wars Trilogy on DVD Box Set.The Star Wars I grew up with and loved is no more. The DVD's are simply another money making vehicle for Mr. Lucas. 'A New Hope', which use to be first, but is now fourth, has been enhanced even more since the 1997 re-release. The old and the new special effects don't work well together. It is cheesy. 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are really good. The special effects work well in the fifth? and sixth? installment.But, the very end of 'Return of the Jedi', when Luke witnesses the spirits of Obe-wan, Yoda, and Anakin, Luke sees Alec Guiness, The Yoda puppet, and...  Hayden Christiansen. After seeing that, I became disgusted. It should have been the old Anakin Skywalker standing with the old Yoda and old Obe-wan.The trilogy has no more meaning to it. You can't make a re-re-release too perfect without giving up something.	3.0	The Old Star Wars is No More.	2005-04-04	14	11	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1X0ZXZ4KZO2X5	"Locke Erasmus ""butterknife_mongoose"""	"Realistically, there is really no need for any sort of review on these films. The Star Wars franchise has long since crossed the line seperating ""movies"" from ""cultural phenomena."" Basically, if you are not at least passingly familiar with these films, then you probably are so completely out of touch with mainstream society that you don't own a computer, and are thus incapable of even reading this in the first place.That being said, I'll throw in my two cents, on the off chance that they'll actually matter to anyone.First of all, I am absolutely euphoric regarding the long-anticipated DVD release of the trilogy. Having one of history's most influencial and beloved films on a technologically superior (and more durable) format is simply wonderful. I don't particularly mind the delay - I concede that Lucasfilm probably wanted to make sure that the DVD format would ""stick"" in the popular market (especially after getting burned with the old Laserdisc release of the trilogy), and I for one am happy that they took their time to make sure that the DVD release was executed well. A number of films suffered (and many more were simply not helped in any way) from DVD conversion in the initial spate of DVD releases, and I personally would hate to see the same happen to some of my favortie movies of all time. And I remain optimistc that this delay time is being well-spent; I expect the Star Wars DVDs to be similar in quality and format to the recently-released Indiana Jones boxed set (i.e., the highest qulaity in an effective format). Besides, we all thought that we were going to have to wait until the conclusion of the prequel trilogy before we got the originals on DVD.As for the inclusion of the Special Editions rather than the original releases, I can't really complain there either. George Lucas considers the SE's to be the definitive versions of the films now. Who am I to second-guess what Mr. Lucas does with his own work? For better or for worse, the public is coming to regard the SE relaeses as the definitive versions of the film as well - to the point that people attribute additions to the Special Editions to original material that was removed (a la Luke's screaming in the Cloud City core - a sound effect only found in the Special Edition). Besides, what can visual effects, a sound effect here and there, and Greedo shooting first take away from the movies as a whole? All of the concepts, stories, settings, and characters that made us fall in love with these movies in the first place are all still there, and that's what really matters.So, if you'd rather shroud yourself in the nostalgia of bygone days, just sit in your room with the shades drawn, watching your copies of the orginal releases on VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc, whatever until they wear out. The rest of us will be watching the SAME MOVIES (with some MINOR amendments) in a better-supported and higher-quality format.

Now when I bought this I knew it was going to be the special editions we've all come to know and love as every fan would say, but Lucas has gone out of his mind with new revisions of a revision of a revision to the crazy Obi-Wan dragon call to the god awful Darth Vader going NOOOOOOOOO in Return of the Jedi. It's really just uncalled for and most of all just unwanted. But there is a plus to every wrong the movies look fantastic in 1080p and the sound is just fantastic and I still think every fan should see the Blu-Ray copies just for that.

I was not disappointed when it finally happend. The picture and sound are amazing. Just like new for me and even more exciting! There is a scene from A NEW HOPE that I was not thrilled about (Greedo) which Lucas changed in the SE. Also, a scene from ESB when the Falcon rescues Luke and they fly away but the action scene and fast paced music is interupted by Vader boarding the Destroyer and darker, slower music plays only to jump back into the Falcon fleeing the fighters on Bespin. This bugs me cus its a terrible interuption of an exciting moment. Other than those two issues, the dvds are fantastic! I like the fact that in RotJ the actor who originally played the ghost of Anakin was replaced with Hayden Christiansen. Returning back to his younger state when he still was somewhat of a good person. It brought the trilogies together some.I know people complain about things in SW that Lucas has changed, I am one of them at times, but could any of us have done any better?The Star Wars Trilogy dvds are a return to a galaxy far, far, away loaded with even more excitement and adventure and is brand new all over again.	5.0	Like seeing it for the first time all over again!	2005-06-29	6	3	3

Seeing it on my TV was one thing...seeing it in theaters for the first time in 1997 was something entirely different.Since that time, there have been several additions made to the trilogy, the latest being the ones made for this release.

Fabulous!  John Williams' score drives the entire film with the power of a modern symphonic masterpiece. A long, long time ago, I waited in lines to see the originals in 70mm Dolby--several times. The original mag tracks have been even further refined and the result is phenomenal. The Blu-ray version looks and sounds great.Regarding the authenticity of these re-releases, my sentiment leans towards ""does it really matter""? The CGI additions do not improve anything--but neither does it detract.This will not be  a satisfactory offering for film professors, students or archivists. Then again, we are not talking Citizen Kane here.

It looks like Lucas is still refusing to give us the true versions of the original trilogy in an acceptable presentation. His excuse is that restoring the original versions would be ""too expensive,"" which is ironic considering that he would make at least ten times the amount he will make by only releasing these butchered versions. Lucas isn't stupid, all he has to do is look at these Amazon reviews to see that 99% of the fanbase are demanding the original versions. The true reason he is refusing is because of ego and vanity. He refuses to admit that his special editions are highly inferior to the originals, and he knows that he would be admitting defeat by releasing the originals as well, because the originals would be the only versions that 99% of people would watch. Other, less egotistical directors don't care which version of their films you prefer which is why movies like Close Encounters, Blade Runner, and Alien give you the option to watch whichever version you want. Sorry, George, but we will never accept these cgi-ridden travesties, and that includes the terrible prequels as well, as the true Star Wars films.

Since these films (the original theatrical ones) were a big part of my childhood, I have to agree that I would like to have seen the ORIGINAL versions released on DVD.  However, being a parent of children that are quite interested in ALL of the episodes (the new 3 and the old 3), I believe that the new generation IS the reason for the digital remastering of these classic films.  When I purchased this boxed set I kept warning my kids, ""Remember, these films are real old and aren't going to look like the new ones with all the computer effects."". Then upon watching them I was thrown for a loop.  My kids had no complaints.  They actually told me that the movies didn't even look old.  So please keep in mind, for the consumer that sees these films as nostalgia, they will be disappointed.  But for the consumer that is supplimenting their video library to complete the Star Wars timeline for their children, EXCELLENT!!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"You might think a debate about which was the better movie, The Godfather, or Star Wars, might be a little strange, but I was discussing it with a friend tonight, and came up with some perhaps off the wall comments, so I thought I'd post them here. Interestingly, one can find Star Wars on some movie website's top 100 films, although usually, such as on the AFI (American Film Institute) website, if there's a great sci-film in the top 100, it's usually 2001.Although many people might not put the original Star Wars movies up there with the Godfather as films, they were, although perhaps not great flicks in the sense that they had great acting, a great plot, a great script and dialog and other traditional film values, still, they were a lot of fun and the special effects were terrific. If I want great acting, plots, and writing I can always rent Citizen Kane, Bad Day at Black Rock, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, etc.Most film historians would probably say 2001 is a greater sci-fi film, but it's a very different movie from Star Wars in that it's almost as much a mood piece as a sci-fi flick, and really gets by on the superb direction and vision of Kubrick, not because the plot or script or acting is that great. In fact, unless you read the original book, the ending is completely nonsensical (the whole Starchild thing is nonsensical anyway although I like Clarke).And as for the Godfather movies, it seems to me that all you had to do to make an impression in this movie was have an appropriately Mafioso-esque mug and demeanor (meaning that you look like you're going to kill the next guy who cuts ahead of you in line all the time) and go around with a beetled brow and a sedulous but crazed look in your eyes, occasionally shooting people in restaurants or in bars and such, and apparently that counts for great acting and atmosphere. No doubt there was some great acting in the movie by the admittedly notable cast, but sometimes the movie's reputation seemed to be as much the result of the shock effect of some of the more grisly violence scenes (such as the horse's head one) as anything else. In other words, lots of gatuitious sex, drugs, and violence in a movie for me doesn't automatically equate to great film-making, which is what seems to sell these days.Well, clearly I'm being a little facetious here. But also the question is a legitimate one, which is how one really objectively evaluates the aesthetic and dramatic qualities of films that are so different in one sense, and yet so much alike in another (all films basically simply being more visually dramatic presentations of your typical printed story). I don't pretend to know the answer to this question myself, except to say that what makes both novels and films different is easy to say, because of the problems in translating the book into a film, but what makes them truly great enough to stand out from the herd isn't always that easy to distinguish or to articulate.That having been said, I'm a great fan of the whole Star Wars trilogy and whether they are truly great movies or not doesn't really matter that much to me. Besides, people get snobbish about movies the same way they do about wines and such, and I think a movie should first and foremost be entertaining rather an attempt to create ""great art,""--whatever that might be--and the whole Star Wars trilogy had more of that as far as I'm concerned than ten of the greatest ""art"" flicks."	5.0	A perhaps odd comparison	2005-04-30	15	3	12

You might think these are copies of the first three theatrical releases of the Star Wars Trilogy, but they are not;  these are the ""upgraded versions"" of episodes IV, V, and VI.

I still have all my toys, I spent significant time and money as an adult making my own Boba Fett costume, and still seek out those Star Wars rarities on e-bay.  That being said, I must say that, while I'm not a huge fan of the majority of Lucas' changes to the trilogy, many of them are the result of what has occurred in Ep. I and II and probably III.  Ep. IV, V, and VI are now part of this larger saga.  The funny thing is that most of the people who are complaining, sobbing, and threatening the life of George Lucas were most likely peeing their pants in anticipation of Ep. I and II.  Then, when they saw that Ep. I (which was god-awful, I must admit) and II (which isn't nearly as bad as everyone likes to make it out to be) were not carbon copies of the original trilogy they declared their god (Lucas) dead and mourned the loss of their life's purpose.I can't believe I'm saying this, but THESE ARE JUST MOVIES!  They should not be your reason for being.  If you want to go a step further and call them the closest thing we have to a modern mythos, I'm with ya'.  But to not recognize that, without many of these changes, the FULL story would become very confusing and disjointed is to reject the mythos entirely.  If that's what you're willing to do, then I submit you are not a fan of Star Wars, but more a fan of your own conception of what Star Wars is, or was.  This is what we have to deal with.  THIS is Star Wars. From Jar-Jar (puke), to Boba Fett, this is what you have to accept as the full `Star Wars package'.  Besides, isn't there something kind of cool about seeing something for the billionth time and seeing something new?Look, I can definitely do without the Jabba scene in Docking bay 94 (""Jabba, you're a wonderful human being"" what the hell is that?  That doesn't even make sense!) And I can definitely do without the retarded dance scene in Jedi.

I personally own three versions of the film: the original release, the THX remastering and the special edition.  What does not cease to amaze me is, in spite of this, the never-ending complaining about the special editions.  *This* is how Lucas wanted the original films to look like and since this is *his* story, not yours, and he's allowed to do whatever he wants.Stop your whining.  Buy the DVDs or don't buy the DVDs, I don't think any of us really cares.  If you buy them and you still insist you need to watch the original version then dust off your VCR and pop the tapes in.

Anderson	"If you prefer the ""Special Editions"" or if you don't care one way or the other, then this is a great package because it doesn't contain the unnecessary extra features disc and is therefore cheaper.If you can't stand the ""Special Editions"" then don't get this.  I was very disappointed to realize that these are not the classic versions.If you are offended by a discussion of why the ""Special Editions"" have limited appeal then stop reading now.George Lucas owes everything he has to the success of one film: Star Wars (1977).  Without the success of that movie, Lucas wouldn't have been able to collaborate with Steven Spielberg on Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and outside of the Raiders and Star Wars franchises, Lucas is best known for American Graffiti and Willow.Star Wars was so far above other movies of the era that it deserves a special place in history.  It's not the best movie ever made and it certainly lacks the whiz-bang special effects that are possible today, but by the standards of the mid 70's it was like nothing else.  I'm not fanatical about the movie; I don't own a jedi robe nor can I recite every line of the script.  However, for me, and for a significant number of the fans that made the original movie a success back in the 70's, it is very hard to watch the new-and-improved version.  It's like walking into the Louvre and discovering that the Mona Lisa has been altered so that we can see her beautiful teeth.The worst part is that it is a betrayal of Lucas' most ardent fans.  The people that loved the original the most are the very same fans that hate the altered version the most... the people that made him rich now have to remain outside the gates.If nothing else, the original has historical value.  Don't believe me?  Go to Blockbuster and rent a sampling of movies from 1977 and compare Star Wars to its contemporaries.  As a favor to his fans, and to history, Lucas should be release a ""classic"" version of Star Wars as it was in 1977.The Empire Strikes Back doesn't have the same historical significance, but it is widely considered the best of the 6 films, so again, in deference to those who care, Lucas should release a ""classic"" version of this film too.The Return of the Jedi has no historical significance and is eschewed by most fans of the series, so I don't care one way or the other... in fact it will be a rare event for me to ever watch that silly movie again.Now, we certainly have the technology to make the Mona Lisa a better portrait... but why would we want to do that?  We could make the first Super Bowl much better; we could add fans to fill the empty seats, we could make the score a lot closer, we could add Reggie White to the Packers and Tony Gonzales to the Chiefs.  We could replace Pete Roselle with a more muscular, digitized Roselle with the voice of John Facenda and give him new lines - have him name the Lombardi Trophy right there.  Imagine if the NFL came out with the ""Special Edition"" of Super Bowl I (which, btw, wasn't called the ""Super Bowl"", nor was it called ""I"").  Now imagine that the ""Special Edition"" was the only version available!"	2.0	Stabbed in the Back Again	2006-01-17	11	8	3

It began the trend of summer ""Block busters"", it spawned the rampant merchandizing associated with ""kids"" movies, and it blew our little minds with it's massive array of new images and epic story scope.  In your head you remember Star Wars, but you really don't remember it.  Watching these movies again reminds you of why Star Wars was such an incredible movie. The special effects seem a tad dated, the light saber duals that seemed so awesome, now seem pretty lame, and some of the acting is pretty poor.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GVO1TOSH51N9	"Mandy ""StarWarsLover"""	I am still surprised that Geroge Lucas changed so many things in the film! And most notably, the ending of Return of the Jedi. I couldn't belive it! Instead of the having the original actor, they replaced him with Hayden Christean ( sp? )! I don't have anything against him, but come on! He probably didn't even know what star wars was when return of the jedi came out. So, instead of this, please stick with the VHS verison which haven't been messed with. Even though the picture quality on the film is GREAT actually. The VHS is much more better simply because you can get to see the original trioglys without anything being changed.	2.0	Why the changes?!?!?!?!?	2004-12-27	11	8	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1EWKXSKBU42MG	Manny	Okay, I will say this up front to all devoted Star Wars fans like me who anxiously waited for this release on DVD, you will probably be disappointed with the changes that were made to movies. Even though the changes did not affect the main story line, they take away the sense of nostalgia that one might have for the original version. George Lucas said he wanted viewers to see the trilogy the way he intended it to be seen. To a certain extent I can understand where he's coming from, but many fans (like T.M.)wanted to see this movie in it's original form, with  only enhancements to the picture and sound quality.Let's start off with the first noticeable  but necessary change.The change was made in Empire Strikes Back, to the scene when Darth Vader communicates to his Master Darth Sidious. This is the scene where viewers get to see Darth Sidious for the first time in the trilogy. The original Sidious looked nothing like the Sidious we all know in Return of the Jedi. Lucas replaced the original Sidious with the Sidious in Return of The Jedi without changing the dialogue much.The second noticeable and unwelcomed change for me is in Return of The Jedi, the scene where Princess Leia and Lando go to rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt. The original puppet that sings in Jabba's Palace was replaced by a computer generated image of the puppet and the original song was replaced with a diferent song that is sung as a duet. This change took away the feel of the original movie in a big way for me (Try to picture computer generated Muppets on Sesame Street and you'll understand what I'm trying to say).  The third obvious change was made to ending of Return of The Jedi.  The celebration song was replaced with another song, and the scene where Luke sees the Ghost Images of Yoda, Obi Wan, and Anakin was changed. In the original, they show Anakin as he may have looked had he not been consumed by the dark side, and in the DVD, they show Anakin's ghost as he looked before he turned to the dark side. I guess Lucas wanted the audience to remember Anakin as he was before he turned to the dark side. I personally would rather have the audience remember Anakin as the good guy turned bad, then turn good again.There were other changes made to the Trilogy, but the ones mentioned here were the most noticable ones.As far as the Technical Specifications are concerned, here's where the wait was worth it! The sound is presented in English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX, English Dolby 2.0 Surround, Spanish Dolby 2.0 Surround, French Dolby 2.0 Surround. Subtitles are in English.I have the Enhanced Widescreen version for 16:9 TVs.I watched all three movies with the sound set on Dolby 5.1 Surround Ex. George Lucas, I must thank you for doing the sound portion of the Trilogy justice. The sound quality is awsome. The 5.1 surround really did add a needed dimension to the Trilogy. It seemed kind of awkward watching and listening to Episode I and II with all the digital quality and then watching the VHS versions of Episodes IV, V, and VI with the original picture and sound.Finally, this set is sold with a Bonus Material Disc with lots of special features. The most interesting being a behind the scene look at Episode III  in The Return of Darth Vader. This segment gives a little sneak peek at what Anakin will look like after he turns and it hints at a long Lightsaber Duel between Obi Wan and Anakin.  The Birth of the Lightsaber is also an intersting segment that talks about the lightsaber and some of the special effects used in the movies. The disc also gives a little sneak peek of a new X Box game for Episode III.  There is also Playable Demo of the game Battlefront.  In all, the bonus disc has over 4 hours of special features.In conclusion, even with the changes that Lucas has made for the DVD, I recommend this Box set to all, old fans and new. The story remains the same with a few tolerable differences.The big plus to the release is the Picture quality and surround sound quality.	4.0	Star Wars Trilogy Revised ........Again (Box Set only)	2004-09-26	3	0	3

These are a must see. I enjoyed the bonus features. Enhanced graphics and sound editing was done to clean up and extend the movies.Now the reason I gave the movies a 4 star instead of 5. The box says Star Wars Trilogy. I thought I was buying them as they were released in the theater. Do not get me wrong, these are good movies. But it is not what I thought I was buying. These go beyond just the added scenes Mr. Lucas added in the earlier extended versions he released. He has actually created new scenes that never existed and added them. As well as re-wrote some dialogue. Yes I may sound like a purest, but I am not. I just think that the set should have been marked appropriately. Now that you know, you can make an informed decision on whether or not to purchase. But you must see these regardless.	4.0	Great Set	2005-05-03	7	5	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3QAMS1V14OGTL	Marc A. Lorenz	I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I have seen all three of these films so much I can quote along with the movie word for word. When I got this for christmas a couple years ago, I was ecstatic. However, when I found out they were the new special editions, I got slightly annoyed.Don't get me wrong, I still love the new special edition films. The additions and changes don't detract from the enjoyment of the films. They just seem to be unnecessary. Why mess with something that has become such a staple of our society?Like I said, the additions and changes are minor, but they are still unnecessary. Like the whole music video type song they added in Return of the Jedi. It is all in a made up language anyway so it didn't add anything to the storyline at all. And when they add the jawa getting bucked off his mount. Its just unnecessary.Some of the additions were more tied to the storyline. Such as the scene where Han first talks to Jaba in A New Hope. They actually filmed that with Harrison Ford originally but didn't include it into the actual movie because they didn't have the technology they needed to insert Jaba into the scene. That scene gives you a little bit more of a look into Han and Jaba's relationship.The digital remastering is very well done also. The picture clarity is significantly greater in the special edition.For those of us who still have a VCR and love the Star Wars Trilogy, this boxed set is a good buy. Even though it doesn't have that same raw sci-fi feeling, its still a quality classic set.	4.0	Still A Classic, But Still Not The Same	2008-12-03	1	1	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A298Y0CYJBENVW	"Marcel Pedneault ""raelian"""	"yes, but... I was pretty surprised to see the ""new"" Anakin at the end of Episode 6.I had not intend to watch the whole double trilogy (Is there a word for a 6 movie suite?) right away. I was waiting to get Episode 3 on DVD, but couldn't wait, I guess.My wife had never seen any of the Star Wars movies, which was good now, because when Episodes 1 and 2 came out, she started watching them... Last week, we watched them again, on DVD, as a ""refresher"" and a couple of days ago we watched Episode 3 in the theater. That same night, we watched Episode 4. Last night, Episode 5 and tonight 6 (we just finished). In a way, it makes sense to see the ""new"" Anakin at the end of Episode 6, especially if you watch all 6 in a week or so. However, they could and should give us the opportunity to buy the ""Original Trilogy"" the way it was, and from what I've seen with other reviewers, I am definitely not the only one who'd buy them again, as they had been released over 25 years ago. The music changed, too. I remember listening to the Ewok song at the end of ""6"", but they removed it.Don't get me wrong, I like the new ones, too.I just wish they had the ""Original"" available as well... Surely Mr. Lucas doesn't want us to hang on to the old video tapes? Ironically, the Star Wars Trilogy (on VHS) are the last 3 video tapes I own. Everything else has gone to DVD. If they don't release the ""good old ones"" on DVD, I guess I'll just have to burn them myself on DVD-r.Now if Mr. Lucas wants the money, he can simply release the originals, don't need to fix anything, add anything, remove anything... just transfer them to DVD. If he wants the fans to get what they want, and don't really care about the money, then he should listen to them, otherwise, they'll just burn their own copies on DVD, from VHS or LD.In other words, give the fans the choice... you want the new one, fine... you prefer the old ones, fine, too.: )"	5.0	Call me a purist old-timer, but...	2005-08-06	1	1	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ABO092BYA4VMU	Marco Freire	"Here are all the changes:A New Hope Visual Changes: (The 1981 rerelease version is the exact same as the 1977 version, plus the title insertion and the dialogue change.)-In the 1977 version, there was no title ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" but when the film was rereleased in 1981, the title was added.-The shot of R2-D2 wandering down the canyon alone now has a different background.-The scene where the Imperial Storm Troopers find R2-D2 and C3PO's escape pod has now been extended, and the dewbacks are now CGI.- The binary sunset was given a strange blur in the 1977/1997 versions, this has been corrected by the 2004 version.-The Sandcrawler shots have alternate angles, and look much more detailed.-Obi Wan's home has an alternate view.-The view of Mos Eisley has been revamped, and looks much more detailed.-The Landspeeder shot entering Mos Eisley is much more detailed-The first Mos Eisley scene has been extended, with CGI monsters walking around. This scene looks much livelier. Now Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport.-In the 1977 version, one of the characters in the Cantina Bar orginally looked like a wolf, in the 1997/2004 versions, he now looks like a lizard.-The most controversial change is the Greedo scene (did you know that one deleted in the Phantom Menace was a scene with Anakin fighting a YOUNG Greedo??)Anyway, this scene had GREEDO shoot first. Unfortunately, the die-hard purists dreaded this change. I don't like it either. In the 1977 version, Han Solo just blasted Greedo. In the 1997/2004 versions, Greedo shot and missed Han Solo and then he blasted Greedo, but in the 2004 version, they shoot almost at te same time, and in the 1997 version they clearly did NOT shoot at the same time.-The entirely new scene that wasn't in the 1977 version was the Jabba scene, who is entirely CGI, but the CGI is different in the 2004 version.-The doors on the Death Star open/close slower in the 1997/2004 versions.-The Millenium Falcon departure from Tatooine is different.-A different Alderaan explosion.-The scene where the Millenium Falcon gets pulled into the death star has a new effect shot after Obi-Wan says, ""It's an Imperial Fighter.-Luke's lightsaber now has color during his training aboard the Millenium Falcon.-The blaster bolts have been censored to not show the impact in the 1997/2004 versions.-The perspective background of the cell block corridor has now been corrected.- The eye of the Dianogah now blinks (2004 version change only)- The writing on the tractor beam controls is now Aurabesh instead of English. (2004 version change)- The scene where Han Solo chases the Imperial Storm Troopers away and then he runs into hundreds of them instead of just a few for the 1997/2004 versions.-During the Obi-Wan/Darth Vader fight, the lightsabers have been corrected in all shots. (In some shots in the 1977/1997 versions, it looks like two people fighting with sticks.)(2004 version change)-After Obi-Wan is gone, Darth Vader's lightsaber color has been corrected. (2004 version change)-The shot of the Millenium Falcon flying under Yavin has been changed. In the 1977 version, the Millenium Falcon files directly under Yavin, and in the 1997/2004 versions, it files more to the right of Yavin and with more movement.-When the Millenium Falcon lands on Yavin 4, we now see the Millenium Falcon land as opposed to the 1977 version where we saw nothing.-In a new scene, Luke meets up with his pal Biggs.-The launch has been changed, instead of lights going up into the sky, we now see the X-Wings clearly flying away, and Yavin is less visible, as opposed to the 1977 version where Yavin was clearly visible.-The approach to the Death Star has been radically changed, with more X-wings/Y-wings approaching, and the ships look much more detailed.-During the battle of Yavin, The second shot after the leader says ""I'm going to try and cut across and try and draw their fire"" has a alternate view of the now CGI X-wings.-The battle of Yavin has been given a computer-enhanced makeover and alternate shots. The first is right after Biggs says to Luke ""he's on me tight, I can't shake him"" that is an alternate shot, and the second is a reverse angle of Wedge Antilles destroying a tie fighter and going through the explosion.-The Death Star expolsion is much bigger.A New Hope sound/dialogue changes:-When the Sandcrawler stops, there is new dialogue said by C3PO:1977/1997 versions: (to R2-D2) Wake up. Wake up!2004 version: We're stopped. (to R2-D2) Wake up. Wake up!-When Obi-Wan Kenobi scares off the Tusken Raiders, his scream is different. In the 1977/1997 versions, this call sounded suspciously like a dewback scream. In the 2004 version, this sounded like a krayt dragon.-While the StormTroopers are searching the Millenium Falcon, a line of dialogue is added which is ""There's no one here.""-After a Imperial Officer says ""TK-421, why aren't you at your post?"" there is a new effect when Luke taps his helmet to signal the officer. But this effect is EXTREMELY HARD to make out.-When the Stormtroopers go into the room where R2-D2 and C3PO are hiding, and one of the stormtroopers hits his head on the door, and the 2004 version added a little ""oomph"" to the effect.-The sound of Princess Leia's blaster sound like a real blaster in the 1977/2004 versions, but sounded like a .44 Magnum in the 1997 version.-While running from the Storm Troopers, all dialogue said by Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker sounded like an unconvicing echo in the 1977/1997 version, but sounds like a more convincing echo in the 2004 version.-When Han and Chewbacca escape through the blast doors, The 1977 version did not have a line of dialogue that the 1997/2004 versions did. And it is: ""Close the Blast Doors!""- The music on the start in the Battle of Yavin is inaudible in the 2004 version, but clearly audible in the 1977/1997 versions.-The line ""He's on your tail!"" was inserted for the 1997 version but removed again for the 2004 version.-During the battle of Yavin, when a TIE fighter is on Luke, different dialogue is said:1977/1997/2004 versions: Blast it, Biggs, where are you?1981 rerelease version: Blast it, Wedge, where are you?The Empire Strikes Back Visual Changes:In the 1980 version, when Luke and his tauntaun are captured by the wampa, you never really see the wampa, only hear it. In the 1997/2004 versions, the wampa was given a complete makeover, and new shots of the wampa eating the tauntaun were added. And another shot of the right-armless wampa was inserted.-During the Hoth battle, a black line on the edge of Luke's Speeder Window has been removed for the 1997/2004 versions.-When Darth Vader communicates with the Emperor, the 1980/1997 versions, the Emperor was voiced by Clive Revill, and the 2004 version was voiced/played by Ian McDarmid. The 1997 version of the emperor has minor changes- the Emperor's eyes have been replaced by chimpanzee eyes!-Boba Fett's Pursuit is different in all three versions: In the 1980 version, the Slave I was chasing the Millenium Falcon form a more far away angle. In the 1997 version, there is another shot added and the angle has been reversed. In the 2004 version, the same angle as the 1980 version is used and the added shot for the 1997 version has been reversed.-The 1997/2004 versions give a lot better view of Cloud City by adding CGI shots of the Millenium Falcon flying through the city.-The shot of Cloud City from a distance is different: In the 1980 version, there is a cloud car and no tibanna gas refinery. In the 1997/2004 versions, there is no cloud car and there is a tibanna gas refinery.-In the 1980 version, there is only one shot of exterior Cloud City before we see Princess Leia and Han Solo talking about Lando Calrssian. In the 1997/2004 versions, there are several more shots of exterior Cloud City.-When Lando Calrissian escorts Han, Leia and Chewie, in the 1997/2004 versions, there are now windows that you can now see exterior Cloud City through. Another shot of windows was added also.-Just when Han is about to be frozen into carbonite, in the 1980/1997 versions, it looks like Han is wearing a sleeveless jacket, in the 2004 version this has been corrected.-In the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader lightsaber battle, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in all shots in the 1980/1997 versions, and in the 2004 version, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in some shots and pink in others.-The 1997/2004 versions added more shots of Lando telling people to get out of the city.-The 1997 version added a new scene in which Darth Vader, after failing to seduce Luke into the Dark Side of the Force, was walking back to the shuttle.-The 1997/2004 versions have a hatch to when Lando rescues Luke, who is hanging from a metal antenna above the skies- as opposed to the 1980 version where there was no hatch and a white glare.-The scene when Admrial Piett delivers a report to Darth Vader on the bridge of Darth Vader's ship has corrected the placement of the Imperial Insignias for the 2004 version.-There is a new scene for the 1997/2004 versions of Darth Vader's shuttle flying to the Imperial Super Star Destroyer. Two of these shots are outtakes from Return of the Jedi, because the man who walks with Darth Vader is NOT Admiral Piett, it's Moff Jejerrod, commander of the second Death Star!!The Empire Strikes Back sound/dialogue changes:When Luke is brought back to the hidden Rebel base, new dialogue is said:1980 version: C3PO: ""Master Luke, it's so good to see you fully functional again!""1997/2004 versions: C3PO: ""Master Luke, it's so good to see you fully functional again! Luke: ""Thanks, Threepio.""In the Hoth battle, there is an extra line of dialogue for the 1997/2004 version. In the 1980 version, Luke's mouth can be seen moving, but no words are said.1980 version: Luke: ""Stay tight and low!"" Wedge: ""AAAHHH!!""1997/2004 versions: Luke: ""Stay tight and low! This is it! Wedge: ""AAAHHH!!""-Right before the 4 TIE fighters have been destroyed, C3PO says and extra line of dialogue:1980 version: ""Oh, this is suicide!""1997/2004 versions: ""Oh, this is suicide! There's nowhere to go.""-When Darth Vader and the Emperor were communicating via hologram, Ian McDiarmid re-recorded all of the Emperor's dialogue and some lines were altered for the 2004 version.-In the 1980/1997 versions, Boba Fett's dialogue was voiced by Jason Wingreen, but for the 2004 version, all of Boba Fett's dialogue has been rerecorded (but not altered) and voiced by Temuera Morrison (who plays Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones)-Right after R2-D2 gets spit out by the river monster in Dagobah, one of Luke's lines has been completely altered:1980 version: ""Are you all right?"" Come on. (helps R2-D2 up) Uhhh. You were lucky to get out of there.""1997/2004 versions: ""Are you all right? Come on. (helps R2-D2 up) Uhhh. You were lucky you didn't taste so good.""This is by far the best change for the 2004 version: In the 1997 version, when Luke fell, a scream was added and this sounded exactly like the one when the Emperor got thrown down the shaft by Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. In the 1980/2004 versions, THERE IS NO SCREAM!!!!!When Darth Vader goes to his shuttle, his dialogue has been changed:1980 version: ""Bring my shuttle.""1997/2004 versions: ""Alert my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival.""Return of the Jedi visual changes:This is the worst change for Return of the Jedi: In the 1983 version, the Max Rebo band (Max Rebo is the blue elephantine thing) pipe player Droopy McCool and singer Sy Snootles are playing the song ""Lapti Nek"". In the 1997 version, this scene is almost entirely diiferent: Sy Snootles is now completely CGI, and she has been given a CGI companion named Joh Yowza. Together, they sing ""Jedi Rocks"" which is so bad it seems out of place. The 2004 version is the same as the 1997 version, but also Han Solo' carbonite encased form is not on the wall.-The sail barge's movements and shadow were almost unnatural in the 1983 version, this has been corrected for the 1997/2004 versions.-The Rancor sequence had that black line on the Rancor in the 1983 version- as you saw on the window of Luke's speeder in the 1980 version of the Empire Strikes Back. That has been removed for the 1997/2004 versions.-The Sarlacc has been greatly changed: In the 1983 version, the Sarlacc is a ""Sarlacc Pit"" that looked pretty boring with only 2-3 tentancles. In the 1997/2004 versions, the Sarlacc is now a Sarlacc Beast, and has 5-6 tentacles with a CGI birdlike beak.-In the 1983 version, during the Sarlacc sequence, when Han Solo was hanging from one of the smaller barges, he was hanging by just his toes, with Chewbacca holding him. In the 1997/2004 versions, Han is hanging by his toes with a rope around them and Chewbacca holding him.-The speeder bike chase has added shots from the back for the 1997/2004 versions.-In the first part of the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader lightsaber fight, Darth Vader's lightsaber is red in the 1983/1997 versions, in the 2004 version it is pink. Luke's lightsaber is also washed out in the 2004 version, incredibly, the version in which the lightsabers look best is the 1983 version, because the 1997 version of the lightsabers are too bright and the 2004 versions are too dull.-When Luke unmaskes Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, he has eyebrows in the 1983/1997 versions, and in the 2004 version, he does not have eyebrows and his eyes were colored to match Hayden Christensen's eyes.-The destruction of the Death Star II is larger in the 1997/2004 versions.-The 1983 version of the celebration scene had a panoramic view of the Ewok village on Endor. And the Ewoks play their ""Yub Nub"" song. For the 1997/2004 versions, a lot of digital Ewoks have been added, and the song has been changed.-The 1997/2004 versions have more scenes of the Ewoks and the Rebels celebrating.This is the worst change in the entire trilogy. The Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan spirit shots were all the same in the 1983/1997 versions. In the 2004 version, Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN!!!! I was so shocked to see this change, I nearly had a heart attack.-A new scene with Oola, a green dancer, has been added for the 1997/2004 versions.-A shot of Banthas has been added right before the Jabba's barge shot for the 1997/2004 versions.-Before the Ewok celebrations, a number of celebrations have now been added, with one of Cloud City, then Tatooine, then Naboo(2004 version only), then Coruscant. But there is a change between the Couruscant shots of the 1997/2004 versions. In the 1997 version, the Jedi Temple is standing, and in the 2004 version, there is no Jedi Temple. And there is another difference. This one is tough, to see, but the Senate Buliding has been added for the 2004 version.Return of the Jedi Audio Changes:-During the Sarlacc sequence, there is different dialogue before Han shoots one of the Tentacles of the Sarlacc:1983 version: Han Solo: Don't move, Lando!Lando Calrissian: Oh, wait, I thought you were blind!Han Solo: It's all right. Trust me!Lando Calrissian: A little higher! Just a little higher!1997/2004 versions: Han Solo: Don't move, Lando!Lando Calrissian: Oh, wait! I thought you were blind!Han Solo: It's all right, I can see a lot better.Lando Calrissian: A little higher! Just a little higher!DVD Ratings: Video 10/10 There is no argument that this is the best all three films have EVER looked of all three versions.Audio 10/10 And there is no argument this is the best these films have ever sounded of all three versions.Extras 9/10 Lots of extras, inculding the 2 1/2 hour documentary ""The Empire of Dreams: The Star Wars Story""Film Ratings: Star Wars 10/101977 orginial theatrical version (without title ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" 10/101981 rerelease version (with added title ""Episode IV: A New Hope) 10/101997 Special Edition 10/102004 DVD version 10/10The Empire Strikes Back 10/101980 Theatrical Version 10/101997 Special Edition 10/102004 DVD version 10/10Return of the Jedi 9/101983 Theatrical Version: 9/101997 Special Edition 9/102004 DVD Version 9/10Conclusion: Highly recommended box set, and these are the only versions of the classic films that will ever be available.

YES  WHY? Because  they are the best films in any galaxy near or far away!  Not only that,  but the EPISODE II footage...oh my. Even if it's just interviews with the  cast (which it probably will be)and not a trailer (which it won't be) it  will be well worth the money spent. Lets face it, alot of people did'nt  like the extra or the changed scenes and they felt they were best left out,  but it has no effect on the overall scheme of things so what is the  problem, let it go. It's still the same old STAR WARS they know and love,  with Mr. Lucas being the master story teller that he is, characters you  feel you've known your whole life, special effects that are still hard to  rival today and the sense that you are involved in something on a vastly  bigger scale than any, if not all other films have to offer. BUY IT, LOVE  IT, CHERISH IT, THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE(p.s you know you'll  regret not buying it when it's deleted, searching all the stores and web  sites just kicking your self when you pay 3 times the price it was at  AMAZON.COM.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A20GPPN6DUMUC4	"Marcus N. Hanks ""drkainn"""	I don't see why people think Star Wars is the best epic ever.  I mean they are enjoyable movies, but nothing spectacular.  Maybe it is because I was not around when they first came out.  Maybe they are like the LotR of today, and people in 20 years will wonder what we found so great about LotR.  Not to mention I for one prefer the Prequel Trilogy.Anyway, after owning and watching the DVD set, I must say, these are definitely the best versions you will ever see.  The video quality is just so goregous, and the 5.1 audio just makes the movies so much more enjoyable than they were the past few times I have watched them, especially the Empire Strikes Back.  The improvements do not take anything away from the movies' story, and there aren't too many.  Not to mention Lucas even said the original version were the unifinished versions.  Even having Hayden at the end of Return of the Jedi was no big deal because it makes sense, and it is only like fifteen seconds of footage.  Then you have other changes to make it fit better with the superior prequel trilogy such as Jango's voice for Boba, and it sounds a lot better.  Some people, like my dad, could not even tell what was added into the movie since he only watched them once in a while.  Also, those of you that complained about Hayden's acting in AotC should realize that none of the Skywalker's had great actors.  Luke (Hamill) and Leia (Fisher) were not that great in the acting department either, especially in the first movie.  They did improve throughout the series, but not that much.As for the extras, well you have the Empire of Dreams 2 1/2 hour documentary that goes into a lot of details on the making of the movies, and also mentions how Lucas was not happy with the way the original movie went due to issues with Fox and his crew members.  There are also documentaries on the evolution of the characters, the success of SW, really bad trailers, a video game trailer and demo, and a few other items.I highly recommended these you like story and space battles, but don't go in expecting the best thing ever made, because there is better out there.I give the DVDs a 5/5 starsA New Hope a 2.5/5Empire Strikes Back 4/5Return of the Jedi 3.5/5	3.0	Star Wars is good entertainment, but not the best.	2004-07-10	7	2	5

I have unaltered versions in Laser Disc and VHS but we will never see it in Blu-Ray being that the huge demand would cannibalize the altered version plus the high quality video would ultimately lead to overseas bootlegging of the movies cutting more into Lucas' earnings. Not a good business move but I will most definitely pay top dollar for a limited edition run.	4.0	Waiting for the 3D Version	2012-04-30	3	0	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1E1GJHKN14HRM	Mariam	The star Wars Trilogy is more than three great movies in a box. it's a  whole culture that was created by the great Lucas.  Lucas introduced  important social, pshycological, and political ideas in a sci-fi frame that  attracted and still attracts millions of viewers arround the world.Each  character in the movie, including the aliens and the immaginary ones, is a  human archtype that depicts human behaviour,and phsychology.The first  Movie in the Trilogy &quot;Star Wars&quot; was produced in 1978 and it was  recieved by a huge success that 2 days before the premier of the second  part &quot;the Empire strikes back&quot; people were sleeping in front of  movie theatres.It is hard to review the Trilogy without mentioning  It's soundtrack written by John Williams that has become a classic tune  engraved in a whole generation' souls.Even though I doubt that there are  still people out there who didn't see any of the Star Wars trilogy, I  strongly reccomend that you get the set.

The one change that should not have been made was Boba Fett's voice. It was an unecessary change. As for the ending of Return of the Jedi changing Anakin Skywalker back to a young man in a way made sense. Everyone knows Anakin became Darth Vader was he was young and when he got older his body never really fully healed so appearing as an old ghost doesn't look right because his body was burnt up while he was a young man not when he was older. Anakin returning as a young man was more moving and dramatic and the chorus singing in the background sounded so angelic and powerful showing that good had conquered evil. It was like a story from the bible.	5.0	Star Wars Fanatic	2005-11-26	4	2	2

These films are the babies of George Lucas, and I feel certain he wanted to make sure that they didn't grow dated, so he updates a few explosions, adds two or three minutes of new footage...that's his prerogitive.The fact remains that these three films are landmarks in cinematic history, and reminders of the joys of corny innocence.  The ""Force"" is hokey, the Stormtroopers can't hit the side of a barn, Chewbacca is a guy in an ape suit...and the whole thing is a hoot!  Pure, unadulterated romantic fantasy, that's what these movies are about.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3N48NHTSIIJ1	Mark Ebert	"Ever since ""Star Wars"" was re-released in 1979 I have been hooked.  The ""galaxy far, far away"" teems with adventure, intrigue, ethics, and myth.  I was one of those people who believed the Prequels would happen when most others thought the Force had ""gone out of the universe"".Even though I knew Lucas was not including the classic ""Star Wars"" editions, I was still thrilled to see the trilogy come to DVD.  Some of the new material is a delightful surprise, but I do wish he wouldn't have toyed with ""Jedi"" the way he did in 1997--the Sarlacc Pit now reminds me of the scene from ""Little Shop of Horrors"".However, if you're looking to rekindled the fun of these films, or share them with youngsters who were merely a gleam in your eye when the saga first appeared, you won't be disappointed.The only thing keeping me from ""5 stars"" is that I wish George (Lucas, not President Bush) would have included the original versions along with his post-Special Edition versions.  People generally like a choice and if they had both editions most would probably prefer the new to the old, but not me, I would have fired the first shot at Greedo!  : )"	4.0	The Lucas Factor	2005-03-18	8	6	2

There is soooo much material published post return of the jedi in the ""star Wars Universe"" to make a hundred NEW movies. YOU DONT ADD NEW TECHNOLOGY AND RE-SHOOT SCENES TO 30 YEAR OLD FILMS! Remember colorizing! Old stories are ""updated"" (usually very unsuccessfully) by a new generation makeing thier movie i.e. Sabrina, Ocean's 11, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Planet of the Apes etc. etc. Show off cartoony CGI with new projects!!! like the awful new Star Wars movies!

I mean Lucas obviously did it to please all of the new fans, but what about the ones that have been following these films ever since they came out or were old enough to understand them, that's like spitting in our faces.

I'm not a big Star Wars fanatic, but I do like the original trilogy.  I was looking forward to the DVD edition, but now I won't be buying it.  And it's all because Lucas stuck Hayden Christensen in as Anikin's ghost at the end of ""Jedi.""  I DON'T WANT TO BE REMINDED of these god-awful, intelligence-insulting, overstuffed, pointless eye-candy, every-element-calculated-for-merchandising-or-videogame hypercommercialized prequel PRODUCTS every time I watch the originals...and especially ""Jedi.""  (The prequels are taking three movies to explain that being a sullen, moody teenager is enough to send someone to the dark side of the force.)  I don't recognize the prequels as being on the same continuum as the originals, and I think it's outrageous that classic movies are being altered to match later films, instead of the later ones being made to match the established ones.  I'd buy the first two originals on DVD if they become available separately.  But I REFUSE to have ""Jedi,"" and by extension the original trilogy, ruined for me by tying it to these horrible prequels, which bear the same relationship to the originals that a Garfield cartoon has to a Rembrandt.If the Lucas-worshippers would take time out from admonishing everyone who doesn't share their enthusiasm to ""get over it""...""get a life""...""shut up""...""suck it up""...""go back to your parents' basement""...""their his mooviez, dood""...and whatever else, they might consider this.

"Because, if you haven't figured it out after watching his schlocky but deathstar-cheeseball good space western, which rose to greatness in ESB with the help of a real screen writer, before then proceeding down the long disintegration from bad writing and dopey plots (ROTJ) to stupid, pointless characters like Jar Jar that were apparently as amusing to George as they'd be to the average 8 year old, to the sterile violence of the the droid wars with idiotic character names like Count Dookie and Generally Grevious and Darth Sidious (oh, yeah, let's trust him) with yet more pointless droid carnage, to the casting of Darth Vader as whiny little bipolar b*tch, then let me spell it out:George is a total hack who has no idea how he got lucky, and he's been one since DAY ONE, but he can't admit that, just like he can't admit that he took a giant dump all over the franchise with his laughably bad I, II, and III.  Why wouldn't your fans want to see Jabba suddenly appear in IV for a completely pointless conversation?  or troopers riding big random animals?  Or bigger explosions, ala Michael Bay? That's really cool you see.  ...And for the children, Gredo must shoot first, because that would send the wrong message or something 5 minutes after Obi Wan slices off some pig dude's arm.  If he releases the originals he admits that his efforts to ""improve"" the originals were worthless, and far worse, that he has no idea how to add value to his movies, or construct plots, characters, shoot action scenes, or write dialog.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A29KLIUYYOA5AI	Mark Twain	It seems that it's already obvious that it would be a waste of three exceptional films not to release the original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. Sadly, this can't happen until after the release of 2005's Episode III, when George Lucas will have some free time to concentrate on it. Then, it will still take some time to put together the bonus materials (documentaries, trailers, cast interviews, etc.) that fans have been waiting for for over two decades. Also, the cover art would have to be slightly altered, to resemble the patterns of the Episodes I and II (and inevitably III) covers. That way, they'll LOOK more like a series of six movies, and not just two seperate trilogies.	4.0	DVD Requirements	2003-01-20	1	1	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A228WIUM8QL0FW	MARKUS H. MCLAUGHLIN	"It was the opening weekend in May 1977, when my late father Bob took me to see ""A New Hope.""  It was playing at the local drive-in theater near the Air Force Base I used to live on.  When I was 5 years old near Austin, Texas.  I was scared at the beginning of the film when that huge Star Destroyer ship appeared firing on a smaller ship over the planet of Tattooine.  ""A New Hope"" was the very first film I ever saw in my entire life.  It inspired me to become a writer when I became an adult.  I owe a huge debt to George Lucas for inspiring me to create and to write.  I want to shake his hand and thank him for showing me ""the universe.""  I am so excited to own ""A New Hope"" as part of the DVD release of the classic trilogy.  I only wish Lucas had made the prequels just as good as the classic three.  What needed to be done with the prequels is to let Lucas write the films but let others direct them.  It made sense fot the classic films, it should have been done for the prequels, at least for Episode II and III.  Finally, may the force continue to be with us for years to come...Please release the unaltered ""cleaned up"" version of the middle trilogy on BLU RAY and Ultra High Definition formats in time for the 40th Anniversary, the year 2017..."	4.0	"A fan's memory of the ""first"" Star Wars film"	2004-08-15	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3ODENXA668OR	Markus Rexon	"I've been a Star Wars fan for a while now. I had been looking for good DVD copies of the original trilogy when I came across this one. Naturally, I bought it, and watched all of them on Blu Ray....I was stunned. It was amazing! It felt like I was watching movies that were just released recently. And believe me, I know: before I got this, I had seen all of the original trilogy episodes on the original VHS release and the DVD version. But this release was (and is) just amazing. The picture quality was greatly enhanced as to a quality that you might see in today's movies. And when you add that to it being on Blu Ray, it looks just amazing. There are some effects added in that look spectacular and don't take any originality away from the films. And some of the rather outdated effects that are in the earlier releases have been enhanced to great lengths. There are several coloring fixes thorought the films, especially in episode 4, which had rather poor coloring quality in most of the previous releases; the colors now look sharp and, in most cases, are just positively beautiful. The sound has also been updated to its highest quality: there is a nice balance of pitch between the dialogue and the action scenes, so that you won't be needing to constantly be turning up the volume for the volume and turning down the volume for the battle/action scenes. Several deleted scenes that were taken out of the earlier releases have been re-inserted here, and they really do fit in with the rest of there respected episodes.Of course, you have to relies that there are some ""updates"" that may not appeal so much to die-hard Star Wars fans; for example, Han doesn't shoot first, several CGI creatures are added in with muppet ones, and so on. And even though I'm still ""on the fence"" about the whole Han-shot-first controversy, all the other changes and added creatures and scenes serve the movies well, perhaps making them even better. There have been some complaints that some of the new CGI ships and buildings scenes look half-done, but they look just fine to me.This is probably the best value you can get from a Star Wars pack: it comes with six discs, three Blu Ray discs and three normal DVDs. The Blu Ray discs are tough and won't bend as easily as normal DVDs, making them more improbable of breaking. They are also quit scratch resistant: even if you press your fingernail down hard on the flipside (which I know will scratch a normal DVD), there won't be a single stain. The DVDs are just like any normal DVD, but they'll play on none-Blu Ray players, making them worth the buy and increasing the value of the pack.There's only one thing that I don't really like about it: it's lake of bonus features. It comes with two audio commentaries for every movie, one with George Lucas and the crew and another one compiled of interviews with the cast and crew. That's it. No making-of documentaries as I have seen in other releases, or anything like that. I really wished that they had included some bonus features like these here. So be sure to hold on to your DVD copy with the bonus features if you decide to buy this.I also wish that it came with the original, untouched version. I have a 2-disc special edition of episode 6 (ROTJ) that includes the updated version and the original version as shown in theaters back in 1983. But those versions aren't included here. I'm pretty sure that most everybody would prefer to watch the updated ones over the original ones, but still.Despite these two ""problems"", this is a great pack that will really add on to your Star Wars collection. And it's also very flexible in transportation: you can use the Blu Ray discs to watch at home for the highest quality and the normal DVDs for watching abroad on devices that don't support Blu Ray. The films look just spectacular and beautiful on Blu Ray, and the DVDs are of HD quality as well. Old as they may be, the original Star Wars trilogy films look stunning and are just as enjoyable and entertaining as ever. This is defiantly a great pack for perhaps the greatest Space Opera ever."	4.0	Glad I bought it!	2014-01-28	5	4	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3I5J0M2YI8EWZ	Mark Wilder	No doubt about it, I would much prefer the original cuts. The added or altered scenes are noticeable even after not having viewed the VHS editions for about four years. They  aren't quite the same movies to me, even though I estimate less than 10% of the running time has been affected.Mr. Lucas seems to have forgotten that many fans prefer nostalgia over perfection. Chances are anyone reading this has more than a passing interest in film. Can any of you honestly say there aren't pictures you prefer in black and white over more modern color? Anyone out there appreciate how obsolete language, fashions, or customs take you back to a certain time and place? Anyone notice that Hollywood had to be a bit more clever before the advent of computer-generated special effects? Ever consider how imperfections in the sound and picture quality can make a film such as Frankenstein or Dracula just a little more scary late at night?Well, I am one of those people and fully sympathize with the purist point of view. Having said all that, I also recognize that for now, this is the only game in town if you want an authorized DVD version of the trilogy.So, I plopped down my $45 and already viewed all three episodes. I thought the changes affected Episodes IV and V the most. Although they by no means ruin the story, they don't add anything to it either. The sound and picture quality seemed fine to me, so I'll hang on to my purchase. For the number of times I'll probably play them it will be a cheap rental.And yes, if the originals ever do become available, I'll dump this set on the used market and buy what I really wanted in the first place.	3.0	I want the originals too, but ...	2004-09-25	10	8	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1SMRHBPIB3O1H	Marlowe Syn	I was one of those fans that had the opportunity to see Star Wars: A New Hope in the theater in 1977.  So I've seen every Lucas variant of his masterpiece.  While the original vision is very special to me, I don't have any major problems with his new version.  I mean the audio and video is much sharper.  The new CGI looks great and doesn't detract from the story.  I actually like the fact that Han Solo shot first.  It really helped flesh out his character a little better.  Remember that he was a drug smuggler, so is him shooting a two-bit bounty hunter first really that big of a moral dilemma?  While Han was a likeable enough guy, he made it perfectly clear that he was concerned for himself first and foremost.For the Jabba scene: I think why he didn't kill Han on the spot was he assured Jabba he'd get his credits.  Jabba may have seen a gamble to get his money and then kill Solo.  Also a blaster fight in a hanger would assuredly tip off the Stormtroopers.My only beef was with having Hayden Christenson's Anakin in the shot with Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end of RotJ.  Why would his spirit look like the person he was 25 years before he died?  Huh?So shame on the people that only gave it one star because it is a LITTLE different.  It is still a great trilogy and will still stand the test of time.  As an old time original SW fan I say change can be a good thing.	5.0	Old or new?  It's all good	2005-07-04	7	4	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AP3I4MPXVG4UY	"Marvin K. Roberts ""TX1Wolf"""	Ok, I was a huge fan of Star Wars growing up.  The first movie I ever saw in the theater was the Empire Strikes Back with my grandparents and the first movie I ever owned was a VHS copy of Star Wars that someone recorded for me off the TV.  I fondly remember my first mail order Boba Fett and laying on the couch watching that old VHS over and over with my dad.  I think that the Empire Strikes back was the best of the series and that Boba Fett was arguably the coolest charachter.Somewhere along the line I seem to have forgotten how much of a hack George Lucas was though.  As I write this I am writing an article for publication and I have the DVDs playing in the background.  I bought the DVDs as soon as they came out on AMazon, despite my disapointment with the prequel trilogy.However, as I sat here on the couch I was startled to realize that Lucas had changed the movies once again, by inserting the voice of Jango Fett as Boba Fett's and replacing the original Anakin Skywalker w/ the new one.  I shouldn;t have expected anything more from the man who decided to let Greedo shoot first and produced the Star Wars Christmas Special.I guess when Lucas decides he needs an even bigger ranch and decides to produce a subsequent trilogy, he'll retcon the originals again.  Until then I can at least watch Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy and be thankful that Tolkien is not around to help him retcon those.	1.0	This sucks	2006-04-30	10	7	3

If you are an original Beatles fan, the newer fans ask you with reverence  what it was like seeing them in concert, etc. etc. (No, I am not fortunate enough to be an 'original' Beatles fan. I wasn't even born in 1964.) Original Star Wars fans are called oldtimers and accused of not letting go of the past and not appreciating that times change.Mr. Rehnquist wrote in his review ""I ask, who would want to see old, outdated movies in this age of advanced technology? "" Well, I hope the answer is ""Many People"". My love of movies is not based on the level of special effects. Should we no longer watch the great old black and white films of the past because they are 'old and outdated'? No more Bogie and Bacall? No more Hepburn and Tracy? What about Gene Kelly? Jimmy Stewart?The thing Mr. Lucas is forgetting is that more is not always better- in an interview when the movies first came out, he was quoted as saying that the problem with the Sci-Fi genre in general was that so many moviemakers forgot about the story. The movies ended up being built around the special effects.Unfortunately, Mr. Lucas is adding all of these scenes and filming the newer movies (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) with nothing but the possibilities of these special effects in mind. He has lost the story; it had become secondary to the special effects.I had no problem with the celebratory scenes added at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"" but I do have a problem with some of the other scenes. Han shot Greedo. Greedo did not shoot first. It is ridiculous to change this. Han's change of heart and redemption are more powerful when you know he was a mercenary! He was always looking out for himself. That's how he survived! He was in it for the money, and found himself inexplicably drawn to the people of the Rebellion. That's good story-telling.The problem is that Mr. Lucas has taken the liberty of CHANGING much of the story with these scenes.Mos Eisley was supposed to be a dusty, deserted town. Tatooine is on the outer rim of the galazy. It's an unimportant, dusty, underpopulated planet. What I saw in the ""Special Editions"" was a thriving, well-populated town.I would happily buy the special edition versions if I knew Lucas intended on eventually releasing the original versions on DVD as well. I'd buy both.We're not trying to erase the movies you love. If you like the ""Special Editions"" Great! I am glad. I would never tell any of you to shut up or that your opinions were stupid and your views outdated as we have been told by Mr. Rehnquist.We original fans aren't telling you new fans that the version we grew up with should be the only one out there.

Thats what I would like to happen and if it does all of us will have to wait untill at leat 2005, thats four painstaking long years. We must be very greatfull that we just got a great Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace DVD to come out. Lets just hope that when they all do come out they have awsome special features, and I most certianly think they will. I also can't wait to see it all digitaly remastered and having the 5.1 doably digital sount that is going to be something. So I can't wait fellow Star Wars fans, and we've waited almost 25 years for this to happen I think we can wait four or five more.

It hurts me.To take a perfect moment within a perfect film: when Luke Skywalker has been told a devastating revelation, he makes a choice and with great dignity steps off into a void and plunges to what he must think is his almost certain death.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A17EN3U7FW6CDP	Matthew DeLuca	"Well, my friends, you may have heard the news.George Lucas and 2oth Century Fox are re-releasing the Star Wars trilogy on DVD.No, it's not the ORIGINAL CLASSIC TRILOGY THAT WE ALL LONG FOR.I sincerely wish it was, as those are the movies that made me fall in love with Star Wars to begin with (Well, not literally in love, but you get the point).No, apparently Lucas' ego cant come to grips with releasing the movies that made his hiney famous to begin with (The ORIGINAL Movies, untouched by Lucas' sometimes irritating ""tweaking"".)No, this set is the same exact set that was released last year  (The ""Special Editions""), only, they have new packaging, and the 4th bonus disc that was included with last year's DVD set is NOT included with this set!That's correct, Lucas and Fox want you to spend over $30 for a set that is WITHOUT the 4th Bonus disc that the last set had.I.E., Lucas wants you to fork over $30+ dollars for a NEW BOX.That's it. New packaging. The packing looks much like the packing for the last set, only the metallic Silver/black, and Gold/black have been changed to the colors of the original Star Wars movie poster.You can see the new packaging, by going to [...]Is it worth over $30?That's up to YOU.But one question remains....WHY?Why re-release the SAME EXACT MOVIES, when the shelves of stores all across the world are still stocked with the original packaging?Why take the 4th bonus disc OUT of this set?Why charge people over $30 just for a new box, but with the same darn movies?Why not just release the ORIGINALS instead of releasing the same darn ""special edition"" Trilogy twice in Two years?It is easier to understand Jar Jar Binks, than it is to answer the questions asked above.But if you use the force, the answer will come to you.Yes, come to you it will.That answer?????M O N E YYes, the answer is money.Lucas and Fox have chosen to steal 30 MORE dollars from their fans, by redecorating the box that the same movies as last years release came in, in hopes that you'll fork over more money.Yes, Grinches, Lucas and Fox are, yes, yes!They could have given Star Wars fans the ULTIMATE Christmas DVD gift- The original movies, restored, remastered, for us to finally own and enjoy and for us to relive many fond memories with.But, those classic movies are not being released on DVD anytime in the near future. In fact, Lucas says that he will not EVER release them.When the rumored ""Ultimate"" Star Wars Saga 6 DVD set is released, we may be able to see some deleted scenes from the original trilogy....the ones that Lucas removed 20 years later.We MAY have that to look forward to. But then again, this comes from a man who says that he cares about the people who made him a billionaire, yet robs them of the movies that they DO want, and repackages the movies that they already have, so that they will buy the darn things a year later.Thus the reason why the 4th disc has been removed....it makes the set sell for only $30 dollars rather than close to $50.I.E, Lucas and Fox want to hypnotize as many fans as possible, into buying this cheaper set, for the Holiday rush. Is it a coincidence that the DVD's are being released December 6th?Not September 6th. Not January 6th. No, these DVD's are being re-released right square between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when shoppers will be most busy. They waited until Star wars fans would go to the store and buy Volume 2 of the cool ""Clone wars"" Cartoon, and they wanted to make us impulsively buy the movies that we impulsively bought two extra copies of a year ago.They are looking for ""spur of the moment"" dollars.If they cared for their fans, they would have made this CHEAPER set available to us last year, but then they would have lost that extra $20 dollars, and they couldnt allow that.No, they waited til they bled consumers dry on the last set, before they threw the DVD's in a new box and made them available in THIS set. Without the bonus disc of course.I am mad about this. Granted, there ARE more important things going on in the Universe than a damn DVD set.But this is an insult to Star Wars fans. Star Wars movies have always been about values, honor and integrity.It is a shame that the maker and distributors of these films do not hold the same values, honor and integrity. They have become money whores like any other businessmen.They are as greedy as Boba Fett negotiating on what a valued bounty should be worth to him. It's all about money. Star Wars is a business to George Lucas. That is why he hasnt had a problem re-doing many of the original movie scenes. To him, its just a job.To him, these are just movies.The force is NOT strong in George Lucas.If it was, he wouldn't throw these EXACT movies as last year's DVD release in our faces and ask for over $30.If the force was truly with Lucas, he would have done what Spielberg did with E.T.-Released the original AND Special Editions of the movies, so that his vision and his fans memories could BOTH be fulfilled.Mr Lucas, you have much to learn, my old Padawan.The dark side is greed. Consume you it has.Forgotten who made your dreams come true you have.Otherwise you would have made our dreams come true, and given us the movies that we have been dreaming of. Not the same movies in a new box.Grateful that is not.Ok, no more Yoda talk.Mr Lucas, you are wrong for re-releasing these movies on DVD.You just want people like me..... die-hard Star Wars fans to fork over 30 MORE dollars into your Billionaire account.And we will. And I probably will too. I'll see the new packaging, and say ""No, this guy only wants money....you HAVE these movies already, Matt... walk away......but..... there IS new packaging......and the price is LOWER without the bonus disc...., well why not"", and our urge to relive those Star wars memories will take us over and overshadow the reality that we are buying the movies because they appear different. You know that, and you let it occur anyway. You use our very love of the movies that made you who you are, and you use it to bleed even more and more money out of us.Palpatine would have been proud."	1.0	Q. Why?  A.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	The Star Wars Trilogy is a movie set classic. All of the movies are classics and are spectacular films. It's about time the movies are be released on DVD and we only have to wait until September 21. The only flaw in the trilogy will be the simple fact that we are getting the special editions instead of the originals. If you love the movies though that really shouldn't matter to you.When Lucas made these movies he was broke. He had a vision for the movie but wasn't able to do some of the things he wanted to do because  he simple couldn't afford to do so. The technology wasn't available for some of the things either so he had to wait until he could get the technology to do it. This was his vision for the film. Most of the special edition stuff isn't all tha bad. I though all the special editions were great except for the singing in Jabba's palace and the dumb song that was played at the end of Return of the Jedi.The films are going to look briliant. They looked good when they were restored on the VHS over a decade ago. If you saw the Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD then you know that Lucas doesn't play around. The extras I hope are fantastic. Many specials have been done over the years talking about the making of the moives and these should be just as good. The specials on Episode 1 and 2 are both fantastic and there is no reason to worry that these won't be as well.It's to bad we can't get the originals and I'm looking past that flaw. These DVDs are going to be spectacular and they will be here to test the tale of time. This is the greateset trilogy ever made and yes it's better than Lord of the Rings. This is an essential to any one that calls themselves movie fans or Star Wars fans. You have to get this when it comes out and it's only a couple of months more wait. So hold on just a little bit longer.	5.0	The Greatest Movie Trilogy Ever	2004-05-27	9	3	6

I highly recommend this product because you get the best version of the movies available. if you want picture quality and sound, go for the blu ray set. if you want the movies that changed history... get this trilogy.	4.0	picture quality good not great.	2012-01-14	5	4	1

Specifically, I was looking to see if these were, in fact, the real movies or if they were the ""special editions.""That alone would have influenced my decision to buy or not to buy. But what pushed me over the fence completely (and then several fences far away from wanting to part with hard-earned capital for these discs) was learning that even MORE had been changed in this release. Re-dubbing Fett's dialogue? Inserting actors from the new trilogy?No thank you. The new trilogy is crap, and the old trilogy has lost a little bit of the glimmer that it sustained all on its own for 25 years. I'm pained as I write this; heartbroken, even. I think a lot of people out there, children of the 70's and 80's, the offspring of the Baby Boomers, have had their faith betrayed by George Lucas' need to compensate for his inability to create anything new by going back and destroying the old.At least good storytelling and loyalty to the fans remains alive despite George Lucas' turn to the Dark Side...

For those of you whom don't know what I am talking about, I`ll make it shot and sweet. In the original Theatrical release and the first VHS set as well as the Laser Disk releases, in A New Hope Episode, IV, in the renegade biker bar after Han talks to Obi-Wan and Luke about transporting them, Han proceeds to talk to Greedo (Jaba's assassin) about his debt to Jaba. Greedo says ""If your lucky he'll (Jaba) just take your ship"", to witch Han say's ""Over my dead body"". This whole time Han is readying his sidearm. Greedo say's ""that is the idea"". Han than shoots and kills Greedo, in cold blood, because Han is a pirate, and he is a bad guy. Later in A New Hope it's the same cold Han he just sides with the Federation for the greater good, he reforms his ways. In the Gold Edition and now on the DVD, same situation with Han and Greedo, after Greedo says ""that's the idea"" Han said ""I'd like to see that happen"", however this time Greedo shoots first misses and Han fires as he did in the original and kills Greedo. My problem is that by doing that Mr. Lucas turned Han from the cold blooded killer that a space pirate is, to a self defender. It should have stayed as Han killing Greedo, and had the Greedo shooting first scene in bonus features in an alternate scene section.I gave this 5 Stars, because that is the highest rating amazon.com offers, but there is no numeric star value to give this set, I guess infinity is a sufficient star value, if it was a report card A+ would be the rating, and so on and so on."	5.0	AARGH Greedo Fires First!!!!	2004-09-21	14	5	9
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2YJ9DT9YZ0DUN	Matthew K. Minerd	Firstly, let me say that it is important to bear in mind that many (although not all) of the changes contained in this release of Star Wars are to be credited to the 1997 rerelease and not this DVD issuing.  With that having been said, I still must say that I am disappointed that George Lucas made his other changes to synchronize the continuity between his new movies with this one.  His goal should have been the oposite (to synchronize his new works with his older masterpieces).  This, in my opinion is lazy directing.Nevertheless, if one can look past the changes made, the movies still are wonderful.  We all know them so well by this point.  While it would be preferable that we were given the movies in their original condition, we have received them as such.  It is difficult for any to imagine episodes 4,5, and 6 in any way that is not filled with awe.  In the core, the DVDs are still those classics which are so beloved.  That is why I must say that they are indeed sullied but only topically.  Substantially, they remain what we love.  While Lucas et al. are culpable for their changes, the did not ruin the original vision of Star Wars.  Therefore, I still suggest this set for any who feel that it is time to renew their collection (being that the VHS copies may be getting old).  The classic, though stained topically, is still that which is known and loved.	4.0	A Classic Slightly Diminished	2005-03-12	8	7	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AKJ33XYR9SNH8	Matthew Kozlowski	First of all, for every one reason people find to not like the  &quot;Special Edition&quot; versions of the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;,  there are three reasons to love it!  I'll admit, I don't like the new  version of the &quot;Greedo Scene&quot;, but I do love the new scene added  of Stormtroopers riding the Dewbacks.  I don't like the energy ring that  appears when the Death Star is destroyed, but I love the cleaned up  Landspeeder effects.  I don't like the musical number added to &quot;Return  of the Jedi&quot;, but I love the new ending of &quot;Jedi&quot; that omits  the &quot;Ewok Song.&quot;  I could go on, and on, but I won't.  I will  definitely buy this new Trilogy set for four reasons: Reason #1 is that the  cover boxes were made to match those of the &quot;Episode One&quot; video  cover (and eventually Episodes II and III), and &quot;Special Edition&quot;  is not written anywhere on any of these videos in this new box set - These  are the final versions of these films, accept it and move on!  Reason #2 is  the 10 minute &quot;Making of Episode II&quot; feature.  Reason #3 is that  if you've noticed, this new box set is Rated: Unrated by Amazon.Com, unlike  the previous box sets which were Rated: PG - That means the version  contained in this new box set has been altered by Lucas in some way and did  not go through the ratings process by The Motion Picture Association of  America because it is being released on video and not in theatres - There  have been rumblings by folks at Industrial Light &amp; Magic saying that he  has cleaned up and changed a few other scenes since the re-release - Such  as Obi-Wan getting killed and the &quot;Rancor Scene&quot; from  &quot;Jedi.&quot;  My fourth and last reason for buying it will be that I  love these movies! I watch this Trilogy repeatedly, and until they come out  on DVD, I need to keep buying them because I wear out the ones I have.  So  there!	5.0	&quot;New&quot; is &quot;Good!&quot;	2000-08-13	3	2	1

Star Wars is, however, a fantastic science fiction triology.  Most of which is well made.  I won't go into the mirco details...most people have seen these three films.  The Empire Strikes back is the best of the three. A different director and writer...darker, bleaker, and full of edge.  The Return of the Jedi would have been so much better without the cute Ewoks! Just a crass comercial tie in strategy that later haunts the three prequels (both of which are so far inferior, mostly CGI, and terribly convoluted plots with equally silly and terrible dialog, and worse NO PASSION! You don't care about any of the characters)...All in all, a must for any sci-fi fan.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1TJNC96AF73XJ	Maxwell	I just want to address the changes to the original versions of the films that have caused such controversy regarding this DVD release.  I must say that now taking Episode 1-3 into account, most of the enhancements made to the original trilogy (including some CGI updated scenery and battles, the Jango actor's voice replacing the original Boba Fett's, Ian McDiarmid's voice and likeness as the emperor in ESB, and Hayden Christenson's image replacing Sebastian Shaw in the final scene of ROTJ) were actually integrated seamlessly and worked quite well.  Although Episodes 1&2 (and probably 3) will never hold a candle to the original trilogy, the new additions to the original trilogy do a good job of linking the new and old films together.  They make the old trilogy seem less dated, and add more common visual themes between the new and old films.  They create a sense of continuity between the two trilogies which was sorely lacking beforehand.  It improves the entire Star Wars experience, at least in my opinion.Of course, if you are one of the purists who completely disown Episodes 1-3 (which of course is your right to do so), then you will feel differently.  If that's the case, then you may want to avoid this DVD release like the plague.  But for those of us who might enjoy an updated presentation and some linkage to the new Star Wars films, you can't go wrong with these DVDs.  That being said, not all the additions work well.  The most annoying and pointless additions made in the Special Edition from a few years (Greedo shooting first, and the godawful new band performance in Jabba's palace) are unfortunately still present.  But thankfully, these are the only two instances where the enhancements leave a lasting bad impression.  These two miscalculations by themselves cannot really bring down the entire experience though.  I deducted half a star for these things, and another half star for the fact that Lucas has jerked us around with so many re-releases.  Honestly, I am not at all thrilled by Lucas' greed and disrespect for the fanbase.  But in all fairness, I cannot deny the quality of the product itself.  Its worth a look at the very least, and if you don't mind shelling out more cash to Lucas, its a good buy.	4.0	Re: changes/updates	2004-10-02	4	2	2

People were giving standing ovations, and our mother had to take me and my older brother the next day again. Needless to say, I love the first three movies. Also needless to say, the three new ones suck (OK, the last one is not bad). Living in Germany at the time, some 15 years ago I bought a VHS THX collectors box of the first three movies in England. My son is now 7 and he loves the Clone Wars, Lego Star Wars etc., so I would really start watching the old movies with him.I have seen some reviews on the blue rays here, so I was hesitant buying them because of the new additions on top of the old ones. So instead, I searched for the old VHS tapes, connected the old VHS player, and.... oh my God, the quality was really bad.So I just ordered the three old movies on blue ray, also for these reasons:(1) Yes, I hate the additions to the old movies, too. Totally unnecessary. But then again, I have to agree with another reviewer, that these additions make up ca. 0.05% of the movies, so who cares?(2) I guess George Lucas is having a bad conscience selling us the same stuff over and over again. I say, let him do his little additions so he can sleep at night. I had to think about an intro by Matt Groening in the Season 1 DVD box of the Simpsons. He wrote: ""You bought all the VHS tapes, and now I am selling you the same thing on DVD. And in a few years, when we have a new fancy format, I will sell them to you again"". He was probably right.(3) Watching the same movies over and over again may get boring at some point. Trying to find Lucas' modifications actually sounds like fun, and then raging about them even more. By the way: Who shot first: Han or the other guy? C'mon...May the force be with you, and find all the additions, you may...****************************UPDATE 9-29-11I have seen The Empire Strikes Back now, and must say that the quality is awesome.

Do not encourage George Lucas to continue reshaping & remaking this successful trilogy well into the future until it becomes distorted beyond repair. It is unfortunate that many fans are willing to accept this new trilogy anyway, & are desperate to have anything out on dvd, even if it no longer resembles the original films, despite all kinds of questionnable changes & edits to the films. Hayden Christiansen's performance in Attack of the Clones was one of the worst things about that film, & now they want to have 'continuity' between the 2 trilogies by using him in Return of the Jedi? Leave the badness of the recent trilogy out of the goodness of the first one.Judging by the updates of the past few months we keep getting from the Lucas camp concerning these dvds, they refuse to even acknowledge the original versions, citing that these new ones are the 'definitive' versions. That's fine, & they can believe that if they want to, but can they at least include the original theatrical versions in the set so we can keep those & use the 'definitive' versions as coasters?To be honest, Lucas & his people have been downright arrogant when asked about including the original versions.What original versions? You had your last chance to get them when they came out in 93 on laserdisc/vhs, they say. Why this attitude? All that many fans are asking is if they could have the original versions, let's say- as a 'bonus feature'-included in the upcoming dvd set. Put them in & call them 'the incomplete/working versions', if that's what he wants. But Lucas won't even budge on that. Is it really so difficult to grant this wish to the many who grew up with & loved the original versions?Unless they do a swift turnaround at the last minute & decide to release the original versions with the dvd set, I'm not going anywhere near this box set. They've shown nothing but contempt for the fans up until now. It even seems that many dvd websites have adopted a spirit of appeasement towards Lucas & the upcoming dvds, afraid to upset him lest he really decides not release the original versions at any time. I know everyone is hoping for that, but I refuse to get down on my knees & play nice.Say No to Lucas, don't buy these dvds, & get the original versions off of ebay. Yes, they will be transfers to dvd from the '93 laserdiscs. Yes, they will be inferior in image quality to those of the upcoming dvds. But they will be forever more real than the tripe Lucas will be releasing in a few months.What a disappointment, to have this trilogy finally released, but in such a questionnable/controversial way........."	1.0	So it has come to this	2004-06-08	27	21	6

Watching these again brought back my childhood. Lucas has made even more changes to the DVD versions of the films (after he already changed them with the 1997 Special Editions), and most of them are positive. Lucas has even changed a few things back from the '97 editions, most notably the now-infamous ""Greedo shoots first"" scene in the cantina. In the new version, Greedo and Han Solo shoot at the same time, but Han's dodge still looks fake. There are also prequel-related changes, such as Hayden Christensen's appearing at the end of Return of the Jedi as Vader's ghost instead of Sebastian Shaw, who appeared as the unmasked Vader in the original 1983 version of ROTJ. On one of the DVD documentaries, Bill Moyers says that with these films George Lucas ""enhanced the entire cultural imagination.""

I honestly didn't mind the changes made in 1997.  Perhaps they were a bit more show-offish than adding any real meat and potatoes to the story, but they weren't a major distraction for me.  What IS a real distraction is adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Jedi.  This so-called 'actor' gives the most wooden, amateurish performances I've seen in ages, so adding even the slightest reminder of this goofball to the 3 classic films is absolutely abhorrent to me.  In my universe, the overly kidified advertisements for Star Wars playsets known as episode one and two don't exist so adding a reminder of them to the tasty portion of the movie series is a serious low blow from Darth Lucas.

I don't mind minor changes to make the effects look better, etc...but when you change the basis of the characters and add to the storyline with your ""improvements"", we have a problem (Greedo shooting first, Han's meeting with CGI Jabba).Some people will say, ""It's his film...he'll do what he wants."" Certainly.  Nobody's denying that.  But I think the main point people forget is that it's the FANS that make movies great.  Not to suggest that box office take is suggestive of artistic appeal, but if the FANS hadn't eaten up the original trilogy, Lucas would be broke.  Now that I think of it, if Lucas was broke again maybe that would encourage him to get back to the basics of filmmaking and make some good movies again!  But I digress...I WILL be buying this DVD set, but I will always prefer the original untampered classics, and I will always be a supporter of getting the originals on DVD someday...even if it never happens.

I bought these DVD's since I didn't have any of the movies on VHS or DVD and rec'd them the other day.  I have watched Return of the Jedi, Empire Strikes back, and the extra DVD with all the bonus footage.  I've yet to watch ""A New Hope"" since I've seen it so many times so cannot comment on it yet.  First, I feel the bonus DVD was worth the price of admission.  I love to see how things were made and all the artistic background stuff since my B.A. is in retail advertising.  I can see what other people are saying when they speak of the little details that were changed in these DVD's.  Things like skys being much bluer and brighter, or machines and creatures being more detailed, and I was ok with that.  However, when I watched the Return of the Jedi and saw how it had been changed from the original version, to say I was ticked would be the understatement of the year!  How could Lucas take out the original man who played Darth in the last scene, and replace his image with that of Hayden's?  It was like blasphemy to me!  It was totally stupid of him and totally didn't work and messed up the final scenes.  Also, he added some New Years type celebration scenes in the end that seemed totally out of place and really corny.  I just don't understand why Lucas would ruin his perfectly good art like that and with additions that made no sense.  Come on now, we see old Yoda and Ben in the end as they were when they died, so why now are we seeing a young Anakin instead of the older, good version after he died like in the original?  Like I said, the bonus DVD is worth the cost in my opinion, but be warned that the Return of the Jedi ending is not true, not it's original self.

And quality wise, it looks fresher than when it hit the silver screens back in the 70's. The colors are fresh and bright, candy comes to mind when you see the pinks reds blues and violets, the flesh tones are scrumptous, it truly sets the standards for the DVD revolution.

Smart	I've just read a comment on these pages suggesting that Star Wars is a complete rip-off of Lord Of The Rings, which is probably the most stupid thing I've ever heard. George Lucas was inspired by myths, legends and fairy tales from centuries before Tolkien ever put pen to paper - the very same things which inspired Tolkien, in fact. They both used the central, defining themes and motifs from these to create their respective works. Some people seem to think Tolkien practically invented the written word ( not to mention the wheel and electricity, probably ) but in fact he was an ultra-conservative and mediocre writer with a fairly impressive imagination, THAT'S ALL. However, there is one thing that's certain - the recent, overrated LOTR films wouldn't EXIST had it not been for the original Star Wars trilogy, which paved the way for every other big-budget blockbuster (both good and bad) that has followed it.	5.0	GET A GRIP!	2004-04-01	1	0	1

Please, please, PLEASE everyone cross your fingers that Lucas saw fit to ""clean up"" the effects he added, to at least help these stand up to the visuals of his prequels.

I didn't exactly agree with it, but I thought it would be interesting to see how he could make it work, and whether it would add more depth to what were already amazing movies.The additions didn't add anything.  And some of the changes were distracting.Now, the entire trilogy has literally been butchered in the name of ""perfection.""I'm not a die-hard Star Wars fan.  I loved the movies growing up-- they're part of my childhood.  I could care less about exactly how fast the Millenium Falcon can go or how many worlds were affected by the Imperial Senate.BUT... there's a point where messing around with a film just obliterates what was so special about it in the first place-- and Lucas has now done that with his original three films.  One of the beauties of Star Wars were how the special effects turned out-- for their day, they were amazing.  Rather than throw CGI into it (that have honestly looked so fake that it makes scenes laughable), marvel at the complexity of models and hand-made special effects.  Celebrate the achievement that Star Wars WAS.  It won the Oscar for special effects-- the hard work that has now been taken over by poor CGI all for the sake of Lucas' ""perfection.""Now I just need to figure out how to get my VHS copies of the trilogy into some digital form before they become unplayable-- because these new, doctored versions are simply unwatchable for anyone who enjoyed the movies as a child.Rated 1 star out of 5-- the only star being given for restoring the color of the original picture."	1.0	A prime example of messing with it too much	2004-09-26	37	28	9

The bottom line for me is that I've waited a very long time for the ""Star Wars"" movies to come out on DVD, and I'm happy to finally own them.  However, the boxed set could have been a little nicer.  The actual box that the DVDs come in is quite flimsy, which is disappointing.  It is also disappointing to see all the little tweaks and changes Lucas has made to all three movies, none of which really make anything better and a few of which have actually pissed a lot of fans off.  (For example, in one of the final scenes in ""Return of the Jedi,"" the ghost version of Darth Vader/Old Anakin that appears next to the ghosts of Yoda and Obi-Wan has been replaced with Hayden Christensen/20-something Anakin.  It doesn't make any SENSE!  They didn't replace Alec Guinness with Ewan McGregor, so why mess with Anakin at all?  I don't understand!)Despite the little indescrepancies, it's nice to have a version (any version) of the ""Star Wars"" films to enjoy.

To be a little different, I'll talk about Empire.  Changing a line (spoken to a robot) from ""You're lucky you don't taste very good"" to ""You're lucky to be alive."" Adding that goofy scream when Luke plummets to his fate (which I heard they then took out, and put back in softened, and who knows what will be on this release?).  The terrible re-edit with flash cuts and CG imperial shuttle in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  Taking the time to CG up all the effects, but still not getting rid of the blue screen artifact ""boxes"" around the asteroids and tie fighters (I mean, if you're going to ""fix"" it, then go ahead and fix it).  Not that I mind the boxes.  They were a product of when the movie was made, and I like that.  I like time capsules on film, which is exactly why I don't like the ""special"" editions.So, yeah.

It's good, I think, to strive for accuracy and truth to original intent.After reading many of the reviews on Amazon about the various versions of the original trilogy (on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray), I am just confused.  Still, fwiw, I do recall ""A New Hope"" not being on the crawl when I saw the original Star Wars in a theater in 1977.I just finished watching the Blu-ray version of Episode IV, and I thought it was fabulous, even if Greedo did shoot first this time around. That does bother me a little, but it happened so fast, I must say I wouldn't have noticed it had I not seen someone wearing a ""Han Shot First"" T-shirt the other day.Here's the catch, as far as I'm concerned. Han Solo commented that the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in less that 12 parsecs. Hello! A parsec, as many of us space geeks and also even regular people know, is a unit of distance and not of time. Can't believe I didn't notice that in the 70s, when I was even geekier, and certainly more observant (I would think), than the current middle-aged version of me. Wonder if this blunder was added as an ""enhancement""?Just had to go on record about that parsec thing. Still, I thought the Blu-Ray version was great, and I'm going to just stop trying to figure out what's original and what was changed along the way.

I know, there's Indiana Jones, but I think it's safe to say that Spielberg won't let him ruin that too.That's what the new fans can't understand about us who can't stand the new versions. It's not just that he's creating new effects, it's that he's ruining the experience by destroying the original. They can't understand it because it hasn't happened to them yet. To love something for decades, realizing that you contributed to enlarge its creator's bank account, and to hear from his own mouth that that thing you once loved doesn't exist anymore simply because he feels like butchering it. Those who think he's right should be aware that by endorsing this action they might fall victim of someone else doing the same with something THEY love in the future. Then they will understand.Speaking about George Lucas, I really can't understand him. On one side it looks like all he cares about is profit, on the other, he reduces said profit by alienating many (if not most) of the people who helped him built his own empire. Maybe all he wants is to generate discussion so he can be just as famous as his creation. I don't know.So let's just be thankful all he can ruin are the Star Wars movies. Can you imagine the atrocities Lucas would have done to films like Casablanca. To fit with the Star War films, he would probably turn all the soldiers into imperial troopers, replace Louis Armstrong with some childish CGI character and change the title to ""Mos Eisley"".

The newly released versions of these three great films on DVD is simply astounding and beyond my wildest hopes. The restoration is a work of technological genius.Obviously Star Wars has been a ""work in progress"" since 1977. Nobody knew whether Lucas would be able to do any more of these films and so the first one was deliberately set in the middle of the story (at the most exciting part) yet filmed as a ""one-shot."" When it became obvious that the box-office success of the 1977 film would allow Lucas to make two more episodes, he made his first tweak with the original film by rereleasing it in 1979 as ""Episode IV""...nobody complained about that. It was a work in progress and it still is. Though ""The Phantom Menace"" was clearly billed as Episode I, most Star Wars fans refused to see it that way but instead looked at it with blinders on. The first part of any story rarely achieves the same level of drama or action as the final parts.The contention that Lucas couldn't make the films that he envisioned in 1977 is evidenced by the existence of unfinished scenes such as the one from the 1977 film featuring Harrison Ford talking to a non-existent Jabba. The scene was never finished because of costs. Other scenes were not possible because the FX technology simply did not exist, such as depicting Corruscant. Casting Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine in Episode VI was a brilliant decision, and hopefully in Episode III most fans will recognize how brilliant an actor McDiarmid is to have first played a later version of a character, then, as an older man to play an earlier version of that same character. Lastly, some FX shots simply had to be redone. Some people may wince at the additions; I, for one, always winced when they showed the cheesy scene of Alderaan blowing up in 1977. But have you seen it on the 2004 DVD? Wow.It is simply marvelous to watch ""A New Hope"" the way it was originally intended to be shot. And it will be even more incredible to watch all six episodes together when Episode III is completed. To get a feel for what that experience might be like, watch the Larson home scene on the Episode II DVD, and then take a look at the same set as it appears at the beginning of Episode IV on DVD. This will give you a greater appreciation for the level of detail and consistency Lucas is bringing to the entire series. It's marvelous. As for somebody's comment that Darth Vader only appears in two minutes of Episode III, don't you realize how long two minutes is? Watch any Star Wars movie and watch your clock. You'd be amazed at how much story is covered, and how many different characters appear, in just 30 seconds.I'm already having a greater appreciation for The Phantom Menace now that we have at least 5 episodes presented the way they were meant to be seen, and on DVD in widescreen. The Phantom Menace is a wonderful beginning, visually spectacular.George Lucas has given us a wonderful, modern mythology. Even Joseph Campbell recognized this fact. Although the mystical elements of Star Wars get overlooked, it's hard to imagine how anyone could not see the analogy between history (or, for that matter, current events) regarding how a Republic turns into an Evil Empire. This compelling epic saga is the brilliant vision of one man...George Lucas. Anybody that can't see this cannot see the forest for the trees. Future generations won't give a crap about what the fanboys here are whining about...they will see all 6 episodes consecutively as they were meant to be shown.And I'll admit Star Wars is still a work in progress. Something tells me Lucas isn't finished yet. I can't wait until he replaces all those damn Ewoks with more interesting CGE creatures...please!!!

Fine, Lucas wanted to update some thing. I dont have a problem with that but when you change key plot points and whole character arcs because the Director has changed his mind than who are the losers except the people that paid Lucas and supported these movies originally?Guido shooting first is one of the biggest travesties to this trilogy and that is first and formost why I wont buy it.How about both versions Lucas?

Lucas just wants to update the film so it is a more coheasive whole when the third one is finished. It is wierd seeing Hayden Christensen in the spot of the old Darth Vader in ROTJ but Lucas apparently had a reason for it. I don't think we should take offence of the changes in this version because we already know Lucas likes to change things. If we don't like this version the true fans still have the ORIGINAL (pre-Special Edition) Widescreen VHS versions of the trilogy...although it would be nice to see that version in DVD quality. I think most of the changes are for the better in this DVD version. The colors are more vibrant and the CG Jabba in ""A New Hope"" looks more textured...although I still don't really care for that scene. The only thing that is a little disappointing are the commentaries. I would have liked more actors to give their opinions and insights into the movie instead of Lucas rambling on about why he did this and justifying why he did that. I would have also liked to have had Lucas point out all the new stuff in this DVD version and why he did it.

Just be glad he didn't replace Yoda with the CGI version from Episode II and III.First of all, let's start with the movies:A New Hope:The first ever Star Wars movie is easily the best. It's just an old fashioned fairy tale. You have the innocent hero in Luke Skywalker, the evil villain in Darth Vader (even though the prequels will change all that), the damsel in distress (albeit, one who will kick some ass before she's done) in Princess Leia, and so on and so forth.The cast gives memorable performances but it's the visual effects that steal the show (and also get the Oscar). I did not see Star Wars until the 1997 re-release so I really have no problem with some of the ""tinkerings"" courtesy of George Lucas.The one noticeable tinkering on this DVD that I have no problem with is the fixing up of Jabba the Hutt who was barely recognizable in the 1997 re-release.The Empire Strikes Back:Another amazing movie, probably better than the first Star Wars. More memorable characters, more amazing special effects, and of course, more tinkerings. I actually don't have a problem with the addition of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor hologram or Temuera Morrison rerecording Boba Fett's lines. It helps to keep the trilogy consistent with the prequels.Return of the Jedi:This movie pulls out all the stops, even though it is a bit more excessive than it's toned down predecessors. The biggest tinkering that I do have a problem with is the substitution of Sebastian Shaw by Hayden Christiansen. That just made me go, ""Huh?""All in all, they are amazing films and will forever be land marks in the history of film. Unfortunately, these changes mean that future viewers may end up watching the prequels first.

I have to say that I have waited a long time for this and unfortunately I also have to say that I'm very disappointed.I realised that the versions released would be the Special Edition from -97 witch includes CGI scenery that already looks outdated by now. Unlike many of the classic effects...But what bothers me most is that Lucas have messed about with the films even more and at such scenery's that it makes me very disappointed. For example: the classic moment from ROTJ were Luke takes of Dart Vader's helmet. I think everyone remembered how exiting it was to finally get so see how Dart Vader looked under the helmet. It was a classic moment that everyone remembers!In the DVD-version Sebastian Shaw's head is replaced by Hayden Christensen's from Episode III. My first question is why this would be necessary? Didn't he think a younger audience would understand Return Of The Jedi after they have watched Episode III? If thats the case I have to say: Lucas, you underestimate the knowledge of you fans! As Sebastian Shaw has past away I also think it was a bit insensitive to replace him. There are also other scenes that have been changed more or less.The documentary is simply great and very interesting but if you looking for the movies I cant recommend this box. I'm happy I bought a deluxe set of the original widescreen VHS-movies back in -93. Not the same picture or audio quality, but they are the originals to me.If it isn't broke, why fix it..."	1.0	Do you mess with new colour on an old painting?	2004-09-24	34	17	17

When it was released in 1977, no other sci-fi film came close in comparison to the quality and advancement in special effects technology that this film presented. ""Star Wars"" set the standard by which all other sci-fi films are judged to this day.As for the plot, many critics like to say that people continue to watch and enjoy ""Star Wars"" to recapture lost youth. They're wrong! Because we remain young at heart and idealistic about the future, we love films such as ""Star Wars"" that promote the hope of a better tomorrow when so many other things in real life have failed. Films such as ""Star Wars"" ignite the imagination and encourage mankind to reach for the stars! Maybe it's the critics who need to recapture their youth and idealism, both of which appear to be dead and forgotten.My thanks to George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness and the many other cast and crew that brought this remarkable film to life for countless generations to enjoy!"	5.0	One of the BEST Sci-fi Films of all Time!	2002-08-06	2	2	0

I know there are purists out there who don't like the prequels, don't like updating the originals in any way and wish the 4-6 could be released in original form.  I respect and appreciate those opinions but I am not that person, I like the stories of 1-6 equally and I really like seeing the improved pictures on the Blu Rays.  I grew up on 4-6 and I was excited for 1-3 when those came out. I know there must be a few people like me out there or they wouldn't sell many of the Blu Rays.  Picture and sound is really good.  I would recommend these for people who love Star Wars are ok with upgrades and some changes.  *This is the same review I gave for the prequels on Blu Ray and I feel the same about both sets so I duped this review.	5.0	Nice looking Blu Rays	2013-01-08	2	1	1

Even if they made extended cuts, director cuts, or special cuts, they all included the earlier versions as well, giving customers that option.Is King George going to offer up the originals in remastered form ONLY when his stock starts dropping?

These aren't even going to be the special editions, they will be yet another version of the film (though it isn't confirmed yet, we all know they will have changes). I've been a star wars fan for twenty years, and I can truthfully say that I'm going to be very, very happy on September 21st. And what I'm about to say will enrage some people, but I'd rather have new editions for the DVD release as opposed to the original trilogy. Why have I gone crazy, you ask? Because different special effects and a few scene changes don't affect what makes this trilogy so great. It is the characters and the overall story that we all fell in love with in Star Wars, not the way the X-wings looked when they were attached to poles in front of the bluescreen. I'd rather have modern special effects replacements to go along with the improved quality of the DVD format. I think that the obviously outdated special effects would be way too cheesy looking when you have the picture clarity of modern DVDs. Don't get me wrong, I do love the original versions of these films as well, but I can't help but stare at the black bar attached to the nose of X-wings as they explode over the death star's trench. It just takes you out of the whole experience when you look at it today.Anyway, this is more of an opinion than a review, I know, but I had to respond to posts like ""Outraged"" (a couple below here) with my take on the whole DVD thing. To sum up, I love the movies for the characters and story, not the old special effects, so on September 21st I'll be gleefully skipping work to sit down with a whole new version of my favorite movie trilogy of all time."	5.0	Finally, the films that DVD was made for...	2004-07-16	20	10	10

To me the picture and sound was great, clear and crisp but still maintained the &#34;look&#34; of that late 70s/early 80s sci-fi grit. I haven't looked at the extras that may or may not come with this set, so I cannot comment on that.The one thing I really hated (along with, it seems, every other nerd in the world) was all the CGI Mr. Lucas went back and put in -- the worst scenes being the Mos Eisley Spaceport arrival scene and adding the Sarlaac coming out of the Pit of Carkoon. This is where watching these in HD is not good. The CGI looks awful, it's like suddenly being transported into a SyFy Channel original movie. Lucky for us it's only a handful of scenes across the three films.If you like the original movies, want HD, and don't mind some crap CGI here and there, then go ahead and pick this up.

Shurack	I have to agree with the majority here, the unedited theatrical versions should be made available as an option to us fans and collectors. As someone who will never (no exceptions) watch an edited movie or television show I will not now nor ever purchase this edition being released for any amount of money and I would urge anyone reading this review to do the same. I also agree that the long awaited episodes I through III were extremely disappointing and not up to the standards one would expect from the likes of George Lucas. Although I liked Nalalie Portman in her role I thought that Christian Haydensen was woefully miscast as Anakin Skywalker and I thought that Episode I was more of a childrens movie than anything else. I guess in the end it comes down to this; Mr Lucas has the right to release his movies in any version or format he sees fit but I also have the right not to buy them. Hopefully, the vast majority of fans will see it this way as well. Let's hope that eventually Mr Lucas will relent and do the right thing both for his fans and his reputation.	1.0	ORIGINALS PLEASE	2011-04-09	11	7	4

It's the first movie I ever saw on a VCR, I find occassion to quote it every day, and, heck it even helped save my life once. So yeah of course I'm pre-ordering this DVD set, buying a movie trilogy I've already purchased 3 or 4 times.The only thing I want--the only thing I hope to Yoda will be on these discs--is an option to remove some of George's ""enhancements"".You know the ones. The little tweaks that he put in back when he first started to lose his mind. Like that awful Jabba scene. And Biggs. And... Greedo firing first.These changes heralded the Dark Times, when George started to fall to the temptations of The Dark Side: computer graphics. Such technological terrors were the harbingers of Jar Jar Binks, the Dark Lord himself.I pray that George will include the original cantina scene, unspolit and uncorrupted. And, failing that, I pray DVD-R technology will have advanced enough by the time this set comes out that such a restoration is made possible for home use. :)May the force be with us,Mike Fehlauerps: actual quote from a friend and new father, to whom I sent a ""Share the Love"" notification after I purchased this set:""Dude, I'm so torn on this.

Hopkins ""A Deeper Groove"""	"At the risk of sounding hopelessly naive, or fartoo brusque for those millions who sweat bloodover which STAR WARS edition is best, I'll simplysay this: the original film trilogy from the late1970s and early 1980s is finally available on DVD.Between the digital remastering (even sharper thanwhat creator George Lucas did in 1997), and thenecessary retooling that Lucas did with each filmas technology grew to match his imagination(particularly where the climax of RETURN OF THEJEDI is concerned), this 4-DVD set is worth thelong wait.While I prefer the deeper speculation and greatersophistication of the current STAR WARS films, thepriceless value of the original trilogy cannot bedenied. Tapping into the heart of Samurai ethic,Zen contemplation, Saturday matinee thrills, andthe wildness of the times from which they came,A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURNOF THE JEDI struck deep into viewer attitudesand corporate beliefs with a straightforwardtale holding an array of subtle twists withinits outwardly simple storyline.""Fractured fairy tale"" might be one way ofdiscerning the heart of this STAR WARS saga.Consider the basics. The Damsel runs offwith the Charming Rogue, while the Adversaryin Black has more in common with the BlondeHero than either realize. The Good Guys areas much from the savage and the bizarre asthey are from the highly cultivated and thepurportedly enlightened; each facing extinctionunless they overcome their prejudices, andwork together to defeat the true enemy.There are no absolutes here. The Adversaryin Black is compelled to redeem himself,while the triumphant Blonde Hero feelsthat he must stand apart from all.Whatever else had to be fought for since,STAR WARS has proven that a tale of SFand Fantasy could hold mass audiences,and reap financial fortunes whileweaving a story of considerableethical value and narrativedelight.With his imagination, his discipline,and his drive, Lucas has influenceda cavalcade of talespinners, fromRidley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, LEGEND)to J. Michael Straczynski (BABYLON 5)and Steven Spielberg (from CLOSEENCOUNTERS and E.T. to  A.I. andMINORITY REPORT).Funny thing. Scott, Straczynski, andSpielberg each had to re-touch andremaster some of their most classicwork. Scott finally was able to putLEGEND out properly only recently,after the film was corporatelybutchered some 20 years ago.Straczynski's pilot for BABYLON 5was better after its creatorwent back and tightened the taleas he originally wanted to.Why should Lucas be denied theright to do likewise, especiallysince the finished results haveproven far superior to the oftenrushed, decidedly made-under-pressure originals?Which STAR WARS is best?George Lucas', as fineas he can make it.Don't miss it!Of course, in considering itsmany missives, and eye-poppingwonder, please do not forgetone very important thing...Have fun!"	5.0	Worth The Wait!	2004-09-28	9	3	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3VNTMEAJ5LVUF	"Michael ""Film critic"""	I am a 31 year old male who absolutely lived and breathed Star Wars as a child. I think that George Lucas is a very talented and genuinely cool guy but I have a problem with the new star wars movies phantom menace and AOTC. How in the world was he supposed to blend these in with the older ones we grew up with? I think they have so much eye candy that we can't possibly believe they happened before the ones we grew up with. I understand that the change in movie technology is tempting to a imaginitive director like Lucas but it does not work 100% for me. The special editions that came out in the late 90's did not go overboard but they surely don't have enough to fit with these new movies the last 5 years. I also do not like hayden very much and think they could have found a better person to play Anakin Skywalker. The Jar Jar Binks thing is a complete debacle if you ask me and the one person who really brought legitimacy to phantom menace was killed!(Liam Neeson). I am glad Lucas is using Christopher Lee in these movies though as he is the true last living legend of the screen in my opinion and just his presence helps a lot. Ewan Mcgregor is also doing a pretty decent job. By the way it seems obvious to me that General Palpatine is eventually indeed the evil Emperor and I figured that out right away without reading like most of us did.  But something is still wrong with this whole Star Wars thing.....too much eye candy and it is appealing more to the youthful audience then us older die hards. I agree that the older versions should have been released or atleast they should not put Hayden's face on the ghost of vader, but I do feel it is ok to have some of the subtle changes from the Special Editions intact. If they did not do that the old movies would really not fit with this new series of pre-quels. I think it is too late for us to complain though and I only hope that this May I will not be too disapointed with the next movie. Phantom Menace was a bit better then attack of the clones in my opinion but if this gets any crazier I will just stick to my old ones.	4.0	My problem with the whole Lucas getting carried away thing!	2004-09-20	10	3	7

(Mind you, these are the bonus discs.  I guess you can use the other three for sun-catchers or coasters for your coffee table.)  Gone are the awkward juxtapositions of the original special effects (based on painstakingly hand-crafted models) with nasty-looking CGI short-cuts.  Other benefits:- No silly scenes in the Tatooine hanger with a much less feared & respected Jabba- Han shoots first!- Hear the Ewok celebration song in its entirety!- No bizarre appearance of the ghost of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return of the Jedi!- The plant from Little Shop of Horrors no longer caught in the throat of the great Sarlacc!- Original nude slave wrestling scene returned to scene in Jabba's palace!Ok, I think I may have dreamt that last one, but STILL!

The topic has been discussed ad infinitum all over the net, and he, no doubt is aware of the outcry regarding the original trilogy. We are not going to change his mind.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2960PS33QUVC4	Michael McFadden	"[...]First, in review this film set is a disgusting hack of a classic and historical landmark in film-making.  These films have been modified from their original content without notice to the public, therefore deceiving those seeking to purchase a fond memory.  They are poor adaptations with CGI makeovers and inserts that will be undesirable to most original fans.  The film score too has been modified and mucks up a classic compilation.  For the trained ear, the cuts and inserts will be unpleasantly noticeable.If George Lucas wants to screw up his newest trilogy series and print a lot of eye candy with a poor story, that's his business.  He knows that he will and has disappointed his original fans by great leaps and bounds.  However, it's not only a disappointment to original fans to purchase this altered ORIGINAL film series, the production itself is a crime of deception.To elaborate, a film is a work of art, regardless of it's title and so on.  Each film piece is of course the property and vision of the artist, regardless of how good or bad it may appear to the public.  However, once a piece has been published, for those who appreciate that publication, any changes thereafter naturally provoke an emotional response and most often a negative one.  To make an analogy, would anyone who admires the ""Mona Lisa"" appreciate an adaptation that changed her hair style, clothing and such to meet modern day trends?  The answer is just this... For anyone who appreciates a good joke, maybe.  But for a true art collector, not a chance.  Further, to package and sell such a rework under the pretence that it is an original print would be a crime of deception.I direct this next segment to the writer of the review titled ""A Note From A Lucas Employee.""  Dear John,  your excuses about time constraints and such are as ridiculous as this product.  A majority of those purchasing this product, did so believing they were getting an original work that captured and launched a following of epic proportions.  Several generations of fans have been crushed by these adaptations.  In your write up you explain that Lucas gave you and the rest of his crew little time to phase these pictures over to DVD.  I have to scratch my head and wonder how long it really takes to copy the films to a new media format?  I can only believe that such an effort takes about an hour or two at the most.  I can guarantee that not one fan asked for the Lucas team to recolor lightsabers or Jaba.  Not one fan asked for the Lucas team to extend the film series by inserting cheap and slopped together CGI extras.  Further, not one fan complained or said that the original film score needed modification.  Each of the adaptations are so obvious to anyone who knows this series well and they stand out like an unwanted sore thumb.  You also mention that Lucas graciously did this to please his audience with a DVD series just before DVDs are to be replaced by a newer technology.  You add that original cuts will soon be available in 2007 on the newest media.  How does one respond to this statement?  Well, my response is... What concession are you trying to offer here?  I see your speech and this product as a slap in the face and as a statement of ""here everyone, waste your money on this product, feel ill towards it, and when the newest releases hit the street, we'll look forward to you lining our pockets with gold once more.""  In other words you have simply stated in bold terms... ""SUCKERS.""  If I may be so bold to speak for original fans, we thank you for this load of crap!  And by the way, my sympathies to you and the Lucas team if your feeling a bit overworked.In response to those who would bash ones who feel pain over purchasing this rather expensive product which adapts the original works and deceives expectation, I'm sure you would much rather go back to your TV set and watch a re-run of the oh-so-realistic Mighty Morphan Power Rangers.  So grab your pacifiers, insert them appropriately, and please keep your less than educated comments to yourselves.What many today fail to realize is that the original Star Wars was a budget film with special effects and such that were less than adequate, even for its time.  Additionally, most of the characters were portrayed by no name actors. And yet regardless, the imagination and creativity of the story and  film managed to achieve such a success, recognition and following that it will outlive its original fan base and many more to follow.  Personally, I can remember when ""Empire Strikes Back"" came out, it took weeks to get near the box office just to get a ticket.  Not even the Matrix or any other film I'm aware of to include the new trilogy films, has managed to pull that off.  There is a significant value to the original trilogy and that value has been diminished in this so called original release.  In my opinion, this release only adds to the disappointment felt by original fans as a result of the short minded and less than creative story compiled in the newest trilogy.Now I have to ask this, why would anyone need to adapt original works to fit new works?  Unless, the newer works were being slopped together for a quick buck and it becomes easiest to make modifications to the originals to aid in this cheap and capitalist effort.  I take nothing away from the difficulty and efforts it must take to produce a good story.  However, if your going to do something, why not do it right from the start?  Why make a new series that doesn't link well with the original series?  Lucas had everything he and his crew needed to make the new productions into  blockbuster hits that could have been remembered throughout history just as his originals have thus far.  Yet what has been produced instead is a film series that completely defies the original story content and is so laden with inconsistencies, over-dramatics, and CGI that no matter what modifications are made to either trilogy, the series as a whole will never mesh.In closing, I give the ""ORIGINAL"" trilogy a 5/5.  I then give this release a 2/5 as it is not the original film by any stretch of the words.  As one review writer exclaimed ""George we want our money back!""  As a fan, I personally want the original movies on DVD as I had believed I was getting.To add one more comment, I rate the newest story line with a 1/5 as it is directed at children and the weak minded who are easily drawn in by the dazzle of carnival lighting effects with little else.  Simply, the story as a whole is weak and lacks the talent of a truly creative writer and relies solely on computer generated graphics for any entertainment value."	2.0	A Note To A Lucas Employee	2005-05-29	24	17	7
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AP7IW8QR4782P	Michael M. Dunham	"I, along with so many others, have waited and waited for Lucas to finally release these movies on DVD.  I was going to wait until Christmas to get it, but I decided I just couldn't wait anymore.  So now that I own it and have had it for a few days, I'm here to tell all of you to buy these DVDs.  Now.Let's start with the most basic - how are the movies themselves?  I doubt anybody really needs me to tell them that all three of these are fantastic movies (although ""Return of the Jedi"" could have been better).  The stories, characters, music, sound effects, and visual effects (for their time) are simply fantastic.  There are very few reasons to not like these movies, they should appeal to just about everybody.So what about the fact that these are the special editions, and not the original movies?  Well, I'll be completely honest - I've never seen the original versions.  I wasn't introduced to Star Wars until the special editions were re-releasted in the theaters, so I can't compare these with the originals.  I have noticed a few scenes in the movies where things just don't look quite right, where something looks too ""digital"" or looks like it's too complicated for late-70s or early-80s visual effects.  And while these things are noticeable at times, in my opinion they don't take anything away from the enjoyment of watching these movies.The special features are nice.  The documentary about Star Wars, ""Empire of Dreams,"" is one of the most impressive things I've seen on a bonus materials disc - it's two and a half hours long!  There are a few other documentaries that I haven't gotten a chance to watch yet, along with a nice preview of episode III (but if you're looking for something with a lot of scenes from the upcoming movie, you'll be disappointed), some bonus material about Star Wars video games, trailers and TV spots, and still photos.The sound and picture are spectacular, much better than I expected and just as good as I hoped.  This is getting long and you're probably getting bored of reading this, so I'll stop now.  In short, this is a must-have for anybody with a remote interest in Star Wars.  Or for that matter, for anybody with a remote interest in good movies."	5.0	Worth the Wait	2004-10-17	12	6	6

These new scenes were not even added as a bonus track to watch at the end of the shows.  I have not found an option to delete them  like with Jabba in episode IV which I will do so in a heartbeat.

After toiling with beat up video tapes, devoted fans can finally revel in the splendor of DVD's crisp picture, amazing sound, and stunning clarity, for each film has been remastered to have all of these and more in stunning quality. The picture is incredibly sharp, and while it will never look as clear as the digital film used in the latest films, it looks quite good. The sound is good--definately to be enjoyed on a nice home theater system. The package comes with a bevy of extras that should keep the fans happy.The only thing any good Star Wars fan will complain about is the fact that Lucas has once again made changes to the movies. Why? We all understand that Lucas was frustrated with the level of technology available and how it impacted his vision, but these are the movies fans have grown to love and the fans do not want them changed. It is too bad that Lucas has chosen to ignore the will of the fan and add things to make himself content.Everyone, from the diehard Star Wars fan to the passing enthusiast who might have caught Episode II on HBO should get this package and relive the saga from the beginning and see just how GREAT this sci-fi classic really is.	4.0	Superb, but why did Lucas add more changes?	2004-09-21	11	7	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ANVMYQWSEWUJX	Michael R. Schneider	How is it possible that I have now bought the exact same (well, almost) movies on video tape for now the FOURTH TIME?  Yes, I'm one of those people  who own the original letterbox release, the letterbox THX release, and the  letterbox Special Edition box set.  Now, as soon as Mr. Lucas announces yet  another marketing of the Holy Trilogy, I'm there with my credit card on  Amazon.com!  Heck, I don't even BUY video cassettes anymore, I have a DVD  player!  Why do I keep shelling out hard earned dollars for the same  movies?Well, if you really need to ask that question, you're obviously  not a Star Wars fan.  Without a doubt, there movies have become immortal  for one reason:  they have ressurected the myth genre.  While the Greeks  and Romans had their famous mythologies, Aesop had his fables, and the  Britsh had King Arthur, the last generation of the 20th Century has Star  Wars.We were raised on Star Wars.  Dreams of becoming a Jedi were as  common as future proffessions such as doctor or policeman back at my grade  school.  I doubt a day went by between my fourth and tenth years of life  where the accolades of Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO weren't acted  out in my daily play with my friends.  We didn't play &quot;Cowboys and  Indians.&quot;  We played &quot;Rebels and Imperials.&quot;  We didn't have  gun fights, we battled each other with whatever could substitute for a  lightsaber.In retrospect, now that I'm all grwon up, I'm thankful for  Lucas for what he gave me.  These movies laid of a simple play of good  versus evil.  In the end, the quest for virtue will always triumph over the  greed of evil.  They also taught me that if you believe in yourself and  have faith a higher power, you can accomplish anything.  For this, you will  see me ordering this trilogy every time it is released.  Not just for the  &quot;Episode II Behind-The-Scenes&quot; stuff, but basically to give the  well-worn copies I already own a break.  Thank you, Mr. Lucas.  You've  brought great joy into my life and helped to teach me the values I have  today.  Though I don't have children yet, I'm sure that when they come  along, they will be living out the same fantasies I did a long time ago in  a galaxy far, far away...P.S.

So, it is with a sad heart and sadder eyes that I will pass up this DVD offer and once again fire up the old VCR and watch my originals for my annual viewing.A few questions I have to for the ""let Lucas stretch his creativity"" camp.  1.  Do the additions add anything whatsoever to the story line--or are they simply stoking an aging moviemaker's ego?  and 2.  Obi Wan dies old, his ghost is old.  Anakin dies old, after finally returning to the Light Side and giving himself to the force, and his ghost is...young???  Am I the only one who sees this makes no sense???

"I was so looking forward to seeing Star Wars released to Blu Ray, but having seen The Empire Strikes Back on a 50"" LED SONY BRAVIA 1080p TV, I am so not liking Star Wars. The clarity of the HD is so wonderful, you can see every production flaw, every fake prop, every not-so-perfect scenery set element, and Chewbacca's hair looks like a cheap fake fur ape suit. None of this can be seen in the theatrical film, or on VHS or DVD. On those media, these errors are hidden by the subtle smoothness of film. But, in the BluRay HD versions, I swear, it's like watching the movie as if it was recorded on video tape. Even the actors movements seem artificial, flat, and not very convincing. Truly, its like watching what someone would have created using a video camera. The lighting even seem too artificial.  The problem, as I see it, is HD has taken away the softness of the film rendering and replaced it with the harshness of reality. There is no denying the picture is incredibly sharp and crystal clear, and here lay the problem. This is suppose to be a Science Fantasy movie, but it feels more like watching a reality show on the Making of Star Wars. The HD has completely removed the ability for me to suspend reality and take in the story. The HD makes every visual element appear too REAL - too ""this is a movie prop"".My advice - stay with the DVD version. There you get a much better picture than on VHS tape, but it preserves the FILM softness. This is NOT a movie you will want to watch HD unless you really want to watch Star Wars that resembles Dr. Who video taped episodes from the 80s."	2.0	BluRay HD Stinks for Star Wars	2011-10-14	11	6	5

I read these reviews for this DVD set and I could not believe the whinney-ass people griping about George Lucas and how horrible he is. All of them complaining about how he keeps changing the movies around and adding new things to them. Never find the FACT that these are his films and he's the one who MADE them to begin with. Never mind the FACT that it was HIS (...) on the line when he made the first one back in '77 that you all love so much. Never mind the FACT no one believed that the movie would be any good and he constantly had 20th Century Fox on his back. He hated the experience so much, he didn't even direct ESB and ROTJ. I think the guy deserves to get his films in the shape that HE wants them to be in. I think he loves Star Wars a far lot more than any of you cry babies. If you REALLY loved Star Wars and not your lost youth, you'd have a better time enjoying the Prequel Trilogy AND these newly revamped Original Trilogy films. All this just makes me like Star Wars even more.The DVDs look great from what I've seen and any REAL Star Wars fan should have them.....and guess what?

How unbelievable, in the age of the DVD, to not give us even the option, of watching the original release of the movies.  It is clear, with the release of Episodes I & II, that Lucas only cares about the money and no longer about the fan base that made him one of the richest people in Hollywood.  At this point, I wouldn't put it past him if he released some kind of ""Collector's Original Edition"" to coincide with the release of Star Wars Episode III, as a vehicle to make yet even more money.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ANAYSRE3LX8GZ	Micheal Hunt	"After all these years of waiting and anticipation for what was said to be the greatest DVD release of all time , looks like its going to be the biggest disapointment of all time. Judging by what the features says, it looks as if there only releasing one of the greatest trilogys of all time in the newer so called ""remastered"" editions. George Lucas promised this wait was going to be worthwhile, and yet he has completly ignored the fans that have kept him in his status of where he is today, and decided not to actualy make a great DVD release.Instead, he has chosen to release not only just the newer versions, he is releasing them in both widescreen and full screen. my pet peeve is not only with that, but would it be so hard to have BOTH wide screen and full screen on the one disc? especially seeing as how theres only going to be audio extras on the discs anyway. But no, Lucas Films wouldnt want to give back to the fans somthing worth while now would they?My second pet peeve is one that I have read so many have agreed with me on, and thats the ORIGINAL presentation of the films. For years they have said that this DVD release would be the best release ever. Well, looks like there not going to live up to that expectation, why couldnt they include BOTH formats of the movies? why cant they have an option on them? that says ""veiw original presentation? or veiw special edition?"". that would make every body happy, wouldnt you think? OR even flip side discs? One side could have the original, and one side have the newer so called ""improved"" digitly remastered movies.... wouldnt that sound more like somthing to look foraward to?Instead, Lucas has completly lost it with this, the bonus features arnt looking like anything worth looking forward to.... it's possible, but i doubht he would include things like when a few of the cast members where on ""The muppet show"" or various other TV appearences. Heck, the bonus disc should be a flip side too, and come with ""the battle of Endore"" and ""Caravan of courage"". the two forgotten and hardly known Ewok movies he made after ROTJ. They would both fit on one disc, and should be included as a bonus too.Now, wouldnt all these years of wait seem more worthwhile if it came with BOTH editions of each film, the original, and special? both presentations of WIDE and FULL screen? and maybe throw in those two Ewok movies aswell? wouldnt that seem more worth the wait? Instead, Lucas is going to release a disapointing trilogy.... but if you want my advice, wait... dont buy this trilogy.... rent it, and dont make Lucas richer off this box set. because you will be kicking yourself in a couple of years time when Star Wars 3 comes out, and George goes for the ""12 disc box set"" and you think to yourself ""damn, i shouldnt have bought the trilogy i have, i should have bought the new one, with all those extras"" and you'll feel Lucas has ripped you off as it's looking right now... because most likly, he will release the original trilogy, and make money off that too, then find other ways to make money, there will be single editions,special editions,  ultimate editions, mega editions, and probably 2 to choose from in wide or full screens.... This over due and long wait for these so called ""greatest DVD release"" that has been told about, is going to be the greatest rip-off of all time. So many fan's will shut down there lightsabre's, take off there helmets, and walk away feeling like there god has just turned there back on them to make the most money out of them he can. Wookies will be howling at the moon over this.Lucas wouldnt be around, least not int he way he is known today, if it wernt for the fans of Star Wars. And he has completly disapointed all of his fans with this abomination release of one of the greatest trilogys of all time. would both editions, and both widescreen and full screen be asking so much to put onto the one disc for each film? or flip side them? would it really be so hard to give back somthing really special to the fans that made him what he is today? would it really be asking for too much for George to be loyal to the fans, instead of trying to drain them for every cent they have?That's my opinion. There are going to be thousands of disapointed Star War's fans out there when this comes out. If you want my advice? Dont buy it. Rent it, copy it, do whatever, just dont give Lucas any satsfaction of sitting back and seeing the $ sign's rise as he makes money off of somthing that hasnt been treated right... with DVD technoligy, George has ignored the possibilitys, he seems to be too wrapped up in what technology has to offer in rueining classic movies!May the shwartz be with you."	1.0	A Lost Hope	2004-05-28	24	18	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3ITF6QNR581AR	Micheal O Mealoid	Star Wars has everything you could possibly want in a film.  The story is set amidst a battle of good against evil, the plucky and righteous forces of the republic versus the evil and sadistic forces of the empire.  The good guy is a young good looking dreamer who just wants to join the battle for democracy, while the bad guy is a black clad half-human half-robot with dark powers, and with the classiest face mask you've ever seen!  It's got a love triangle, sword play, dog fights in space, humour, torture, a great escape, old enemies fighting to settle an ancient score.... it just goes on and on!But on top of all this stuff of classic stories, it's also a great science fiction story, with dorky robots, exploding planets, lightsabres, spaceships, big furry aliens, not to mention the deathstar and the force!Star Wars was the first really big science fiction film, and led the way for all the other great sci-fi that came along in it's wake.  Just think of Terminator, Alien, Close Encounters, Predator, Jurassic Park, not to mention the resurgence of Star Trek and the resultant flood of sci-fi on tv.  Star Wars made sci-fi into a marketable commodity, and boy did it take off in a big way! It's not often you can point to a specific turning point in popular culture, but that's exactly what Star Wars was.But for me, though, it was the first film I saw in a cinema, a present for my tenth birthday.  Perhaps it's a bit wimpish to call it magical, but that's what it was!  Everything was so cool!  A couple of things really stood out though.  Light sabres - surely the coolest weapon ever.  Darth Vader - a baddie you could really sink your teeth into, all that black leather, the cape, the mask, the voice.  Wow!  R2-D2 - a robot's robot, cute, funny, but clever and steadfastly loyal.  Suddenly, every kid was covering cardboard tubes with tinfoil and having mock battles, or else breathing funny and trying to strangle people by pure force of will, or maybe just whistling and tootling a lot!  I was already reading science fiction by then, but to see it come alive on the screen, so realistic, the effects so good (they still look good even now), the story so interesting, it was just a dream come true!Star Wars is an excellent film, a classic of science fiction.  The effect it had on popular culture, and especially on science fiction in the cinema and on tv, will never be surpassed.  If you haven't seen it by now, well it's not too late.  Watch, and prepare to be a kid again.	5.0	Vader, lightsabres, the force, millennium falcon, R2-D2.....	2000-10-02	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2IZ3VA24EWW9W	Michele Easterling	"I seem to be one of a very few ""Original"" Star Wars fans who not only approves but applauds the additions Lucas made to his classic films, and I was also pleased to find the DVD release to consist only of the special edition, rather than bowing to the no doubt enraged orginal fans who wanted the orignal theatrical cuts. George Lucas made a brave move, going back and ""retro fitting"" the orignal movies so they where at least closer to what he originally wanted, and I'm glad to see he didn't try to backtrack by pleasing both camps.Reviewing these films seems pointless as they have become so much a part of culture (wether you realize it or not) that you have no excuse for not seeing them. And if somehow you did miss them, now is your chance to see what you missed.The Trilogy absolutely shines on DVD (and I can finally through out my old VHS copies) and belongs on the shelf of every fan of Star Wars, Science Fiction, or Cinema."	5.0	At last, the circle is complete...	2006-03-30	10	4	6

I was annoyed by the fact that the DVDs are of the Special Edition and not the original. What's more, a new line in ESB and new shots in the end of ROTJ were added to connect the original movies to the less classic prequels.I don't think I would have minded the changes as much if Lucas had not inserted Hayden Christensen into the victory celebration, replacing the original actor for Anakin. For those, like me, who do not like the prequels, this change was very upsetting.I'm very angered by the fact that there does not seem to be a classic ""Star Wars"" anymore; just George Lucas's new, technologically advanced version.  These DVDs would have been more of a success if they had the option of watching the original or special edition. Call me crazy, but some people enjoy seeing ancient special effects and singing Ewoks. That's what made this trilogy a classic in the first place.

I haven't watched them yet, so the 5 stars is purely based on my viewing of the special edition versions on VHS. Despite getting the DVDs on the day they came out, i just can't bring myself to watch them. I know about Greedo, the new Jabba, the pink lightsaber, Anakin's ghost and other anomalies. I'm hoping that when i watch them, i won't be disapointed. I have a feeling i will. It's the same feeling i got when my PS2 broke and i converted to an xbox, transfering all my games only to realise silent hill 3 would not be released on xbox. So here i am stuck with 2 and 4 but no 3! I (...) like things to be orderly and neat. I also hate being cheated of great scenes in a film. Believe it or not, but i actually preferred the pink jabba with bulging eyes to the squinty eyed, shiney piece of s**t from episode 1. I never dreamt that the films would change so much, there was nothing wrong with the 1997 special edition films so why change things again. Why on earth fix something that isn't broken? George can do what he likes but it gets to a point where he just needs to accept what he's got and move on. Make Star Wars sequels, that's what everyone wants! Use your computer technology to make the original actors 30 years younger and continue from where ROTJ left off! Ok, that's going a bit far but it had to be said. The main qualm i have about the changed DVDs is that these are the versions that will be seen by future generations. I would want my children to see the films the way i saw them, with Han Solo frying Greedo without so much as twitching a muscle. That was a great scene and is now wrecked. Anyway, one more thing, the packaging is rubbish. Flismy or what! I'm even considering ditching the box and putting the DVDs in the holder with my others. At least then i can have all 6 films together without spending more money on box sets. I was going to sell my gold 1997 special edition collectors box when the DVDs came out, now i think i'll keep them, hidden somewhere safe.	5.0	Scared...	2004-09-23	8	2	6

(as in seeing the movies at a relatives not just the box, I own some of the other DVD and VHS releases though)Now, I personally, think that the changes aren't THAT bad. My reasons for disliking them are not because of I think they're stupid, and not because I'm a whiny Star Wars fanboy, I dislike them because I like to see Movies in general the way they were originally presented to us. But this collection was not intended for that, it was intended as a polished release of a few old classics. In that, (save Greedo shoots first which is the only change I actually despise with a passion)I think it does a FANTASTIC job. The quality is great, the sound is great, everything is great for what it is.Now I personally will not be buying them, because, as I said, I like seeing films in general the way they were originally presented, more from an artistic standpoint then a fanboy standpoint.(for in all due sincerity, I actually prefer Doctor Who) But for people that don't care about that, go for it, the set is GREAT. If you're not a complaining fanboy, you will be pleased with what you get.Also, as a side note, if you own this or other versions, but want to see a fairly HD theatrical reconstruction of the Original Trilogy, look up the Star Wars Despecialized editions, you'll probably find them on a torrent site or something. But only if you own the movies already, I do not encourage piracy, it's just that they are a very good way to watch the films in as close to their original splendor in ""HD"" as possible.(They're fan made, of course)Peace and Prosperity."	5.0	The Blu-Ray release of Star Wars tOT	2011-10-24	2	2	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A15K988ZLGP65K	Mike Dugan	"It seems that the big argument surrounding this edition of the legendary Star Wars Trilogy is whether or not George Lucas had the right to make such drastic alterations.  Some claim he should not have tampered with a successful set of films, others declare he can do whatever he pleases since they are his films.  I prefer to run the middle road.  Honestly, I do prefer the original versions of these films, but I also think Mr. Lucas had every right in the world to make the changes he did.  I certainly don't agree with all of them, in fact there are a few I find to be quite harmful.  But, to be fair, there are some changes that I really do think are quite cool.  Simply put, there are some changes I liked, and some I did not like.  That's all there is to it.  In any case, I can understand George Lucas wanting to alter these films in one way or another.  I myself have had experiences where I've done something creative and then later on wanted to change it in some way, be it a slight tweak, or a drastic alteration, so I can respect Mr. Lucas' desire to change his groundbreaking film series in certain ways, both big and small.What I can't respect, however, is his attitude regarding the changes and his refusal to make the original theatrical versions readily available on DVD as well.  Choose any major motion picture that has an alternate version in existence, a director's cut or another ""Special Edition"" or the like, and the makers of these films almost always make the original versions available on DVD for the fans at the same time.  Films like Apocalypse Now, Legend, the Alien series, or Gladiator all have both their original theatrical incarnations available for purchase on DVD, along with extended or recut versions of them if the buyer so chooses to get them.  But George Lucas, in a very puzzling move, has felt the need to deny his fans of that option, the reasons for which I cannot understand.  As somebody interested in both writing and film, I would have loved the chance to contrast and compare the two versions of each of the Star Wars films against each other, all in the fantastic clarity that DVD technology offers.  Indeed, I would have leaped at the chance.  George Lucas took that chance away from me and many others like me, and that is what really destroyed my respect for him.  What kind of filmmaker does this to his fans simply because of his own selfish desires?Mr. Lucas maintains the argument that any great artist through the centuries in just about any medium, be it painting, music or film, would want to be able to go back and change their work in some way.  That is true, of course.  As the saying goes, art is never finished, only abandoned.  But does George Lucas honestly expect us to believe that after any of these changes are made, the original versions are to be disregarded and forgotten forever, even after making such a huge impact on society for so many years?  If Beethoven was suddenly able to completely alter his Ode to Joy so that it is almost unrecognizable from the original that people would not still harbor a love for the original variation after its tremendous influence on the world?  No, art doesn't work that way.  I'm not saying the Special Editions of these movies deserve to be shunned, but after nearly three decades of redefining film and making an unbelievably huge impact on society in general, the original versions don't deserve to be forgotten either. They still have a place in almost everyone's heart, and that's what George Lucas shouldn't have the right to try to undo.That's not the worst of Mr. Lucas' attitude behind this DVD release.  What really bothers me is how he has recently been appearing publicly to use his celebrity status, and even uses the dialogue and prominent themes in his new Star Wars films, to blather on and on about how great and wonderful democracy is, how precious it is to our society, and how it must be protected at any cost, only to then back over himself and act like a complete dictator.  The moment the fans speak up saying they want to see the original versions of the original Star Wars films on DVD, suddenly George Lucas invokes a ""what I say goes,"" policy.  Suddenly, what the fans have to say no longer matters.  Suddenly, democracy conveniently no longer applies.  It's a pretty heinous thing to see this man publicly rambling about his love of democracy, then listen to him in interviews in which he boldly states that he ""doesn't care what his fans think.""  That is an absolutely vile and hypocritical stance for someone who claims to value democracy so much to have, and I am seriously taken aback by such a blatant miscarriage of his own principles.  All I'm saying is if George Lucas is going to drag his personal politics into his craft, and is going to preach and pontificate about the importance of democracy, then he should support it every step of the way, not when it merely suits him best and makes him look good in front of his fellow Hollywood big shots.  Star Wars fans should have the right to choose which versions of these great films they want to see on DVD, not have George Lucas spurn them and make the decision for them as if they aren't capable of doing so, then tell them they can just watch the old versions on VHS tapes or Laserdiscs. Being forced to choose between seeing only the heavily altered versions on DVD, or seeing the original versions on substandard, out-of-date (not to mention expensive and difficult to find) formats like VHS or Laserdisc is not what I would call a reasonable or fair decision to be faced with.  Practice democracy, Mr. Lucas.  That's the only way I and many others will respect you again.George Lucas himself has also made clear his hesitation to release the unaltered versions due to the cost.  Remastering older movies is definitely an expensive endeavor, for sure.  While I'm a little skeptical about that since he has such vast wealth, I'm not going to tell a man how to spend his money.  Hey, millions of dollars are still millions of dollars, no matter how wealthy you are, and a decision of such immense cost should never be taken lightly.  That's why I think those of us who want George Lucas to make the extraordinary effort and expense to bring these beloved movies back to us unaltered should be more civil.  Writing angry reviews and cursing and personally insulting Mr. Lucas, while simultaneously demanding he release the unaltered versions is not the way to get an artist to cooperate.If George Lucas was generous enough to fulfill my wishes, I would definitely get the Special Editions along with them.  Like I said, I would love to be able to compare the two versions against each other and weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the two.  I'd love to see the versions without the changes I disliked alongside the versions with the changes I actually enjoyed.  It would be the perfect balance.  But until I see the original versions of these fine films on DVD, and more importantly until Mr. Lucas develops a better attitude, then I'm not interested."	1.0	George Lucas should practice what he preaches	2005-12-22	23	17	6

George Lucas' refusal to remaster THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES -- aka the very films that made him untold amounts of money, brought him international renown, and enabled him to do pretty much whatever the hell he wanted to in Hollywood after their success -- is sickening. Watching the ""Special Editions"" and seeing the dim-witted CGI additions that I would swear my 4-year-old niece had done herself is painful at best.I really don't get it, because if I were in George's position it would be the original fans that made the movies a success who I'd be working the hardest to please. And it doesn't take much research to realize that THEY ALL WANT THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES ON BLURAY. Is that honestly asking too much of a man with essentially every film-related piece of technology at his fingertips?I could go on and on even more about how mind-boggling it is that all of Star Wars' biggest fans could ever be treated so poorly, but I'll stop here. As someone who grew up in the '90s watching my Mom's VHS Star Wars tapes, and then eventually getting the VHS box-set ""digitally-remastered in THX"" version, it's literally unbelievable to me that I can't get a copy of each of the original three movies in the latest and best digital video format.Give us the original theatrical releases, completely remastered to the highest possible audio and video quality, or don't waste your time on the original trilogy at all; Because THIS ISN'T THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. This is not what tens of millions of people grew up with and still consider to be one of the most breathtaking cinematic experiences ever.

The space ships, battles, Luke coming of age and Han Solo's reluctance to help the Rebellion were all fantastic. My brother and I were a pain to my father when the action figures and the ships entered the toy market (we still have the millenium falcon). This is a classic that everyone who is a fan of Star Wars should own. Almost 20 years since the orginal Star Wars was released and amazingly nothing is cheesy, outdated or dumb on this brilliant masterpiece by George Lucas.

But I guess I should of known being that the title gives you a clue ""Empire Strikes Back."" Return of the Jedi was my favorite.

These DVD's are supposed to have some more changes that Lucas has added to help further tie them in with the prequels and fans are complaining about that now too.Keep in mind that with the new films, the scope of Star Wars has changed dramatically. In order for the old films to appear as if they are part of the same continuity, they too must change. There's nothing wrong with that. It's an improvement.I can understand the opinions of some fans that having Greedo shoot first or adding Jabba to A New Hope weren't the best ideas, but the changes that DID serve to enhance the films, like improved special effects, extended sequences, new locations and backgrounds are too often overlooked. The further changes to the DVD, like putting Ian McDiarmid in the role of the Emperor for The Empire Strikes Back or adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Return of the Jedi to further tie in the old movies with the new are excellent improvements. Personally, I applaud Lucas for having the courage and taking the time and effort to re-visit these classic films and make them even better. Let's face it-these movies are old, and they show their age. To bring them up to speed with the new films, changes have to and should be made so the series looks like it is all part of a continuous whole, and not suddenly like one group of movies made now and the next three chapters looking like movies made over twenty years ago. Puppets, stop motion, and careless special effects mistakes just don't cut it anymore.I had originally heard Lucas wasn't going to make further changes to the DVD's beyond those of the Special Editions. Now that it looks he will, I am ecstatic. I can't wait to see these great films again, and for them to be even greater now with these exciting, necessary changes.	5.0	Necessary Changes	2004-07-27	34	10	24

Smith was constantly updating old news stories so that they would always reflect the current political climate. I don't mean to read some deep heavy meaning into George Lucas' reworking of these classics, but he should let people remember these movies as they were, warts and all. As for the movies themselves, what can I say that everyone doesn't already know?

Done almost eight years ago and revised for the dvd. Why are you complaining about it now for a review of the dvd? The Jabba The Hutt scene? Done eight years ago, also slightly revised for the dvd. Luke's scream down the chasm in Empire. Added eight years ago and taken OUT of the dvd version. Why? Most fans didn't like it and logic says if he made the conscious choice, the decision to step off, why would he scream? Meh, he sounded like the emperor anyway. The added shots of Darth Vader in Empire? Yep, eight years ago. The Ewoks ""Yub yub"" song? Yep, changed eight years ago. Since this is supposed to be review of the dvd, I'll say that I've never seen Star Wars looking or sounding better and the bonus disc is excellent. Back in the early eighties, trailers weren't all that they are today, but here we've got'em. Even an advanced trailer for *snicker* Revenge of the Jedi. That was of course before Lucas decided that a Jedi wouldn't take Revenge and called it Return instead. All in all this is a great set to have.

I've waited this long for star wars in blu ray, I'm happy to wait longer for either the originals in blu ray or 3d blu ray.I must admit I thought everyone was just nitpicking and being overly harsh with the changes, but see them for yourself (or better yet YouTube it and save yourself the money) and disappointment is a given. I wouldn't even classify myself as a fanboy either so god only knows what all you real die-hard fans feel about it all!  Shame on George Lucas.	1.0	Insulting blu ray box set	2011-09-14	17	13	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A300FZS4M8ZG7N	miktek	It STAR WARS on DVD. Its STAR WARS with pretty darn good sound and pic. So what are people's problems with sound, special editions and specks here and there ?????Unbelievable !!!!!!!!!If you like the movies (as most do) then get the set as its the best quality you wil see these films in and for a good price. I don't actually sit right up close to the tv to note down every bit of grain or dot that i see, nor am i a jedi nut or lives and breathes this stuff because i have no life of my own and must rely on some good movies to create a mythos that i can live by. I mean seriously, for the normal, sane, have my own life viewer who likes STAR WARS you will think that the pic and sound are pretty bl**dy excellent.These are movies that everyone has seen and have been re-glossed, re-worked and re-packaged for DVD. So if u want to own them then get the pack as they really are wonderfully presented and just forget the over-anaylitical reviews of those stating that there is a speck here, a sound drop out there and so forth because for most people this set will be good value for money and i doubt (unless your a zelous fan) your not going to notice any flaws.As far as the movies only being presented on dvd as 'Special Editions'......BIG DEAL....It is not like he has completely stripped the movies and changed it. I tend to think the re-mastering of some scenes and addtional footage of others ADDS more to both the movies and for the fans to enjoy even more of thier beloved Galaxy far, far away.....but no u got whine about it. Director's cuts have been common for years and thus this fits well with GL re-working of these movies. I mean overall he did a pretty good job and didn't take anything away. Granted it would have been nice to please everyone and release the orginal theatrical versions but he didn't so get over it.I wish Steven Speliburg would re-work JAWS, u know make the shark look abit more realistic for this day and age and a few other movies that i like could use some re-working so it really doesnt bother me. I don't think GL has ruined his classics by what he has done to them and i still enjoy them as i did when they were first released.The package loses on star though for Return of the Jedi which is a good 1/2 of a movie trapped in a really bad bear film.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GR412YA3MROS	Miles Price	I'll admit it -- I'm not a fan of the Special Editions.  They're just don't do anything for me, and I don't like the idea of adding footage for adding's sake.  That's what it really seems like George Lucas has done here.  I really wish that Lucasfilm would've released the original versions of these films along with the SE.However, something is better than nothing, and since we're not going to get the Original Versions on DVD...it's better to have something.The transfers are beautiful.  The colors pop, the sound is awesome.  I'll admit I still get a little bit of drool on the corner of my mouth watching them.I found the commentary tracks to be entertaining for the most part, although the director of ESB is a little obnoxious.  I could have not listened to him more.Finally, the extra stuff on the 4th disc is full of interesting material.  It's worth getting the set for that disc.I'm sorry for whining just a bit about the Original versions...I'll try to relax and not let it get to me too much.	4.0	Original Film Lover...	2004-12-18	6	4	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1LJP4A3RWHG54	Millennian	George Lucas is a god! The god of film-making! This classic science fiction trilogy is a timeless masterpiece that may bring girls into sci-fi. I haven't seen it nearly enough times! I have kept count and it's 1,000  times. To me that is not enough. The experience is overwhelming, the  lightsabre battles, the space wars, the loveable characters, the wickedness  of the dark side. To me it has numerous genres! Action / Adventure / Comedy  / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Romance / Science fiction Sir Lucas is my  idol! It was an honour to simply view Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom  Menace, which was also a classic. I would love to own all of them in  different sets, only then my life would be complete.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1G3X6E2RG9TJV	"""misplaced1"""	"I am a 29 year old lifelong Star Wars fan.  I consider the original films to be as much a part of my personality as the lessons I learned in school or the values I learned from my parents. I cannot conceive of myself or my consciousness apart from the influence of the FIRST trilogy.  I've seen them all coutless times, quote lines appropriate to any situation, and I still will drop everything else to watch them when they show up on TV.  So needless to say, I was completely thrilled to see them in the theatres back in the 90s.  I even tolerated the SE changes, just so long as I could still obtain copies of the originals.  How sad I am to hear that the DVD editions, my chance to own these films in a permanent format that I can share with my children and grandchildren, will only be available in the SE versions.  How wrong, corrupt, and thoroughly inhuman. Now...here's why.  It has been said that the SE versions represent the fulfillment of ""the artist's definitive vision"" and that Lucas, as the artist, has every right to complete the vision he wanted to but didn't have the budget or technology to do so 1977-83. Thus case closed, apparently.  Well, not so.  I for one take a different view of art.  I think that when great art is released into the public arena, and goes on to prove itself so influential that it becomes a sort of cultural signpost, its form in fact transcends the ""artist's vision"" and becomes a kind of common property, part of our collective consciousness, and part of us all.  To then permanently change it decades later is to do a kind of violence to us all. So, for instance, take ""remastering"", a common technological alteration to lots of classic records.  This can be a good thing. The Beatles records (an appropriate cultural analogy, I think) have all been remastered for CD. They sound better, enhance the nuances of the music, and take little, if anything away.  Remastering does not substantially change the art, which I why I can accept some doctored up special effects, and maybe some ""restored footage"" here or there in the Star Wars films.  But THIS, this travesty, this attempt to permanently eliminate the original versions in favor of the sanitized, kid-friendly, ""definitive"" versions....well, that would be like Paul re-releasing all the Beatles albums in 2004, with new vocals and overdubs added, dropping some of the offensive songs, calling them the ""definitive"" versions, and making the originals unavailable.  Would he have that right?  Or does that art belong to all of us? I would call that just what I call THIS: a crime, corrupt and inhuman.  Thanks but no thanks, George."	1.0	Boycott with a tear	2004-04-05	9	7	2

He does have the right to change some of the special effects for DVD if he wants to.  The guts of the movie are still the original and the very few changes are hardly noticeable.  He was only trying to incorporate the older versions slightly with the newer 1-3 series and special effects.  Honestly, if you enjoy star wars and aren't a big snob about minor insignificant details, then you'll love this set just as much as the videos with the convenience of the DVD. We enjoyed sharing it with our kids who all have watched the video version and the DVD versions with no issues.  It's just entertainment.  There are a lot more things to enjoy in life.

My parents brought me to see star wars in the theater when I was 3 years old. It was the first thing I remembered in my life.I must admit I was apprehensive when I heard the even more things had been changed in this release and that the original theatrical release (or even the 1995 thx remaster) was not included. However, the changes added here were not as bad as I feared. The extra dialogue in the emperor hologram scene will take some getting used to. All in all, these changes did enhance the movie rather than feel like the intrusions of SOME of the 1997 SE additions. I say SOME, because not everything added in the SE versions was bad.Bad SE stuff:-Greedo shooting first. The scene looks horrible. Anyone can tell that it was spliced. Had they been able to make it more fluid and natural looking I would not complain. It looks like the videocamera ""magic"" tricks that I did on my own vhs camera as a kid where I would stand in front of the camera wave my hands, pause the camera and then put my little sister next to me, unpause and say she magically appeared.-The extra Vader dialoque in ESB just sounded not like his voice anymore.-The awful musical scene in Jabba's palace in ROTJ.Most people tend not to mention the many good ""additions"" made in the SE films:-Cloud City looks much better with the subtraction of some walls and digital buildings added in. Much more lively.-All of the matte fixes (see through cockpits in ESB hoth battle).-The Biggs scene finally explained what Luke said in ANH. All my life I was trying to figure out what he said after he put down his toy ship and said ""Biggs is right I'm never gonna get off this rock"". It never made sense before.All in all this is a good release. Everyone else badmouthing the color changing and sounds being wrong... check your tvs and dvd players you have a technical problem, NOT this dvd release. Others complaining of boxes around the TIEs in space... yes these were there in the original VHS release of the theatrical versions. They are due to the matte filming process. Lucas must not have been able to fix these like some of the other matte corrections, otherwise he would have.I give 4 stars because I still believe that the originals could have been included as a bonus even if they were not ""fixed up"". Lucas talks about the millions that would have cost... come on buddy, you've made billions off people like me already. It won't hurt to dig into that pocket... They could have transferred the 1995 thx release to DVD and I would've been happy to at least have a copy of the originals that would not degrade like the 5 copies of the trilogy that I wore out as a kid. I have kept my thx remaster with only 2 or 3 viewings and I plan to burn it to dvd myself since Lucas has shunned us."	4.0	Wish the original was included as a bonus	2004-09-26	4	3	1

Personally, I was not born when these movies came out, so the raw, grainy version has no special place in my heart.  I have seen the old version, and it's cool.  But the remastered version, in my opinion, reflects what Lucas would have done had the technology been available.  If you want proof, look at episodes 1, 2, and 3.

Wow and I thought Luke would get the princess! Then Jedi came out and it was cool but sort of felt a little ""Muppety"" and cute. But I still liked it. Many years passed then the Episode I trailer came out and I watched it over and over again - frame by frame - I eagerly waited for the weekly mystery photo to come out on Star [...] and examined it from top to bottom. It was mind-blowingly exciting up until after the EP1 Lucasfilm logo played on opening day and everyone cheered.What happened after that was the biggest disappointment of my life - Star Wars got lame. Really lame. Annie? Annies mom? Jar-Jar? Barfff! King George was drunk with power and none of his associates obviously had the the guts to give him any constructive feedback and Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were stupid cornballs. Bottom line, Star Wars was much better a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away. I long to have that feeling back - the original version - not the stupid CG makeover one.

On top of my TV I have a Jango Fett posable figure and a Gollum Figurine, next to a Homer Simpson. In one of my bookshelfs I have a bunch of different types of Storm Troopers (from the old era and from the new).I've always thought that what was really cool about the Star Wars Trilogy were the secondary characters. I never really cared much about the stupid Jedis or Han or Leia or Luke and his father. When I was a kid I chose a storm trooper and created a whole story around it. My favorite characters are General Veers, Admiral Ackbar, the General guy from Empire Strikes Back and the chick that says: ""Stand by, Ion Control... Fire!"" and the Speeder Bike storm trooper that yells ""Hey"" to the Rebel Soldier. The rebel guys who get excited when someone tells them ""the first transport is away, the first transport is away"".The ability of the Star Wars Universe to make you use your own imagination to further the depth of those characters is what I love about Star Wars. And I think that is a big deal about what is great about The Lord of the Rings too.The Special Editions came out, went to see each one about 4 times. Sure, I hated the same changes most of the whiners around here have already mentioned, but that didn't make me mad or try to boycott anything. Admiral Piett was still there, and also the guy from Third Rock from the Sun in Return of The Jedi.Special Edition on DVD?

As any artist has a right to change their work, so does he.  These changes are not just for the sake of changes, but to get the movies to what his original vision was.  And that was just not possible with the technology at the time they were filmed.  Personally, I like almost all the changes, but am glad Luke's scream is gone and the Han/Greedo scene is cleaned up better.  I like having Jabba in Star Wars, I like the updated Wampa in Empire, the updated Cloud City, etc etc.  Plus add to the fact of the picture being cleaned up, sound jacked up, and good ol' Disc 4, I'm as giddy as a schoolboy.Will I buy this set?

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A57IC7R3H37LI	"M. N. McBain ""Myric McBain"""	"I'm going to be honest with you all: this is NOT the original Star Wars.  I don't know what George Lucas has been thinking lately - especially with the latest 2 movies: ""Attack of the Clowns"" & ""The Phantom Plot"" - but to tell you the truth even altered these movies are pretty good.  The plots are solid and they are still entertaining, even if they are not the classics.  I don't think the changes were inappropriate enough to warrant lowering their ratings that much (personally I loathed the Ewok ending song in the Original Return of the Jedi and am glad to see it gone).  I do remember the excitement when the movies first came out in theatres in the 70's and 80's, but those days are gone, and these are not those movies anymore.  I still recommend these for anyone who isn't terribly offended by the changes (which I agree were not necessary), but they are Lucas's movies, and he can do what he wants with them.  I'll keep this DVD release, but I'm also holding onto my VHS copies of the originals.  Oh yah, don't even waste your time with the latest two movies."	4.0	Well... ya know... eh, I dunno.....	2004-12-01	19	6	13

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A4DOH45X8SBBQ	"Moff Tarkin ""Tarkin"""	Man are all the reviewers that need to trash George Lucas for trying to improve his classic film so wrong. How can one of the greatest film series ever made be completey ruined because a character somehow manges to get a shot off before he was killed by the hero. HOW DOES THAT RUIN A MOVIE? You can think the scene is not what you remember but it will not ruin the movie. Hate the Jsbba scene well How about you hit your next chapter key and skip the scene entirely its not like the scene was there to begin with. How can you call yourself a fan if you are not really ready to accept the changes the creator makes. And as far as Hayden at the end of Jedi. Nobody has seen Episode 3 yet. Maybe it would not make sense to have Sebastian Shaw there once the Jedi ressurection technique is revealed. No wonder George Lucas does not want to make episode 7-9. He is probaly afraid his fans will get even angrier. If more people showed support instead of anger maybe that would encourage George to reunite the original cast for one last great hurrah. You all talk about George going to the Dark Side with greed what about your own anger have you learned nothing watching these movies. So if you do not want to enjoy the best looking, sounding and improved FX (Everyone like to criticise Jabba in ANH but no one praises the much better looking attack on the Death Star. Come on anyone care to complain about that?)becuse you do not have the coping skills for the few minutes of changes made then you have a problem. Me I can not wait and when I am watching the trench run from ANH or Vader's revelation from ESB or the attack of the Death Star from ROJ. I will not be thinking of anyone who trashes George and his grand trilogy. I will be enjoying some great films. They can enjoy it the way the have for the past 20 years on a VCR.	5.0	Ungrateful Fans	2004-09-15	26	8	18
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A261KKPGQ39MRS	Mofizz	"Just adding my two cents to the ranting and raving pro and con the DVD release of the Special Editions of the trilogy. A few points:A) George can certainly do whatever he wishes with these films, doesn't mean the fans who made him rich have to like it or buy it. I liked the original films and won't be buying these... I guess I will never get to see the films I loved as a kid again.B) George is a hack film maker and a hypocrite. In an interview from the early 80s, George makes comments about how ""some directors get so wrapped up in creating SFX and worlds that they spend film time on it"" and how that's a bad thing. Now who's guilty of that these days? (The doc is ""From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Trilogy"")C) Greedo shooting first, Han stepping on Jabba's tail, Luke screaming as he falls at Cloud City... those are my major complaints about the ""improvements."" Each of these scenes or changes alter the meaning of the shot/sequence and thereby change the film. Let's face it on Jabba's dancers though, that musical sequence ALWAYS sucked.Don't buy these DVDs... eventually, if Lucasfilm has ANY business sense, they'll release the first three films unadulterated."	2.0	My 2 cents	2004-05-24	24	17	7

I have seen each movie during its original release, but there's something great about going from one movie right into the next.When the three Special Editions came on VHS, I had to get them. And now, I'm buying the Wideescreen DVD (got to, I have an HDTV!) I look forward to my next rainy day, and all three movies in one day!As to the changes from the original release to the Special Edition to the DVD version - it's a mixed bag. The additional creatures in Mos Isley and the backgrounds in the Cloud City add a depth not available in the original. Changes to Greedo and Jabba don't do much for me. I guess if I want to dispute it with George Lucas, I'd better get some studio to make my movie!	5.0	They're still great movies...	2004-09-21	4	1	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	I have read a review of the new trilogy DVD set online and here are some of the major changes from the 1997 Special Edition versions. 1)Han and Greedo shoot at the same time and the effect of Han dodging Greedo's laser blast has been vastly improved. 2)Vader's lightsaber is now red throughout the Obi-Wan duel, not the white color it has appeared in the original and the SE versions before. 3)Luke no longer screams while falling down into Cloud City after the Vader duel. 4)Jabba the Hutt had been redone with newer CGI in A New Hope and from the screenshots I've seen, he looks much better (still not great though). 5)The final major change is that they put Hayden C. (teen Anankin from Attack of the Clones) into The Return of the Jedi's shot that has the ghostly forms of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching the celebration on Endor. Look, I'm a fan of the original versions too, but most the new DVD changes (besides #5) really improve on the 1997 Special Editions. At least George Lucas has taken the middle ground by listening to fans and still putting forth the versions that he wants to. After all, these are his films and I'm just glad that on Sept. 21st I will own these classics on DVD. It's about time!	5.0	It's Not Going to Be That Bad People!	2004-09-09	7	2	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2T5FFATKEQQEV	monkeytot	Ok.  If you dont get it its a debate amoung us star wars fans who shot first Han SOlo or Greedo?  SOem say Han because he was better, but some say Greedo because then it would make Han look like a cold blooded killer.  It's oneof those things that no one can resolve like the guys dream at the end of 2001 Space Oddessey (a great film to see if you want to be a director)!  But what does it mean?aLSO.  I saw these films when they came out IN the Theatre int he 90s PEOPLE and they are great!  Everything youve heard is true!!  As a kid, when I saw them, I like most boys would fantasize that i was held captive by the evil Darth Vader and I waited for LUke to rescue me and save me with his LIGHT SABER!!!!Also to the fan review by Donovan...Great news about the Re-imagining (its what they call a remake to you...) of SGt.  Peppers.  What cool news for us Silver Beetles fans (as they were first called), but, um, this is a sight for Star Wars reviews, not music!!!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A32NXC1LGTHSR2	Monkey Who	"George Lucas has insulted the fans and the kid I was during the early 80s growing up with Star Wars: Special Edition ONLY DVDs.  If he wants to go and,IMHO, subjectively mess up his original story with bad CGI (not all CGI is bad, but Jar-jar Binks and the fake Jabba were just awful)that is own business. But I do not understand why he can not simply include the ORIGINAL theaterical releases on the DVD.  That is all I ask. Hell, even if I hate Ep. III I would buy the entire 2007 edition of all six movies when it comes out just to get my hands on the original releases in DVD form, but I won't buy a single George Lucas film at all until he releases Star Wars in the Original form.  George Lucas is darned lucky he released the Indiana Jones set first before announcing that the Star Wars Trilogy is not the ""classic"" trilogy it once was.  I was born in 1977.  Just my subjective thoughts to the new younger fans of Star Wars.  If the special effects, including CGI, are awesome, but the plot of the film is awful then the film is still bad.  Plot should ALWAYS come first and then be supported by CGI.  Great CGI does not make a great film.  A good story does.  I feel bad writing this review, but I can not believe how indifferent George Lucas is!"	1.0	"Not the ""classic"" Star Wars I grew up with!"	2004-09-18	13	11	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1G6YF6HVEL1ZI	monsterofthemist	there seem to be fanboys who cry over the fact greedo shot first, and I ask you who cares? Star Wars was awesome, is awesome and will always be awesome. I don't give a flying flip who shot first since they shoot at the same basic time now, nor do i care about the change.  i loved the additional footage of Harrison Ford interacting with a well rendered Jabba the Hutt. What kind of Star wars fan doesn't want more Han Solo? any way you get to see the progression of the characters in star wars and that is what i love about both trilogies is their progression of the characters. Luke Skywalker goes from Tatooine farm boy who transforms into a Jedi Knight and hero of the rebel alliance. Han Solo transforms from a space pirate/smuggler into a general of the Rebel alliance. what is memorable in star wars are the jedi battles between Luke and Darth Vader. the light saber duel on the death star my favorite. what Star Wars always delivers in spades are the actual star wars. the space battles are always building and building through each movie until it reaches a crescendo in a really spectacular final space battle in Jedi.all movies i would rate 10 out of 10 but my Personal favorite is Return of the Jedi. I recently watched the Entire Star Wars saga From Episode 1 to Episode 6 and i must say it is one of the most incredible science fiction stories ever put to film. I would recommend this Box set because each film comes with audio commentary and the bonus disc which has cool featurettes and a documentary that chronicles the phenomenon of star wars and the rise of George Lucas.	5.0	Star Wars will always be awesome!	2011-08-15	23	3	20
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"The Films:Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope...A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a daydreaming farm boy named Luke Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine discovers a secret message in the memory banks of a small astromech droid called R2-D2. The tenacious little robot leads the young farmer and his golden protocol droid, C-3PO, to the home of a mysterious hermit who holds the secrets of Luke's past...and future. The hermit's name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he is a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself, a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!Star Wars, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back...It is a dark time for the rebellion. Luke Skywalker and his friends have set up a new base on the ice planet of Hoth, but it is not long before their secret location is discovered by the evil Empire. After narrowly surviving an attack by a Wampa snow-beast, Luke and the rebels must flee the invading Imperial Forces, but not without putting up a fight first. What follows is a fantastic battle between snowspeeders and huge, 4-legged walking machines called AT-ATs, a necessary defensive in order to allow the large rebel transports to get away. In the mayhem of escape, however, the tight-knit group of friends, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, R2-D2, and of course Luke Skywalker, must divide. While struggling to survive in the harsh snow of Hoth, Luke had earlier received a visitation from the spirit of his old teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructing him to go to the Dagobah system and seek out a Jedi Master called Yoda to continue his training. With R2 as his co-pilot, Luke departs Hoth in his X-Wing Fighter for the mysterious destination, while Leia is forced to escape with Han, Chewie, and 3PO in the Millennium Falcon, a ride she is less than pleased to take.As Luke makes his way to the strange, swampy planet of Dagobah, Princess Leia fends off the romantic advances of intergalactic rogue Han Solo aboard the Falcon, Darth Vader in hot pursuit of their ship.  The Falcon's hyper-drive damaged, Han leads the Imperials into an asteroid field hoping the dangerous maneuver will cause them to give up chase, but when the asteroid cave they take up residence in displays a mind and appetite of its own, they are forced to come up with a new plan. Attaching their ship to the hull of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, they manage to disappear from detection by the Imperial crew long enough to float away with the massive Destroyer's garbage discharge, but legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett is wise to their plan and informs the Empire of the Falcon's next destination, Cloud City. Meanwhile, Sith Lord Darth Vader holds conference with his dark master, the evil Emperor Palpatine, via holographic technology. Together, the two plot to recruit the son of Anakin Skywalker into their perverse household, or kill him if he refuses.On the eerie swamp planet of Dagobah, Luke Skywalker seeks out his new teacher in the ways of the Force, the elusive Master Yoda. What he finds is a small, green, inquisitive creature that offers to show him the way. Reluctantly, Luke follows the aged little alien, only to be baffled by the discovery that this creature is the Jedi Master himself. After some convincing by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda agrees to take on the padawan learner. Under his instruction, Luke begins to learn the intricacies of the Force, the differences between the dark and the light, and the mastery of his new, Force-given powers. Most importantly, Luke learns the dangers of being seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and the ease with which such a transformation can take place.As the Millennium Falcon reaches Cloud City, a beautiful, floating, gas-mining colony run by Han Solo's old friend, Lando Calrissian, they are greeted by some none-too-friendly security skiffs. This is no comfort to the already concerned little band of rebels, who are not exactly at ease about what sort of ""friend"" Lando Calrissian may turn out to be. Soon enough, old friends bid seemingly warm welcomes, and introductions are exchanged as well. Lando proves to be a charming diplomat of a scoundrel; as friendly as can be, but more concerned about numero uno than even Han Solo used to be, as the Falcon's crew will soon find out. For it is not long before they are also greeted by their old nemesis, Darth Vader. Han Solo is soon suffering under the Empire's vicious means of torture, all in an effort to lure Luke Skywalker into Vader's clutches by way of telepathically sensing his friend's anguish. And, it's not just Han's suffering Luke senses, but that of Leia as well, who is coming to terms with her true feelings for the Falcon's brave captain; and the suffering of  the wookie co-pilot Chewbacca, who has devoted his life to protecting his friend and partner, Han Solo. Luke is soon determined to join his friends on Cloud City, despite his training being incomplete. His teachers, Yoda and Obi-Wan, advise against the action, another unwise choice the padawan will have to live with and learn from after more than one failure during his training on Dagobah; and that's IF he survives this new mistake. By making his way to Cloud City in an attempt to help his friends, Luke is forcing an all too early confrontation with the Dark Lord of the Sith himself, Darth Vader!Star Wars, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi...While the evil Galactic Empire hastens construction on its new, second Death Star, Luke Skywalker's loyal droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, carryout their role in a rescue mission to retrieve their friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. As the two droids procure servants' positions in the slug-like Jabba's desert palace on Tatooine, Princess Leia Organa arrives in the guise of a bounty hunter named Bousch, Chewbacca the Wookie in tow as her supposed bounty.  Newest rebel recruit Lando Calrissian already in place and disguised as a palace guard, the stage is set for the final arrival, would-be Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, bringing with him the consequences of Jabba's refusal to be paid for Han Solo's freedom. However, before that happens, the plan is for Leia to free Han herself that night. The attempt is unsuccessful. While the princess does manage to free Han from his carbonite prison, Jabba and his cronies catch Leia in the act, and she soon finds herself clad in metal slave-girl garb and kept on the end of a leash at Jabba's side. Han, on the other hand, is locked away in the same dungeon cell his partner Chewbacca is being held in. The two share a bittersweet reunion. As day breaks again, Luke Skywalker arrives to take matters into his own hands, but his threats upon Jabba land him in the mobster's rancor pit, and he is forced to exterminate the great beast. This angers the Hutt intensely, and Luke and his crew are immediately sentenced to death by Sarlacc. The prisoners are loaded onto a skiff, and Jabba and his followers board a sail barge to the pit of the Sarlacc, sunken within the hot desert sands of Tatooine. As Luke Skywalker is prodded onto a plank over the deadly pit, an immense creature made of beak and tentacles eagerly waiting below, he offers Jabba one final chance to free the small group of rebels or pay the price of death. This amuses Jabba, but the death sentence stands. A signal to his loyal astromech droid, R2-D2, sends a lightsaber through the air and into the waiting hands of Luke Skywalker, who immediately takes action. As Leia strangles her massive Hutt captor with her slave chain, Luke and Lando battle the skiff guards and take back possession of their droids and friends Han and Chewie.Soon, the group of friends is back with the rebel alliance planning out their next course of action. All except for Luke, who has traveled back to the swamp planet of Dagobah with R2 in an attempt to finish the Jedi training he began there. It's a difficult reunion for the Jedi padawan. His master, Yoda, is on his deathbed, only waiting for this last chance to speak to Luke before giving himself up to the Force. For Luke, it's a time for closure on a subject that has eaten away at him since his battle with Darth Vader on Cloud City. Yoda confirms his darkest fears. Darth Vader IS Luke Skywalker's father, the once good and caring Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, seduced and corrupted by the wicked Emperor Palpatine decades ago. Yoda also informs Luke that only a final and successful confrontation with his father will make him a true Jedi Knight and stop the Emperor's reign of evil. Yoda passes away, his last breath revealing the secret of one other existing Skywalker child. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi arrives to console Luke as he emerges from Yoda's tiny home. It is Obi-Wan, Luke's first Jedi teacher, who helps reveal to Luke the secret identity of his unknown sibling and guides him to the right course of action.Luke and R2-D2 return to their friends and the Rebel Alliance in time to join General Han Solo's team on a mission to take out a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. The shield it provides protects the Emperor's new Death Star, hanging high in the skies above.  As Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and the droids lead a small group of rebel soldiers on their special mission, General Lando Calrissian takes charge of a space battle to replicate the events of the battle of Yavin years earlier. When Solo's team takes down the Death Star's shield, Calrissian will lead the rebel fleet of fighters to the weakest spot of the Death Star to blow it up! With no small amount of uneasiness, Han volunteers his beloved Millennium Falcon for his good friend Lando to pilot on the maneuver, despite having a bad feeling that he'll never see ""her"" again. The groups go their separate ways, Han and the gang sneaking past Imperial security in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Things go wrong from the get-go though, when the discovery of their team by Imperial biker scouts forces Luke and Leia into an exhilarating speeder-bike chase through the Endor forest. Luke makes his way back to the group, but Leia is lost. Luckily, she befriends a small, bear-like creature called Wicket W. Warrick, a young Ewok from the same tribe that soon captures Han, Luke, Chewie, and the Droids. Together again, Luke uses a bit of Force ""magic"" to convince the Ewoks to join the rebel forces in a thrilling woodland battle against the Empire's ground crew in a desperate effort to get the Death Star's shield down in time for Lando's assault on the deadly weapon. Luke has other issues on his mind also, however, and after revealing the truth to his long lost sibling, surrenders himself to Vader and the Emperor in the hopes of  finding the good that he still senses from deep beneath his father's twisted black shell. The future of the entire galaxy relies on the success of the Rebel Alliance in their separate goals, and it all culminates in the final act of ""Return of the Jedi.""The Legacy:In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them ""Star Wars,"" a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, ""Star Wars"" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what ""Star Wars"" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart!In 1980, the prayers of millions of ""Star Wars"" fans were answered with the release of a second Star Wars film, ""Star Wars, Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back."" Continuing the spectacular story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, along with their wookie and robot friends, this was a much darker chapter in the epic Star Wars saga. It was a chapter of dark secrets, heart-wrenching devices, and a cliff-hanger ending that left many movie-goers with a feeling of, ""What the *#@%??!"" Nevertheless, it was a masterful piece of filmmaking that would go on to be called the best of the Star Wars saga by a multitude of Star Wars fans. Returning with the brilliant music of John Williams and the same outstanding cast as the first film, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, David Prowse, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and the voice of James Earl Jones, and introducing Billy Dee Williams in the role of Lando Calrissian and a new instant fan favorite bounty hunter character known as Boba Fett, plus the masterful puppeteering talents of Muppet legend Frank Oz, ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas felt safe to turn over the reigns to seasoned director Irvin Kershner this time around. Taking on the job with intense respect and vigilance, Kershner's determination to create a worthy second act to the Star Wars saga resulted in cinematic excellence! A rousing adventure fantasy from beginning to cliff-hanger ending, loaded with action, effects, suspense, drama, magnificent performances, and one of the most famous and believable screen romances in movie history, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" took the Star Wars story to a whole new level, making it so much more than we ever thought it was before!Then came 1983, and fans were flocking to theaters to see the 3rd and final film in the legendary Star Wars saga, ""Star Wars, Episode 6: Return of the Jedi."" Completing the spectacular story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, and the malevolent Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, ""Return of the Jedi"" proved to be a very revealing final chapter in the Star Wars mythology. Old secrets were confirmed, new secrets revealed, bonds were strengthened, new ones were formed, the world said goodbye to some beloved characters both good and evil, and a band of tree-dwelling teddy bears proved that all the technology in the universe isn't enough to defeat the  ""human"" spirit! Of course, the main theme of ""Return of the Jedi"" is the main theme of Star Wars itself, redemption, but to delve too much into that just now would probably ruin the film for those who have not yet seen it. Returning yet again with the brilliance of John Williams and the same wonderful cast, George Lucas chose director Richard Marquand to helm the film this time around. The result was another cinematic masterpiece, though many fans may disagree due to a popular disdain for the lovable Ewok creatures. It's a distaste I still don't understand, but many folks simply don't like anything cute. I offer up this question though: In a galaxy as vast as that of ""Star Wars,"" wouldn't SOME of the creatures be cute? It's inevitable. The Ewoks serve a crucial purpose, regardless of the feelings of many fans. They embody one of George Lucas's major themes in Star Wars: The little guy can't be kept down! Anyway, I must not be the only Ewok lover. The characters enjoyed a popular cartoon series in the 80s (more popular than the ""Droids"" cartoon featuring R2 and 3PO), and had two quite enjoyable made for TV movies! ""Return of the Jedi"" is high on fun, being thoroughly action-packed and full of more bizarre creatures than any Star Wars film before it! It also introduces us to a character only seen before in holographic form (until the prequels came along, that is), the dark Emperor himself, played to fiendish perfection by Ian McDiarmid! And, yes, it's in ""Return of the Jedi"" that we see what's under Darth Vader's mask for the first time! This final chapter in the Star Wars trilogy is not to be missed by fans of the first two films! A rousing, enlightening, and astonishing experience from beginning to end!In 1997, ""The Star Wars Trilogy"" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the ""Star Wars Saga"" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, ""Return of the Jedi.""With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or ""classic"" Star Wars Trilogy came even more ""improvements"" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable adjustment to the first film, ""Episode 4: A New Hope,"" in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In the second Star Wars film, ""Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back,"" in addition to the previous changes, which enhanced the Wampa attack scene and opened up Cloud City to far more glorious views, the film now features changes to bring it more in line with the Star Wars prequels. Boba Fett's original voice has been replaced with the voice of Temuera Morrison, who played Jango Fett and the clones in the Star Wars prequels. Also, the scene where Darth Vader converses with the holo-projection of the Emperor has been redone with new dialogue and the replacement of Ian McDiarmid in the role of the evil Palpatine. In my personal opinion, the alterations that have been made to ""Empire"" over the years are more than welcome, especially to Cloud City, and while I feel for the actor who was replaced, bringing back Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor really ties the entire film series together quite nicely, as he played the Emperor in ""Return of the Jedi"" as well as in the prequels. In truth, it's a change I've always longed for! My only minor quibble is that replacing Boba Fett's voice seemed totally unnecessary, and I rather prefer his original sound. There's no reason to think that he wouldn't have lost his accent over the years after losing his father in Episode 2 at such a young age, and the original voice was far more menacing. As for the third film, ""Episode 6: Return of the Jedi,"" In addition to the '97 changes, which included an added musical number within Jabba's palace, improvements to the Sarlacc creature, and new cityscape celebrations and music in the film's finale,  ""Return of the Jedi"" now features changes to meld it better with the prequels also. Along with improving the overall look of the Rancor scene, the spirit of an aged Anakin Skywalker in the end of the film has been (quite shockingly) replaced with that of a much younger Anakin, circa Episode 3, played by actor Hayden Christensen. My honest response to the various changes to ""Return of the Jedi"" over the years: I'm not a huge fan of the added musical sequence. It seemed rather unnecessary and more cartoony than anything else in Star Wars. The only thing that bothers me more is the two-headed Podrace announcer in Episode 1. That bothered me MUCH more. Taking that into account, I am not extremely bothered by the musical number in Jedi, but it was better without it. I am rather pleased with the much needed adjustments to the Rancor scene, which was really just a matter of making the elements blend together much better than they did before. The Sarlacc changes are welcome by me too. It's definitely a more intimidating creature than it used to be when it was just a big hole in the ground with a few tentacles. As for the changes that relate more to tying the prequels to the original trilogy, the new elements, young Anakin's ghost and the cities of the galaxy in celebration, are excellent additions when one watches all six Star Wars films together. However, the original elements hold a place in all our hearts and this is why offering up the original films as a DVD option would have been so greatly appreciated. Still, over all, aside from only a few complaints here and there (particularly the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak, AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no serious problems with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all).Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. ""A New Hope"" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. ""Empire"" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and director Irvin Kershner. ""Jedi"" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable and can clue a viewer in on key elements, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, all the really great extras are on the 4th disc in the DVD boxed set! Here, the highlight is the outstanding 150 minute documentary ""Empire of Dreams,"" an in-depth look at the making of all three classic Star Wars films. And, when I say in-depth, I MEAN in-depth! Fantastic program! The bonus disc also includes three enjoyable featurettes on the characters of Star Wars, the legacy of Star Wars, and the birth of the lightsaber. Other extras include still galleries, an Xbox game demo, a preview of ""Star Wars, Episode 3,"" and my favorite bonus features besides the documentary, the Trailers and TV spots. I absolutely LOVE the teaser trailers to the films, especially ""A New Hope"" and ""Empire."" There's a powerful 1970s/80s sci-fi fantasy eeriness about them! I mean, they're creepy! Overall, not a bad bonus line-up, but don't let your hopes get too high. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking deleted and alternate scenes, the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with (you know, ""It's Lando Calrissian in disguise!""), AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. Regardless, the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" boxed set is a must own! Still three of the finest films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still as thrilling as ever! ""Empire"" is still as eerily transcendental as ever, and, oh, do Leia's glossy lips look glorious in ""A New Hope's"" digitally restored and enhanced glory! You can keep your gold bondage Jedi bikini! Gimme young, glossy-lipped, cinnamon bun-headed princess perfection! Oh, and Ewoks still rule! If you like 'em in ""Jedi,"" pick up the Ewok Adventures double feature DVD! Now, let's hope those aforementioned ""Ewoks"" and ""Droids"" animated TV shows get some DVD season sets released soon too!"	5.0	The Greatest Film Saga Ever!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3SQ6UZ43EP1IW	Morgan F.	This review is of the Blu-ray trilogy with the blue-tinted cover and the large profile picture of Darth Vader.  The package contains three Blu-ray discs in a single case.  The movies themselves are not the theatrical editions; they are the later releases that include the embarrassingly juvenile edits and new scenes added by Lucas.  Thankfully, the masterpiece of the trilogy, Empire Strikes Back, is uncluttered with these changes and remains fairly true to the theatrical edition.  In spite of these minor flaws, the movies are still wonderful, with excellent picture and sound quality.  I used these to introduce my four year old son to the series while sparing him the misery of watching the three worst movies of all time, Episodes I, II, and III.  He loves watching them, particularly The Return of the Jedi.  They are still terrific films after all these years.	4.0	Delightful films, in spite of the questionable additions	2013-01-03	1	0	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1CWZX50BY3RHC	"""morpheus129"""	What else is there to say about the Star Wars Trilogy? It defined what sci-fi movies were, if that. I've been a fan of Star Wars ever since I was 4 or 5 years old, when I saw Return of the Jedi on TV. And even though The Phantom Menace may have somewhat been a fluke, you still have to admit that it's a good movie as well. But The Phantom Menace doesn't compare at all to the original trilogy. My favorite movie out of the trilogy, by far, is The Empire Strikes Back. The darker tone to it makes it much better than A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. Also, I think it's got the best acting, as well as best character developments.When the trilogy was rereleased back in 1997, my mom bought the pan and scan version when I wanted the widescreen version, but I was fine with pan and scan. After about a year, I wanted the widescreen version desperately, but it went out of print. Therefore, I was left with my crummy pan and scan. But now, thanks to the almighty God George Lucas, I can watch the original trilogy the way it was in theaters, not to mention the Episode II preview at the beginning, which I can't to watch.Even if you have 3 different copies of the trilogy, go ahead and buy this version, especially with the Ep. II intro. Thank you ever so much for making these brilliant movies, Mr. Lucas, keep it up!	5.0	Best Movie Trilogy of All-Time	2000-11-25	1	0	1

The special new effects look great(period), and the new scenes are very enjoyable. There's one thing though. Where are the DVD's? I know they're coming out soon now, but why did Lucas publish another VHS special edition box-set? Wasn't the first one enough? I guess, for die hard Star Wars fans this new box-set must be great, but there are many star wars fans out there who eagerly awaits the DVD's.The reson I give this box-set 5 stars, is because the Star Wars movies are classics! DVD or no DVD, these movies are still great, even if they're on VHS.

Another Amazon FAIL: this Bluray's title is says ORIGINAL when it is the adulterated CGI strewn crap that Lucas thought we needed to fully appreciate his vision.What Crap, Lucas.Its distracting from the story, it fills the movie with a detestable disney feel from an otherwise great sci-fi film.The effects back in 77, 80 and 83 were astounding. Imagine if CGI was added to Blade Runner just because they could, that would not make it better.Mono Lisa needs some digital airbrushing...The films are a treat to watch besides the above comments.The color is really great, the sound is fixed and finally feels audiophile and not grainy distortions of the theatrical release.	4.0	THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RELEASE	2013-05-11	1	0	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2PHCZ5CLF14ED	Movie Fan	Well, the original Star Wars movies that so many people experienced as they first appeared in cinemas are apparently no longer of value or relevant to anyone anymore and are not included in this set.The fact that a quality print of the original Star Wars is still not available today is unbelievable and a real loss to fans of the original trilogy, and indeed to all those with a genuine interest in the preservation of important works and maintaining their integrity within film history.I am sure this release will adequately meet expectations for those that enjoy the revised canon, and I genuinely hope it is all that you wish for, but also feel that many people are greatly missing out by not experiencing the original theatrical versions, which actually had a more natural looking colour pallet, better contrast with no detail loss in shadows, and pioneering special effects and model work still intact.As time has moved on, and in the light of continuing changes and digital manipulation, which just seem to detract rather than enhance, I have now come to accept that fans such as myself who greatly appreciate the unaltered films are also no longer relevant, or indeed even part of the intended demographic for this current incarnation of Star Wars and all that it has become.I have great memories of watching Star Wars when first shown in cinemas all those years ago, and the real sense of adventure it evoked in the imagination, and although obviously a little sad that both new and older fans will not be able enjoy the original trilogy at a respectable quality, I believe this release really does mark what is a great missed opportunity.Very Disappointing.	1.0	Missed Opportunity	2011-09-22	14	12	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ABAGCAUR8A7M2	"Movie Maniac ""shevhead02"""	I've posted before, in this same forum, but my views on this product have changed. First off, yes, I know we're all reviewing a product which has not yet been released, but with confirmation of the newest changes, I think it's safe to do so. I'm still on the fence about purchasing this set, and if I do get it, it will be mainly for the bonus features. I understand that they are George Lucas' films, and he is free to do whatever he wants to them, that's fine. But quite honestly, I think with the time they've spent making changes to the movies, they could have been re-mastering the originals. Of course, I've never personally re-mastered a classic film into HD format, so I don't know how long it takes, or how much it costs, but I'm sure that Lucas has the funds. If it would've taken more time, fine, push back the Blu-ray release date. So why aren't the originals included? Time... irrelevant, fans would readily wait longer for the best quality product. Cost... yeah right, with the original releases 30 years ago, all of the re-releases over the years, and of course the dozens of other films Lucas has released, the cost is irrelevant as well. Demand... well, apparently that's irrelevant to Lucas as well. Fans have wanted the originals ever since they were last released on VHS in the mid 90s. But hey, it is what it is, I'm just another reviewer amongst the crowd. I think most, if not all, of these negative reviews would not exist if the original films were included with this set, or even in a separate set, that way, fans could decide which versions of the films they would like to watch.	2.0	So many valid points	2011-09-11	14	12	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2AQZ9ITY8GSJ0	Movie/Music Fan	I love these films and am a fan yada, yada, yada..., But why did George feel it was necessary to make changes to these films yet again.The two most irritating changes (there are much more but these are my top two most irritating) are in Empire:1st. The scene where darth vader is summoned to talk to the Emporer was completely changed along with the dialog.  In the old good version you just partialy saw the emporers face in the hologram image which made the emporer seem more mysterios.  When I saw the new version with a full frontal view of the emporers face I laughed because it looked so stupid and out of place with the rest of the movie.2nd. They changed Boba Fetts voice from the original to some irritating New Zealander accent.  Why do this George? Just because Boba Fetts father Jango Fett (from Episode 2) spoke with this annoying accent doesn't mean you have to butcher your originals any further by making changes so that they match the first three episodes.I first asked myself why wreck your originals by making further changes, but the answer became obvious, George is trying to make all six movies and stories tie together.  When I first watched Episodes 1 and 2 there were plenty of ocassions where I though to myself hang on a second this contradicts what happens in Episode 4, 5, 6 e.tc.For example in Episode 5 Obiwan appears as a vision before Luke when he is laying on the snow and instructs Luke to seek out Yoda the Jedi master who instructed him.  But in Episode 1 Obiwan's master and instructor was Qui Gon Jin not Yoda.The changes should never have been made to 4, 5, and 6.  From the start episodes 1,2, and 3 should be chopped and changed and hacken and edited, and rewritten so that they make sense and relate to 4, 5, and 6 not the other way around.Ultimately these films are George's and he can do as he wishes with them.  But it seems insulting to the actors of the original trilogy (and to the fans) to replace their voices entirely or drop their scences complety for the sake of covering up for the fact that the story telling in the prequels didn't match events that would occur later in 4, 5, and 6.Fans have waited for a long time for these films to come out on DVD, and it seems slighty disapointing and insulting when we part with our money to watch films that are not the same as we remember and enjoy.And just one final note on Episode 3. It will be more of the same of 1, and 2.  Characters you don't give two hoots about, bad acting (Hayden Christian I'm talking about you), and CGI galor.  In fact George why not do the whole film in CGI and use no actors at all.	4.0	Why did you change these films yet again George?	2004-09-25	11	8	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1CT5JOWW8KAXV	M. Peitzmeier	"It took me a long time to finally decide to buy this box set.  I read the reviews, and agonized over the changes done to the original films.  I was also a bit upset over the fact that the unaltered films on the bonus disc were non-anamorphic.  These things seemed like deal breakers.I was wrong.  After watching the ""remixed"" versions again, I found them to be just as entertaining as the original versions.  Sure there are some differences that may prove fatal for some (ie. Han vs Greedo) but frankly, I find all the complaining over that a bit silly.This set has both positive and negative points.  I really liked how the film was changed in some parts to include contemporary footage (from the 70s and 80s) originally shot by lucas but cut from the film (ex. Luke talking to Biggs in A New Hope).  I also liked how crisp and clean the visuals were.  Some of the new CGI footage does add to the movies, making transitions cleaner or adding depth to a scene.However, I did not like how some of the CGI scenes were total garbage.  The comic relief scenes of droids at Mos Eisley and the brief musical performance at Jabba's palace are the main offenders.  Also, swapping in Hayden Christensen as Vader's ghost at the end of Return of the Jedi was not a good move in my opinion.  Logically it doesn't make sense.  Aged Obi Wan dies and we get a ghost that accurately portrays him.  Old Anikin dies, and some how we get young Anikin as his ghost?  I know you want us to accept the prequels but please!Overall, I'm very pleased with this set.  If you have yet to purchase Star Wars on DVD, I'd recommend this version.  Should you be totally opposed to the remixed films, at least you can fall back on the non-anamorphic originals.  The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is due to the silly comic relief scenes I mentioned earlier."	4.0	Really Glad I Bought It!	2009-05-11	5	3	2

It actually screws up the point of Luke ""saving"" his father.  I guess George was attempting to link the old and new movies, but young anakin with old ben and old yoda makes no sense.  For a new viewer, it may imply that darth vadar's history is erased and that anakin lives on in the force as a young man.  having aged and re-joining the light side was the importance.  plus, i always thought the actor who played old anakin got the shaft.more bothersome to me was the re-do of the emperor/vadar conference on the star destroyer.  the image of the empereor is redone with the actor who plays him in 1-3, 6 but the dialogue changed again.  George again changed the context of the scene and makes it look like Vadar is not aware of Luke, which he should have been.And what is with vadar's dialogue after the episode 5 duel with Luke?  ""Bring my shuttle"" was fine.  ""Alert my SD..."" doesnt even sound like James Earl Jones.  Why was that necessary?What reallly bothers me about the edits and redos is that Lucas is changing the story.

Peau ""enigmamusement"""	The blu-ray picture quality is so clear on my parent's Full HD 50 inch plasma TV, it makes these three old movies look like they were made this year. The movie A New Hope is my favorite where all three actors and the two robots act like the funny Three Stooges and the Star Trek life-saving crew, and where every single person or robot in the movie is a survivor and a hero at the same time. If one of the five - person or robot - was suddenly left out in the movie, I would feel depressed and the movie title would instead become A New Hopeless in my imagination. Luckily, in the end of the movie, that feel-good feeling is so long-lasting when you see  all your five stars alive as a galactic team of superheroes in this movie and the following two movies in the trilogy.	5.0	Blu-ray family scifi movies of the century for Full HD plasma TV	2011-09-29	11	3	8

Also  the added bonus of Episode II footage is sure to please anyone who  purchases this set.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3HSSS8C4GHMAZ	Mr. Gareth G. Bull	"It's nice to see the original artwork took from the 'original' star wars saga. One thing I dont understand though, why didn't George Lucas edit their faces with the latest art graphics technology? He could have morphed Obi Wan to look more like Ewan McGreggor. He could have made Princess Leia look more like her mother, Natalie Portman. I dont see why we can't have Jar Jar Binks in there. Oh, I know he's not in those movies but I'm sure ol' George would agree it may just a freshen up the old farty art work for the new generation.Ok, ok... I'm obviously not insane I'm joking around, I'm trying to make a point. Although the original pictures of the old movies we all loved are printed on the box, the content (of this pictured DVD boxed set) is 'not' of the original movies. This I almost asmumed immediately. ""Whey-hey the originals with the original artwork,"" but no I was wrong. My shock reaction was too curl up into a ball on the floor of the wallmart store and wish the nightmare away. For those who were there, I apologise for the difficult time I put all the staff thru. It was my one and only mid-life crisis moment!Looking out for the year realease dates of the movies was also another sign that gave me false hope of... well you know... Its hard looking out for the original films on dvd as the single release of episodes 4-6 are dated at their original release. If they have been added to then I believe 'Star Wars Episode V: Empire Strikes Back (1980)' should be dated around the 2005 mark not 1980. Doing that just leads me down the path, to the dark side... or again leads me to falsely believe that the old episodes have finally been remastered and original to their theatrical release.Seriously though, its important to bomb this DVD set till Kingdom Come! or till George Lucas understands that his 'ideal' vision of the star wars saga shouldn't be imposed on everyone. What happened to freedom of choice? Refusing to release a classic version of a movie thats one of the greatest films of all time surely must be a crime.If you do want to see the original there is a petition you can sign at originaltrillogy dot com, but I also saw the old laser disc collection (found in some internet stores - sorry I dont advertise) which will be the closest you can get to owning them on DVD. I haven't a clue about the quality of laser discs though and probably wont buy them unless I'm certain of good picture/sound quality.If you read all of this, I apologize.I am truly sorry if I wasted your time."	1.0	Its important to bomb this DVD set till Kingdom Come!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A15W70BFY26KIA	Mr Ghostface	"Some apologists for The Phantom Menace, not all, defend it by saying, ""Yes, it has its flaws; but it's just as good as the original Star Wars, which had the very same flaws.""After a while it's hard to avoid the suspicion that they're right. Not about The Phantom Menace being a good film - it is definitely not - but about Star Wars being no better. Maybe we've been deluded these past decades. Similar delusions have persisted for just as long. Could it be that Star Wars, too, was an unimaginative, flatly directed, kiddie movie?NO! Most certainly, it was not. One thing The Phantom Menace reveals, though, is that Star Wars was not fated to be as good as it was. It became great partly by accident.Harrison Ford has genuine charm; Mark Hamill is perfect as the innocent adolescent with a tendency to whine; Alec Guinness needs no comment; and no other female lead had the strength of Carrie Fischer - at least, not while playing a traditional princess. Maybe this perfect cast was assembled by sheer chance. (Lucas never replicated the feat, after all.) But so what? It's still a perfect cast. They all created memorable characters; and moreover, as characters and actors, interacted successfully with each other.Mos Eisley's spaceport was also a fortuitous accident. ""Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy"" - yet it managed to avoid being a thriving, respectable looking town largely because George Lucas didn't have the money to turn it into one. And a good thing too. It's possibly the most frightening place in the Star Wars universe: truly grimy, light years away from real civilisation, crawling with odd and touchy aliens.With art direction, special effects, and music, too, George Lucas struck gold. Has a science fantasy world ever looked better? Have special effects ever succeeded in making such a world look more real? Arguably not - although this isn't what makes Star Wars unique. Nor is the music (although the music is part of what makes it unique). No: there really is magic here. It sounds a clich&eacute;, but there IS something about the simple but honestly pursued story, or the world, or the score, or something, that lifts Star Wars high above by-the-numbers space opera - the same indefinable element that makes Das Rheingold more than a soap opera with occasional sorcery, and The Lord of the Rings more than the first of five thousand episodic fantasy adventures. This is the company ""Star Wars"" belongs in.I for one am thankful that Lucas never had the time or money to over-fill Star Wars in the way that he has Epiodes I and II. The new films are perfect examples of how self-indulgence achieves only one thing, the spoiling of the art.If the film isn't quite up to the standard of the aforementioned opera or the book, well... maybe that's because it found its way into such company by accident. It belongs there all the same."	5.0	Better than it should have been.	2002-10-13	9	6	3

Lucas WAS correcting his special editions, despite all the claims that it was just an urban legend.A lot of people were disappointed that the DVD versions are just the special editions with a little spit shine on them, but I didn't mind.  Personally, I don't blame Lucas for wanting to erase the orange blob under the hover car or enhancing visuals which were limited by pre-digital blue-screen technology.Yes, there were unwelcome changes.  The Jabba scene.  The new Sy Snootles song.  These are bad, but they don't detract from the overall experience.Incidentally, the Jabba scene in Episode IV has been re-re-edited, and it's now much better.  Still sloppy, but better.  Han still steps on his tail, though, and watch for Chewie to enter the docking bay twice.Other more subtle changes have been made, but you probably won't notice them unless you really study them.  You will, however, notice that Hayden Christensen now appears next to Yoda and Alec Guiness at the end of Return Of The Jedi.To call it a controversial change would be an understatement.	5.0	Finally!	2004-09-13	12	6	6

I didn't know that the release was only going to be the ""special edition"", and from the reviews here it seems it is special only to Lucas.I am also a fan mostly of the first film. ESB and ROTJ are also great, but Stars Wars will always remain my favorite.I resent the fact that not only has he altered all of the films, but that they are only being released as a boxed set.Why? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ That is why.I only wanted the first film, and not this new butchered version of it anyway, so needless to say I won't be buying this.I find it ironic that he whines about piracy, then he goes and does something like this.This will only contribute to piracy. I don't know if these films were ever available on laserdisc, but if they were, and are still around, someone is surely going to rip them and post them on the net. And there will be a lot of people who, not being able to legitimately purchase them, will be eager to download them.What an idiot.He got it right the first time. While I agree that it is his right as an artist to make changes, I think that in respect to the fans who made both him and his films a smashing success, he could have offered the original theatrical versions also.The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are both so awful I wouldn't want them if they were being given away free with a large pizza or a Big Mac.This is Lucas's new ""vision""?If so, then I'd say he needs to schedule a visit to the optometrist."	1.0	"It wasn't broke- but Lucas ""fixed"" it anyway..."	2004-09-21	10	8	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2H22I2RWE0HOV	Mr. Sinister	Having read the reviews and understanding that some fans are pissed off at the new versions of the three original Trilogy films, we need to step back for a few minutes and take a deep breath.  First things first . . . Is somone holding a blaster to your melon, forcing you to put your hard-earned dollars into Mr. Lucas' bank account?  Nope.  So I think the major resolution to the issues of revamping the Trilogy break down pretty easily into this:  If you don't like it, don't (...) buy it!  Bottom line.  Now that that's out of the way, let us explore the possibilities.  Sure, I liked it when Han just straight up wasted Greedo in the original films when I was a wee lad of seven.  Hell, that was what made Han Solo so friggin' cool.  Rebel.  This close to the galactic version of Dirty Harry.  And sure, did I need to see that geek, freak, whining (...)of an Anakin Christian whatever-his-name-is in the original movies?  Hell, no.  That borders on blasphemy.  Seeing these movies in the theaters as I was growing up bordered on a religious experience, and screwing with the originals makes my flesh creep.  But, we gotta look at it the other way.  Apparently Mr. Lucas doesn't want the originals back on the market in DVD format.  Now we can do one of three things about it.  By the Malaysian bootlegs off of E-bay or stand around and (...)like a bunch of whiny Star Wars geeks or we can buy this revamped version of the Trilogy and lump it.  There are the choices.  I didn't say you had to like them.  But the picture quality is great!  And the sound is fabulous!  And the documentary is superb on the 4th disc . . . so suck it up and buy it and keep your memories of the originals in your mind for selfish nostalgia.  All in all, the changes aren't as bad as all that.  This is just the 1997 Special Editions with three or four more tweakings.  Lucas apparently will never feel that the first three Star Wars flick will ever be done to his liking.  Whatever . . .	4.0	Let's Unsheath Our Claws and Go For The Jugular!!!!	2005-04-16	15	5	10

The original films had great special effects for their time, a fast pace, and engaging characters.  They also had some several very bad actors in key roles, mediocre dialogue, and numerous continuity errors, both within the  individual films and over the course of the series.

DO NOT BUY.  read on...While I knew George was not going to give us the unaltered original trilogy (he's been saying this for years) on blu-ray, I was at least hopeful that this blu-ray set would be similar in film content to the special editions we got in 1997 (getting rid of the Hayden addition and so on in the 2004 DVDs).  Realistically though, we knew Mr. Lucas couldn't help himself from tinkering with the films even more.  BUT, with the changes he has added now, he's gone too far.  There are silly CGI additions that create continuity errors (R2D2 hidden in a pile of boulders now) and over-the-top audio changes (Krayt dragon, etc.).  The killer though, is the addition of NoooOOOoooOOo.  This scene was probably one of the most important moments in the entire saga.  Vader's silent actions sent chills down your spine.  Now, Lucas has decided to add NoooOOoooOOOooooo to the scene.  It even covers up Luke's desperate pleas to his father.Sorry George, but this is it. NO DEAL.  It's fine and dandy if you want to continue to play with your films, but do not erase history.  Make all versions available, most importantly the theatrical.  Future generations need to know the original films.  Your colleagues can do it (see Blade Runner), so why can't you.DO NOT BUY THIS SET!

After watching them, I feel so violated! It wasn't the original release, it wasn't even the special edition, IT IS A COMPLETELY BUTCHERED VERSION OF THE STAR WARS TRILOGY! The special edition was bad enough, but now on this DVD release, they have edited and changed even MORE scenes!The straw that broke the camel's back for me was at the end of the Return of the Jedi movie, where Luke looks off and sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father. THEY REPLACED HIS FATHER WITH THE ACTOR THAT PLAYED ANAKIN IN EPISODE II. So now Luke looks off and sees two OLD Jedi's, and one young teeny-bopper! LUKE LOOKED OLDER THAN HIS DAD! Seeing that felt so wrong! All the new scenes felt wrong, and out of place! They all stick out like a sore thumb! I didn't even wait for the credits. I had to take the disk out! That was just too much for me.Yes, this was George Lucas's creation, and he can do what ever he wants to it but this is just wrong. Star Wars was a classic! I am sure that I am not the only person who liked it the way it was.Re-storing and Re-mastering a movie is one thing, but adding and changing scenes to this degree is a crime. I really think that Mr. Lucas is going through some sort of mid-life crisis. He must have woke up one morning thinking that anything old is bad!A lot of people compare this DVD set to Michael Jackson's face, and I have to agree. We should be able to see and buy the versions of Star Wars we want. He should have released both versions, &quot;original&quot; and &quot;special&quot; editions. If he wants to change stuff, change episode 1,2, and 3. They're not classics, there not even well liked by fans.The comercial advertised this DVD set like it was going to be the Star Wars that we all remembered. It's still Star Wars, but it's not the version that a lot of people wanted to preserve on DVD. I bought it and I am not happy with it.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AFPJLXBDMC7WI	"M. Snowden ""STOP THE FOOL"""	Yet again more changes have been made to the once great films:What's Been Changed?The rumors are true: Lucas made more changes to the films for their DVD debut. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has been added to a scene in Jedi, Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) replaces Clive Revill with slightly revised lines in Empire, Temuera Morrison has rerecorded Boba Fett's minimal dialogue, and some other small details have been altered. Yes, these changes mean that the Star Wars films are no longer the ones you saw 20 years ago, but these brief changes hardly affect the films, and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies. It's not like a digitized Ewan McGregor has replaced Alec Guiness's scenes, and the infamous changes made for the 1997 special-edition versions were much more intrusive (of course, those are in the DVD versions as well).Why George Why!? He just has to change it again. Just like in the south park episode where he goes about and makes more changes. Its happening! soon all guns will be replaced with walkie talkies!!!

What a perfect venue for such a visual feast. But sadly, rather than heed the huge demand of fans for this series to be released on DVD, the emphasis appears to be on re-releasing the VHS format... over and over and over again.I own this trilogy on VHS, and enjoy the enhancements that have been made to this set over the original release. I am anxious to obtain this trilogy on DVD. I already own the VHS, do not want to buy another set on VHS, and want it on DVD. But can I get it?No! Only the refurbished VHS version keeps popping up again and again.I thought there would be hope after Phantom Menace appeared on DVD. But no.... evidently hope misplaced.The folks who steadfastly refuse to release these titles on DVD are doing a massive disservice to their fans, to movie affecinados, and to their own bottom line. It is, as another wanderer of the cosmos might quip, ""illogical"".The VHS Trilogy has some wonderful enhancements over previous releases. Yet, the evident lack of regard for a huge and growing segment of the viewing and movie buying fandom is alarming and disconcerting.Until it is available on DVD, then maybe this would be a great series to have on VHS. However, if you long to see this on DVD, I would encourage you to hold out until the producers finally accomodate their fans."	3.0	Hold out for DVD	2002-04-26	1	1	0

Tate	Star Wars has one of the largest fan bases of any Hollywood phenomenon out there, so it comes as no surprise that they break off into little cliques to decide how its legacy should live on. There are those who claim that nothing should be done to the original since that's what they fell in love with, and there are those who want to be selective about the updating done to them, and then there are those who want them to be retconned entirely so that they fit the prequels more. George Lucas can't win.I was born in '87, but my first exposure to Star Wars was in fact the original film. Personally, I have found all of the enhancements to be enjoyable (well, okay, Han shot first, but aside from that...), and expect there to be many more enhancements made in my lifetime because Lucas is an artist who will never be completely happy with his work, partly due to the fans incessant whining. People will always find something wrong with these movies.I enjoy Star Wars in all its forms, and look forward to future updates from Lucasfilms. 5 out of 5.	5.0	You can't please everyone...	2010-02-05	2	2	0

The Trilogy and American Graffiti are among my favorite films of all time. However Lucas's decision to only release the special editions of these films borders on a crime in my mind.The original release of these films marked a revolution is special effects. The motion control techniques and modeling were state-of-the-art at the times these films were released. All of hard work an innovation of teams of visionary artists will now be lost to history because of the ego and short sided thinking of one ego maniac.Why don't we just colorize every black and white film ever made because the directors really wanted color, but it just wasn't possible at the time?

Part of the fun of those movies was that they DIDN'T look perfect and that they DIDN'T have a CGI Jabba the Hutt.  I can't believe some of the things I've heard that Lucas changed in these movies.  I understand that George Lucas has the right to do what he wants to his films as they are his creation.  But I also have the right to make sure that he never sees another cent of my money as long as he's being so selfish.  Anyway...I heard that some REALLY BAD people *wink* somewhere on the evil Internet made DVD's out of recordings from the laserdisc releases of the films.  I also heard from a ""friend"" that the quality is actually pretty good.One other funny thing I'd like to point out is that a lot of people's favorite Star Wars film seems to be The Empire Strikes Back.

All of these things really alter the films for me and make it a far different trilogy than the one I grew up with.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2L119B70PDKAH	musicfan	These films are classics and will always be remembered as the greatest film saga of all time. They have stood the test of time and after almost thirty years, old and new fans love 'em.The Star Wars Trilogy's transfer to DVD doesn't dissapoint. With an entire other disc completely dedicated to special features, there's really not much you can complain about in that aspect. Also, the changed George Lucas has made to these films are mostly for the better. Adding Ian Mcdiarmid to The Empire Strikes Back to play as Emperor Palpatine when he's talking to Darth Vader through a hologram was a great idea that made the contiuity between all of the films better because Ian played Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and all of the prequel movies. Adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Return of the Jedi as Anakin's spirit did the same because he played Anakin in Episodes II and III. At the end celebration in Return of the Jedi, one of the planets it shows celebrating is Naboo, which, again, helps with continuity. Boba Fett's voice has been re-recorded using the actor for Jango Fett, because in Episode II we learn that he is a clone of Jango Fett, so naturally he would have the same voice as him. Continuity is helped here also.In addition to these wonderful revisions the sound and picture quality is absolutely amazing. I couldn't ask for anything better.If you are a Star Wars fan, a science fiction fan, or just a movie fan in general, these movies are must-haves.	5.0	Classics	2005-06-09	3	1	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A30F1J3UP8MM41	Music Fan	This is a review for the Star Wars Widescreen, Theatrical Version of Episodes IV, V, and VI. The box has Luke and Darth Vader clashing light sabers with a blue background. I already own episodes I through VI (special editions)on Blu Ray, and I bought this set on DVD specifically for the theatrical versions. Buyers should be aware that the theatrical versions are only on the bonus discs, so don't buy a set that is missing a bonus disc if your goal is the theatrical versions. Also the Aspect Ratio is 2.35 to 1 for both the special editions and original versions, but the special editions are enhanced for widescreen 16:9 TVs, whereas the orginal versions are in 4:3 letterbox format. This was a disappointment for me, as it put black boxes on the top and bottom of my 16:9 screen and overall made the picture smaller. But apparantely this is as good as it gets for the original versions on DVDs. You should also be aware that the only other item on the bonus discs is a Xbox (original) demo version of the Star Wars Lego game. I hope this helps with your purchasing decision.	4.0	Original Theatrical Versions	2013-04-28	8	4	4

I'm a purist at heart and didn't like the fact that the movie was changed but let's be real - the story line is the very same and unless you've watched the originals literally dozens of times (to the point that you can recite the movie by heart) you're not going to notice a majority of the differences.  One change that I personally didn't like was at the end of the Return of the Jedi when Luke Skywalker sees the ""glowing"" Obie Wan Kenobi, Yoda and his father.  For some unknown reason they changed the actor who played Luke's father in this scene.  Despite the fact that it's just plain rude to the original actor, it didn't change the story line at all.  If you're a fan of the triology this dvd collection is well worth it for the updating that was done on the sound and picture as well as the fact that a dvd will last longer than a video.

I like it when some things are cleaned up because with all these new effects in movies today your eye is just drawn to the old effects, but to tell you the truth I can't tell most of the time when they've changed something.I admire special effects, and there can be so much added to a story with its great use, but it is not essential. I love the Star Wars trilogy because of the story, the effects considering the time, and, most of all, the actors and their lines (no one beats Harrison Ford in the role of a sarcastic mercenary).Like most trilogies the three aren't equally good, but they stay equally entertaining throughout. In the case of the bonus material, I watched just about everything on there and enjoyed it all. Some bonus stuff released today gets very boring, but this material talked about the effects, the crowds and fans, and the actors. It was odd seeing the actors older, but it was enjoyable. I saw sides in Luke's actor he hadn't shown in the movie, which really makes me wish he'd been in more movies. Fun bonus material, very much worth it.Star Wars is such a classic series, everyone knows the name, but I'm always surprise when I find people who haven't seen the original series. I'm not saying watch it because it's a classic, but it holds its place in the best movies ever.You'll have to see it to know what I mean.	5.0	The original Star Wars!	2007-02-06	6	5	1

I loved them all and sawe them repeatedly each about 40 times.  I loved it.  Then recently I bought the boxed set to see the extras and to see what all the hoopla people were making about the changes.  I personally don't see the big deal os.  The films are still fantastic and exciting.  I enjoyed every bit of it now as I did way back when.  Personally I believe George Lucas read my mind because as I was watching Return of the Jedi I was thinking it would be great if at the end he put the Anakin Skywalker we know today (Hayden Christensen) in the scene in the end where Luke sees his father, yoda and obi-wan.  To say the least I was overjoyed to see that he did.  It's was the right thing to do because he basically is showing Anakin restored to the man he was prior to going to the dark side.  It would have been better to have Padme inserted as well so Luke and Leia could see their mother.  But over all I believe all the additions were great and the movies are still the best.

The picture and sound quality is excellent for VHS, and, though some are not needed, the additional segments were interesting to watch.  I'm guessing that most of you already know the story, and if you do, great, but bear with my brief synopsis' of the videos for those underprivileged souls who have not seen them.IV: A NEW HOPE.  Often referred to as the first movie, it is actually the first of the TRILOGY, not the series.  It quickly opens with the capture of Princess Leia Organa, Senator of Alderaan and the escape of See Threepio and Artoo Detoo, the two comical droids.  Play then switches to the intro of Darth Vadar and the skeletal Governor Tarkin and then to Tatooine, home of ""Ben"" Kenobi and Luke Skywalker.  They go on a mission to bring the plans of the Death Star to Alderaan, assisted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, owners of the Millenium Falcon, respectfully.  The first segment of the trilogy culminates with a lightsaber battle, retreat to the Rebel Base, and exciting mission to destroy the Death Star.  A five star movie.V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  My favorite of the series, part two begins on the ice world of Hoth, at the new Rebel base.  Not long after the opening, the base is discovered and attacked by Imperial troops with Leia, Chewbacca, Han, and See Threepio escaping on the Millenium Falcon and Luke and Artoo heading for training with Jedi master, Yoda.  The Falcon takes shelter in an asteroid field to begin repairs, where the blossoming relationship between Han and Leia becomes evident.  Luke starts to harness the force to aid him on Degobah.  In need of help, Han goes to his friend, Lando for supplies and shelter, only to find a rather unpleasant surprise waiting for them there.  The best movie of the trilogy.  Five star material.VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI.  Beginning where ""ESB"" left off, our heros are on a mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt's palace.  After the reunion, Luke heads off to Degobah to keep a promise to his Jedi trainer, Yoda, while the rest ship back to the Rebel base to get the low down on the second Death Star's construction.  Han leads a strike team after Luke returns from Yoda (some rather interesting news from him, by the way, folks) to the forest moon of Endor to disable the shield protecting the Death Star.  This movie is practically all action, ending with the Battle of the Ewoks, Vadar and Luke's showdown, and some interesting revelations.  The creepy Emperor Palpatine makes his appearance.  My least favorite of the trilogy, but still a good story.  Four stars.There you have it.  I urge you to purchase these videos: It is well worth your pocket change.  A NEW HOPE also includes a twelve-minute trailer on Episodes I and II and how Lucas plans to tie up all the loose ends.  Extremely watchable, without a killing number of spoilers.  If you want more info on any of these three movies individually, see my reviews for each on this website.Final Word:  A definite worthwhile expenditure of your money.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A11LBJI2U95GXT	Nathan R Bauman	"I shall confine my points in this review to the scene with the ghostly Anakin, Yoda, and Obi Wan.  The subsitution of the Anakin we are to see in Episode 3 for the original aged, ghostly Anakin, was an unmitigated disaster.What is so disturbing about the replacement is not merely that youth and beauty have triumphed over age and wisdom. As for beauty, the youthful Anakin's face shows a little too much fat; on an older person it would be more excusable! As for youth, Luke Skywalker surely would look up seeing a brother, not a father, and the father-son relationship has been critical to the epic trilogy. Presumably George Lucas made the decision to help unify the prequels with the originals. He may also have been thinking of redemption, of an eternal youth, like C.S. Lewis's Narnia characters in ""The Last Battle."" But he was wrong to do this, quite apart from the visual and cognitive dissonance created by the juxtaposition of the still-aged Obi Won and Yoda with the youthful Anakin.The new depiction denigrates Anakin's greatest moment of spiritual clarity: that moment when he said ""no"" forever to the Dark Side of the Force, and ""yes"" to the Good Side. That moment came on the Death Star when Anakin Skywalker-Darth Vader reached deep into his own soul and found that love for his son was more important than all the emperors and systems in the universe. Indeed, it was the culmination of an internal conflict that he felt all along, and that we witnessed, for example, on the moon of Endor when the man-machine was lost in thought among the trees. Anakin's love conquered his despair, and, as he himself admitted, saved him.I reacted strongly against the change on a personal level, too. Each of us, like Anakin, has made bad decisions, made turns toward the Dark Side, if you will. If we turn to the good side, everyday, whatever grace we may exhibit as a humans will always be lived out of the sum total of our life's experiences. In our own lives, we cannot undo the past. To turn back the clock, to be a young Anakin again, at the very point where his journey goes so wrong, is both paradox and fantasy, in the negative sense of the word. Furthermore, the entire six part series is about Anakin.  It makes no sense. Unlike many mistakes, this one is completely reversable--at least for the next release of the DVD's; I certainly hope that in the inevitable boxed set for all six episodes George Lucas will give us back the ""original"" ghostly Anakin.  I'd certainly be prepared to fork out my hard-earned money again to have this single mistake fixed.Note that my ""Real Name"" badge should now read: ""Seoul, South Korea."""	3.0	Good, but ruined at the end!	2004-10-09	18	16	2

It's more like it shaped my life. I might have been a perfectly normal little girl who liked Barbies and My Little Pony, had my early exposure not rendered me instead the type to collect Rancor Keeper action figures (with removable leather hood!)I don't know for sure how many times I've seen the films. I lost track somewhere around 27. I suppose, realistically, it must be at least 60 or 70 times altogether. Certainly, whenever I see the 20th Century Fox logo, I am surprised if it is not followed by John Williams' score. (Sadly, this is not an exaggeration. Every time I hear that fanfare, my brain is primed to see a galaxy far, far away, and I feel a little sense of letdown when it doesn't occur.)What that means to me now is that I can't enjoy my new DVD set as much as I'd like. Certainly, the cleaned-up audio and video are superior to my aging, greenish VHS copies. But I can't find it in myself to enjoy all the digital crap Lucas added into it in 1997. Maybe if I didn't know the films so well, I wouldn't find the additions so glaring, but for the most part I find the CGI doesn't mesh at all well with the puppetry and scale models. Jabba the Hutt's ""new"" scene is an abomination; at several points Han Solo clips into him as they move around.And change just for the sake of change has never appealed to me. Call me hidebound, but I didn't spend half my life memorizing the dialogue only to be tripped up by a new version of Luke and Yoda chatting on Dagobah. The same information is conveyed; why use an alternate cut? It just distracts me from my enjoyment of the films.I guess my only hope is that some other die-hard fan (with more tech-savvy than I possess) will figure out a way to make a DVD of the short-lived remastered VHS version produced in the mid-90s. Meanwhile, I am giving this DVD set 4 stars based in large part on the happy memories it evokes.  More objectively, the hash of ""improvements"" Lucas added to the films would make me rate it a 2 or 3."	4.0	It's Star Wars, man.  I can't help but rate it highly.	2004-09-22	12	8	4

Is the holy trilogy, now that it's finally on DVD, worth owning?  Of course it is, but to all fans who made the singular, unified groan that Lucas would be releasing the ""Special Edition"" versions of the films on DVD as opposed to the originals that we all grew up with, you'd probably be better off sticking with the original videos.  Despite that though, all three films look glorious, and Empire Strikes Back has never looked or sounded better.  I won't go into the storylines of each film, since just about anyone and everyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the last three decades knows it allready, but I will say this.  I, along with countless others, am getting tired of Lucas going back and re-modifying his films.  Remember his first film, THX 1138 (which is now on DVD, and naturally has all new special effects) which dealt with a technologically overrun society?  It seems like Mr. Lucas' life is immitating his art, and that is a shame.  Despite that, you know you'll eventually pick this up, but maybe you should give it a long, hard thought before George decides to ""re-modify"" his films again down the road."	3.0	The holy trilogy finally on DVD, but is it worth owning?	2004-09-20	15	10	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1HX5J4LJDQUZP	Nemo	"At last, the greatest space saga of all time is finally on DVD. I was not alive to experience the phenomenon that the first entry in the series caused, nor do I know what it was like to experience the brand new feeling that Star Wars brought to moviegoers. What I do know is this: that these films are film Holy Grails which I believe to be some of the greatest films of all time. The first time I watched these movies was in the theatre, was at the re-releasing of Star Wars as new ""Special Editions"". It was in 1997, and I distinctly remember the sheer magic that the first Star Wars-""A New Hope"", brought to me. I was instantly captivated. From there on I became a Star Wars fan, not the faux-lightsaber wielding, Star Wars cult fanatics, but a simple fan of a trilogy that changed a generation. Now here I am, reviewing the DVD version of a cultural phenomenon.Star Wars: Episode IV-A New HopeOverall I was very pleased with this DVD. The picture and sound quality are beyond perfect, and most of the changes here are subtle. There is, however, another unwelcome change to the Han Solo/Greedo confrontation. Now, not only does Greedo shoot first, but Han now dodges Greedo's blast and then fires. I think that Lucas should change it back to the way it was. Come on Lucas, Han Solo was a space pirate. Space pirates, even if they are protagonists, still do whatever they can to survive in the galaxy. But otherwise this DVD is great. What I love about ""A New Hope"" is its open, space-opera cheerfulness. After all, this is the one that started it all, making more than $460 Million. Other changes include the lengthening of the detention block, the changing of English font to Auberesh font, and the alteration of the Jabba scene.Star Wars: Episode V-The Empire Strikes BackThis is the most unaltered movie of this DVD set, and by far the best. This film is much darker than the first one, and much more dramatic. Part of the reason is that Irvin Kirshner is the director. He brought his cinematic vision to Lucas' already dazzling vision of the films. This perfect marriage of story and effects created ""Empire"". Another factor which made this film was so good was Mark Hamill's performance and his connection with Yoda, whose puppeteer was Frank Oz.  The most prominent change is the addition of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor in his transmission. This is good for the sake of continuity, and Ian McDiarmid is much more sinister in this scene than the old woman being voiced by Clive Revill. The other change I could spot is the re-dubbing of Temuera Morrison's voice for Boba Fett. Again, this is the best of the series, and the best space movie ever made.Star Wars: Episode VI-The Return of the JediAh! Sigh. Jedi, jedi, jedi, jedi. Well, this is the least of the Star Wars films by far, and I really can't blame it all on Richard Marquand, the director. So I blame it on Lucas. It was the story which was flawed, not the directing. In fact, Marquand did not have much experience with special effects, and thus, if given a better script, would have done a much better job. And those dreaded Ewoks! I was in total disbelief when Wicket, the films central Ewok, was first introduced to Leia and the audience. The single bright light is the real introduction of Ian McDiarmid's Emperor, who provides an excellent villain to the movie. As for the changes, the most distinct and blasphemous one is Hayden Christensen supplanting Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of Anakin. Another alteration is the insertion of Naboo as one of the areas celebrating at the end."	5.0	The Last of the Great Movies on DVD	2004-09-26	12	7	5

Not only is the audio excellent, but the clarity and resolution are truly spectacular. And, what is the best is the fact that none of the films lose their artistic quality that made the originals so popular. Now all we need are the Original Versions and I will not make anymore complaints. However, these are not the original versions, but Lucas' tinkered with versions. Again, Greedo shoots first. Yes, Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw as Anakin's ghost. But, with some luck and some time, these deviations will be forgotten. Right now, I am only concerned with the pure joy that these TWO classics, (Sorry, Jedi) are finally on DVD. As for the extras, I can make the assessment that Lucas is omitting some things, but these will do for now.	5.0	Now all We Need is the Original Versions!	2004-09-24	3	1	2

So this DVD package is a must buy. Right? Wrong. Here's why.Do you realise these versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are not the original versions, nor are they the 'special editions' from 1997? They are actually the special editions 'touched up' again! These versions are so far removed from the originals that we are not buying what we saw and fell in love with in 1977, 1980, and 1983. 'A New Hope' (aka Star Wars!) has lost its charm because it is now an unconvincing hybrid of blue-screen/cheap props and high-tech computer animation. This version of Star Wars is caught between two vastly different film-making techniques and as a result, has lost its continuity and just looks silly. For example, we see the 1970's computer screen describing (in very outdated imagery) the plan to destroy the Death Star just prior to the digitally enhanced X-Wings flying past Yavin. Where is Lucas' consistency? This occurs very obviously, throughout the whole movie. Despite these flaws in Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi don't suffer near as much in comparison. Lucas had a larger budget when he produced these films, and it shows.Hold back on this package if you want the originals!Do you realise that Episode 3 is due out in cinemas in May 2005? There will be a boxed set of all 6 Star Wars films to follow at some stage. Do you think anyone would buy this future 6-movie package if it wasn't going to be a superior product? No. Lucasfilm will have to convince the public to spend money on these movies again. The 6 movie DVD will be THE package to buy.Hold back on this package as there will be a superior package of the 6 films to come.Did you know that George Lucas has stored away so much more footage from the originals than has been shown? There are scenes in ""Star Wars"" featuring Biggs and Luke on Tatooine, scenes from ""Empire"" featuring Wampas attacking stormtroopers and rebels, and scenes of Luke training with Yoda, scenes from ""Jedi"" featuring the Rancor, sandstorms, dialogue between Obi-Wan and Luke. The list goes on. George Lucas has to make use of these scenes. They are not in this package. So they must be included in a future DVD package.Hold back on this package if you want to see those 'missing' scenes.We deserve a package like the Alien Quadrilogy where we would get both the original version AND the special addition. Lucas should also take note of Peter Jackson and the quality of the Lord of the Rings DVD packages. We shouldn't have to keep spending money on inferior products because we are not told the truth about what will or will not be released in the future.Having said that, I bought these because I love the saga. The DVD extras are excellent and the picture quality and soundtrack are outstanding, but I've got the feeling Lucas is holding alot back. If you can wait for the 6 movie package then do so."	4.0	Hold Back on Buying This DVD Package	2004-08-10	32	24	8

He spoke with such intensity about the horrors, with such sadness about the losses, and with such optimism about the victory.  Sorry to say, I didn't and couldn't grasp the depth of his feelings about those times.  To me the War was a black and white experience, molded by the images and sounds of the then contemporary newsreels and films; and so it remains to this very day.  Yet my father was only a youth from 1940 - 1945.  Having lived through that period, however, influenced his life in many ways.  As much as I would have liked to have shared a sense of that life event, there is simply no way for me to jump into my father's shoes and experience it the way he did.  The same is true for movie fans of every generation.  Some films affect us in tremendous ways.  Some films influence who we want to be, or who we eventually become.  Some films define a period of our lives and become so inextricably a part of our past that we build our memories around when we viewed them and the impact they had on us.  Such is the legacy of the Star Wars films.  Just as with the shooting of JFK, I can recall where I was and when it was that I saw Episode IV for the first time.  It gave me the same thrilling satisfaction as when I read the Count of Monte Cristo for the first time or any of the Hemingway novels. It was pure escapism, pure adventure, and it helped me get through four years of college.  But it was MY experience, and I can't expect anyone outside of my generation to understand or appreciate what it meant to me.  That's why comments that argue that ""old fans"" should ""move on"" and ""embrace the future"" are ridiculously meaningless.  These are from kids who simply can't step in my shoes.Distilled to its essence, films are nothing more than moving pictures that tell a story.  It's no different from a book other than in its presentation.  What this debate is all about is the power or abuse thereof of owning intellectual property.  Mr. Lucas is free to experiment with his asset because he owns it.  We can't complain.  It's our system.  This is business, and filmmakers are entitled to earn a living, and the investors/producers/distributors of these films are entitled to earn a profit.  Those of us that want the original version on DVD will simply have to wait until it gets released, or copy our VHS versions over to digital.  What Mr. Lucas has done for me, however, is increase my appreciation for all of the classic novels I've read over the years.  At least those can't be changed, which is why they call them classics."	3.0	Perhaps Star Wars is not a classic after all	2004-09-08	33	27	6

He has made changes he felt were necessary for people to get maximum enjoyment out of the films.Also, if you really feel that the unaltered originals are the best, then watch them instead of the new DVDs. As far as I'm concerned, Lucas has not ordered a massive burning of all original Star Wars movies. For everyone else you felt the series needed a touch up, enjoy these new DVDs. We can all sit down and watch the version that we personally want.Remember Lucas is not out to spite you; he has given us some incredible movies, and he simply wants to give world the most complete and enjoyable movies he can.	4.0	DEFENDING GEORGE LUCAS	2005-05-23	40	19	21

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3489JENP5Q230	Nick Alimonos	That's it . . . I've had it. No really. I didn't want to bother putting in my two cents, but I am really getting sick of all this Lucas bashing and SW bashing.First of all, let's have a slight reality check here, shall we? Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, or whatever the heck you want to call it, is NOT a masterpiece! OK? You were all probably 12 when you first saw it, and now all those warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia are clouding your judgment.Case in point . . . I was watching ANH the other day on VHS, and BOY does it look horrible. I mean HORRIBLE. Let's start with the little bit I actually was able to sit through:1) The Stormtroopers are idiots. Let's face it. These guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. All they can do is shuffle around like idiots in oversized helmets while firing cheap looking laser shots that go nowhere. In fact, how in the WORLD does Han Solo, a guy with one blaster, scare away and chase down an entire regiment of troopers? Where did Vader find these guys? And if they are such idiots, how in the world did they takeover the galaxy in the first place?2) Vader's fight with Obi-Wan-Kenobi is attrocious. I mean, I know one guy is old and the other guy is on some kind of breather, but COME ON, I could fight better than that. In addition, at one point during the fight, Obi-Wan-Kenobi's lightsaber turns into a point of light that looks like a Christmas tree bulb (I guess Lucas didn't know how to make a lightsaber from the top looking down). Just imagine if the trilogies were reversed, and ANH came out in 2008, how outraged fanboys would be by such a geriatric, anti-climactic battle.3) Serious visual flaw: Since when does junk float? In the garbage compacter scene, big chunks of metal debris just float to the top of the water. Um . . . I know the props are fake, but these spaceship parts look too obviously like bits of cardboard and styrofoam.4) Really BAD SFX: Sure, for '77 the FX were really something, but the black box surrounding the incoming TIE-fighters are just too noticeable. Another scene involving has an X-Wing zoom over the top of the Death Star (which looks so obviously like a very cheap plastic model set) and the laser blasts that shoot off of it spark like fireworks! Thank God Lucas added those extra seconds where you can actually see the Death Star in all its magnificently massive, spherical glory.5) Sure you say, all this is bad, but Star Wars isn't about SFX and action scenes, its about plot and acting! Gimme a break! If you care about that, you should be on the Godfather message board.So let's talk about plot and acting in ANH. When Luke finds out his aunt and uncle are dead, he basically forgets about them (these people who basically raised him like parents from birth!) in about a few minutes. But when Obi-Wan-Kenobi dies, a man he just met and knows for about a couple of hours, he freaks out and gets very emotional. How's that for coherence?I could go on and on like this . . . but I won't. The fact of the matter is ANH is really not as great as you remember it, or you would like to believe it was. I was 2 when the movie came out, and now I am 29, and obviously my life-experiences are going to taint my view of it today. Does that mean it is a bad movie? By no means. The things we love about Star Wars are still there . . . which is, I believe, the incredible world George Lucas realized, a world that, as children and sometimes adults, we can dream about long after the credits roll. A few minutes of altered footage isn't going to ruin the DVD's for me, even if I don't agree that Jabba the Hutt should remain anonymous in ANH.	5.0	You people are delusional	2004-08-24	34	10	24

Star Wars - A new hope is the reason we all wore chewy t-shirts and c3po lunch boxes...A true fantasy of good vs evil with wonderfully developed characters.  I believe the stregnth of this movie is due to our ability to be these characters..that is what is lacking in most movies these days...It was a fantasy that I and You and everyone can relate too...We did relate to these characters so we didn't just watch, we were right along with them for the ride of our lives.	5.0	Finally!!	2004-03-31	2	0	2

People think since they have had the movies since kids that they have some type of ownership over them, which obviously don't have. now i will say that i am not the biggest fan of all of the alterations, but cmon, the differences will probably total up to maybe 3 minutes of a 2 and a half hour movie being changed? If you had no previous introduction to Star Wars, and saw the movies as they were on the blue rays would you hate them? if you honestly can answer that question with a yes, you can not call yourself a Star Wars fan.5 stars because the movies look and sound awesome on Blue Ray and the total differences throught all the movies adds up to like... 3 minutes of alterations.	5.0	George Lucas does not care what you think	2011-09-26	14	6	8

The changes that Lucas made did not change the most important thing about the movies, THE STORY ! The special effects are phenomenal , but the story is Golden. This epic tale of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil is simply poetic as placed against a back drop of Light sabers and Alien worlds. The color and sound on every film is flawless , and the changes were seamless and did not interrupt the enjoyment of the film in any way. The commentaries are fantastic and insightful. The fourth disc is packed with great extras even the art work in each DVD is great.I do ask this to all of you who are angry with the changes. If you had the power to go back and change something in your life and make it better , wouldn't you?	5.0	I liked it , even with the changes .	2004-11-07	12	7	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2483NOCVPYS12	Nicky G In CT	I have just spent an entire Star Wars Sunday watching the DVD Set for the first time. I have to say as a fan since the age of seven since the original films release in '77 that the films have never looked better. I approve of all the changes except for the one that is getting the most buzz from all fans old and new.A NEW HOPE:I am happy that, here goes the first spolier, Jabba was changed again for Episode IV: A New Hope. The first time we see him in '97 for the Special Edition he appeared smaller, which was okay because he was younger. Yet when he appeared in Episode I: The Phantom Menace he was as big as he was in Return Of The Jedi. That was obviously a continuity error that has now been corrected. And thankfully so.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACKI am also pleased that The Emperor is now portrayed by Ian McDiarmid. He is The Emperor that we have come to know in Return Of The Jedi and the three Prequels. Which again adds continuity in the Star Wars universe.When I first heard the voice of Boba Fett I noticed a change right away. His voice is now supplied by the same actor who portrayed Fett's father Jango in Episode II: Attack Of The Clones. This makes sense because Boba is Jango's clone and should have the same voice. Once again continuity comes into play.RETURN OF THE JEDI:Now we get to the scene that is getting all of the buzz. The end of the film where we see the spirits of Kenobi, Yoda and Annakinhas been altered. The actor Sebastian Shore who portrayed Annakin in Jedi when the Vader's mask is removed and as a spirit, as stated above, has been replaced by Hayden Christiansen from Episodes II and III in the Spirit scene.I can see Lucas' reasoning for the change, again for continuity, but why not show a young Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) or young Yoda (Episode I era)???? The change would make more sense and be a lot more effective. Why just Annakin? To show the character before his fall from grace as a Jedi? This would be acceptable I suppose. But in all honesty I think this scene should have been left the way it was shot originally.Overall a lovely addition to my collection. The extra disc contains a fantastic documentary of all three films and a 10 minute sneak peak of Episode III where we get to see Annakin don the Vader suit for the 1st time and tons more. We've all waited long enough for this set. I too would have preferred the original theatrical releases but after seing how beautiful the sound and picture is I'm sure we'll all grow accustomed to the changes.	5.0	Spoiler Alert Review	2004-09-12	12	7	5

Toys,rereleases in theaters,books,it's done grand.But times change.Star Wars prequals have tried to compete with this new great wonder trilogy of the 21 century,But have failed I think for being the most spectacular.The greatest trilogy(so far)for a Millenium is THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!! I almost have to say it beats the old Star Wars Trilogy a little.NOT speacial effects even,but the plot,heart felt acting,and a mythological feeling.Beats the Force.Star Wars is no longer the best and only fantasy.For one thing the preaquals have sad ending and the plot is not as speacial as Lord of the Rings.Thats why it's not as popular.I never felt Return of the Jedi blasted it's predesesors completely.Return of the King even outdid it's Helms Deep battle and the emotion was fever pitch with Sam having to carry Frodo and even Aragorn's almost failure and it really made you believe that Middle Earth would be no more!I think it's still climatic when Lukey defeats Darth Vader and he changes.The ending is good but Lord of the Rings is more fufilling.Isn't it cute when Sam greets his family and closes the door on a Epic?	5.0	It's the trilogy of the 20' century!	2004-01-16	4	0	4

This masterpiece is a jewel in any DVD collection - Lucas Art should have made a better packaging (take the lord of the ring special edition package, for example).The box is beautiful, with nice embossing, but made on thin cardboard stock, that will not resist a long time, I am sure. The DVD sleeves look really ""Cheap"" an the selection of the art, paintings and drawings used on them very poor.So in conclusion, these dvd are of course a must have, and deserve their 5 stars raiting, but the packaging is HORRIBLE, CHEAP, and deserve a minus 5 stars.

ALthough i love the original trilogy i purposefully hadn't seen it for about four years, waiting for the day when it would come out on dvd. And Yes isn't it brilliant! It was a joy to watch the first two prequels before it, if they wern't star wars people would find it easier to enjoy them for the really good fantasy films that they are, then to kick into the classic trilogy after.I for one really like the changes and additions and am glad they have happened, and i like the connections with the prequel trilogy also. If any more deleted scenes or enhancements make their way in to any later releases that would make me very happy too.Some of the physics of the ewoks fighting and winning against the stormtroopers don't look quite right to the eye, and just mayby Jabba deserves a more spacious pad, given his notoriety and some of the cool pre-production sketches that were drawn. And light saber duals are always good, anymore footage of darth and luke going at it couldn't be bad.Star Wars will always be a favourite. The pictures look great, the music ques and effects sound great and the supplementary material is interesting also. One more thing, the acting. What's with people about the acting, if u don't like the films fine but to like the films and think the acting's bad, how does that work? Is it like an Ed Wood film of something? I especially think Mark Hamill's job as Luke is spot on, and he does a great job of carrying probably the main plot line.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AEFR1W52VXBRZ	Nilremwolf	But personally I can't see buying a whole new set unless the special features are what draws you to it.I'm an old Star Wars fan.  I still have my 20 year old VideoDisc player, which works (for those who remember them) and have the original trilogy which I still watch time to time.  Color and sound are still terrific, even flipping them over halfway through, and changing discs, but you'd not expect less from the first precursor to today's DVDs.Like many, I got the Special Editions on VHS when they came out, and some of the changes were welcome, some weren't.But no movie and update is going to be perfect.  It's personal choice.  I'd take the trilogy as a gift when the original versions come out on DVD, but I won't buy another set like this, not when there's so many versions out on tape and DVD already.I'd suggest getting this set if you haven't bought any of the movies in say, 10 years.  But if you're a longtime fan who's kept up your library of Star Wars, unless the Special features is enough for you to plunk down the extra, it'll just be another set gathering dust on the shelf, like my three different sets, two VHS, one Videodisc.Ahhh, now to just look forward to the full Sextet releases in a couple years.  the Original Sextet, the Special Edition Sextet, the Definitive Sextet, and the I Can't Do Anything More To These So We'll Throw Everything Into the Set SetGotta admit, as much fun as the original Trilogy was. . . they know how to run a cash cow.	3.0	If you don't already own them, it's one thing . . .	2004-11-14	11	11	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A37EWN5SS67OOA	Nimrod	"The Star Wars Saga was a breakthrough in the science fiction movies. It is an imprtant series that should be learned, or at least mentioned, in cinema academies. However, it's not really a good movie. When the movies came out, the then breathtaking special effects had covered on its weaknesses. Today, when these effects are no longer unique, one can see more clearly the weaknesses of the series. The plot is generally OK though kind of weak and sometimes boring and pathetic, such as The Toy-Beaver like Alliens in ""Return of the Jedi"", at least, if you do something like that, after making millions in 2 movies- Get  better costumes! The actors are pretty good, not great, but ok, and the general idea is good.Anyway, why 4 stars? Well, it is a classic, and as a breakthrougher it disorves some honor. It has some ideas that turned into cultural icons and even a religion, lately. The immortal Yoda (Though it could've been made better, I mean, what's with that muppet?) and of course, every-kid's-dream: The lightsavors. It is a nice movie, that is generally fun.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	"Nearly 30 years ago in a galaxy far far away, wiz kid film maker George Lucas forever altered the cinematic landscape of science fiction with ""Star Wars.""  A memorizing fairytale, and by now legendary intergalactic epic by which all subsequent like-minded endeavors have had to live up to, ""Star Wars"" was the story of the son of a Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his quest to rid the galaxy of an evil empire helmed by Darth Vader. That Han Solo (Harrison Ford) slowly began to emerge as everyone's favorite heartthrob (particularly in ""The Empire Strikes Back"") didn't seem to hamper Lucas' initial story line - especially since Leila was actually Luke's sister and therefore definitely out as a love interest for the young and viral Jedi in training.  But I digress. With its strident overtones of son eclipsing father in ""The Return of the Jedi"" Lucas' saga in space fully realized the box office potential of trilogies. Buttressed by spellbinding special effects, script scenarios that seemed to improve in leaps and bounds with each new installment, and a near mythological following akin to ""Star Trekkies"" ""Star Wars became that rarified cinematic sensation; a marketing genius's wet dream. John William's masterful main title forever changed the musical landscape of movies for the better. One needs only to hear the first few bars of music to find instant connection with a film history steeped in great composers and their great compositions.""Star Wars"" also made George Lucas a very, very rich (if conflicted) man and gave him a cottage industry to fall back on during his less lucrative career in the late 80s and early 90s. That in recent times fans of the first three films in the series have expressed their overwhelming outrage at the director's need to insert new computer generated footage and ""update"" his films is a bone of contention well documented. Press releases from on high have used the logic that the films in totem belong to their creator. Hence, if the creator is dissatisfied with his work he has every right to go back and ""fix"" what he feels is inadequate. While no one can dispute that it was Lucas' initial genius that created the legacy, it does seem, at least to this reviewer, that Herr Director relinquished his own personal rights as to what is or isn't a good film after he bestowed his greatness on to the collective memory of the free world. After re-releases in the mid 90s the trilogy went into moratorium so that Lucas could produce the last three installments (actually the first three). Despite the overwhelming advancements in the film industry, none of Lucas' subsequent installments come anywhere close to recapturing the magic of the first trilogy.And now, at last, audiences finally get to see the reason why on DVD.  These new hi-def transfers are, in a word, mind-blowing. The image is pristine and exhibits a surreal amount of clarity, depth and fine detail. Film grain is practically non-existent for an image so smooth you'll swear you're in the same galaxy with Luke and Co. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Flesh tones are miraculously true to life. Blacks are deep and solid. The enhanced sequences in the film have a much more integrated feel to them than they did in theatres in the 90s.  Of the three films, Star Wars exhibits the most improvement in video quality. ""Return of the Jedi"" in direct comparison seems a tad weak, particularly in the scenes on Endor in which the forest foliage has a decidedly muddy and touch too grainy feel to it. (Aside: the image is still astounding compared to anything you've likely seen before. Compression artifacts are present but do not distract. There's no hint of edge enhancement or pixelization. The audio for all three films has been cleaned up considerably. Though all three soundtracks are decidedly the product of outdated sound equipment they are remarkably engaging for films of their vintage and will surely NOT disappoint.Apart from the audio commentaries for each film this collection comes with an extra disc loaded with bonus footage. There are vintage documentaries, new featurettes and a host of deleted scenes and outtakes to choose from. But if you're like this reviewer, ultimately these are mere icing on the cake.

Indeed, the issue is not whether Darth Lucash may or may not (yet again) make changes to Episodes 4, 5, and 6. Yes, they are his creations and his properties; he may do with them as he wishes. Yet he does have at least an ethical obligation to disclose the fact that they are different from the previously released versions and not pass them off as the same - as shown by the line &quot;Own the Original&quot;. After all, the disclaimer is the standard industry practice adopted by everyone else, including his colleague Steven Spielberg, who clearly states that his &quot;E.T.:Special Edition&quot; is different from the original &quot;E.T.&quot; and unlike Lucash makes both &quot;E.T.&quot; versions available on DVD.	1.0	Side of Deceit versus Side of Disclosure	2005-06-09	20	9	11
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2IU9TYLUCRN0E	N. Lucius	"These latest scene changes are the final proof that George Lucas has lost his mind, however they are NOT the main reason why I just cancelled my blu-ray pre-order. I had been excitedly counting down the days until this release, but this time George/Lucasfilm has given the whole Star Wars community the middle finger by not correcting many of the problems (color) which plagued the 2004 release. This blu-ray has virtually all of the same issues as the DVD.  I'm talking about Vader's bubblegum pink lightsaber, the super high orange or purple explosions opposed to the more realistic white hot/yelow effects. These were especially noticable during the Battle of Yavin, Tantive IV shootout, and the carbon freezing chamber duel. They stuck out to the point to where they were almost distracting. After seeing the prequels, it's hard enough to still view Vader as that ultimate bad a** villian I feared in my childhood, but it's now near impossible to do it when he's chasing after Luke with a pink lightsaber.Lucasfilm has been made well aware of these issues thru complaints made by ticked off fans since the DVD launched 7 years ago. Now in the last year of hyping up of this Blu Ray release, Lucasfilm has assured us Star Wars fans that our complaints had been heard and addressed in this release,  the Blu-Ray would NOT have the same color and audio problems as the dvd's, they went back to the original negatives and spent 3 years fixing these particular problems, they manually went thru frame by frame in the problem scenes fixing and making other color corrections to bring them close again to the original theatrical versions.Heck Starwars.com displays a screenshot of Luke's fixed blue lightsaber on the Millenium Falcon in ANH, boasting about how they went back and fixed these problems. I have seen the Blu-Rays myself and I can confirm this is NOT the case!! Yes it is fixed for that particular frame and a few other frames, but the next shot of the same scene his lightsaber shifts back to green, just like in the screwed up dvd release, then goes to bright white, then back to a very pale blue color. Yes they fixed ONLY a small portion of that scene, left the rest of it untouched with the wrong color, while implying that the whole thing has been corrected. The lightsaber scenes in the other movies, Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, are practically UNTOUCHED WITH THE SAME color and timing problems that the DVD's have. It's like Lucasfilm is only willing to put in a half a** effort in anything they release anymore.... and why not?? If it says Star Wars on the box it's going to sell.Now for the changed scenes:A New Hope- When R2-D2 hides in the shallow cave from the Sand People, there have been CGI rocks added in. The new rocks now cover up half of R2's body which makes him hidden better. However when he leaves a few seconds later, he just pulls forward and the rocks simply disappear!! Did they just forget to alter that scene too?- Obi-Wan's introduction, he scares the Sand People away with a Krayt dragon call, has been redone again and now sounds like a jr. high kid making funny noises in Windows sound recorder. When I first heard it I thought no way, it's someone pulling a joke. It's sounds so bad and is so out of place, they made absolutely no effort to mix it in at all. You'll just have to hear it for yourselves... but sadly it's real. Unbelievable- Greedo still shoots first. It is alot better than the DVD version.Empire Strikes Back- Wampa's arm in fixed. Looks good about time.Return of the Jedi- Jabba's Palace has a bigger door... ok?- New CGI alien walking around in Jabba's palace as everyone sleeps. Poorly done and sticks out worse than a sore thumb... looks like Sebulba from Episode I?- Ewok's now have CGI eyelids, blink, and sometimes make a clicking noise when they do. (maybe a tribute to Muppets/Fraggle Rock?)- Darth Vader now screams ""Noooooooooooo"" as he picks up and throws the emperor, much like the way he does at the end of Episode III.... now twice!! This  ruins a great and one of my favorite scenes. It's bad. The voice doesn't even sound like Vader's and it's just lazily pasted over the rest of the audio.  Lucasfilm didn't make the effort to blend in at all..... what are they thinking????? If you really feel you need to add something like that, at least attempt a decent job.This has just gotten laughingly ridiculous. There is no excuse this time for ignoring what the fans want and taking away more of the original magic the movies had back in the 70's and 80's. Besides the deleted scenes, this is not a quality release. I've cancelled my pre-order and I'm done with anything new to do with Star Wars. This includes the new upcoming 3d versions which will no doubt have even more stupid changes and conveniently opens the door for yet another Blu-Ray release. I have my unaltered copies on my bonus DVD and that's all I need.I urge anyone who feels the same way to NOT fill the pockets of George Lucas anymore!! I don't understand how they think it's necessary tinker with new stupid voiceovers and Ewok eyes, but not fix the more obvious and distracting problems of this and the previous release. All the while Lucasfilm insinuated, just as recently as last week, that they had indeed corrected those problems..... THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING!! They also claimed to have exhaustively sent this set thru 3 levels of quality control which is either another lie or Lucas has the most elite team of a** kissers ever assembled. I've defended the first two prequels, the Special Editions, and George Lucas himself over the years, but I'm done. For the first time in 25 years they will not be getting another dime of my money."	1.0	"So this is how Star Wars dies.... with a thunderous ""NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"""	2011-08-31	34	29	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3JK31X6A5AIS3	noel	"The first time George Lucas made changes to the ""original"" Episodes IIII, V, and VI, well, fine. That move could be explained as fixing the flaws and faults of the movies that arguably came out ahead of their own time, when the cinematic technology was not quite able to properly present His vision of an epic struggle between Good and Evil. For the record, this reviewer, unlike some diehard purists, liked the changes except the face-off between Han Solo and Greedo in ""A New Hope"" and perhaps the musical score at the very end of ""Return of the Jedi"".Having said all this, the changes made for the DVD Trilogy Edition seem to have been done for the sake of making more changes, not to mention making mockery of His proclamation that the 1997 Special Editions are ""the definitive vision"". Indeed, this latest whatever is analygous with people who undergo cosmetic surgeries as a matter of obsession and addiction. Also, it is as though Lord Lucas is actually ashamed of having cast Clive Revill as the Emperor in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and Sabestian Shaw as the elderly Anakin Skywalker in ""The Return of the Jedi"" and so on and so forth. Defenders of Lord Lucas might say that He made these switches for the sake of ""continuity"" between the Original and Prequel Trilogies, not to mention perfection. So What? These movies already lack in it anyway.Exhibit A: While Anakin has aged considerably between I and II (note the casting change from Jake Lloyd to what's-his name!) Padme has not aged one bit (maybe she was frozen in carbonite during all that time!).Exhibit B: In II, Owen Lars evidently has had possession of C-3PO for quite awhile by the time he first meets Anakin. In IIII, though, he has no clue whatsoever who/what he is (maybe he had all his memories from II wiped out!).It is sincerely hoped that, as the movies that were originally filmed in B&W; are now routinely available in both Original and Colourised Versions, the Original Trilogy would continue to be available in ALL THREE versions: Original, Special, and the most recent Special - Special Editions. Now that would be a fantastical service to any and all who even casually care about this one-of-a-kind space saga."	1.0	Perfection...or Shame?	2005-01-04	24	17	7

However, for those who use the word ""love"" in describing their affinity with these films, that day of shopping on Amazon will be bitter sweet.  The sad truth is the trilogy that is being released here in not the modern classic, not the cultural phenominon, not the childhood memory of millions of people who love them.  They are doctored, unauthentic, added-to and altered, shells of the great films that these ""Special Editions"" owe their success to.  It is a shameful reality that the original films are not being released along side these not-so-special editions.  George Lucas considers these editions the ""finished"" movies and does not intend to release the originals any more than he would consider releasing a ""rough cut"" of any other film.  He considers the original classics his works in progress, entirely overlooking their importance to people on a personal level, or the trilogy's contributions to film history as significant pieces of work from their original time period.  If Vincent Van Gogh were to rise from the grave and decide to paint a few more Iris's into his classic painting, would the world not miss the original?  It would make about as much sense as this impostor of a trilogy.  Will those who love these films buy the ""special editions"" anyway?  Yes.  Would they have rather had the originals? Probably.  Is a crying shame that George Lucas ignores the movie lovers to whom he owes his success?  Absolutely."	3.0	Tarnished Brilliance	2004-05-18	13	11	2

He threw his fans a bone in 2006 by releasing them individually on DVD with ""bonus"" discs containing transfers of the original cuts from the same source used to create the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set.  (I bought them individually, used, on Amazon so as not to give Lucas any more cash directly.)The first discs for the films contain the butchered 2004 versions.  I threw those in the garbage but I suppose that, if you wanted to, you could keep those around as drink coasters.  I keep the ""bonus"" discs with the non-anamorphic theatrical cuts safely stashed in my fire safe and I have an old 4:3 TV on which I can view them.  They won't look very good on a newer widescreen TV, as the image will not fill the screen completely.The criticism that the 2008 bare-bones, cash-grab release set gets is well deserved, but it sure is better than the more recent Blu-Ray release, which has even more pointless alterations and no original cuts included.  I recommend buying DVDs including the original cuts used.  Make sure you get either the individual releases from 2006 or the box set from 2008.  Those are the ones that include the original versions.  The rest of the DVD and Blu-Ray releases are Bantha fodder.Here's hoping that Disney, which now owns the Star Wars franchise, can give us a proper release of the original three films at some point down the line after Lucas dies.  (Sad that I have to say that, but it's true.)UPDATE (July 20, 2013):  I've just obtained the 1992 limited edition widescreen VHS box set and the image quality on the 2006/2008 ""bonus"" discs is only marginally better than the image quality of that release.  There is also a widescreen VHS release of the original versions from 1995.  The widescreen VHS releases of the original trilogy in its unaltered form from 1992 (ASIN: B0001KO9QA) and 1995 (ASIN: B009R97M3S) provide a good low cost alternative to the ridiculously overpriced 2006/2008 DVD release."	3.0	2008 DVD Set is the Best (Official) Release of the Original Trilogy Currently Available	2013-07-07	0	0	0

The word needs to get out that if the originals were fully restored from their nitrate negatives and presented letterboxed they would be beutiful. After all, we're talking about bright beutiful film, not a video game. The movies are supposed to look better than some ugly computer game based on it. As a matter of fact, why don't some of these rude people just play the game and give the movie to the people who truely apreciate and respect it. This is altering film, and it's like colorizing STEAMBOAT WILLY. As much as I respect Mr. Lucas for making the films in the first place I do find him a bit of a hypocrite. He was bashing the new colorized THREE STOOGES dvd yet he won't let people who love the original (which made the STAR WARS franchise famous in the first place) have what's so deserved.

In some ways it's because of Star Wars that grew to be able to trust my instincts and feelings. Sadly, George Lucas has become such a manipulative control freak over the years and the worst part is that he seems to believe every thing he says with little or no accountability.

I have not purchased this box set yet because I have some questions, anyone who can shed their SW knowledge on me it would be much appreciated. After a lot of internet research it seems there is no definitive answer as to which home video release is the best and most accurate to the original theatrical versions. It seems before the 1997 release of the special editions the home video releases were for the most part unaltered. Therefore any copy of SW that was made before 1997 should be unaltered to the untrained eye. So that said, if you can get a wide screen copy of SW that was made before 97 you should have a pretty accurate copy. Now comes the question of aspect ratio. There are wide screen laser discs of the trilogy available that were made before 97 (93 to be exact). Everyone says that this box set is a laser disc transfer but it is 4:3. However if you look at this: [...]this person is comparing the widescreen laser disc to the 2006 release of the theatrical versions. They both appear widescreen. So does that mean the 2006 version of the theatrical releases are the most accurate? It would seem if the 2006 are widescreen and theatrical then they would be the best of both worlds.

I own the Collector's Edition box set for laserdisc from 1993. Every frame of film was chemically cleaned for that one, and the sound remastered as well.The irony is is course, when the original trilogy was added to the DVD release a few years past, this what NOT the versions used, but something that looked like it came straight from a VHS tape.So all they need to do is to scan these prints and put them on a blu ray, because the more I read about the new 'aditions' to the movies, the more i cringe...	3.0	"Ruined by the increasingly amount of new ""features"""	2012-08-06	5	4	1

I've never seen a more clear example of falling in love with one's own footage.  With Lucas' refusal to release the original remastered theatre print editions, he is betraying the trust of an entire generation of people whose lives were shaped by these films.  The special edition changes them substantially.  There was a pleasant balance of slapstick in the original, and now ""A New Hope"" is uncomfortably brought down to the level of ""Return of the Jedi"" with additional cutsey animal/droid/human/hut antics. It's not the money, we all know it would make bank.  It's 100% Lucas' ego.  No, I'm sorry, I believe Lucas has no right to tamper with or hinder the release of this work; it has become far, far bigger than the man himself.  I look forward to independently produced (and of *necessity* pirated) DVD's of the cleaned up originals.  And if Lucas ever manages to escape the fog of megalomania, I'd be happy to pay him almost anything to never have to see Han step on Jabba's tail again.  Please please please!

For so many years, the film stayed inside my head and I wondered what ever became of it. Finally, it was on cable one night and I managed to see it all over again. Of course, being older, one is more likely to dismiss it as 'amateurish' but it really is a special kind of film. The premise deals with a lost book of the dead called the ""Necrominicon"" and how it suddenly affects a group of students out for a picnic in a backwoods forest. They encounter an eerie park ranger who wants the book back for his own sinister ends. Also included are plenty of monsters that are really quite good for the time and the budget involved. Take a look at the flying demon, even though you can see the wires on the wings, he's still pretty evil looking.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AV0C3YW0AEP13	Oymaprat	I agree with the review below mine, but it doesn't stop these movies being great. But these are like the Lord of the Rings in that they can't be watched over and over. Why? Because they're action movies with little comic relief (Han Solo) and you can only enjoy seing a Tie fighter blow up a couple of times. None the less, to the sensible people who only watch these movies once every 10-15 years these are classic exiting adventures.However, in all honesty, unless you really desperately want to see the special features, or don't have these movies already, keep the ones you have and treasure them-this edition isn't worth it. I've got the original vidio release versions, and have only watched them twice and love them.Essentially, it's just another version of a great film, but due to the fact that it doesn't stand to repeated watching, I give this a four star.I hope I've been of use...

But these few last years, reading many comments on Amazon about both the first trilogy and the yet unfinished second one, I can't stand fans who blame George Lucas for being what he is and for making what he makes.I consider the opinions of fans who say that THEY prefer the original trilogy to the special one.  Who can blame them?  But they don't express themselves in these words, on the contrary they blame George Lucas for making changes to what they think is THEIR movie.  Well I say : Star Wars is George Lucas's work, project, dream, movie and creation.  He does what he wants with it.  Who cares if Solo shoot first?  Solo is Lucas's character and he may decides what he wants him to do.Moreover, fans seem to prefer the movie as an artist's work rather than a story.  George Lucas intended to write a story first and believe me, Star Wars is a big one, very interesting (for me, at least).  I would be glad if fans were satisfied with a DVD version which would be the original one.  I would buy it myself, as well as the special one.  Anyway, it is possible Lucas will release one, because he is the kind of money-making man that cannot ignore a potentially lucrative affair like that.

They have to act at invisible objects which are later turned into CG creatures and effects.  Compare these conversations (Obi-Wan and the alien chef in Attack of the Clones, any conversation with Jar Jar, Obi-Wan's conversation with the clone-making aliens) with any scene from Lord of the Rings involving Gollum.  See the difference?  I've noticed that most people who say that the fans are 'whining' about the Sp Ed's also say that they were too young to have seen the originals.  That's the difference here:  we are watching our memories die.  They are different movies now.  Is 2001: A Space Oddesy a terrible movie because Kubrick didn't get to add new effects, or does Casablanca seem fake because the squibs of those days don't compare with today's stunt work, or is Rear Window 'out dated,' (by the way, if you dis these movies, then you are not a movie fan and you do not understand the storytelling proccess) or does Michaelangelo's David seem primitive compared to Henry Moore's works because it's older?  The answer to these questions is no, because they are established works of art and their creators display their prowess of the medium in each work.  The original, unaltered versions of Star Wars are just the same: they were film making at its finest.  Lucas had a very small budget for A New Hope and it became the standard to which every film maker tried to reach for the next 20 something years, in effects, story and appeal.  My point in mentioning the works of past artists is this:  You can't change your work after you've displayed it.  Anyone who has taken an art class understands this.  You only make it worse if you do.  So anyone who says the original versions of Star Wars aren't all they are cracked up to be, is too immature and unlearned to understand.---------BUT----------There is a commentary on each disk by Lucas, Carrie Fischer and sound effects man, Ben Burtt (If you've never heard Ben talking about his work, you're very unfortunate.  The man is a genius!)There is the feature called ""The Birth of the Lightsabre"" which should be very interesting.  Then there is all of the new footage that has never been seen by the public.  Then it is on DVD.  It could be priced a lot higher than forty dollars, but it's not.  I say that should make us, the die-hard Star Wars fans of the originals, who are very irate at the idea of the special editions, consider buying this set.  I know that we will be contributing to Lucas' promise to never release the originals by giving him money, but we can't take the chance that he might stick to his guns.  I know a boycot of this set sounds very romantic, but as I've mentioned above, there are too many people out there, too young to understand our outrage (and aren't going to be persuaded by us old farts), who are still going to buy the set (along with the old farts like myself who see the value in the extra features), giving Lucas enough money to keep him from needing to release the originals.  Maybe, in a few years, Lucas will change his mind.  Maybe he'll go ahead and spend three or four dollars, make a little three disk set, no extra this and that, no special package design, showcasing the original unaltered films on DVD and make a another two or three million off of it."	3.0	we are watching our memories die	2004-06-25	8	4	4

Connors ""eccentric"""	"Since the introduction of high-end DVD releases, the public has been anticipating the release of the original Star Wars trilogy. When it was finally released, I raced to pick it up. Popped it into my DVD player. When it was all over, my reaction was, ""That's it!?""George Lucas was quoted as claiming that he was holding off on the release of the trilogy on DVD because he wanted to do ""something special."" This was the biggest letdown since we first heard the word ""midichlorians."" (A word apparently having to do with computer-audio interfacing for a swimming pool.) ""Something special"" seems to mean ""when we can get the most money and advertise the most stuff."" It most certainly did not mean enhancements to the movies or bonus materials.""From Star Wars to Jedi"" and ""Star Wars: Behind the Magic"" both offered more in-depth and comprehensive insights into the making of the trilogy than these bonus features.Hard-core fans know that there were deleted scenes from each movie, none were included. There was, however, wonderful commercials for Episode 3 and all the great video games...which kind of blows the collector value of the set.To top it all off - and I know this is a tiny, insignificant detail except for the hard core fans - Jeremy Bulloch's voice for Boba Fett was replaced by Temuera Morrison...apparently to try to add some kind of continuity to the depressingly tragic prequels George has been pushing off on us.George set the bar really high, and has been failing to reach it ever since the recording of the famous ""Yub-Nub"" song at the end of ""Return of the Jedi.""

It's nice to finally get surround sound for these movies.

Store owners here do not care about street dates and put product on the shelves as soon as they get them.  Therefore, we often get DVD's about 1 to 2 weeks before they are available in North America.  We're talking Region 1 (North America)DVDs, not the Region 3 (Asia) ones.  (The Region 3 DVD was officially available today, September 17 at large stores such as HMV). Anyways, got the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs last week and finally watched them all including the supplement disc.  The picture and sound were superb.  I don't mind the special editions since they were done as per George Lucas' wishes.  Who are we to criticize what he does to HIS movies.  They are all minor changes to the background and add to the grandeur of his vision.  HOWEVER, there was one change that I did not like and it was only done to the DVD and not the theatrical release of the special editions.  In the final shot of Return of the Jedi when Obi Wan, Yoda and Anakin reappear, they replaced the guy playing Anakin with Hayden Christensen.  I thought that was sorta unnecessary (the other guy is still in the scene in the Death Star when Luke removes his mask).  I know it makes the contunuity with the first 3 films more coherent but it looks strange with this young guy standing with Alec Guinness and Yoda.  Other than that, the wait was worth it.I was also somewhat dissapointed with the short preview of Episode 3.  It dealt mainly with Hayden getting his own Darth Vader costume (yawn).  There is also a brief glimpse of E3 in the Lightsaber featurette.  Overall money well spent.  I know George Lucas doesn't need it but what they hey.	5.0	Hong Kong Viewer	2004-09-17	58	46	12

You see, what none of you can realise or even comprehend is that Biggs is still alive! You see, as the laser blast from Darth Vader's Tie Fighter hit Biggs' X-Wing, Biggs accidently hit the hyperdrive. This sent him roaring through space and perhaps even time... itself!

He and I have become great friends and we often sit around watching that wacky Britcom ""The Young Ones"" whilst drinking Jolt Soda and making prank phone calls to Dirk Benedict (you've gotta love Starbuck!). Biggs himslf has informed me that he wants the scenes with him and Luke early on in Episode IV to be put back in as well as having MY band, Vader Vader (like Duran Duran but... different!), playing in the Cantina scene. He also informed me that if the scenes with him and Luke were NOT put back in SOME ""Special Edition"" of Star Wars soon, that he would hire Kuzak, formerly of the Law Firm Of Leland, MacKenzie and Brackman to sue everyone on the staff of Lucasfilm Ltd. for breach of contract and hurt of feelings.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1FP4TZTSYST1S	Pat Tuttle	It's official: there are even more changes being done to the trilogy. Old Georgie's at the computers again, and this time his corrections are even more drastic than before. Nobody liked the changes made for the Special Edition 1997 release of Star Wars, and nobody's gonna like this one's either. Call it a Super Deluxe Temporary 2004 Limited Edition DVD Version 1.2 Star Wars, if you will. Whether or not fans appreciate this continuous tampering of the films, as well as having to buy release after release, is debatable. But who can appreciate the removal of Anakin Skywalker's ghost in Jedi in place of a younger Hayden Chrissomething's? Or replacing Boba Fett's voice in Empire with the Australian guy in the new one? Or (worst of all) including Naboo and the Gungans in the victory celebration, one of whom is compelled to exclaim &quot;Wesa free&quot;. I have seen the photos with my own eyes, and those compelled to disbelieve will be shocked come September. And Greedo still shoots first. Seriously. And since Lucas feels that every time he has a bright idea about the movie he can make the &quot;official&quot; change permanently, there will be no option to watch the original versions. Take it or leave it, this is the new Star Wars, and it's here to stay. Until George changes his mind again.	3.0	A Perfect Trilogy Spoiled	2004-07-29	19	15	4

Arguably, it's Lucas' prerogative as the emperor of this particular movie universe to revise his work, although whether he also has the prerogative of basically thumbing his nose at the purists is another matter. But it's not the fact that changes per se were made that bothers me; it's that too many of the revisions are so clumsily managed. The new material is visibly, and sometimes audibly, spliced in, and the seams show-whether it's cluttered and overlong new CGI effects shots that don't match up with what was filmed in 1977, small but nagging changes in the storyline, or additional dialogue that doesn't enhance our understanding of the story. A few of the emendations do represent minor improvements: e.g., the more turbulent motions of the Rebel and Imperial spacecraft in the Death Star shootout that concludes what is now known as ""Episode IV,"" and the substitution of the Imperial alphabet in any signage appearing throughout the trilogy. But from the viewpoint of an old-timer, Lucas apparently didn't know when to leave well enough alone, and the movies' rhythms are usually disrupted when either the circa-1997 ""Special Edition"" or the circa-2004 DVD changes are incorporated. The thought that Lucas has vetoed the idea of releasing the original versions on disc, and that we'll have to live with these ""rewrites,"" does leave a sour aftertaste.With that said, I don't believe in throwing out the baby with the bathwater: Lucas' fiddling has marred the original trilogy, not ruined it.  On the plus side, the movies look and sound terrific, thanks to painstaking digital remastering (one or two anomalies on the soundtrack of ""Episode 4"" notwithstanding). The disc-length documentary on the making of the original trilogy is a major bonus. And after all, we've been waiting years for this trilogy to be issued on DVD. Whether it's the original movies as first seen in theatres 25 years ago or the slightly compromised versions that comprise this DVD set, these remain touchstones of pop culture-and they're a blast to watch. Still, the original ""Star Wars"" fan base can be excused for wanting the option of seeing the trilogy as they first encountered it, and excused for thinking Mr. Star Wars is a wee bit arrogant in telling them, ""No, you can't have it."""	3.0	A bittersweet victory for the Rebel Alliance	2004-09-23	0	0	0

People who welcome these changes are part of the generation of fans who prefer movies that use a ""story"" to show off special effects rather than use effects to help tell the story. Yes, I know the meat of the story in this trilogy is very much in one piece.  However, who would want to see Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz be ""updated""?

I'm sure that I probably saw some Disney movie or something before I saw the ""Star Wars"" movies, but these are the movies that I actually remember seeing first, if only because of the impact they had on my imagination. That's what ""Star Wars"" is all about, after all. They are modern myths, told by one of the most imaginative storytellers of this century.These movies appeal to children on several different levels. First of all, the creatures and settings are fantastical (the best examples of ""science fiction"" we have). They are fun, with an action-packed storyline and memorable characters. And the imagery of ""good vs. evil"" has rarely been better shown.But then they also appeal to adults. Why is that? Because they are myth, they resonate with our minds and hearts no matter what age we are. The conflict of good vs. evil is not the only imagery we, as adults, can identify with. There are political storylines, and we are shown the eternal lesson of how power can corrupt. There are themes of redemption, family conflict and resolution, and the power of strong friendship. The roles of student and mentor are also examined from positive and negative angles.These movies never fail to entertain me, even after having seen them literally dozens of times. I grew up watching them on VHS, and now that they are on DVD, the picture and sound quality is absolutely amazing. The ""older"" movies look just as sharp as the ""new"" trilogy.What I cannot understand are some of the fans of this series. Not necessarily just ""Star Wars"", either, but Trekkies as well. Both ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" have explored ancient themes in the context of futuristic settings, and done that task exceptionally well. But those people who insist on going to the conventions and dressing like their favorite characters boggle my mind. These movies are ENTERTAINMENT, nothing more. Stop taking them so seriously. Stop living your life based on science fiction. And for goodness' sake, stop posting ""reviews"" of Episode III when the thing hasn't even come out yet. If you'd like to discuss rumors and trailers and spoilers, go to the websites devoted to such things. Please put REVIEWS on the review site.That's just a personal complaint.

The special features were lame, and let's be honest, who wanted to watch the entire Disc special where they lauded George Lucas as a genius? Such ego!  Sure, at the time, the special effects were fine and maybe it did INNOVATE a whole industry...but the whole ""concept"" of Star Wars isn't like Buddha's word of mouth, or anything.anyhew.  Back to the series itself.Empire Strikes Back is the best, then Star Wars: a New Hope;  Sadly, I'd have to add the Third Prequel before Return of the Jedi.  But, that's another tangent.A New Hope is a typical coming of age story, but at least it's believable and exciting.  The introductions of new 'technology', the first viewing of the Lightsabers and the talk of the 'Force'.... is still enthralling, for some reason.Without Harrison Ford, the movies would have dragged.  or the character Han Solo.  There is great chemistry between Ford, Hamil, and Fisher....making the characters work well together, as if they fought together for years.  The dialogue is snappy and funny.And the TRUE Saviors of the universe is of course, R-2 D-2,and Wedge Antilles! NOT Luke.Small qualms: It's funny, when Biggs, a long-time friend of Luke's gets blown to smithereens by Darth Vader, there is no reaction from Luke at all.  I guess he didn't have time to weep.....and, if the Empire was really that powerful, why the heck would they wish to construct a Death Star?Empire Strikes Back- the first viewing of everyone's favorite anti-Hero, Darth Vader!  I'm sure I can't say enough things about him that others haven't already said. So, I won't say it, suffice to say, he is the best all-time on screen villains. This, I will give credit to George Lucas.  And, of course James Earl Jones' voice was perfect casting.small qualms: Luke's scream could have been a little more convincing when he found out his dad was Vader.Return of the Jedi:  I did enjoy Luke's growth and self-confidence. And of course, the enticing Carrie Fisher!The bad: Ewoks. I do not believe for a second that they could defeat the Empire. Death Star two.  How cliche. Can it get more boring than this?Third, where the heck did all the Rebel ships come from?  Four: The Emperor.  He ruined the whole series for me.  HE also doesn't make any sense, and was totally unconvincing as a powerful villain. He looked like a moldy prune more than anything else.Dark lightning, the most powerful Force attack? please. Couldn't Lucas have invented something better than that?Five: JAbba the Hut just didn't scare me enough. He was less of a menacing gangster than a big fat worm.  Also, having Han walk over his tail made me laugh more than anything else.

And on the debate between the originals or the special editions. I am, personally, against the special editions. One reviewer has mentioned that the movies are George Lucas' works and that the fans have no right to criticize what he's done with them. I disagree, however. Because Star Wars is so close to so many people's hearts they are, in a way, the fan's movies. I have always said, don't fix what's not broken. Lucas has tried, and that's fine, because being only 16 the first time I saw Star Wars was the special edition in the theaters, but the true crime is trying to keep the original versions virtually unobtainable unless you want an aging dilapitaded copy on VHS.Anyway, Lucas, if your changing of originals was a way to get more money, trust me, you'd get a lot more money if you would just release the originals on DVD. Everyone that doesn't buy the special editions would buy those.	5.0	The Greatest Trilogy of All Time	2004-05-21	6	3	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1XA8XYBD7WHPQ	Peter Guerrera Jr	"Over twenty years ago, George Lucas created the StarWars trilogy and changed the way we thought of movies.  The saga was completely diffrent from the previous movies of its age as both special effects and story drove people to watch the films countless times in movie theaters over and over again.  These movies truely defined a generation of movie goers back then and are still classic films now.With the birth of the DVD format, fans were sending out countless requests to Lucasfilm for DVD versions of these films and after years of waiting, Lucasfilm has given in and will finally release the films on DVD.Most reviews I have seen on this website by ""fans"" has been completely and utterly annoying.  Some claim that Lucas just ""doesnt get it"" by altering his classic films.  Were they perfect the first time?  Of course, but that was over 20 years ago.  For those who argue that changing film history is wrong, throughout the course of film history films have seen slight alterations as the years passed with whole scenes being removed or changed.  ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick had most of the original ending changed after its first week at the box office, but fans who have seen the altered product feel that its better.  Those who argue that Lucas has ""raped"" their childhood memories by altering these films are just looking for reasons to dislike the man because they feel that the prequels havent measured up to thier name sakes. Hell, the film was changed as far back as as its original release as Han Solo's girlfriend Jenny was removed from the bar scene.In the end, the films are the same story you enjoyed.  A farm boy becomes a knight, a princess becomes a warrior, a rogue finds something to believe in, and a father finds redemption.  Lucas could put in Luke Skywalker cutting grass on Yavin before going off to do battle against the Deathstar and its still the same story.  Altering the lighting during a lightsaber battle....putting in another actor to replace one who was in the film a total of 1 minute....altering dilogue to help it better fit the prequels?  In the end, its your choice on if your going to pick up these DVDs, but to give the films a rating of 1 out of 5 stars because you dont like the changes, it makes you wonder if those same people are actual fans or just LOTR fans trying to trash the competition."	4.0	the classic saga revisited	2004-07-15	8	2	6

I bought this 4 pack dvd hoping to see great video but this is a total rip off. Episode IV is not the duplicate of the original theater release - for example - when Darth Vader enters the ship the princess inserts a disk in r2d2 and records whats going on and why she needs help - that's cut completely - and later on when Luke gets the droids and goes to play the message r2d2 says he has - instead of seeing the 70's version of a really neat 3d Hieroglyphic of the princess talking - its all cut out. You dont see it until Luke plays it for OB-One Kanobe and then you wonder what the connection is because you never saw when it was made and why.The story now has no real basis to grow on and relies on just visual effects. Five minutes into this I knew it was not worth it - unless you never saw it before. This is not worth the price for those who saw the original.I didn't bother watching the other dvd's in the 4 pack. I figured if they messed with the original, the rest were cut to ribbons too and they probably did it to make it fit to the DVD digital limits. I'll try the VHS format. At least I get to see the original full length version - even if the quality is lower.	1.0	Not the real thing	2004-09-30	35	18	17

I grew up with the originals, and they still satisfied and amazed me, much as many films in my childhood did. You don't need CGI or added effects to appease your dwindling fanbase, and it's been largely proven that children don't even care as much about this.What it comes down to is money, and Mr. Lucas is a legend of film. Why he can't give the series better treatment by preserving the original cinematic artwork is beyond me.Perhaps in a few more years, he'll have learned his lesson that abandoning fans is really not a good idea. Not like he cares...he's raised a whole new generation of fans who are more than happy with the prequels and the newly added effects.I just wish he'd stop taking a dump on the fans who made his career what it is.	1.0	"""I'm altering the deal.

Not since the release of The Beatles ""Let It Be...Naked"" CD have I seen such anguish, mixed emotion and gnashing of teeth over a re-released product..and mostly from those who've yet to see them!!What is the problem? This isn't a life or death situation..they're only movies..as many others have stated. I have my copy already..they sound & look magnificent. The changes make sense when tied into the overall scope of the whole Star Wars Saga. So it's young Anakin at the end overlaid, so what if Greedo shot first..who really gives a rats!! It doesn't change the overall feel or flow of the movies themselves. Besides they WERE George Lucas' brainchild after all..he can pretty much do what he wishes with them!! I can see the sense in those changes too given the release of Episodes I & II and the impending release of Episode III next year. The conspiracy theorists are out in force again but they're kidding themselves if they think these movies are ""ruined forever"". Sheesh!!With hindsight, there is some ""hokeyness"" present in some parts of IV & VI..things like the cutesy Ewoks and certain scenes in the Episode IV (the hug-fest in the garbage compactor, the 'Droids getting ""emotional""). That hokeyness is also present in Episode I (the Jar Jar Binks scenes, the ""kiddie"" scenes) & II (the Anakin-Padme romance) but at least it's consistent.  However that's part of the overall charm of the movies. Initially based on the structure of 1930's-50's action movie serials like Flash Gordon, we have the young initially-naive hero (Luke), the feisty heroine (Leia), the swashbuckling rascal (Han Solo) & loyal offsider (Chewbacca), cute funny characters (the Droids) and the wizard-like ex-warrior(Obi-wan) not to mention the supreme Villian (Darth Vader). Supported along the way with a host of other wierd and wonderful supporting characaters, these 3 movies are just pure, sheer escapism and lots of fun. I was 20 when I first saw ""Star wars"" on the big screen..the opening shots of the Imperial Star Cruiser filling the huge screen left a huge impression on me and my poor neck (I was watching it four rows from the front!!)  The films set a huge standard in science fiction film making that has just gone ahead in leaps and bounds since.Overall I'm glad it's on DVD finally..I can now preserve my 1997 Remastered VHS versions. This is a DVD set to enjoy. Forget the changes in the film..you'll barely notice them...just sit back, forget the rest of the world for about 6-7 hours and enjoy them..and don't forget torank up that amazing 5.1 sound!!"	5.0	THIS IS A TRILOGY TO ENJOY	2004-09-23	13	8	5

So, I hope that this might clarify issues that you might have.  A friend of mine keeps on harping about the big difference between widescreen and fullscreen.  My own ignorance had me assuming that big black bars on the top and bottom were annoying.  Also, I had to squint to see the details since everything was squished from the top and bottom.  Well, that's obviously wrong and you should check out some frames of widescreen vs. fullscreen on the internet.  Now with movies without the jaw-dropping views and scenes, there is not much that you are gaining with widescreen.  But, take the capture of Princess Leia's ship in ""New Hope"" or the Millenium Falcon chase in ""Empire Strikes Back"" on fullscreen.  The image that you are left with is basically a chopped off version of the original film to fit on your computer or TV screen.  If you keep the same film reel format in widescreen, then you will get the black bars on the top and bottom with the entire frame intacted.  So, if you feel that you can do without black bars, then go ahead and get the fullscreen.  Otherwise, get the widescreen to enjoy the trilogy which is the way it was in the movie theaters.The bonus disc could be a toss-up depending on how you view chipping in another ten bucks.  In my opinion, you might as well go ahead and spring for the extra disc.  The price of the trilogy is already over $40 dollars and you can't just buy the extra disk separately later.  Plus, you get alot more features in learning about how the film was made and some of ideas/thoughts from writers and visual/sound effects specialists at Lucas Films.  The simple 3 disc set without bonus disc was released just recently to attract buyers who didn't want to purchase such an expensive set.  Well, it's your decision but make a choice that you can look back without regret.  My favorite parts of the disc was the whole idea about how to create the character of Darth Vadar and his whole heavy breathing that we all remember quite vividly.  Also, who can't remember all those wonderful sounding lightsabers that whoosh when Luke or Obi-wan were swinging them.  Well, those people who created the effects and sounds talk about it.  Kinda interesting and you'll never see it on TV.The quality of all the films are first rate but my only gripe about the trilogy is the special edition treatment.  We get these silly additions of a digitally created Jabba the Hut and also scenes of Hayden as young Darth Vadar.  Taking a classic film and then getting a do-over is just ridiculous.  It's like having a writer say Mark Twain looking over Huck Finn and then going back to change bits and pieces on the plot of Huck and Jim.  It's done and finished so don't mess with it.  Art should be a finished form after it's done no need to keep on polishing it over.  You just ruin it for the future generation and people just get confused.  So, if you just ignore all those additional scenes from George Lucas (which goes for those who actually lived through the original 80's trilogy), then go ahead and purchase this.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A18DCNDAE1WZ5G	Phil Viglione	"I received the DVD trilogy as a Christmas gift, and immdiately (actually that night) watched Episode IV.  I must say, I wasn't very happy with the way it turned out and I almost didn't want to watch the others, even though I did.  IV was alright considering I had the VHS Fullscreen, now i can watch what's cut out in a full screen movie.  A few of the changes were good, for example Obi-Wan's and Vader's lightsabers have been completely revamped and look better than ever, but that's about the only good change I noticed in it.  Some strange changes i noticed but I do not know if it was the TV I used or what, but when Obi-Wan first appears scaring the sand-people, the cry is completely different than the original.  The last major change i saw in IV was the scene when the Falcon escapes the Death Star.  Luke and Han are shooting the TIEs.  In one scene a TIE is flying past the Falcon.  However I noticed the gray box around it indicating that it was obviously super-imposed in the picture (if you've ever seen National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, at the end when the sleigh is in the sky the box is there, then you know what i'm talking about.)  I don't know if that was from the TV i used or if it's really there. If someone would tell me if they noticed it also, that would be helpful.ESB had more changes that may have been for the worse.  The most obvious is the Emperor's hologram.  Another was Boba Fett's voice, and one other was when Luke loses his hand and falls, they took out the (ahhhh-ahhh-ahhhhhhh) noise of him yelling.ROTJ was the best of the three except for the end.  It seemed like instead of making a few minor changes, they made one major one big enough to ruin the movie.  They took out Sebastian Shaw and stuck Hayden Christianson (however its spelled) in at the final scene, and it really took away from the quality of the movie.  One other that wasn't too bad was an extra celebration scene from Naboo, it didn't really take away from the movie that much.In review, I feel Lucas could have done a better job with the ""Special"" Special Edition DVD and would highly recommend he re-do these movies for DVD again the way they were in 1997."	3.0	Not exactly happy...	2005-01-05	13	8	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A307LZV1TBCJJO	phimseto	"A friend of mine clued me into his pet term for the Star wars rerelease films, now reissued on video - the ""very special"" editions, as in the ""very special"" episodes of sitcoms or ""very special"" like Jason Biggs' trumpeteer is perceived to be in ""American Pie 2"".  In short, the original Star Wars films were reduced to treacle when, in their rerelease form, they could have garnered a new generation of fans.Let me qualify something here.  You are not a bigger Star Wars fan than I am, nor do I ""not get it"".  I was born in 1975.  My earliest Christmas pictures have me standing next to a Death Star toy with assorted characters and playsets strewn about.  I got Boba Fett, Yoda, and the Emperor in plain, small cardboard boxes via mail order.  I saw Star Wars in rerelease when I was four, saw Empire at the Ziegfield in NY when I was five, and was first in line for both ROTJ and TPM on their opening days.  In-between all that, add in the countless video games, comic collecting, book reading, and whatnot, it all adds up to one thing - I have a deep affection for the Star Wars franchise, but that doesn't mean a slavish devotion to George Lucas' decision-making.People say Lucas has a right to do whatever he wants with his original trilogy films.  This is incorrect.  Technically, as he owns them, he can do whatever he wishes.  However, especially fourteen years after the fact (1983-1997), the films have a cultural resonance and are beloved for what is in them.  Fundamentally changing them would be like DaVinci adjusting the smile on Mona Lisa's face or Shakespere deciding that Ophelia and Hamlet ride off into the sunset together.  There is a cultural point, that all artists usually have the good sense to recognize, when their art takes on a life of its own and is no longer simply theirs.George Lucas doesn't seem to get this.  So much of what he does in the Special Editions is strong - the tidying up of effects, the cleaning up of the negative and the sound, and even the addition of some scenes constitute a director's right to go back and try to make his film better.  What Lucas does, though, is go beyond this.  Whether by making Greedo shoot first, Luke scream after tossing himself into the void, adding Jedi Rocks while removing the original song, or even changing the end music and sequence for ROTJ, Lucas has done more than tweak the mechanics and flow of his film.  He has, instead, fundamentally altered our perception of events and of how we process and experence the films.  In short, he has taken something familiar and made it into something cold and alien.  There is no excuse for this.For a generation of inspired 20 and 30-somethings, along with their parents, Star Wars represented something familiar, something good, and something we wanted to be associated with.  The '97 rerelease, represented here in this collection instead left us feeling unwelcome, as if Lucasfilm decided we had lived out our usefulness and was moving onto a new audience, one that had to have Vader's return to his ship at the end of ESB explained and shown step by step.  Very special, indeed.While there are aspects of the special editions that are good, the negatives far outweigh the positives and it pains me to say that this Star Wars collection is not worth having over the original versions.  You would be better off finding those or getting copies of them than you would owning and watching the special editions."	2.0	"""Very Special"" Editions Only Serve To Portend Jar Jar Binks"	2002-05-14	27	14	13
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ALWB64XOXNMDP	Picardfan007	I can remember when I saw this movie in the theater for the first time when I was thirteen. It was as if someone out there knew for the first time that SF could be intellegently for the big screen. The documentary DVD sheds a lot of light on how the movies were made. Surprisingly all the execs thought this would be a dismal failure. George Lucas was not the great director everyone thought he was while making the film.  He almost suffered a heart attack due to the pressue.I was surprised to discover that he tried to purchase the rights to Star Trek and Flash Gordon before going out on his own to write his own saga. I wonder what he would have done with Star Trek?!!It's amazing to know that Hollywood placed a fine on him for not having the credits roll until the end of the film.  No wonder he opened his own studio! Despite all his box office success he was still treated poorly by the people that helped him put up the capital for this film.	5.0	The best saga of all time	2004-09-22	13	9	4

YO YO YO WASSSSUUUPPPP!  I can see why they're so dazzled by Lucas' tricks and chicanery when their heroes are people like Pauley Shore and Eminem, UGH!  I was born well after the cancellation of the original Star Trek series, and thus never saw it during its prime but was still able to grasp the importance of the drama, theatrics and nuance of the show.  Anyone will tell you that the visuals are not what made the show great, even though they were revolutionary for the time, it was the story that gripped people from week to week and caused the cultural phenomenon that we now have today.  It didn't matter that they used Styrofoam cups or that every alien looked oddly human or that Scotty could single-handedly reverse the laws of physics with the snap of his fingers, it was all about quality acting and storytelling (well quality storytelling anyway).I'm sure you all get my drift but for the brain-dead, generation zero, robots out there, I'll have to elaborate.  Star Wars = Good.  Phantom Menace = Bad.  Original, untouched trilogy = Good.  Perverted, warped Special Edition = Bad.  Hitler = Bad.  George W. Bush = Worse.  Thus ends the lessen.I just saw a commercial for Skittles, look at all the pretty colors, and have been subliminally commanded to run out and buy, buy, buy (blank stare).

If he does not feel satisfied with the originals, and wants to alter the films to conform to his concept(s), I have no problem with it.  In point of fact, I find that the films have all benefited from some much needed tinkering.  I realise that there are a host of dedicated fans that want the originals as they were, and I don't slight them for feeling ""cheated"". It would have been more considerate of Mr. Lucas to give those fans the option of purchasing those originals, just as he did when the Star Wars Trilogy was remastered and released on VHS.

Of course, it's not Blu-Ray quality, but as far as DVDs go, it's fantastic.  The sound is crisp, clear, and lots of fun when piped through a surround system.George Lucas revisited the original films and added some new CGI effects that help achieve his original vision that because of technical and budget limitations were not available when he first made the movies.  The updates are minor, comprising less than 5 minutes of added footage, and don't change the overall look/feel/story.  Some fans love the updates, some don't like their Star Wars tampered with.  Whatever camp you're in, just be aware that the films presented here are the ""updated"" versions.The real treat of owning this box set is the documentary, ""Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy"".  Over two-and-a-half compelling hours, the viewer becomes aware of the sweat and tears George Lucas exuded in order to have his vision put on film.  In and of itself, it's an amazing story and one worth watching.  It will only increase your respect for this remarkable run of film making.

I was at just the right age when it came out, to be totally blown away by the effects, storyline and the whole experience. I had the original release on VHS, and later got the digital enhanced version on VHS. Now - this set gives me a more permanent copy of the 3 movies, plus a whole DVD of background and an hour long show putting the whole phenomena in historical context. That's most likely my favorite part - as it more than anything else, takes me back to my childhood.Why only 4 stars then? Well - because this is the ""new"" version of Starwars - not the old and original one. I know George Lucas didn't like the original version completely - but that's the version I fell inlove with. When the original digitized version was first done, I remember the documentaries showing the difference. What's left is scenes with too much digitization - it takes away from the story, and looks like it's just there to show off.I would have apprechiated a documentary about the digitization too (at the very least) and the option of playing the original version without the addons.As you've noticed - I'm not describing the movies themselves. They are self-evident the best story ever told on the big silver screen. No doubt. It wasn't the technology or the special effects alone. It was the full and complete combination of a great story told perfectly. Of course it looks a bit crude with todays eyes - but that just makes it even more important and more interesting to learn about. And to keep for future references.The Trilogy is a documentary of a milestone in moviemaking. Any sci-fy buff out there (like me) should definately own this.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	The original Star Wars trilogy is among the most watched and beloved film series in movie history.  The films have moved past being mere movies into cultural icons.  What other movies could spark such a heated debate over enhancements and updates as these films have done.  Internet sites have been set up specifically to discuss the changes.  Some of the changes work in the film (the new Jabba is much more realistic looking), while some are completely ridiculous especially the insertion of Hayden Christensen in Return Of The Jedi. One wish would have been for George Lucas to do what his good friend Steven Spielberg did with E.T., release two versions of each film, one in its original release and the other in the updated release.  That being said, the films look outstanding in their DVD presentation.  The films are one of the last handful of classic films to see their release on DVD and they are welcome in any version.  The bonus disk is outstanding and the two and half documentary, Empire Of Dreams is superb unto itself.  The changes to the films are merely superficial, the true heart of the stories remain intact.  It is the struggle of the Rebel forces to overcome the evil Empire that keeps you interested and that remains undiluted.	5.0	Still Great After All These Years	2004-10-21	9	6	3

I was hoping I wouldn't feel let down by the changes Mr. Lucas made to his films. I didn't mind the visual enhancements, but some of the added scenes messed up these classics. The pacing in the movies was pretty clean and crisp before they were turned into ""Special Editions"", now the movies seem to drag a bit.Special Editions are fine, but I'd love to own the originals in Widescreen DVD format. Coke came back as Coke Classic and New Coke was allowed to continue until New Coke died due to a lack of sales. Why can't we have a Star Wars Classic DVD pack being sold in edition to the Special Edition pack? I say let the fans decide which one they want.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2VN986E5KR1NV	ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen)	"At long last, what movie fans have been waiting for!  This definitive widescreen DVD edition of the ""original"" STAR WARS trilogy (aka Episodes IV-V-VI) is a feast for the senses.  Though some may quibble with George Lucas' tweaking of the theatrical versions, what we have here is the complete vision of the Director:  STAR WARS as he meant to make it all along.  The characters here are so iconic, it's easy to forget that some critics have heaped scorn on the ability of various actors, on the dialog, and on the direction.  Not to worry...those critics are misguided and wallowing in their own cynicism.  This DVD set captures afresh the wide-eyed wonderment of Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, the world-weary swagger of Harrison Ford's Han Solo, the cool elan of Sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi, the brave-yet-vulnerable beauty of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and the brave ferocity of...the Ewoks?  Well, OK, there are a couple of weaker points in this saga, but overall, it's a potent epic filled with many cinematic archetypes...the light saber battles, the father-son dynamics, the dizzying space travel, the cosmic spirituality, the comic monsters and the deadly mutants, the Gary Cooperesque sense of Western High Noonism, and...the Ewoks?  Well, heck, even the Ewoks grew on me after the third or fourth viewing. The three individual films look and sound fantastic technically, and there are extras galore...the overall package is as lavish as one could want.  Let's face it:  STAR WARS and a small handfull of other films are why we wanted the DVD format in the first place.  And now...it's finally here."	5.0	You know you want it....	2004-09-27	12	6	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A16QQPNW15W13B	ProphetPlanetside	"First off, the movies do look good.  Of course now the blu-rays look better, but these are good-looking DVDs.  The movies are unfortunately not the theatrical versions that we all know and love.  Star Wars (A New Hope) has the CGI Jabba scene which I thought was totally unnecessary, AND the scene where Greedo shoots first.  That scene looks VERY BAD in this DVD.  As far as Empire Strikes Back, I wasn't that upset with too much, the only noticeable change for me was adding in Ian McDiarmid to act as the hologram emperor (a change I like).  Finally, Return of the Jedi adds in some ""cool"" things towards the end of the movie, where it shows people celebrating the end of the empire on Coruscant and Naboo.  And we get to see Hayden Christensen as Anakin's ghost at the end... YAY.  If you want to see the original versions watch them on vhs, that's what I do (there are also the limited edition DVDs with the theatrical laserdisc non-anamorphic transfers on it which apparently look similar to vhs quality anyway).  If for some reason you like the special edition add-ons plus these new DVD release updates (everyone has their own opinions) then this is a good set if you can get it used at a good price.  Better yet, if you want to hear Darth Vader say ""NO... NOOOOOOOOO"" then just buy the blu-ray set."	3.0	Special editions with new updates from Lucas!	2012-08-09	1	1	0

What a silly, pretentious review.  Sayles, Fellini, Goddard are great, but to compare the tone and subject matter of Starwars to Cries and Whispers, for example, is completely missing the point.Starwars is GL's ode to Saturday matinees, flash gordon, and swashbuckling rogues w/ touches of myth, samurai warrior code and spaghetti westerns.NEWSFLASH:  movies are ALSO about having fun.  No films better represent the sheer exhilaration, wonderment and escapism of what movies are all about than the original starwars trilogy.RE: Edits to the trilogyIf the reviews on Amazon are any indication, many die-hard SW fans are outraged by the alterations GL has made post-release.  While I sympathize w/ this viewpoint to some degree, I don't think the changes are significant enough to warrant the outrage.  Most of the changes are cosmetic (having little to do w/ the characters and grand scope of the story) and according to GL, would have been included in the original if not for the technical and logistical limitations.The optimal solution would have been a release of the original movies along w/ the changes as extras on the DVD.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A46ZOT4KO5SMV	Puggo	"In 1978, Star Wars was nominated for 10 academy awards (including best picture, best screenplay, best supporting actor, etc.) ultimately winning 7 including awards for editing, sound mixing, and special effects. The AFI lists ""Star Wars"" as #15 on its list of all time greatest films. Make no mistake, this isn't just a fun romp, it is a very significant and important film.Understand that the version in this box set is NOT that version, but a version that has been largely painted over with 21st century computer graphics, does NOT include the academy-award-winning sound mix, and with many different and more recent editing decisions. On this version, the effects and edits you see may be from 1977, or they might be from 1997, or maybe 2004, or maybe 2011... they might be the original academy-award-winning animatronics of Stears Dykstra, Edlund, and McCune that have never been equaled, or they might have been replaced by dated-looking 1990s computer-graphics, or they might be new things that were thrown in a couple of months ago. The choice of scenes and editing of those scenes might be the academy-awarding winning ones made by Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas, or they might be newer ones made by people who are preparing the movie for future 3D-a-rama. The glorious academy-award-winning sound mix by MacDougall, West, Minkler and Ballhas remains unavailable and has been replaced here by a completely different, over-compressed one that is unlikely to have won an academy award in 1978, let alone today, and wherein the young remixer even inserted his own voice.In short, this release not only fails utterly to preserve a major artifact of our cinematic heritage, it goes further in that its producer has made it clear that he will never allow that seminal work to be accurately preserved. This is not simply a bad product, it is a serious blow to art history and to our popular cultural heritage."	1.0	cinematic history and this set	2011-09-03	16	13	3

There was nothing written on the box to confirm that though, so I was naturally skeptical.  I came here to check it out and I was right.  Same Special Edition set that was released just recently, only without the bonus disc.  Lame Lame Lame.  In fact I looked around for the other set and it was marked down to the same price as this one.  Crazy.  Makes no sense at all to the fans to even consider buying this.

Well, if you have done your research you will discover that these are probably (they're not out yet) the exact same discs as last years set without the 4th bonus disc. Its the holiday season right? People are buying gifts now so it would be safe to assume that this 'plain' set will mainly be bought as a gift so that you save money by buying this cheaper set to give away. On the other hand this set does seems a bit pointless, why not spend that little bit extra to get the extra bonus disc?If people think Lucas is being greedy then what about the Sin City DVD? That one came out in the summer with 1 crappy featurette only as the studio knew it would bring out a multi-disc version in a few months time to get more money from impatient sheep. Unless you got caught out I have no pity for people who foolishly and knowingly gave their money to the greedy, corporate, fat cats. At least Lucas is doing it the other way round, he's releasing this plain version over 1 year after the 'definitive' set and so giving customers a choice.As for this set I was hoping it would be the original versions that came out last century (that sounds old!) but they're not. Actually I reckon last years set should have come with 3 versions of each film rather than one. The other 2 would be the original theatrical versions and the 1997(?) special editions that I actually prefer.

I am not looking for new special effects, I don't care if they have been altered, I don't need HD or BluRay quality and I am not looking for anything new; what I am looking for is the pleasant and exciting return to the days of my youth when Star Wars was magic.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	A long time ago, in 1977, George Lucas and his team of creative artists presented the world with the most successful, most popular and most imaginative work of science fiction ever to grace the screen- Star Wars. Originally a six part saga, Lucas decided to begin with the last installments (episodes 4,5 and 6). EPISODE 4: A NEW HOPE introduced the characters that have been a part of American culture for more than twenty years- the adventurous, pure-hearted Luke Skywalker, the mercenary but loveable Han Solo, the elegant Princess Leia, the wise Zen master Obi Won Kenobi and the evil, black-clad Darth Vader.Although to many intellectuals, Star Wars appears to be trivial fantasy, with flat, underdeveloped characters and razzle-dazzle special effects in a story without any meaning, there is more to Star Wars than meets the eye. Interviews with George Lucas have proven that he suffused the story with symbolism and classic aspects of mythology. In one level, it is a coming-of-age story and in another a saga of good versus evil. Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), an orphan without knowledge of who his father was, has lost his aunt and uncle in the hands of the overpowering military of the Empire. Obi Won Kenobi, a former pilot, guides him in the Zen way of the Force- a mysterious, spiritual cosmic force. A message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) via the robotic R2D2 and C3PO sends Luke and his friends on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped princess who is in the hands of the evil lord Darth Vader.Their journey takes them to a wild tavern (Mos Eisley) where alien outlaws gather for drinks. Here they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who assists them on their mission by providing his ship the Millenium Falcon. The hairy, ape-dog hybrid Chewbacca is his sidekick. Although Princess Leia is saved and the powerful space station Death Star destroyed, the seemingly happy ending to this first film hides an ill omen- Darth Vader is not defeated.The special effects are striking, particularily on DVD, and the sound, the cinematography and the scenes that were cut due to time (such as Han Solo meeting with the alien mob lord Jabba The Hut) are included. George Lucas's masterpiece is at its finest.	5.0	A Galaxy Far Away Is Closer On DVD	2003-03-20	3	0	3

George Lucas seems to believe that poorly done CGI makes for compelling viewing.  I had read that there were only a few ""minor"" changes in this DVD set, a claim that is completely false.  Entire scenes with dancing CGI characters have been added (like the end of ""Jedi""), and the background music in many of the scenes has been changed.  Particularly offensive is a scene in ""Jedi"" where the seedy lounge singer in Jabba the Hutt's place has been replaced by a ""wacky"" animated version straight out of Disney.  Puh-lease.  These versions make me yearn for our old copies taped off of HBO.  The bonus DVD is interesting, but the extensive reworkings of the original movies make this purchase a waste of money.

No, I don't necessarily think that putting Hayden Christensen in Jedi was the worst thing he could have done...before you ""BOO!  HISS!"" me, think about it...what was the last face Anakin wore just before he came to be Darth Vader?  He didn't look like Sebastian Shaw, he looked like Hayden Christensen.  I think there's a certain logic to it, wherein they revert to the way they were at their strongest point of being Jedi, and where was Anakin the strongest but at the end, just before he became Darth Vader?  I know hardcore fans won't necessarily agree, but I can see why they did it that way....Obi-Wan was strongest with the force just before Darth Vader struck him down, and Yoda...well, Yoda looks like Yoda.

I can watch this movie over and over, and it is still entertaining every time even after all these years.It's true that the acting in this movie is pretty bad by the likes Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, but Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing, and James Earl Jones give superb performances IMO.I'm one who prefers the Special Edition release vs. the old version, but I hope Lucas will release both on DVD.	4.0	still the most convincing star wars movie	2002-09-30	6	1	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A17WM7FBBF26KR	Randlev	Getting ready for the upcoming trilogy DVD, I've done some research and read lots of opinions on George's changes to all of HIS films.  And I think that we won't even see all the reasons for these changes or be able to appreciate them until May 2005.  See, whether anyone likes it or not, the Star Wars saga is now going to be made up of 6 Films, just like George initially intended.  Six movies in the saga, not three.  If George wants his saga to have a little continuity, then why fight the artist?  And I have faith that watching Revenge of the Sith next May, we'll all be worshipping the almighty George Lucas again.  I have faith that all of George's changes to the original trilogy will make sense (even Hayden in ROTJ) and we might all have a little more respect for...(gasp)...Episodes I and II.  Yep, the world will be a pretty awesome place for Star Wars fans in the coming months.	5.0	give him a chance	2004-09-11	14	4	10
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2FQQANPO52G7Q	Randy Price	"I must admit that I was impressed with the changes made to the original Special Edition (which I hated).In this revamped version,- Greedo still gets a shot off at Han in the Cantina, but they shoot simultaneously (rather than Greedo shooting first and missing at point-blank range).- Jabba meets Han in the Mos Eisley hangar bay, but the CGI is superior to the original SE (here, they used the CGI for him from Phantom Menace). Instead of yelping when Han steps on his tail, he growls and bristles while flexing his arms. Although, he still should have wiped the hangar bay with Han's @$$ IMO, the changes make him appear to be less of a wimp than what we saw in '97.- The holographic meeting between Vader and Palpatine in Empire has been completely redone. The dialogue is much better than the original (which I always thought sounded lame and made the Emperor appear weaker than the character we see in Jedi). The holo-Palpatine was also given a make-over. This time, we see Darth Sidious' cowled visage from Episodes I and II instead of the bulging-eyesocket-almost-looks-alien crappy makeup job from the original film.- Boba Fett's spoken lines are now voiced by the actor who played Jango Fett in AotC.- Luke no longer yodels ""AIEEEeeee!"" as he falls to his supposed death from the Bespin platform following his duel with Vader.- The CGI has been touched up in Jedi with Luke's scene with the Rancor. The ""outlines"" (between the beast's legs and hands) have been removed so that the Rancor scene is more believable. Also, a splash of sand goes up in the air as the monster's left hand collapses limply to the ground.- The CGI yellow overlay over the Emperor's eyes was touched up so that only his pupils are yellowed (rather than the entire eye/jowl area).- Hayden Christensen was CGI'd in as the spectral Anakin that Luke sees standing beside Obi-Wan and Yoda, which fits as this younger Anakin is how he appeared prior to his fall to the Dark Side (in the latter half of Episode III). After he redeemed himself, it makes sense that THAT is how his 'residual self-image' (to borrow a phrase from The Matrix) would appear.- the art from the original movie posters appears on each DVD respectively.In fact, the only change that was leftover from the original SE that I dislike is when Luke remarks, ""You're lucky you got out of there"" when R2 is spit out of whatever swamp beastie that swallows him. In the original version of Empire, Luke says, ""You're lucky you don't taste very good."" I thought that was much funnier than the line they went with in SE, but that's small enough to be overlooked in the grand scheme of things."	4.0	welcome changes to the original Special Edition	2004-11-09	20	17	3

Other reviews here tell you of the changes they had. The Greedo scene is still in this, which I began disliking like a year ago, but it's not a big deal. It's not like your whole vision of Han Solo was altered, because anyway, we each take characters in however we want to. Hayden was added to the end scene as part of the Jedi Trinity, as I call it: Anakin, Yoda, and Obi Wan, to forever take care of Luke and watch over him as he reforms the Jedi Order and the peace in the Republic. I gotta say, adding Hayden was a huge thing for me, because now that scene is much more emotional in my point of view, specially after experiencing episode 3. These are awesome films, and you still can see that here. Many people believe Lucas should stop adding stuff and respect the public that ""made"" him, but I don't believe that. They are his films, and as the author he can do whatever he wants. In a book is much simpler and understandable, but in a movie it is tricky business, but the excitement of seeing Star Wars will never be changed. When the whole saga on DVD comes out this will be obsolete, but a fan with a job will not hesitate on experiencing all the features and such this offers."	5.0	Star Wars, as always	2005-06-07	5	4	1

So following in this logic, Lucas will probably continue to release VHS versions of the next two films using the same box style as these.  Don't be surprised if the Star Wars movies aren't available in DVD until after 2006 when Episode III will be released on home video.I am giving this edition only a 4 Star rating because the first copy that I brought home was defective.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A353H0XIOT17HF	R. Christian	"I have to say I totally understand this debate over the altering of NEW versions of the Star Wars Trilogy (episodes 4, 5 and 6). I am truly looking forward to these films in their new versions but I sympathize with those who want their films untouched as they first viewed them. Perhaps in my mind, these may be some of the very FEW films ever made which could stand the updating and restoration... I say that for a few reasons. First of all, the Star Wars films in question depended so greatly on the prequels that have been made in the years since.... also they depend on their ""look"", and seen compared to episodes 1 and 2.. and probably the upcoming episode 3, they may not look so great to future Star Wars fans who will instead see them IN ORDER, which most of us DID NOT. To my thinking, if it these were not revamped, they would look weaker and more primitive to future generations caught up with the clarity and tone of the first 3 films.I TOTALLY agree that to change details of the story might not be wise, and I am not aware to what degree this will be done except for rumour... we all need to actually see them to make a judgement call for how each of us feels about the changes... but if it's simply a matter of cleaning up the special effects (like removing the gray boxes from the spacecraft against the black skies) and making Yoda look more like a living being and not a ""Muppet"" I am all for it.ARTISTS ALTERING THEIR WORKS:Is it okay for an artist to change his works? Some say NO. Yet in history, classical composers such as Bach, Bruckner, Debussy and many more, often had ""versions"" or new ""editions"" to change orchestration, orders of movements and even which instrument would take the lead in a concerto. Every art scholar knows that paintings are often painted and repainted by their original creators and sometimes overpainted by other painters many years later. The museums are filled with works that have had faces painted out, figures added, coats of arms changed or painted out and fig leaves added to male nudes. There are even paintings that are painted over other paintings that were already completed. This is more common in art history that you think. Many Italian and Dutch paintings have gone through extensive realtering. Sometimes even an artist would sign his name to another mans painting.... some works by Rembrandt were actually painted by others in his studio. He knew the painting would sell better with his name on it.These days, many a brand new Harley Davidson with state of the art design is bought by an owner only to be remodelled into a custom chopper to the raves of the magazines and buyers .... and that logic applies to cars, great buildings and other things.The REAL question is SHOULD motion picture films be altered? My general answer is probably ""NO""... I believe in cleaning them, fixing badly done special effects, reprinting from the original negative, etc... if it does not ruin the integrity and look of the original (just as art museums routinely ""restore"" great paintings without a fuss from anyone).... but on the question of adding scenes and altering storylines... that is a trickier question. STAR WARS COULD be the exception for the above reasons and since it is their creator who is doing it. It is well known over the years, he has expended on his original 1977 ideas on these sagas and he wants to ""right"" that. This vision may conflict with OUR individual ideas of what these films may mean to us... but since when do individuals agree on what is ""right"" or lacking in any given film? I know many a Star Wars fan who hated the introduction of ""Jar Jar Binks"", or did not care for other aspects of one of the films upon release. So what is ""right"" for ""Star Wars"" remains the discretion of Mr. Lucas... the creator of these ""worlds"" we have been allowed to visit... and in 1977 he set to film a world he wanted to share with us and now, 30 years later, he wants to evolve that world for generations to be born long after we are gone while he still can.I think we need to see what the man will give us in this new set and then judge if it is for us or not. For what it's worth, I DO believe the original theatrical release should be available to those who want them... and the films are so popular, I think both the new versions and the original versions in release will be profitable for 20th Century Fox to have on the market."	5.0	Star Wars...

I did not like the substitution of the hologram in the final portion of the film, where Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear.  But, this DVD set, of pristine clarity and great sound, deserves to be in every Sci-Fi's collection.

I saw the original movies in the theater when they came out;  the special edition films in the theater when they came out, and now I have a superb DVD set of the three movies.  Allow George Lucas to refine his vision of the films as technology allows;  the budget for these films when they were made was extremely small compared to even the cost of mediocre movies today.  These movies were groundbreaking movies, and this DVD set is a fine way to celebrate those films. In these movies, things were being asked in the way of special effects that had never been tried before and was truly pioneering.

The stuff he added to this is pointless in the extreme- it consists of shlocky slap stick, like flying mechanical bugs getting swatted, etc. I found every bit intrusive, stupid and wholly uncalled for.

I need more money to add to my bank account, which is why I am releasing a 4th DVD set of the Star Wars movies. This will be the same as my wonderful other DVDs that I have re-re-released, except I have put better cover art. I sure hope my fans go out and buy this DVD, because I think they'll dig the beautiful new cover art, even if it is something they already own. You know, I was gonna get the original negatives, since that is what the fans want. But about halfway into the meeting with Fox, I decided ""To hell with it, I'm gonna rehash these DVDs I had and just re-re-release my other DVDs that fans hate."" Fox thought it was a bad idea but I decided ""screw them."" Anyways, know that I need more money, and yet those who don't have this yet BETTER get it, because if they don't I will sneak into their house and make them like it. I mean, laserdisc transfers are so much easier than an original negative transfer. I don't have any plans to restore them with 5.1 Surround Sound or Anamorphic widescreen from the original source.

Personally I believe that at some point a true artist has to know when to stand back and admire his creation.. unfortunately Lucas isn't there yet.	2.0	NOT the Original!	2011-09-26	13	9	4

I say that because not only will he squeeze, twist and reshape the Star Wars story in as many ways he can, just to milk every last penny from it, even if it shamelessly wallows in the realm of ridiculous and &#34;ruins&#34; it , but also because he STILL hasn't made the ORIGINAL theatrical versions of the IV, V, VI available on blue-ray.  I just don't get it.  The special editions are so-so, but I grew up as a kid watching the original theatrical versions.  I am shocked good 'ol money-thirsty George has not found a way to get money from myself and others who preferred the true originals, by cleaning them up and putting them on blue-ray.  So frustrating and dumb.  We know you love CG effects, George.  But your rubber monsters and handcrafted effects were really good.

Instead, the ever perfectionist George Lucas, decides to ""alter"" his films again.  I don't mind the improvements so much, but couldn't he put the old ones out too?  Part of the original charm was the original special effects.  Now the original movies will get lost, and they should have been preserved for viewings, even by film historians.  These films are now classics, they are pop culture history, We do not want them altered.  They were fine the way they were, warts and all.On a technical level the trilogy stands way out on its own.  The sound, visual effects, and musical score all work well together, even in the lesser effort ""Return of the Jedi.""  Too many critters (i.e. toys to sell), too long (about 10 minutes) and a convient tie up all loose ends kind of ending bring this episode down a little.I like 'Empire' the best.

I remember these movies as much as I remember Indiana Jones and I feel that these two will always be the greatest works from George Lucas that I grew up with.  I know it sounds hypocritical of me after my review of Indiana Jones but I feel that the new cgi effects Lucas added to these three movies was not all that bad.  I say my main reason is that these were science fiction films and to that affect you wanted to see great star fighter battles and incredible technological effects and to that the new Cgi effects did a spectacular job true to some real hard-core fans that maybe a form of taboo to change some of the film but as a few other reviewers are saying as well the movies are owned by Lucas and it is his right to change it how he sees fit.  I also agree with some reviewersthat the new trilogy that came after are not as great but most of thetime people can never make a copy or a remake of something that was as good as the first.

The empire strikes back is very good but not a classic like a New Hope, it is action packed from beginning to end, and Return of the Jedi is a little too hoakey and to much for the 3-12 audience, with the ewoks and all. Nevertheless all three movies are fun and its great to get them on DVD (after all this time) in pristine condition. They look and sound great. There is also an extra disk of extra's, for those who like those things. I personally do not care about the extras, I do not have the time to waste on that kind of thing; But I know there are people out there who will judge the DVD's on the extras alone.

Then saw the real version on the scifi channel, the widescreen, with comentary from Billy De Willams and making of each film. Went to see the 20th anniversary release in the theatres for a dozen times and was blown away. Bought the only version out there, the widescreen version of the special editions. I'm going to buy the another release of these movies in widescreen, with a making of episode two.The only way you could ever truely enjoy these classic movies is in widescreen and not in the evil version. Space is a pretty big place and is wasted on watching Star Wars and any other space movie formatted. It's the only way to hear John William's wonderful classic scores, the THX sound quality and Dolby Digital Sorround Sound. To see the battle in widescreen feels like your in the movie, to see it formatted is a waste of time and money. But to see it on DVD is truely would be a treat and I'll buy twelve dozen copy's.

It is interesting to see how the chars relate, especially after the 'last' episodes were madebefore the sometimes cluttered, later 'prequels'.The trilogy holds up well, with some minor flaws. One being the lack of resemblance between the actor who played Darth Vader(when Luke took his mask off as he was dying), and the youngActor, Hayden C.

One word to describe them: sloppy. It's great to see the movies finally on DVD, but the revisions just detract from the movies. They make the movies seem more like cartoons in places. Lucas should have given the fans a choice like Spielberg did with E.T. (releasing both versions, new and old, on the same disc). In order:1. Star Wars--Greedo still shoots first, and makes one wonder how he lived so long being such a poor shot. The added scene with the digital Jabba looks very bad and the addition of Boba Fett to the scene takes the character from an intriguing loner to a hired thug. The digital X-wings show the sloppiness of the work. The original modelmakers had red stripes on the X-wings for each pilot's designation (i.e., 5 for Red-5, 2 for Red-2). Now they each have two red stripes, making them all the same (i.e., all Wedge). The added scene with Red Leader and Biggs is poorly edited, as someone is obviously digitally imposed crossing in front of the actors, causing R2D2 (being raised at the time) to jump about three feet. If Lucas wanted to ""correct"" things, then he should've corrected the bad computer effects during the pilot briefing scene and the boxes around the TIE fighters pursuing the Falcon (they look worse than they ever did on VHS).2. Empire--Did anyone ever really wonder how Darth Vader got back to his command ship after Luke escaped? If so, then that scene's here, with Vader instructing a subordinate to have his shuttle standing by. Only problem: it's not James Earl Jones doing the voice, or if it is, he must've been sick at the time. Also, if Lucas really wanted to replace the first emperor with Ian McDiarmid, okay, but couldn't the makeup have been better? Again, sloppy work. And there is no reason to change the dialogue (this, the edited jump cut of Biggs/Red Leader editing out a line of dialogue about Luke's father in the first Star Wars movie, and the addition of Hayden Christianson in Jedi prove Lucas never intended for these to be the actual versions of the movies, as he contends now).3. Jedi--Okay, there's not much that would help this beyond digitally removing the ewoks, but adding Hayden Christianson into the last scene was a bad idea. His long hair looks absurd, and he appears to be just standing around waiting for someone to tell him what to do. Sloppy. The same goes for the new song and computer-generated cartoon in Jabba's palace.Hopefully Lucas will realize Star Wars was put on Congress' list protecting the movie as a national treasure for a reason. His revisions are like someone taking The Wizard of Oz and colorizing the first part, or removing the tornado and adding a digital tornado.  Or like Ted Turner colorizing Casa Blanca. With any luck Lucas will release the originals but until that happens, these are great to have if you can close your eyes during the revisions. They're just too jarring to watch."	3.0	Not so special	2004-03-31	1	1	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A81P47EIXM8HA	"Richardson ""Clarence"""	Hello,this is a 2 part review of the DVD set for Star Wars...1) the set itself...I found the sound and picture to be of the highest quality and I own a box set of laserdiscs of these movies.  It was also nice to have commentaries by George Lucas for the movies (something that many directors still don't do).  The bonus DVD contains HOURS of extras and is really interesting.2) the uproar regarding the changes....Yes, I was suprised to see some of the changes since the movies aired and even since my laserdiscs were made ...BUT unlike some of the misguided people, who have reviewed this set ...I DON'T think these movies belong to the people who watched them....they belong to the creator and producer ...Mr Lucas.  If he feels that technology can be utilized to update/ upgrade them to his original vision or to make the series of 6 stories more complete....its his call.  Honestly....after a decade or more of upgrades on CDs by remastering you'd think people would be used to the fact that it can and will be done....this isn't on a par with colorizing black and white movies....and the same reviewers who accuse Mr Lucas of defacing these films are  arrogant enough to say that they ...the viewing public are the rightful owners of them....that is pure nonsense.  I appreciate someone writing that changes to a movie they love ruins the experience for them...and can respect that.  To slander the person who created these movies and make personal attacks isn't  very classy and would encourage anyone to disregard reviews by people making personal attacks part of their review as they obviously are unstable and have an attachment to these films that is not healthy...they're just movies and entertainment for goodness sakes...these characters are not real and the inclusion of an extra scene that changes their motivation ...blah blah blah..is psycho!bottom line..a very entertaining set....well produced and with hours of fun extras....thanks.	5.0	well done set...ignore reviews from psycho fans	2004-09-22	31	18	13

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3U2Y0C1GV7XV9	Richard W. Eckman	"I will add my voice to the outraged and indignant chorus of people who are sick and tired of Lucas releasing, re-releasing, and re-re-releasing these films without what he damned well knows we all want:  Unblemished, restored versions of the original theatrical releases of '77, '80, and '83.  Lucas claims that the original versions of the films no longer exist.  Well, THAT'S a load of bull.  I do not believe it; it's a blatant lie.  Let me ask a simple question:  Um, if the original versions no longer exist, then what version, which master print was used to create all the various other miscellaneous editions that have been shoveled out at us?  Besides, we all know what a hoarder Lucas is - the man throws NOTHING away.  You mean to say that he doesn't have at least ONE servicable print of each original version stored away somewhere?  Come on, already...!  It's been claimed the prints do not exist, that they were destroyed or in such horrendous shape that they were beyond repair.  I'm sorry, I don't buy it.Furthermore, what's the allure for those of us of the first, original generation of STAR WARS fans to buy these films?  We've already allowed ourselves to be duped into buying multiple versions of them on vhs and dvd.  Sure, the blu-rays will look and sound phenomenal - of that, I have no doubt.  But y'know what?  The dvd's are just as nice.  And besides, in at least one of the dvd releases he included as a contemptuous, condescending concession the original theatrical versions in the form of inferior transfers from the laserdiscs.  Considering that's as close as we'll ever get to getting the original, true versions of the movies on disc, I'll take it.The only other thing the man could possibly offer as an incentive to purchase this set is to include all the goodies that we as fans have been clamoring for for many years:  deleted/restored scenes from the Original Trilogy; bloopers; the original screentest tapes; audio commentary by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford (yeah, good luck on getting him to do it, I know), Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Frank Oz, etc.; The Holiday Special (yup, why not?); original trailers; and those wonderful nostalgic original ""making of..."" documentaries - ""The Making of Star Wars"", ""Special Effects - The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Classic Creatures - Return of the Jedi"", and the compilation ""Star Wars to Jedi - The Making of a Trilogy"".  ALL of that is material that we all damned well know Lucas has, and has been sitting on, for years.  The only reason he did not include any of it with previous home video releases has been simple:  He was holding out on us to include them in future releases so that we'd buy the films yet AGAIN.  Period.Oh, and any special features (such as those treasured and much-sought-after deleted scenes, like the one depicting Luke completing his lightsaber at the beginning of ROTJ) will ONLY be included in the mega-set with all six films - NOT the individual trilogy sets.  So, if you want that extra material, you've gotta buy the set wtih the crappy, embarrassing, insulting Prequels.Well, I'm done.  I will NOT give this man one more dime.  Since the age of 7, I (and my parents) have done more than my share to make Lucas rich beyond the dreams of avarice.  And the way he repays this?  To keep us strung out, promising what we desperately want but only giving us just enough to ensure we come back for more - like a drug dealer with a bunch of junkies.  Well, no more.  I'll find and buy the disc with the extra materials on eBay or ioffer.com, or a CD Warehouse or Exchange store.  I'd rather give my hard-earned cash to another fan than give Lucas more money.Here's my closing salvo:  When E.T. was set to be released on dvd, there were to be 2 different sets:  A tin box set crammed with extras, and another more economica set that didn't have quite as many bells and whistles.  I had pre-ordered the second (economical) set.  THEN it was revealed that the ONLY set which would include the original theatrical version of E.T. (the one I grew up with and loved all my life) was the prohibitively expensive tin box set.  Well, there was a FLOOD of outraged protest and cancelled orders (inlcuding my own).  I did not want the reviled, cgi-riddled, dumbed-down version of the film.  At the last second, Spielberg wised up, heard the fans, actually LISTENED to them, and included the original theatrical version with the economical set.Guess what?  I happily bought that set."	1.0	NO ORIGINAL VERSIONS MINUS EXTRA FEATURES = RIPOFF	2011-02-25	34	29	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AK17Z8Y0MRNKA	Ridgewood gal	"I searched and searched for the original movie, for over a month. When I first read about the Trilogy in the product descriptions, it descibed it as Episodes 4, 5 and 6 which really threw me off.Then, whenever I searched under Star Wars or Star Wars Episode I, and tried to view the first episode, it showed on the cover art for the video or DVD all these images which I knew were not the original Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford movie I wanted (that was the first Harrison Ford I ever saw, back as an adolescent in the 70s!).Finally my neighbor told me that, some years after we viewed this movie as kids, they named the original one Episode IV, the next two are V and VI.  And later sequals, made as ""prequels"", were named I, II and III.  Thanks to her, I found what I was looking for!To show how confusing this can be for us parents:  When my son told sister what he got for Christmas, she told me SHE too had been searching for the original movie but couldn't find it online; she was so surprised when I told her the original is called episode IV.  This is more than a cooincidence that we were both thrown off by this!  So if you are looking for the wonderful first movie, this is key information: that the original. first movie is called Episode IV.  Something real Star-Wars-Groupies would know, but not us average folks looking for the classic.Folks at Amazon, you may want to find some way to help people figure that out in their searches, as -- with so much recent Star Wars hype -- many of us parents who enjoyed the movie in our childhood are looking for it for their kids, but not being big ""Star Wars-heads"" we are having trouble finding it.As for rating it, we haven't seen it yet, but any parents will remember that this is wonderful, and will have stood the test of time!  I liked the original stuff much better than later episodes which seemed a bit less fabulous than the first, just my opinion -- that the first episodes (again, called 4, 5 and 6) are the greatest!  So we can't wait to watch this triology with our son and daughter.  My daughter thinks she won't like it, given the subject, but I did as a girl, (princess Leiha and all), so I bet she will, tho maybe I only loved it because at the time the effects were soooo amazing to us!"	5.0	Note, this is the original movie and its 2 sequels, tho called IV, V and VI	2007-01-04	2	1	1

Why can't I see the movie I fell in love with in 1977? I don't mind it when they clean up the print and remove minor faults, but putting in CGI, just for the sake of using it, is not my cup of tea.(...) I like the Mona Lisa just the way she is, I don't particularly want to see her with a new hat and curly blonde hair. I hate it when they mess with things that are great the way they are.As far as I'm concerned, they can keep on changing SW as much as they like, but unless the original version is included, I'll just keep on watching my old video tape, thank you very much. Call me old-fashioned. I'm grateful for what George Lucas gave us back in 1977, it's the best movie ever in my book, but the SE definitely is not.	3.0	let us choose between original and SE	2004-04-07	5	5	0

Then there is the fact that most of the changes just don't come off very well. The blending of modern digital effects with the old mechanical type usually is not very smooth, leaving these scenes looking patched together and awkward. They look like exactly what they are - scenes from an old movie with some digital affects dropped in.  And in many cases, the new affects pale in comparison to the old fashioned affects that relied on models (the new CGI Jabba the Hutt anyone?).  New scenes are either unnecessary or detrimental, such as Han shooting Guido first or Han stepping on Jabba's tale. I could really do without the childish humor that Lucas has taken to in recent years, especially in the original trilogy. And who does Lucas think he's fooling when he says he always wanted to have Han shoot first but couldn't do it because of ""editing"" issues. Right. You could never have had Han shoot first way back in '76, couldn't be done. Comments like this really drive home to me the low regard Lucas has for his own creation and the fans these days. Sad. Hopefully Lucas's greed will lead to a DVD release of the original cut of these films, so there might at least be some silver lining there. The only reason I gave this set two stars is the extras, which I have to admit are plentiful and well done."	2.0	Bantha Fodder	2004-12-17	14	13	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1F1FOR46702YF	R. J Rey	"Acclaimed filmmaker George Lucas catapulted the Sci-Fi genre to new heights with the breakthrough masterpiece, the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy. A long time ago in a galaxy far away, a small band of rebels have dared to fight back the ruthless Galactic Empire. A simple farm boy named Luke Skywalker who dreams of something greater, will seized his true destiny and help the Rebellion overthrow the Empire. This amazing Sci-Fi spectacle is one of the most successful franchises in film history and contains a strong fan following unlike any other. The blockbuster trilogy is the ultimate battle of good versus evil and features a compelling epic storyline, memorable characters, thrilling action sequences and award-winning special effects. The fine cast includes Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, Billy Dee Williams and James Earl Jones as the voice of the ruthless Darth Vader. All three films were very successful at the box office and also won many Academy Awards. This marvelous 4-Disc box set features Episodes IV (A New Hope), V (The Empire Strikes Back) and VI (Return of the Jedi).The ""Star Wars"" Trilogy is the must-have DVD of 2004. The entire science fiction saga is presented in 2.35:1 THX certified anamorphic widescreen format. The box set contains an outstanding picture quality that brings new life to the popular Sci-Fi trilogy. Its intense Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound delivers an excellent home theater experience. The box set also features informative audio commentaries by creator George Lucas, cast member Carrie Fisher and technical crew, theatrical trailers, still galleries, an in-depth feature-length ""Star Wars"" saga documentary (Disc 4), behind-the-scenes featurettes and a exclusive preview of the upcoming ""Star Wars: Episode III"".

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3M453J1GSLLHS	"R. J Schaick ""minstrel75"""	"First of all, I just want to say that I have no plans to ever purchase the DVD set. I own Widescreen VHS tapes of the originals (the set released in 1995 before the Special Editions) and I'm quite pleased with them. However, for the sake of argument, I rented the DVDs from my local Blockbuster, just to see what George Lucas had done with each movie. What follows is (I hope) a fair assessment, as a fan of the ORIGINAL original trilogy.The picture and sound are excellent, just what one would expect from a DVD Transfer. The Star Wars universe has always been a visually imaginative one, and deserves to be viewed with high quality picture and sound. The DVD Transfer does the movies extreme justice in that field. So the movies get an A+ there. As far as revisions are concerned, I can understand that George Lucas certainly has the right to make changes if he wants, but like any artist, I think he should have taken a step back first and asked if he was really making a change for the better. For example:-I can't understand his logic for changing the sound that Obi-Wan makes to frighten away the Sand People in ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" In the original, he sounded like a ferocious beast, something they might actually be scared of. I really can't describe the sound that he makes on the DVD, but I do know that it does not sound terrifying, and it doesn't seem logical to me that a group of Sand People would run from it (even if they are easily startled).-However, I can understand George Lucas's logic for having Temuera Morrison redo all of Boba Fett's dialogue in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (given what we learned in ""Attack of the Clones""), but honestly, I don't think the new voice fits the character that well. The original voice (that of Jason Wingreen) was better suited to Fett's personality of an emotionless, profit-driven hunter.-Likewise, I can see why he would put Hayden Christensen at the end of ""Return of the Jedi,"" but Christensen just doesn't seem to give off the outstanding look of fatherly pride that Sebastian Shaw was giving in the original.-Speaking of ""Jedi,"" my verdict on the ending is a toss-up, since I was never a huge fan of how the original ended (it was cute, but I felt it still left something to be desired. The highlight was the exchanged glances between Luke and the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father). I thought John Williams's music fit the galaxy-wide celebration of the Special Edition and sounded better than the original Ewok routine (and again, I can understand George Lucas inserting Naboo into that sequence on the DVD, and don't have a problem with that, since he's tooling around with something he put in back in 1997), but at the same time it didn't feel up to par with the music in the rest of the trilogy.-And I too feel that having Greedo fire first more or less screws up the character arc for Han Solo, an arc that was, in some ways, more satisfying than Luke's. In the first movie, we see a mercenary who doesn't care about anyone except for maybe his ship and Chewbacca, but has a change of heart at the end. Then we see someone who has his foot in the door, but it's mostly due to his feelings for the princess. Then finally, we finish with someone who has not only taken up a cause (with no thought of any sort of reward), but has matured to the point where (before he learns that Luke and Leia are related) he's willing to step out of the way if it will make his love happy. I never felt that Han needed to be a white-horse hero right from the get-go, but I think that what happens on the DVD (Han and Greedo shooting at the same time) is a fair compromise. It's not perfect, but I think Han still keeps his reputation for the first movie.-There is one scene in the Special Editions that I  particularly enjoyed, and that was a scene from ""A New Hope"" filmed back in 1977 (but never used in the original theatrical release) that better establishes the relationship between Luke and his childhood friend, Biggs Darklighter. As most character development scenes usually do, it wound up getting cut. But sadly, that was perhaps the only change that I truly enjoyed (until the day I die, I will say that the original band in ""Return of the Jedi"" sounded much better than the overblown production we saw in the Special Edition).When all is said and done, I give this set one star for the picture quality, another for the sound quality, and the third for the Bonus Disc (Lucas definitely delivered with that one, giving fans all the goodies that they've come to expect from movies on DVD). But as for the way that he keeps chopping up the classic trilogy, my father once used the following example in a conversation about Star Wars. He said that if you look at the Mona Lisa, she's completely out of style. Someone, if they were so inclined, should repaint her in more modern dress, and give her a more contemporary hairstyle (and maybe a navel ring or lip piercing). I won't deny that George Lucas has the right to alter these movies, but ultimately, it's up to individual Star Wars fans to determine if these changes make the movies that we grew up with more enjoyable. For me, the answer is no. But as I said, I have my VHS Box Set, so I'm not complaining. If, for you, the answer is yes, then by all means, I recommend the DVDs."	3.0	What I hope is a fair and balanced review.	2005-12-21	11	11	0

One is the special edition version, and the bonus disc contains the original movie release.  As an old timer who liked the unaltered version (just like someone who does not like the remix of a song) I am very pleased.The only thing I regret is that the spanish dubbing of the original is not the neutral latin one. The spanish version has accent from Spain, which is very distracting.  Spain has a population of about 40 million while Latin America has the same amount of population of the US.  So it is like making an english dubbing with Australian accent, quite weird.  On top of that, Spanish people use different words than the rest of spanish speaker public.  In US, the latino public is not likely to use words used by people from Spain, they just feel unnatural.The old original spanish dubbing (made in Latin America) for episode IV was incredible as it indeed improved the original voices of Vader, Leia and pilot speech during Death Star dogfight.  I missed this dubbing a lot.In the spanish dubbing for special edition of episode VI, the voices of EV-9D9 droid and Boushh Leia sound REALLY crappy, like a cheap home made scifi movie. Reducing costs?  This is a great way to scam Lucas and his audience.I give this pack 5 stars for it is a great thing to have the original release.

It was a no-brainer.  The cleaned up prints are done nicely.  Had they been released seperately, 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' would have been 5-stars each.  It is 'Return of the Jedi' (3 stars at best)that brings my rating down to a 4-star.  'RotJ' has its moments, but it's clearly the weaker of the three.Yes, Lucas continues to tweak at the original releases.  Most of them are fine and not critical to the moderate fan....but even I have a hard time w/the update of Anakin Skywalker one of the final shots on 'Return of the Jedi'.As bad as the acting can be during some shots - it is still not as wooden as Hayden Christensen or poor Natalie Portman in the new trilogy.As for extras, there are a good amount of them.  Not as many as say, 'Lord of the Rings' series - but movies are now made to include these things - 'Star Wars' wasn't made in that era.The teaser for 'Revenge of the Sith' was disappointing at best.  It's not a trailer by any means - mostly Lucas going on and on.  The documentary is pretty good - and wow - there are some BAD auditions for the Star Wars characters (how did Cindy Williams ever get a job?).The best are the trailers for the movies.  HORRID (but in a retrospective amusing way).  Had I seen them in the theatre, I doubt I ever would have thought of going to the actual movies.  Even the 'TESB' and 'RotJ' should have been better to capitalize on the original movie's success - but their trailers were just as bad.Definately worth owning.  No longer the best trilogy on DVD - The 'Lord of the Rings' gets that title.	4.0	I Know.  Somehow I've Always Known....	2004-09-23	13	5	8

The original trilogy, in it's original unaltered form, is my ""holy grail"" of movies. They are at the top of my list of films to see on BR, but they are the only ones not available. Everything else I want to see in HD is available, or soon will be. Don't give me any crap about the SE's, those are NOT the original films.This has nothing to do with the perceived quality of the SE's. It's about more than just my childhood memories, it's also about history. The original films, ANH especially, are milestones of cinema. Their original forms should be presented in the best quality possible, with the same attention to detail  as the PT and the SE's.I'd pay for the complete saga if necessary, to get them. But if they are not available, I will not spend a dime on it. Lucasfilm has gotten plenty of my money over the years. If they want more, give me what I want.

I thought it was the greatest movie I had ever seen.  I also enjoyed ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (my overall favorite of the entire saga) and ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.""  These movies remain just as fascinating for me today as they did 27 years ago.  Yes, I love the original releases (and if/when George Lucas releases the originals on DVD, I WILL buy those as well), but I do understand Lucas' reasoning behind his ""tweaking"" with the films, and I do believe they help with keeping the consistency between ALL of the films from Episode I all the way through to Episode VI.  The bonus features disc contains a lot of great extras--most notably the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary, which provides the most in-depth look I've ever seen behind the making of the ""Star Wars"" saga.  I also enjoyed the featurettes ""The Characters of Star Wars,"" ""The Birth of the Lightsaber"" and ""The Force is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars.""  Also included is ""The Return of Darth Vader,"" a behind-the-scenes look at ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.""

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1DMYUSXX77JEW	Robert Bauer	What can be said about Star Wars, that hasn't been said so many times before? Entertaining, fun, great acting, story, action all rolled up into one. People have been talking about it for years, and will continue to for many years to come. There was absolutely nothing like it, and nothing will ever compare to it again. Ok, it is not The Godfather, Gone With The Wind, Wizard Of Oz, or Citizen Kane. It doesn't pretend to be. But the impact it has made over the years, proves just how strong cinema can be. Many people have been waiting for years for this film to be released in HD, and for good reason, if any film calls out to be in HD, this is it. Finally after many years, George Lucas has agreed to finally release this film on blu-ray. I agree with most people who say that this is the most anticipated film ever to be released in the HD format. I have been collecting this film on all different formats for many years, and was thrilled to pick it up on blu-ray, when I first heard it was going to be released. Then I started hearing all the rumours about it not being the original version, etc. I will coment on that right now, because I believe that it is very important. But it will be short and to the point, then I will give my review on the quality of the blu-ray itself. First off, I have to say that I don't believe people should play around with their creations too much. Like Da Vinci, imagine he took down the Mona Lisa, and painted her hair blonde, or some other color, because by today standards, for some reason or another it wouldn't be politically correct, or taking the Last Supper painting and painting Mary Magdaleine in there, because some people now say, that she was at the last supper. Or musicians, going back to the recording studio and tinkering with their classic songs, because they believe something was left out, etc. It really isn't right to alter your work. However, Star Wars is George Lucas's baby, and he can do whatever he likes with it. But that doesn't always make it right. Censoring and altering can cause dangerous precedents later on. Yes, I do wish that he would have included both versions, the original and updated versions here, but no. I believe and hope like many others, that perhaps in the future, he will clean up the original version, and release it in HD in a offical SW release, but until that happens, this edition will have to suffice. Now on the blu-ray itself, the video and audio are absolutely unbelievable. Without a doubt these are among the finest blu-rays, that I have ever seen. I can say without reservations, that these are definitely reference quality, and if you just got a brand new blu-ray player, then these should be your first pick up for your system. I played them on my PS3, because I don't have a blu-ray player yet, and they looked outstanding. The color, sharpness, and all the details are there, definitly blows the standard dvds out of the water. The 6.1 surround audio is also incredible, you will hear ships, gunshots, and lazers, whizzing all around you. It is really like you are in the middle of all the action. So even with George Lucas's polishing and tinkering, although I don't agree with it, it still doesn't ruin the integrity of the film itself. And if i wish to watch the orignal version of Star Wars, I still have the original laser disc in mint condition, and still have a laser disc player that fortunately still works to watch it. So with the alterations and all, and even though this is only bare bones, with only commentaries, I still recommend The Star Wars Original Trilogy IV, V, VI.	4.0	Absolutely Incredible, but...............................	2011-12-05	3	3	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ	Robert Blake	"After years of waiting ""Star Wars,"" the epic space opera George Lucas first unleashed to the world in 1977, makes its debut on DVD. Lucas is of course known to be a techno freak, obsessed with the concept of digital visual effects or just visual effects in general. Anyone hoping for the original ""Star Wars"" prints will be disappointed, but at the end of the day it is Lucas's film and if you're open-minded you can at least appreciate that the re-touching makes the original trilogy connect better with the current prequels. On DVD the trilogy looks stunning, now we can truly appreciate the scope and colors of one of the great unique visions of modern movies. The genius of Lucas, aside from the technical credits, was the way he mingled ancient mythmaking with futuristic science fiction to create what is essentially a modern fairy tale, ""Star Wars"" is like Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" an epic adventure full of romance, colorful worlds, characters and dashing heroism. The first film, ""A New Hope,"" introduces us to the timeless characters of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 with operatic flare and a stunning sense of visual artistry. It is amazing to watch this film and then hear Lucas speak about low budget problems. The score by John Williams sets the tone for what became one of his most famous works, he hits us with splashing colors of sound and elegant, romantic strings. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" continues the saga with an even wider angle, a love story develops and we are taken to worlds as diverse as the inside of an asteroid field and a planet composed of clouds. This is also the first showdown between Luke and Vader, and a shocking secret is revealed (is there anyone out there who doesn't know it?!). ""Return Of The Jedi"" finishes things with more imaginative flare and a memorable, exciting showdown between good and evil. Lucas deserves credit for delivering his masterpiece in a worthy DVD set, we get the films with commentary and a special fourth disc that not only contains a fascinating documentary, TV spots, trailers and featurettes, but also a small glance into what we'll be seeing in 2005's ""Episode 3."" And yes, there are few re-touches. The scene where Vader speaks with the Emperor in ""Empire"" has been re-done a bit, Hayden Christensen of the prequels also makes a surprise appearance in ""Jedi,"" so in fact, the re-touching isn't as devastating as some try to make it out to be. ""Star Wars"" remains so popular because like Greek mythology it appeals to our basic human feelings and ideas. It is simple and romantic yet deep and meaningful. Consider that people who can't stand ""Star Trek"" are easily entertained by ""Star Wars."" And even if you don't care much for myths and philosophy, this is good movie fun. These films contain precisely what great storytelling is all about. Sure you can argue that the acting isn't first rate or that some of the plot threads are hokey, but you can't deny that ""Star Wars"" has a heart. This is a must-have in any film collection."	5.0	A Timeless Classic.	2004-10-17	17	10	7

While the picture quality is spectacular, and the sound is top notch, a few glaring errors on the part of a crazy George Lucas ruin the entire package. Now I was never one of the super-purists, though I am the biggest Star Wars fan. The Special Edition didn't bother me too much when it came out, besides the Return of the Jedi musical number. But some of the changes to the DVDs are inexcusable. I'm not talking about the little changes; clean ups and the like are actually great looking. Obviously, George Lucas has become so rich and prosperous that he is surrounded only with yes men. If he had come up to me and asked me to make the lightsabers look so lame and put Hayden ""I can't act my way out of a paper sack"" Christensen in the final shot of the trilogy, I would have told him what a jerk he was. But alas, no such creature exists on Skywalker Ranch. Luke's lightsaber in ROTJ is terrible. In the desert scene, the lightsaber is so bright you can't see anything else in the shots. Also, the length changes drastically from shot to shot, and the thing is way too green. Also, Darth Vader having a bright neon pink lightsaber is just wrong. Alas, the shame. Maybe when George Lucas kicks the bucket, his kids will release the actual movies. Here's to hoping."	3.0	Dang	2004-09-28	13	8	5

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3GRU9732S4V1U	"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1"""	Two hours in a darkened movie theater in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1977 were enough to change the life of a then eight-year-old kid forever.  For anyone out there who enjoys adventure, science fiction, special effects, or just good storytelling, there is no denying that the original Star Wars trilogy is a monumental achievement in modern American cinema.  The cultural influence of these movies cannot be overstated enough.  The first film and its two sequels have grabbed a place in American culture right up there next to Gone With The Wind.  99% of movies out in the last few decades will eventually fade and be forgotten, but these films will be around forever.  I myself now have two young kids, and you can bet that I will sit down and watch these movies with them many times.These three films, together with their three &quot;prequels&quot;, tell a basic, simple story.  It's the story of the corruption of good from within, the seeming hopeless descent into evil, and the eventual redemption and victory of good.  Once you get past all the special effects and sci-fi elements, it's actually a very powerful theme, an one I think everyone can benefit from.  The message is wrapped up in a LOT of good storytelling, including awesome space battles, unforgettable characters, and more than a little comedy.As far as the new effects and added scenes for the Special Edition versions, I thought they were kind of a mixed bag.  In the first film, for example, I really liked the shots of the Millenium Falcon on approach to Yavin, and I also liked the shots of the X-Wings and Y-Wings as they round the curve of the red gas giant on their way to do battle for the Death Star.  There were several EXCELLENT new shots on Tatooine, especially Obi-Wan Kenobi's house and the &quot;new&quot; version of Mos Eisley.  On the other hand, I could have done without some of the changes to the dogfighting scenes, and also I think the movie was better off without the scene between Han and Jabba.  I also never quite understood why they added in one scene with Biggs at the rebel base, but not the scenes between Luke and Biggs on Tatooine.  As it stands, the addition of Biggs is jarring and doesn't seem to make any sense.  It makes sense if you've read the original book, but one shouldn't have to read the book to understand the movie.  I also thought the change to the scene with Han and Greedo was a mistake.  As for Empire and Jedi, those changes didn't make much difference to me.I own both the original and &quot;special&quot; editions of the trilogy on VHS, so I get to pick and choose which ones I like the most.  I know that Lucas is going to release these movies on DVD at some point.  Perhaps it will be set up in a way that will allow fans to &quot;choose&quot; which version of each scene they want to see.  Now THAT would be something!If you are one of the few out there who haven't seen or are familiar with these films, I'm not going to spoil the plot for you.  I will just say this - you OWE it to yourself to see these movies.  They are classics, now and forever.	5.0	Search your feelings - you know these movies RULE!	2001-12-27	19	17	2

I don't want guns to be flash lights, Han to shoot second, and obvious cgis that don't go with the puppets and models that make up the movie. There is nothing more distracting then a beatifuly done scene with a giant video game looking character walking through. All you atention is drawn away from the characters to look at some crazy creature that was inserted 30 years after the fact. And how about the scene where Jabba walks around Han. Possibly one of the worst additons ever. I agree it is cool to see what they added, but it is all out of place. And though it was minor, Han shooting the alien after being shot at in the bar took away from his loosome character. He is supposed to be scum, who learns to help others.I would be all for dvds where you can select what version you want on the front menu.

But I only thought the two sequels deserved four stars...  as for therest of the star wars series, I really did not care for them.  I think Hollywood was just making money off the originalthree.  In fact I had guessed right away when the fourth movie came out, who was going to wind up being theEvil Master of Darth Vader.

Finally gave away two VHS copies, kept the original ""Empire Strikes Back"" for myself, but I keep it in safe keeping and never watch it. Why? Because I like the new additions and sound effects, plus handy dvd discs, although, when the redo's were first introduced I did not like all of the effects. This is the set with modified additions deleting some of the most irritating retouches like Luke's screaming when falling off the platform in Empire Strikes Back. A big thankful, thank-you! I never liked that screaming that was never there before, and thought it kinda foolish since it seemed to make him more mortal.In general, I like the additions like Jabba's talk with Han, the Jabba dancers, and even the emperor revised in Empire Darth Vadar private conference. The only real questionable redo is the very young Darth at the final of Return Of Jedi. Why are OB1 and Yoda remain ancient in after life spirits, when Darth is given a rebirth.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AL77PH3L1I0QF	Robert Young	"It's really simple. People in 1977 loved your film. For many years after, people loved them. When I was growing up in the early 90s, I loved them as well. But even at the age of 12 when the ""Special Editions"" came out, I knew something wasn't right with them. I had grown attached to the original trilogy, the way the story was meant to be told, and the additions of the ""Special"" versions did not fit in. The new stuff didn't add anything. All of it was just fluff, never intended to be in the film in the first place, with the obvious exception of the Jabba extra scene, and even that was butchered. If it didn't fit in anymore, just leave it as a bonus on the DVD and move on, that CG mess was completely uncalled for.As a student of film, and avid lover of the art of film, the fact that not only would you, Mr. Lucas (I know he probably won't be reading this, but still), shrug off the complaints of your first bout with ""special enhancements"", but you would further insult when we finally get to see these films in an HD format. It shows a total disregard for the art of filmmaking. What happened to your love the work of Kurosawa? Do you think he would ever do such a thing? Maybe add a CG horde of bandits to Seven Samurai, or a loud melodramatic ""Nooo!"" to the solemn ending to Ikiru? No, it would never happen, because Kurosawa was an artist, and I'm beginning to think that you aren't and probably never were. I can understand the feeling of not being satisfied with something that you've done. Most people probably can relate to that. But the finished product was cherished by many, many people, and it belongs to them just as much as it belongs to you.I know that you're a business man first, and a filmmaker second. I know that despite the thousands, maybe millions of dissenting voices you'll hear over this will probably fall on deaf ears. But I urge you to think back to the late 70s, when you were a struggling artist who nearly killed himself to bring his vision to the world. How would that young man view what you have become today? Bottom line, your fans are just that for a reason, because you made a wonderful piece of art. Please, stop insulting them."	1.0	Knock it off, George.	2011-09-12	22	19	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2Y51TMVEI1YZQ	"Rob Michaels ""axe7734"""	"First off, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, so the 3 star rating is not for the films themselves, although there are parts of them that might get fewer than 5 stars, but not many. I'm not going to comment much on the films themselves because what else is there to say? They are awesome! My 3 star rating is actually for the overall package of the DVD set. The video & sound quality are excellent, so no problems there. However, I give it 3 stars because there is so much here that is lacking. There is so much more that could have been added, but for some strange reasons, wasn't. First, why is there only 1 bonus disc between three films when the DVDs of Episodes I & II got TWO DISCS each? This makes no sense. There have been so many specials about Star Wars over the years (like that infamous Holiday Special, which, no matter how corny it was, would still be cool to see on DVD) that surely, more features could have been added. Second, where are all the deleted scenes that have become legendary for many Star Wars fans? The early scenes with Biggs & Lukes other friends, the snowtroopers running into a bunch of wampas and the sandstorm scene in Jedi. Most DVDs have deleted scenes nowadays, so why not Star Wars? And finally, I know these are George Lucas' films, but knowing how fanatical & devoted the fans are, why couldn't we have gotten one disc with bonus material, one disc for the special editions and one (or possibly a double-sided disc) with the original versions, so that fans, new & old, can see how the films were ""way back when"". I mean, I know he felt changes were necessary, and I agree, they are kind of cool, BUT, when I first saw Star Wars at the age of ten, I don't remember no one complaining, do you? Sure, you might be able to buy the original versions on video through ebay or something, but videotape doesn't last forever. And the quality is usually crap. It's too bad Lucas only seemed to pay attention to what HE wanted and not what the fans wanted, but I guess you can't have everything. Still, these great films are finally on DVD, though somewhat altered, and with a few features missing, so I shouldn't complain too much, but it just bugs me that they overlooked so much. So, even though I seem to love to complain, I still bought 'em and liked 'em."	3.0	THIS is what we waited so long for???	2004-09-24	24	14	10

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3B5J6A75D3KO2	"Rocko Audiophile ""Analog Rules"""	"I am a Teen of this Generation,16 y/o as of 2005. The First Star Wars I saw was ""The Phantom Menace"" in '99 good Movie, then I saw ""Attack of the Clones"", a bit dissapointing. But ""A New Hope"",""Empire Strikes Back""(my favorite), and ""Return of the Jedi"", are all masterpieces, primitive effects or brand new CGI. I have the '97 Versions which I purchased in 2002, the effects are decent. But I really paid more attention to the story despite the effects can't hold a candle to the effects of ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"". Now Revisited, the 2004 DVD Trilogy is a major step forward from the '97 version and a jump from the 1977,1980 and 1983. I was fortunate to see the ""Original"" Versions(THANKS DAD) which you purists call it.Many of these Changes recieve a thumbs up from me, I will explain why:PROSEP.IV ""A NEW HOPE""In ""A new Hope"" color is greatly improved and much of the CGI is a good thing. A couple of examples are the Sandcrawler, looks way better and has a perspective. Jabba the Hutt is changed from the Human actor in '77,to the Gruesome PS2 reject '97 Jabba, to the better,not perfect, better Ep.VI and Ep.I Jabba, but he is kinda dark in this movie. Shots Like X-Wings leaving Yavin and the Detail added to X and Y wings in outer space preparing to attack the death star.The Death Star and Alderaan explosions are stronger with an added aftershock and Added Scenes at Mos Eisley add a little more Humor to the Movie for the Kiddies. Audio changes like the Soundtrack are a big improvement, awesome on a THX system, Luke's ""I think we took a wrong turn"" Echo is also more believable, in '77 it sounded kinda exaggerated.EP. VMy Favorite of the Originals.With THX in the backpocket, The Battle of Hoth is much more breathtaking, with explosions of AT-AT's and the Asteroid field.One of the Best changes is adding Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor rather than the Monkey woman voiced by Clive Revell on the '80 and '97 versions. Lucas did not change it for the Prequels In my opinion, he changed it to fit Ep.VI. The Slave I chasing the Millenium Falcon is way better also. Cloud city's color has been enhanced, it is necessary to fit our now digital world. One change that took a while to realize is there's windows in the building where the group is with Lando. A Huge audio change is the conversation w/ the emperor and Darth Vader, also Luke fall w/ digninty rather than the crappy scream in '97.EP.VIROTJ is the lesser of the Older movies, only 1/4 as good as Ep.IV, and 1/2 as good as EP.V, but 100x better than Ep.II. Jabba's Sail barge colour looks better,of course and the Sarlacc has an added mouth, both are good changes. Han Solo's toes must have been super strong in '83, that was hard to believe, an added CGI Ropes take care of the Hercules toes w/ added detail. Darth Vaders eyebrows are removed, which makes sense since he was horribly burned in Ep.III. Death Star II's explosion has been enhanced, also the celebration added Naboo and Coruscant and an Added Jar Jar screaming ""WESA FREE!!!"". Hadyen Christensen's cameo is a good change in my opinion, because he died as a young adult when he turned to the dark side but then turned good again which when he was good he was a young adult, so it's a good thing. There's also a toppled statue of Palpatine that isn't there in '83.Now the Cons.EP.IVThe audio is kinda choppy, an example is when Luke sounds like he's in '77 old analog and Leia sounds like a digital '04.Jabba the Hutt still doesn't look like the '83 Jabba or the '99 Ep.I Jabba. The Lightsaber going from on to off and vice versa. Could have been fixed.EP.VBoba's Voice, in some cases, the Ep.II outpreforms the Original voice, but not quite, there is more feeling in the original voice of Boba, but It makes sense to alter it since he is a clone of Jango. I really don't like how Vader's Lightsaber looks, it is pink, George... IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE RED!!.EP.VIThe Music at Jabba's place is just bad...I prefer the '83 Version.And the biggest con is Vader's Lightsaber...again...IT'S PINK!!!. The Last isn't really a con for me but for some it is big and it's not Anakin. Jar Jar is added at the Celebration Saying ""WESA FREE!!!"", i'm the few people that didn't hate Jar Jar but for some, it's gonna hurt.The Story for all movies EP.I to EP.VI is all great, some are just explained better that others, all except Ep.II. THX comes a long way on enhancing the Experience of these great movies, The oldest, IV, is experience in a new way with great additions and better overall feel of movies. Star Wars isn't about remaining pure all the time, The Old movies tell a story and so do the New ones, ""Boo"" say the ""Original Purists"" who are nostalgic. But Lucas is giving more to my generation on experiencing the Old movies, but in a new way. I for one congratulate Mr.Lucas on this changes, I'm Happy for him because he gets to sjow the movies he originally intended, but because of the age he made them and the budget, he often hit a wall and had to settle for less, Not any more. Some CGI changes are good, some are bad, same w/ audio and scenes.Oh... and one thing... There His Movies, not yours, so stop whining and if you didn't like the '97 edition, then don't bother looking at this one or you will have experience a rage like never before, but for the rest of us who appreciate,old generation of the '77,'80, and '83 and this new '04 versions equally, Buy this DVD, you will not regret your decision, I appreciate it old or new, and for that I consider myself a true fan of Star Wars."	4.0	Star Wars For Old and New Alike	2005-05-31	14	9	5

I'm not sure if it's just the way the DVD is or if it's a glitch or something, but it looks like it could be some digital CGI thing that's not edited out properly or something.  I tried it on my player and laptop and saw it both times.  Just wondering if I got a bad DVD, the rest of the movie was great.I'm not too worried about the parts George changed, it's not like they're crucial plot points or anything, and I guess they are his movies.  I wouldn't have made the changes had it been me, but I don't think it takes away from the overall timelessness of the films.  I did notice that for 1977, 80, and 83, those puppets and creature costumes still look surprisingly real...sometimes even more real than the CGI stuff that's been added.  But overall it's still the trilogy I saw as a kid, and it's not gonna disappoint me seeing the changes each time I watch the films from this set.	5.0	Great Movies, But I've Got a Question...	2004-12-28	6	4	2

George Lucas' brilliance first came to the big screen in 1977 with ""Star Wars: A New Hope"".  This movie would set the standard for all sci-fi movies that followed.  With Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Darth Vader just to name a few, ""A New Hope"" was universally loved.  The story continued with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which in my opinion was the best ""Star Wars"" movie ever made.  The second movie in the original trilogy puts Luke face to face with Darth Vader and includes the biggest revelation in movie history and one of the most famous lines ever.  ""Return of the Jedi"" concludes the original trilogy with a blast as Luke and Darth Vader face off for the last time as the Emporer watches and waits to try to turn Luke to the Dark Side as he did with Darth Vader.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3A8BQ0NVIUCRM	Roger	"These three beginning original Star Wars Movies have been reedited and remastered to provide better viewing entertainment than the previous originals.  They include DTS sound for English, using Dolby Digital for other languages.  The DTS sound is amazing, and far out performs the originals.  The only issues I had was the common dynamic sound being much louder than voice dialogs.  I found myself constantly having to turn the volume down to reduce loud bass sound effects and volume up to hear voice dialogs.  (Probably in an effort to make neighbors also want to watch a Movie, just like the loudness wars with commericials. :-/)I also found the reedited version to include the later Episodes' details to be essential for following a transparent story line between all six episodes or all six Movies.  The only anomaly was the scene of the computer generated Jabba the Hutt talking with Han Solo while walking within STAR WARS V.  Some shadowing or displacement can be seen between real and computer generated video, but over all I still enjoyed the scene.  Jabba the Hutt looked much more real, with a lot more detail.  Additional scenes were also added, providing more background details or better explanations to viewers, further enhancing the story line.Since I use Linux, I had an issue with MPlayer properly decrypting the Blu-ray Movies.  I was able to play and view the Movies using MPlayer, but video started displaying artifacts.  I troubleshooted this to be a result of improper decryption, and had nothing to do with processing power or other hardware issues.  Sadly, I needed to use ""makemkvcon backup --decrypt disc:/mnt/dvd-udf/ tmp/movie"" in order to be able to playback the Movie properly and thankfully without any loss of quality as I use a computer HDMI linked (sometimes optical S/PDIF) Yamaha receiver sound system.  A waste of disk space and a waste of energy required for processor and bus power.  As they say, be thankful for what you have, even if it's inadequate.  Blu-ray developers really need to work on this, and remember the innocent are suppose to be sold a product or service, and not leached or swindled for enhancing their own private agenda.All in all, I really enjoyed these Movies and have always enjoyed the director's usage of orchestra music and good talented actors, as well as outgoing special and computer generated effects.

I give it only three stars because the originals from 1977, 1980, and 1983 are not being made available on DVD.George Lucas should be able to change his films however he wants to, but why keep the originals away from those who really want them? Steven Spielberg released both the 1982 version and the 2002 version of E.T. on DVD. James Cameron did the same by releasing both the originals and Special Editions of The Abyss, Aliens, and Terminator 2. Why can't George? I think even a Limited Edition run of the originals would satisfy most Star Wars purists. C'mon!I admit that I'll be right there buying the new DVDs, but for the fans' sake... for film history's sake, I hope the original versions that I saw and fell in love with will be made available on DVD to the public. These films made Mr. Lucas what he is today and should get the respect they deserve!	3.0	Change them? No problem. Just give me the originals.	2004-08-28	22	18	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A4N1VU60B7DGR	Roy Hobbs	"This review refers to the changes made in 1997, generally called Star Wars ""Special Edition.""I think I can sum up Episode IV (A New Hope) this way: new/extended scenes on Tatooine, specifically Mos Eisley, were a mess. I was fine with the other changes.I cannot recall a director ever creating new scenes from scratch like Lucas has done here. I have no problem using the old, but orignal to us scenes such as the one involving Biggs Darklighter. The scenes created from scratch were all failures in my opinion - and they were all on Tatooine. From extra stormtroopers searching for R2 and C3PO on their duneback creatures (or whatever they were called) to an ill-advised scene involving robots, Lucas failed miserably. Of course the most eggregious error Lucas made was changing/re-editing the Han-Greedo storyline. Let's suspend our disbelief for a moment and actually believe what Lucas said was true: that Greedo fired first. If he originally wanted to have Greedo fire first, than that idea would actually be just as bad as editing the scene around. Letting Greedo get the jump on Han makes Han look slow and weak. He was certainly not a weak character and if ANYONE has a gun pointed at them by someone who is threatening to shoot, everyone has the duty to fire first. Lucas did not make this film by himself and surely disappointed many of the other folks who made this film possible. It's hard to believe but this one scene change really sticks with me, as it seems to with other folks.Fortunately, Lucas didn't make similar mistakes in the subsequent episodes. Episode V is my favorite and he didn't butcher it. (Although I'd have been happier if he had Leia kiss Chewbacca and not kiss Luke at all.)I really don't care for either ""dance"" number in Jabba's Palace in Episode VI, so the change there doesn't really effect me.Despite some things I liked, the best thing for all of us was if Lucas had left well enough alone and simply cleaned up and remastered his old films the way they were originally shown in theaters."	4.0	To sum up the special edition...	2012-07-07	0	0	0

But there's a part you(taste buds) that is left feeling unsatisfied and dissapointed because what you just experienced is definitely not what you remember or hoped for.The enhanced versions are dissapointing, yet when you look at all the crappy movies being made these days, the new trilogy still beats many of them. As for original StarWars fans, this enhanced trilogy just wont cut it.For one, the originals were perfect just the way they were. Secondly, among other misfortunes, the added animations were HORRIBLE- they looked like cartoons. ex. in A New Hope -Han walking/talking with giant 'blob-o-graphics'.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AIRK8KHFSBGVY	R. Roberts	Classic movies shouldn't be changed. A movie moves beyond just a way to kill some time, it becomes an experiance, something that your mind thinks back to and finds comfort in. I think for some 15 year old to come along and say people shouldn't take Lucas's changes as sort of a slap in the face to the die hard fans are ignorant to what this trully ment at the time it came out. It was the most advanced looking film to come out at that time, the top of the effects ladder at that point. I think to change it in an attempt to add footage to fit the prequals is an attempt at forcing them to tie into each other. Rather then changing the prequals story so that the continuity works, he is taking the lazy approuch, by simply adding in at post. I can see if he released a Speacial Editions version, and an Original, but like George Lucas loves to do, it is being forced onto people. Do I think these scenes will take away from the enjoyment of the originals, I do not thing so. I would like you to take this into consideration before you slam old timers for being upset over the changes and imagin that someday maybe a movie you ultimately find amazing is changed for no other reason then the whim of a director.	3.0	A classic	2004-09-12	21	14	7

However, I feel it was a mistake to release an extended version at this particular time. I think Lucas Film should have released the Classic Trilogy first, then extended version later. I was 22 when I first watched Star Wars, and every time I see the Classic version, I feel 22 again. Now I am 48, and watching the extended version, I lose that feeling and think, ""Oh, that's new footage."" Or, ""That scene with Jabba and Han looks too digital."" Or, ""Why upgrade all this stuff and leave the Death Star plans as basic as a Pong game?"" I am no longer ""in the zone"" of movie watching, I am distracted. So hence, the 3 stars instead of 5.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A9LNWA25IM2DX	"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-"""	For the release of this trilogy, George Lucas kept saying the movies were his and that he could whatever he wanted to them if he liked to. Well, he was not just saying it!Long before the release of this set, rumor had it that while filming the new episodes he was also shooting new scenes for the classic trilogy, someone even wrote that he asked John Williams to re-score episode IV so the `Imperial March' would be present in the whole saga.It's not that I don't agree with directors altering their films (look at the extended editions of `The lord of the rings') the problem here I believe is that these movies are classics, and for generations people have fallen in love with them, so watching a movie that reminds you of your childhood when puppets were the best thing special effects could offer and suddenly seeing a digital version of Jabba the Hutt talking to Han Solo can be shocking. The whole issue these changes represented could have been avoided with a very simple thing: an option. Something similar to what many directors have done for their DVD's: if you want to see the original theatrical release click here, for an extended edition click over there, that simple!The truth is Lucas film didn't think that way and they just went ahead and changed everything Lucas asked (some of the changes are hilarious really, wait to see Hayden Christensen in episode VI), below you'll find some of the changes made to this `Special edition' of the `Theatrical special edition' from 1997, it is up to you to decide if you buy it, I rather borrow them from someone and wait for the release of the original cut (I don't doubt they will release it, Lucas will never have enough money):* A new digital Jabba the Hutt in Episode IV. No, this is not the digital Jabba from 1997, the scene might be the same but yeah, this is a new Jabba (for Christ sake, wasn't Lucas happy with the one he added before?)* A new Emperor in Episode V. Remember the old emperor from the `Empire strikes back'? forget about him, Ian Mc Diarmind is here now! Not only was he added to an existing scene but the dialogue was modified as well, now Palpatine is kind enough to explain to us that ` the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker'* Boba Fett's voice changed! I know, it sounds ridiculous but it's true. Following the twisted logic in Lucas' mind, he thought `Well, if Bobba is a clone from Jango Fett, they must have the same voice!' Genious! Now we have the classic dialogues from the bounty hunter we love, with an accent (wasn't it enough to make of a legendary bounty hunter a spoiled boy?)* Darth Vader has no eyebrows anymore in Episode VI. I'm not teasing, check it out when Luke takes off Vader's mask near the end of the movie, the excuse is `now he looks more resembling of Hayden Christiansen'* Jedi Temple and Naboo in Episode VI. In the final celebration of the film, among the planets that were added in 1997 now we have Naboo (and Jar Jar Binks in the middle of the screen screaming: `Wesa free') and in Coruscant now we get to see the Jedi Temple in the distance.* Anakin Skywalker in Episode VI. Yes, we still have old Anakin's spectre next to Yoda and Ben Kenobi, the only difference is that the old Anakin is gone and now we have Hayden Christensen! Why? Because according to Lucas' commentary, when Anakin transformed into Darth Vader he died, so the old guy we see dying is not Anakin but Vader (what?) it makes sense according to him that we see the younger version when he died as Anakin.A very important thing to note would be that the sound mixing is awful, this can be specially noticed in Episode IV, the dialogues sometimes sound clear and some other times don't, they switch from stereo to mono and it is just too difficult to let it pass unnoticed if you have a home theater sound.The extras are good enough to spend some time watching them, being `Empire of dreams' the highlight of the DVD. The documentaries are more of an `everybody admires Lucas' thing; funny fact is that Peter Jackson is present in most of the documentaries and in all his appearances he says how much he admires Lucas' work. No matter how disappointing this can result, even the ones who hated it like me will end up buying it if they haven't already, after all, that's what makes us fans, isn't it?	3.0	Totally disappointing	2005-07-12	12	9	3

That being said I have always been a huge star wars fan. I remember having luke's x-wing fighter that had an R2 that you pressed down to make the wings move, very cool! So to me this has always been the classic ""Trilogy"" I've never understood people's dislike of Jedi I think it's above Empire! To me A New Hope is a good intro but I've always been a HUGE Luke Skywalker fan so you could see why Jedi would be my favorite as Luke really comes into his own in Jedi and is really a bad ass, where in ANH he's just a teenage nerd who lives on a desert planet. Yes he saves the day but it's more luck than power.Ok so to the DVD's, like I said I never saw the O.G's in theaters so I can't say I've really seen these films. When they were re-realesed in '97 I got a taste of what it was like to be there in '77. HOWEVER the changes always bothered me, I HATE the Jabba scene in IV. I love when han steps on Jabba's ""Tail"" soo corny, and the song in Jedi, bleeh. I don't mind some of the scenery shots like in cloud city ect.. I think these are good changes, but sometimes very out of place. Would someone please tell LuCASH that when you make a moive your suppose to leave it in it's original form as sort of a time peice. But this new thing of changing classics (E.T I'm looking right at you) is stupid. Someone should take these films away from lucas because if he continue's there'll be nothing left of the O.G's. Someone made a good point on here, Lucash didn't write or direct the two standout movies in this trilogy, and it shows. With the ""New"" Tilogy there is so much cheesy diolouge and pointless love story mumbo jumbo and ""lore"" that Lucash has made up. (Matrix Reloaded I'm looking at you) Seeing yoda fight is cool but over all there pretty weak.Ok so the picture and sound are INCREDIBLE!! I never imagined these movies could look so good! In a word astounding. So I've read another review from an employee of Lucas and he said that these DVD's were just because of a demand for them, and the fact that DVD's are going to be replaced eventully lucas decided to put the SE's on DVD insted of spend the time to fully re-tool the O.G's. So with that in mind you can't get too mad. I understand that they were working on Revenge at the time and had no time to do these DVD's so I understand why they wanted to wait till all the movies where out so they can make a Ultamite box set wich will include the O.G movies. To this is say great! These movies are popular for a reason, and it ain't from the '97 re-realease. I understand trying to reach a new audience but geez why not let those movies stand on there own, yes the new trilogy makes the old ones look very out dated but THEY WHERE MADE IN THE LATE 70'S EARLY 80'S!! good lord, if Cassablanca was updated every 10 years we'd have J-Lo in it and a song by ashlee simpson. My point is that movies like this don't need to be updated, yes they look cheesy now but it's a time and place, when you screw with it it just cheepens the whole thing. I mean everyone probably hates their movies when they see how different they can make them now but that's not the point, let them be! Like I said these movies did not gain popularity because they were re-realeased, they were popular because the characters are great and the story is awsome! Just leave it, don't become a whore to CGI, I think since '97 when CGI started to show up everywhere, we've learned and I hope Lucas has that CGI can't carry a film. Take the new Trilogy, great CGI but no story! No stand out characters, boring diolouge. I LOVE these films even with all the changes I STILL love it, but to me the CGI is cheesy, it was made in a time when CG was still in it's infant stages, and I'm sure after seeing Golum in LOTR george wants to go back and change it again. And frankly I say he shouldn't this is the point, you can never stay ahead of Technology, it's always going to get better. So is george going to ""Update"" these movies every 10 years? By the end we'll have a 10 minute Ewok song and dance, and Jar Jar will show up in cloud city or something, so lame. Wow long review but the point is get this box set because the DVD's look great. But know that this is not the O.G fims, you'll have to wait until 2007 for the HD's in there O.G form. Can't wait!!"	5.0	Thee Trilogy!	2005-05-06	18	8	10

I am wondering about the new footage that has been rumard to have been added.  I dont know if they should be messing around with a masterpiece, but since Lucus has made the prequals, it would be nice to have them make more sense.  The 4th disc should be cool with the episode III stuff about the vader suite and all, I just hope they dont give to much away.

I don't understand the big fuss over the special editions only being released. People are so anal over a few extra scenes and added footage to closer match the original vision for the films. I'll buy the trilogy and I'll enjoy it too because I'm not someone who is scared to have a little change in the movies. George Lucas probably didn't even see the sense in releasing the original versions in the first place since it's all right there in the special edition, and it's how he wanted the films in the first place.

Let's hope so!Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope:1.The Imperial March has been added to Darth Vader's firstappearance on Princess Leia's ship. 2.The lightsaber effects have been redone and the frame jumps of lightsabers being turned on has been removed. 3. There's a new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate. 4. The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds. 5. The original shooting scene between Han and Greedo has been restored. 6. When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbence in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it aswell. 7. Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded foruse with all the stormtroopers and Boba Fett in all the movies. 8. The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been remade. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene. 9.The Death Star battle is more epic  10. There's a new scene with Vader goes to Coruscant in the same building at the end of Attack of the Clones and inform the Emperor of a new potential who is strong in the Force. 11. Chewbacca now gets a medal.Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back1.The battle of Hoth is enhanced with a ground battle between the Rebel soldiers and stormtroopers 2. Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels. 3. Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions.Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi1.Jabba the Hutt is now a combination of the puppet andCGI. 2. The Rancor is CGI 3. Yoda is CGI. Yoda disappears leaving his clothes behind like Obi-Wan now. 4. The  love theme Across the Stars is inserted when Luke is talking with Leia about their mother. 5. In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious 6. Lightsaber effects shadows on the floor are gone. 7. During Anakin's death scene it starts with a sad rendition of the Imperial March and slowly evolves into Anakin's Theme. 8. Sebastian Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with HaydenChristensen. 9.Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christensen.	5.0	The Ultimate Archival editions?- I hope it's true.	2004-06-04	39	26	13

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2SWSEPMKO6ZO3	Ryguy	I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid.  I had the originals on VHS back in a time when they were released separately and they were fun to watch.  But VHS is a dead form of media now, and now DVD is the superior form of entertainment.  When I found that Star Wars was being released as a box set on DVD, I was estatic.  But the news came that it was going to be the special editions, ONLY.  Now why would anyone think that just releasing a revised edition of a movie by itself is a smart idea?  Other directors or studio's have released special editions of past movies, i.e. Independence Day, E.T., Terminator 2 to name a few, they also released that special edition as an extra with the ORGINAL movie, so you can enjoy the original if you didn't like the extras(Independence Day Special Edition sucks balls by the way).But I can't understand Lucas's logic behind this decision to just release the special editions.  True it is his movies and it's a story that he wishes to tell to masses, but he should be grateful as a storyteller and artist and release the ORIGINAL editions with them to show appreciation to the fans and to show how much he has advanced or how much he's taking for advantage nowadays when back then it was so much harder, and the end result was still nothing short of amazing.I didn't mind the special editions whatsoever, there were points where I agreed with others(the greedo scene, the added Jaba the Hut scene, etc.) on how they were unnecessary and just made it stupid, but overall I was happy.  And seeing the new changes for the DVD release, I must say the only noticeably change that I've seen AND am very upset about is in Return of the Jedi.  I mean what the hell?!  Why would he put the punk from Episode 2 in there instead of the older Anakin.  I heard it was because when you die as a Jedi, you assume the form of your Jedi form, which in Lucas's view is the horrid actor that portrayed Anakin from Episode 2.  But how is that possible?  He was a little prick throughout the whole movie, he sure as hell wasn't pure.  But honestly, the older Anakin seen in the original changed and converted back to be a Jedi in that he relized his ways and conformed, helping his son and basically apologizing for what he has done, thus converting back to a Jedi and being pure.  (...)In conclusion, this a decent set, could've been ALOT better, but oh well.	3.0	A very nice set, but why aren't the ORINGINAL originals in?	2004-10-21	6	5	1

Maybe to those who have only seen the movie once, but to long time fans this will be a disappointment. Through out the movies you will find small changes in dialogue and word order. Most noticeable are the changes to Yoda famous quotes. The result is a movie which feels awkward to anyone who knows the dialogue well. Additionally the graphical updates often added extra background. In the cloud city, views of the outside were added almost haphazardly. The result is odd lighting and views that seem out of place, once again Lucas is becoming too dependant on technology. Also the DVD compression was not perfectly done. There are several places where smoke appears pixilated leaving an impression that the DVD was just not done right. Oh, did I mention, volume levels have also been changed, blaster noises are sometimes almost silent, while other times overwhelmingly loud.All I can say is, ""Lucas, I want the ORIGINAL SERIES back.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ANPDYTK0G96IM	Sajji Baba	"I just got my Blu Rays of episodes 4-6 and started my weekend by watching Empire Strikes Back.Firstly, my system:Mitsubishi 1080p projector on a 120"" screen.Denon receiver with Dolby Tru HD and DTS HDAtlantic Technology Speakers 5.1PS3Picture quality:  Amazing!  No graininess with great color balance.  Original aspect ratio.  I've seen the DVDs (including the issue that contains the original theatrical release - that was not in anamorphic wide screen, but original!), the laser discs (both new release and the mega box set that has each movie spanning 3 discs!) and of course the VHS versions that were originally pan and scan.  Of course, the Blu Ray's picture quality cannot be matched by previous technologies.  I don't know how else to describe the picture, except that it looks like it was filmed using recent technologies, not 35 mm film stock from the 1970s.  If you see some other Blu Ray transfers from the '70s and '80s, you'll notice a significant deterioration and graininess that's typical of the low quality film stock from those decades.  Take a look, for example, at the Blu Ray transfer of Ghostbusters and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about!  This experience, however, was just awesome.Sound quality:  The people that invented THX were, of course, going to do an awesome job and they did not disappoint.  These movies are presented in DTS HD - which I feel sounds better than Dolby Tru HD (that's not included).  Dolby Digital and DTS standard audio tracks are also on the disks, but why have a Blu Ray player if you can't enjoy the HD audio!?!  I think the sound outdid the picture quality!  There was a perfect sound emersion with excellent use of the surround channels.  Not just gimmicky noises that most other movies employ, this experience really made you feel like you were in the middle of all the action.  If you have a well calibrated 5.1 setup, pay close attention to the rainy sequence with Luke and Yoda in Empire; rain is coming down all around you!  Simply beautiful!  During the asteroid sequence, the surround channels are used with extreme precision; as ships come from the background or fade into the background, you feel it.  The .1 aspect?  The sub woofers are perfectly balanced throughout the movie.  Again, never a gimmicky use of this most important channel.  The subs rumble with great precision, just like the surrounds.  The battle on Hoth was simply perfect with regard to the use of surrounds and sub.  I never had to adjust the volume to adjust from dialog to action sequences - that was the whole point of Lucas' original mission with THX balancing.  You should hear the dialog when it's time to hear it and the action sounds shouldn't overpower the rest of the movie.  I often find myself lowering volume during crazy action sequences and raising the volume to hear dialog in lesser quality sound mixes...even from modern productions.  Not with this movie, the balance was just perfect.  This will become a new reference standard for testing sound systems!Regarding Lucas meddling with the originals?  I don't really care.  Mostly because I think Empire Strikes Back is the best one of all 6 and he really didn't mess with this one much!  There are some CGI flight sequences that don't take anything away from the movie, in fact, I think they add to it.  Thank you George!!!  Star Wars, of course has crazy meddling, with Jaba and new creatures...just too distracting.  And I never really liked Return of the Jedi - I thought it was very cheesy with the Ewoks.  So if you're like me and want to relive the best movie ever (in my opinion), then these Blu Rays can't be beat.Worth every penny, even if it's just to watch Empire Strikes Back.  Beware though, this box set only includes the 3 movies and no bonuses material.  The movies do have audio commentary, but no other special features.  I'm ok with that - I think you can enjoy ""the making of"" stuff only so many times before it gets boring."	5.0	I just saw the Blu Ray Empire Strikes Back and it was AWESOME!	2011-09-16	13	11	2

Johnson ""misterscooter"""	QUICK REVIEW OF THE SET:  These versions aren't quite the movies I saw as a kid or have on VHS but they are pretty darn close to the same.  Lucas decided to make changes, for better or for worse and for whatever reason.  I'm glad the movies are on DVD despite these changes because I want them to last longer than the tapes that will wear out.It is good to see the included extras but I wanted more and that is the main reason I lowered the rating.  Don't expect anything on the level of the Lord of the Rings platinum sets.  I do appreciate the commentary on all three films, though.Watching them again, with the recent context of episodes I-III, I realize how much more I will enjoy IV-VI as I grow older and my kids start to watch (and they won't care or notice the changes unless someone points them out).  The reason that we have the new movies is because of the originals.

I happen to like the trilogy as it originally was and I am not old enough to be a part of the ""old generation"". The add-ons will incorporate the abyssmal prequels with the old Star War movies. Incorporating in particular a younger Anakin ""wraith"" at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. To AVOID BEING CENSORED AGAIN, I will say that this is a GREAT FANTASTIC IDEA! This isn't a personal issue but alot reviewers seem to be abusing the privledge of writing a review as means of ""firewalling"" so, I want to be different and go ahead and say that I think George Lucas can do what he wants to his films, I as a consumer will have the right not to be taken in by it. I think it would've been nice to get a DVD of the original unedited version along with the edited version of the trilogy, then it would've made both parties (revisionists and old schoolers) happy. It would've made Lucas more moolah megabucks! But he didn't so I can live with that. I can live with not spending any money on this product.

Piazza	This isn't Sammy, actually it's his wife jen.  my husband loves these movies, but not quite to the extent i do.  he saw them for the first time he can remember when we first got together four years ago. i grew up on this stuff.  i'm only twenty, so i don't remember going to either of these films at the theater, but i don't think it really mattered.  they are just as big on the old tv, but i must say when my younger brother and i went to the new release of the Star Wars special edition, it was amazing.  these movies to me are just perfect.  they are not comparable to any other movies ever made, or any to ever be made.  there is everything you could ever want in these films and nothing is ever over done.  nothing cheesy, no corny jokes and nothing overexaggerated.  there is happiness, victory and sorrow but not so much that you can't relate to what's going on and how everyone is feeling. i hope no one ever sins and redoes these films. there is nothing that could ever make better what has been made, there are no actors that could ever suffice for the roles (if for some reason you would be reading this, i love you mark hamill; and episode I took awhile to get used to without the dashing trio-quartet, sorry chewie).to anyone who has yet to experience these films, they really should.  they display everything fantastic about film making, everything entertaining that has been lost over the past few decades in the film industry.  bravo to all who participated in this creation, it will be remembered and cherished forever.and for all you teens who just won't submit, kevin smith refers to Star Wars religiously in clerks, mallrats and there's that new jay and silent bob strike back movie.  it can't be that bad, now can it?	5.0	Just Perfect	2001-09-10	3	3	0

Of course its only in standard DVD format.  As great an option this is (exactly what I wanted) dont spend 180 bucks on it.  As much I love star wars (lucas is a visionary and his movies are legendary..) lucas is greedy son of a B... When I bought this set back during its release, it must have been close 30-40 bucks.  Im sure lucas knows that the vast majority of star wars fans would prefer the original theatrical release (for obvious reasons) and thus probably likes to watch those same fans fight for these versions.Though my advice is to check up on ebay and other auction sites.  Ideally, it would have been nice if the Blu-ray discs had AT LEAST the original theatrical version in standard-DVD format....but I guess Lucas enjoys playing the waiting game...making more money off us.	5.0	THIS is the set you are all probably looking for...	2011-09-05	4	4	0

Though I like The Empire Strikes Back better, this is my second favorite Star Wars film though it has extremely  heavy competition from Return of the Jedi. The cast is wonderful, including  Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Alec Guinnes, whom was  nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The action is excellent such as a  laser fight through the Death Star and a spectacular space fight where  Rebel X and Y wings battle Inperial TIE Fighters and turbolasers from the  Death Star while trying to destroy the Death Star. R2-D2 and C-3PO are  great, as is Chewbacca. David Prowse plays Darth Vader and James Earl Jones  performs his voice, resulting as a great character.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AINFVSQGK1SSD	S. Bridges	"While most of these reviews rave about how great were the ""old"" masterpieces,  most miss the point of how awesome this DVD release is. I will elaborate on this below. However, let me start by stating I could not disagree more strongly with the indignant whine: ""How could [George Lucas] tamper with a masterpiece?"" `Reviews' of this sort are really not telling us about the DVDs and actually miss the most salient aspects of the movies altogether. Star Wars was a great movie both because of the themes it portrays as well as its characters, which are subtle variations on archetypes, and how they reinforce the movies both dramatically and thematically. The special effects do not define the movies, and unfortunately detracted in some ways from the originals.My 5-star assessment is based on the following points:New scenes: Let's face it, the original Star Wars trilogy had a couple of flaws (gasp!) They lacked wide establishment scenes, and the continuity was a bit spotty as some scene changes used gimmicky fades in lieu of more rich representative transition scenes. They also do not integrate that well with the more rich canvas of the episodes 1 and 2. The added scenes for the most fix these issues. They actually help the overall arc of the story by smoothing the pacing and flow of the individual movies while tying together, visually and thematically, episodes 4-6 with 1 and 2. I cite the Sand Crawler drive across the desert or the much reviled new drive into Mos Eisley both in ANH.Sound: Puhlease. Listen to one of the lightsaber duels. `Nuff said. The sound remastering is amazing. To get a rough approximation of how the movies would sound, watch one of the old trailers included on the DVD set to see how different the sound and score are in the old format versus the new THX / Digital.Visuals: The visual remastering is so good; the movie does not look any where near its age. Crisp, clean scenes look as though this flick rolled of the presses in the last year not 25 years ago. From a visual standpoint, these movies stand close to episodes 1-2, which as most know were 100% digital.Extras: The extras are good but not spectacular. They include a long but not so deep documentary, original trailers, game previews, stills, art, and my favorites: three featurettes, and what is referred to as Episode III preview (this is really a feature on Darth Vader's story arc.) Episodes 1 and 2 extras were as good or better. The reason being is their extras were created during production with the DVD releases in mind. Fans of the Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings DVDs will find these documentaries a little pedestrian. That is not really an indictment of the Star Wars DVDs as much as a credit to the LOTR folks and how high the bar has been raised.These movies are a must have for fans of the entire story, episodes 1-6. The additions create a much more consistent and cohesive story. And they are just so visually and sonically spectacular.If you are a die hard fan of the originals and don't like the recent additions to the ensemble including episodes 1 and 2, the extras will probably frustrate you. So keep watching your worn-out betamax versions."	5.0	"Aditions are worthwhile - ignore the ""purists"""	2004-09-22	13	3	10
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AOCKLUMUZIAM	S. Cargnel	"This is hands-down, quite simply, the greatest release in dvd history.....so far anyway (we all know theres more Star Wars coming). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was not a completely comprehensive set with the most comprehensive features possible (Lucas is holding out on that for the future). For what it is, and what it encompasses, no other set available can touch it, especially in the sound and picture department. Now, to address the Special Editions ('97 and 04') vs. The Originals:1. First, these movies are made by and are the property of GEORGE LUCAS. As the creator, maker, and owner they are his to do what he wishes just as is the right of any creator, maker, and owner of anything. Its a level playing field people, any other filmmaker has the same rights to his/her films. Lets not throw sour grapes because he chose to exercise his rights, even if no one else does. Besides, his intentions were no mystery. He said it way back in the seventies and eighties that he was disappointed with how the trilogy turned out and that only about 25% of his vision had been realized due to technological limitations. Follow these thoughts to conclusion and we all knew what was coming. 2. The changes he made make sense and are necessary! As soon as Lucas decided to begin making the prequel trilogy in the 90's a situation which never before occurred in cinema history occurred. Someone was making films to show what happened decades before the events of the existing stories. Yes, Lucas invented the prequel. For the first time a trilogy of films made long ago came chronologically long-after a trilogy of films about to be made. Obviously things had to be done to maintain continuity throughout. Shouldn't Palpatine be the same actor from beginning to end? Of course, especially the same gender. Bobba Fett's voice should be identical to Jango's considering they are clones of each other whether the voice is as ""cool"" or not. Now the big one, the moment Anakin became Vader he ceased to be the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. Kenobi says it right in Return of the Jedi. Therefore when this event occurrs in Episode III, the Force spirit of Anakin, remains at that point in time. He is a young man. This is why we see him as Hayden at the end of Return of the Jedi because he is redeemed and on the Light side again as the Jedi he once was. If he died unredeemed as Vader Im sure we would see something quite different as his spirit stands on the Dark side with Palpatine, Dooku, and Darth Maul. So this change too makes sense. Its all part of consistent and proper story telling as any good story teller, no less filmmaker, will know.  3. Finally, the question we need to ask ourselves, sentimentallity aside, is ""Do the changes Lucas made really change the story at all?"" The answer is NO, if anything, they enhance the story and clear up problems with the finer details. There arent any characters that do anything radically different or out of character given what we already know. No one lives when they originally died and no one dies when they originally lived. No characters are scrapped from films they were once in, the actors are made consistent throughout now. People fell in love with Star Wars for the characters and the stories their lives tell, that remains the same and thats whats important to remember.....not whether Han or Greedo shoots first.  So, if what you fell in love with about the trilogy was the characters and their story go out and buy this set!  One last cathartic note, leave the Ewoks alone already. Lets stop with the ""cute teddy bear bashing"". In films there are metaphors told through characters. Godzilla was a metaphor for the bombing of Hiroshima and The Blob was a metaphor for McCarthyism. The Ewoks are a metaphor for the simple, unsophisticated, technologically unadvanced defeating the technologically, superior super-power because they got arrogant and careless.  Its a deep statement shown in a simple, cute way, so you dont even realize it unless you think about it. We live in a time where people dont want to think while theyre ""being entertained"" anymore. Thats why we live in a society where ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" can be #1 at the box office when 25 years or more ago such things never saw screen time."	4.0	STOP, READ, and THINK	2004-09-22	22	13	9

It's one thing to be anti-corporation.  It's another thing to be anti-fan/anti-audience.  People loved the originals not necessarily because of the visuals, which were stunning, and still are.  They loved the originals because of the acting and the story, which is why the last two additions to the Saga have been widely panned.  George should swallow his pride and realize that having strong principles isn't always a demonstration of good character.  Sometimes you have to realize that you have to please others as well, and not just yourself.Kudos to Mr. Lucas for having the guts to stand up to the corporate film industry system.

Honestly, I also liked the updated special effects on the cinematic reissues for the 25th (I think) anniversary.So let's get the crap out of the way.  The changes Lucas made FOR the DVD - necessary?  Some yes, some no.  It was nice to see Ian McDiarmid being the emperor in ""Empire Strikes Back"" (sorry, Mr. Revill.  I at least hope you still get royalties), and the script rewrites make more sense now given what we know of the backstory.  But still, but still....we didn't need Boba Fett's dialogue redubbed.  We also didn't need even MORE stormtroopers for Han Solo to run away from.  Another thing that, not only we didn't need, but was unnecessary and puzzling - replacing Sebatian Shaw at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"" with Hayden Christiansen.  Why?  And why not replace Alec Guinness with Ewan Macgregor to make it a matched set?  My biggest complaint is with other ""Star Wars"" veterans; why didn't Lucas include the cleaned-up originals with the altered ones?  I guess we all know the answer to this one, but it bothers me still.The changes, however, are minor and don't get in the way of the goodness that are the original trilogy of films.  The bonus disc is a nice touch as well, bringing the sheer joy of behind-the-scenes goodness up to date with what made him famous.  It was good to see they added and expanded on ""Empire of Dreams,"" since they showed a version of it first on A&E.;  One doesn't get the feeling of reheated leftovers that sometimes accompanies a DVD which throws an EPK or ""HBO Behind-The-Scenes"" doc as a ""special feature.""  Add in the commentary (good overall), great still galleries, and excellent promo spots (it was way cool to see the TV ad for ""Star Wars"" I remember back again), and it's a good buy.  I hope, though, that Mr. Lucas resists putting out any more ""special limited editions.""  Oh, well, one can hope!"	4.0	Necessary Purchase - Tweaks And All	2006-09-29	5	3	2

I'd like to see them in their theatrical releases with state-of-the-art picture and sound quality. No laserdisc masters. I want to see George Lucas undo what he did. Yes, correct the big error he made to his films with a large eraser!These films were treated poorly over the years starting with 1997s Special Editions and the 2004 DVD release. They do not need tweaking. Why fix something that so many fans love?  I'm not against the changes, but I hate not having a choice. I want the choice to choose which version I want to see.

I've owned the original Star Wars trilogy on no less than 3 different formats (VHS, Laserdic, DVD) and have several fan edits at my disposal.  To say I'm an original trilogy Star Wars nerd is taking it lightly.So when Lucas decided to clean up the films shot by shot, to present the most pristine print of Star Wars possible, I was enthused.  With hopes that he would present the trilogy in its best form yet, I could forgive him for making *some* of the changes in the 1997 re-release.  Shots of outside vistas as Leia hurries to intercept Boba Fett in Cloud City are fine.  I can forgive him for painting those in.But this release is a travesty.  Between Tarkin's screwed up audio on the line ""Then name the system!"", the audio engineers eliminating the trumpeting brass as the X-wings plunge down to the surface of the Death Star, Luke's wussie scream as falls into the bowels of Cloud City, don't get me started.  Not to mention Han and Greedo's fight, Anakin's ghost, etc, etc.  The list goes on and on.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.Admit defeat and wait patiently until either George comes to his senses, or dies.

Thre was a point where Luke was floating in the tank and you see this red goo/dye injected into the tank. Then they pull him out and Leia or 21B (the droid) says something like, 'The Bacta are growing well, the scars should be gone in a day or two...'When I saw 'Empire' in the theater back in 1980 there was another scene I will never forget that I have NEVER seen since except on the earliest of (bootleg?)VHS copies.2 - In the battle scene on Hoth in 'The Empire Strikes Back', right before General Veers is about to destroy the power generators, Hobby 'kamikazees' the walker with his snowspeeder. He lets out a blood curdling 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!' on his way in. You see the snowspeeder coming in from General Veers perspective from inside the walker then you see the General - the expression on his face is priceless. The walker's head then explodes as the snowspeeder hits it. Another walker then destroys the power gens a little later. The power gen explosion is also different, it is a more pulled-back shot with full view of a nuclear mushroom cloud superimposed over what were the generators.Also!CUT SCENE/AUDIO #3When the snowtroopers enter the base immediately following the battle, there are some scenes cut out of them rushing in to the command center and the audio has been changed to eliminate a PA announcement that says, 'Imperial troops have entered the base, Imperial troops have entered the base!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A11BOI8VHJIAGZ	Scott Kenny	"The original three Star Wars movies are easily some of the best movies ever made. George Lucas has changed that with his incessant, pointless editing. Instead of Han starting out as a cut-throat, which he was, Lucas tries to paint a prettier picture by having him shoot second. Then the ridiculous scene with the CGI Jabba, which stands out worse than anything, continues the downhill slide. The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.Just like Darth Vader now says ""NOOOO"" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this ""Star Wars"" release."	1.0	Edited to nothingness	2011-09-17	10	8	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"When Star Wars opened in 1977, theaters were packed, with audiences waiting in lines to see the ""space opera"" that George Lucas had masterfully crafted.  The movie, which became one of the top-grossing films of all time, changed forever the way science fiction movies were made, elevating the genre from the realm of B movies to serious fiction, so much so that the original Star Wars movie, subtitled ""A New Hope"", was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar that year.The technology of the time was somewhat limited, and though it was considered ""cutting edge"" in its day, special effects limited the vision which George Lucas had hoped to present to his worldwide audience.  It seemed only fitting therefore that on the anniversary of his Opus, he would return to the world of Star Wars once more, re-inventing the movie that launched a franchising monstrosity in a galazy not so far from home.What was created was the extended edition of the Star Wars movies, with a special focus on the first installment, ""A New Hope"".Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasfilm's effects house, which was in its infancy at the time Star Wars was produced, was brought back on the project once more to expand the film into the vision Lucas had originally envisioned.  While all three films were to be ""touched up"" for the 20 year anniversary release, it was ""A New Hope"" that was given the biggest facelift.  Scenes that had been cut were re-introduced to the film, new scenes, with the aid of some cutting edge CGI were created, and the film as a whole was retouched, enhancing the color and sound through the use of digital processing.The movie opened with much of the same hype as it had 20 years earlier.  Storylines, which had been developed in ""the Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi"" were fleshed out some in this first film, and for the first time, we saw the famous scene where Han has his initial run-in with Jabba the Hutt (a scene that was omitted in the original release due to a lack of effects technology to create the slug-like Jabba).  Additional sequences included a greatly enhanced Mos-Eisley spaceport, full of droids, strange alien lifeforms and a barrage of businesses and settlements that gave the city a much greater scope than the original.Similar additions were created for the sequels, though most of the revision work there surrounding the enhancement of exisitng scenes.  As with ""New Hope"", the films were cleaned up, providing new digital effects where blue screen and miniatures had been used previously.  The changes, more subtle than the first, are still impressive, especially the altered ending to ""The Return of the Jedi.""  Though this reviewer will not ruin the ending for the viewer, lets simply state that there will no longer be a need to suffer through the Ewoks song that seemed sadly anti-climatic at the end of the original release of the film.The special effects in these films play more like characters than situations, and ILM has done a great job of cleaning them up.  Especially impressive are the new fight/flight sequences at the end of ""A New Hope"" when the Rebel Alliance is engaged with the Empire with the intent of destroying the Death Star.  The new visuals, which were blended in many cases with existing effects, are much more fluid, providing a greater sense of reality to the viewer.For anyone unfamiliar with the story surrounding the Star Wars franchise, it begins with a farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), whose greatest dream is to be a pilot in the Imperial Fleet.  When his uncle purchases a pair of droids for their farm, he uncovers a secret message recorded by the beautiful Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) for the mysterious Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi (Alec Guiness), which begins a string of events that will forever change Luke's life.  With the aid of rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca, Ben and Luke, along with C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2, head out to Alderan where they hope to aid the rebel alliance in overthrowing the Empire by destroying the Emperor's most lethal weapon, the dreaded Death Star; a spacestation capable of destroying entire planets.  Upon their arrival,they run head-long into the Death Star, which has recently destroyed the planet of Alderan, Leia's homeworld.  Their ship captured, the crew escape capture with the aid of Han's smuggling compartments built into the floor of his ship.  They set out into the Death Star to rescue the princess, dis-engage the tractor beam and ultimately return to the secret base of the Rebel Alliance.  Kenobi, whose actions differ some, sets out to confront Darth Vader (David Prowse (voiced by James Earl Jones)), ambassador to the Emporer and former pupil of Kenobi.The balance of the story, and the sequels, are for the viewer to discover.  These films, which have been digitally transfered to video cassette in both wide screen and full screen editions, are spectacular, with a clarity of sound and color that is better than any other release of the films to date.  The extras on the video cassette are sparse, save for a three-part ""Making Of"" serving as an introduction to each of the films.  Narrated most by Leonard Maltin (film critic) and George Lucas, these introductions to offer a good glimpse into the process Lucas and his sizable staff undertook in the re-creation of the many sequences in each film.As the original Star Wars Trilogy is not yet available on DVD, this collection is probably the closest transfer in existance of these films to a digital video.  The videos are clean, with enhanced sound and color that really do make the movies seem as if they were brand new, instead of a re-release of a film that is over 20 years old.  The additions to each of the film are enjoyable, though some look contrived, especially the sequences surrounding Vader's return to his Star Destroyer at the end of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". (You will note that the general who meets him at the end of Empire is the same as the one who greets him at the beginning of ""Jedi"".  It would seem that Lucas spliced some spare footage from ""Jedi"" into ""Empire"" to expand the scene.)Though many critics complain that the films should not have been doctored, the extended edition nonetheless does offer up a fresh look for the films and, for the uninitiated, the closest opportunity available to experiencing the Star Wars franchise the way it was seen when it first packed the theaters in 1977.  These films have stood the test of time, and now, with the release of all three in this collector's edition, are a worthwhile addition to any video library.-Scott Kolecki"	5.0	A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far Away....	2004-01-15	7	5	2

For example, David Prowse (Darth Vader) talks about his ""casting session.""  Warwick Davis & Kenny Baker discuss how Warwick got the Ewok lead the day of shooting when Kenny came down w/food poisoning.  Alan Ladd, the exec at Fox who supported Lucas, discussed the political battles at Fox when nothing was going right during the shooting of Star Wars.  Walter Cronkite & Bill Moyers talk about the impact that the trilogy had on popular culture, Lucas' interest in Joseph Campbell, etc. The list goes on and on.

The new changes actually help the continuity and make it feel like the movies fit together better when you watch all six.  The only new change that bothered me at first were boba fett's voice being changed to match Jango's, and young Anakin substituted at the very end of ROTJ.  Now that I am used to them though, they don't bother me at all.  In fact, I believe that is a big reason people hate them (and the new trilogy for that matter).  People just aren't used to them!

It breathes new life into a good, but old movie.I even wish they would have taken it a step further and updated some of the lo-res computer graphics in the movie.  They look like Pong.The puppets seem kind of campy looking today, and maybe they could have done a little something with those too.I guess there's no way to cover up some of the stupid dialogue between Han and Lea, but that's another matter.I do agree with others that both versions should be available, but I'm guessing that would be expensive.

I'm not sure why modern writers and directors don't feel like they can make a re-make without ""modernizing"" it with trendy issues.

To me, adding CGI to this film is like painting a beard on the Mona Lisa. The Greedo-shoots-first thing is annoying, but I find the Jabba scene to be much worse. A CGI Jabba is superimposed over the original actor who played the part, and through the ""magic"" of computer special effects, we get to see a ridiculous moment with Han walking over Jabba's tail (this was done because Ford walked behind the actor in the original scene, something that proved problematic when the CGI Jabba was added). So much for the most feared criminal in the galaxy.It's a shame that Lucas won't (at this stage, anyway) make the original theatrical version available alongside the ""special"" edition. It'd make every Star Wars fan deliriously happy, but it seems that Lucas doesn't care about the fans who grew up with the film as it originally was. It's also a huge slap in the face to the many filmgoers who saw this film repeatedly over the years and who purchased it in its various video/laserdisc incarnations.If Lucas sticks to ditching the original version and only releases the SE on DVD, then I won't be buying it."	2.0	Good news:Star Wars on DVD.

I will buy this only because its the only set offered, but I beg Lucas to bring back the original films and put them onto DVD.	4.0	Why does it have to be special edition?!	2004-04-05	1	1	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A337F7O1GO8RRC	Sean	This review is over the September 16, 2011 Blu-ray release (the box with vader's head covered in scenes from the movies). At the moment this is the only release of episodes 4-6 on blu-ray (the 1-6 is basically the same release). NOTE THAT THIS VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE THEATRICAL RELEASE.That All Caps aside, this is an excellent release.PROS- The blu-ray quality is excellent- 3 disc set, in a small compact form- Separate from episodes 1-3CONS- Doesn't contain the theatrical release- blu-ray quality means that the CGI add-ons are easy to spot and look pretty bad IMO (even a person watching the series for the first time can tell these aren't suppose to be there)- CheapNote: if you want the Theatrical Release (at the point of this review) you either need to get the old VHS or the November 4, 2008 DVD release (has vader and luke clashing with lightsabers, lots of blue, with vader's helm in the background)Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Theatrical Edition)	3.0	Great Release of the Re-Released Version	2011-12-28	8	8	0

Sorry, but I have disliked Lucas ever since I tried to sit through Episode One and I only persevered for a grand fifteen or so minutes because I was waiting, hoping, and praying that Jar Jar would get set on fire. He didn't (I don't think) and I went back to sleep. Go to hell, Lucas. You have made a mockery out of something that was sentimental to me.	1.0	This is just sick- zero stars	2004-09-12	37	20	17

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"We can say what we want about George Lucas and his short-comings with his Star Wars films.  We can moan and groan over the fact that the man is a perfectionist who can't just leave a film alone.  So, he hasn't heard the expression, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  Or if he has, he's certainly not paying attention to it.  We can also get upset that he likes to play down to his audiences.However, we sometimes forget that this is Star Wars.  It's easy to not enjoy his latest films because they did not create the stir in cinema history like his first film which literally changed the way we see movies today.  Jaws may have been the first summer blockbuster hit, but Star Wars blew the doors off.  No film like it had ever been made up until that time.  Yes, there were television shows such as Star Trek and Space 1999 that tried to jumpstart science fiction.  In many ways, they succeeded.  But there was something infinitely more magical about Star Wars.  The story is simple, while the special effects, especially for 1977, would transport the viewers to a time and place never conceived of before.First of all, these DVDs look great!  The restoration is beautifully done.  The colors have never been more vivid and alive.  Nor have the sounds.  They look better now than ever before.Star WarsDespite George Lucas's changing the title, I still think of Star Wars as the original.  To my mind, it is still the best entry second only to the Empire Strikes Back.  And, yep, George directed this one, which embodies his best work.  Perhaps it is because he didn't have the technology to bury the story and dialogue that we find a good story and decent dialogue.Even by today's standards, the opening sequence still looks fantastic as the Star Destroyer chases down the Rebel Blockade Runner with a monstrous on-board battle to follow.Alec Guiness is still wonderful as the ever-wise sage, Obi-Wan Kenobi who leads our young band of heroes on a daring rescue attempt of Princess Leia on board the dreaded Death Star.I still remember the wonderful fantasy of romping around on a huge space station blasting stormtroopers.  Lucas plays right into the dreams of every hot-blooded American boy.  Cowboys quickly seemed superfluous by comparison to having a laser gun!The final battle still holds up and is still George Lucas's best space battle out of all the films he's done.  It's more personal and gripping as Luke Skywalker attempts to destroy the Death Star with Darth Vader about to blow him to bits.  The is especially true as his shipmates are destroyed one by one.The performances are great too.  Harrison Ford as the sarcastic Han Solo reminds you of his more likeable character to follow, Indiana Jones.  Mark Hamill also turns in his best performance of the trilogy.  Carrie Fisher is great, but her best performance would actually be in the next film.  And, as always, there's the loveable droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 (Lucas's favorite character).Most of the additional scenes are good.  I still don't like Han Solo chasing stormtroopers around a corner to find himself facing 100 of them.  They're just standing there!  I find this unlikely, especially when he's chased back by the same small squad that he chased to begin with.  I found the original version of him running into a dead end more humorous and effective.Empire Strikes BackStill the best entry in both the original trilogy and overall.  Empire Strikes Back is one of the best science fiction films ever made.  George Lucas hands over the directing to Irving Kushner.  Aside from Episode 3, this is the darkest of the films with Darth Vader, obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker, chasing Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon all over the galaxy.The shift from the hot desert of Tatooine to the ice planet of Hoth is an effective move, especially the climactic battle in the snow that sends the rebel forces running for their lives.Finally, we are introduced to one of the best characters, not only in Star Wars, but cinema history: Yoda.  Frank Oz provides a charm to Yoda as Luke, at first, does not know who he is.  Yoda may stand only 2 feet tall, but his wisdom is colossal as Luke quickly realizes when Yoda forces him to confront his fears.Let the Han vs. Leia begin!  The banter between these two characters is simply classic!  Right from the get-go, these two, unwilling to share their true feelings, find themselves locked in a one-liner combat.  ""I'd just as soon kiss a wookie,"" snaps Leia.  ""I can arrange that!  You could use a good kiss!"" Han fires back.Everything from the asteroid field to Han's fate in the carbon freezing chamber in Cloud City is perfect.  But nothing prepares you for the dreaded secret as Luke Skywalker chooses to face Darth Vader.  The sad part is that new viewers will never have this surprise because obviously Luke is Anakin's son.  But, as a viewer back in 1980, it was simply haunting to hear Vader say, ""No, Luke.  I am your father.""  I still remember the hush that fell over the audience once those words were uttered.Empire Strikes Back is as close to perfect as any Star Wars film has come.  It balances adventure, romance, spiritual depth, and humor all in one.Return of the JediProbably few films have ever held as much anticipation as this one did.  Empire Strikes Back left us with a major cliff-hanger.  What would happen to Han Solo?  What about Luke's Jedi training that he neglected?  Who is this mysterious ""other"" that Yoda refers to?Unfortunately, Return of the Jedi is one of the weakest entries into the Star Wars saga, if not the weakest.First of all, nearly half the film is spent on Han Solo's rescue.  We find that Luke has suddenly acquired his Jedi Powers.  We don't know exactly how much time has elapsed since the end of the Empire Strikes Back.  But, the rescue of Han isn't the meat of the story.  The plot and the attempt to finally destroy the evil Empire is where the focus really belongs, and only an hour and 15 minutes or so, simply isn't long enough to do this.Revenge of the Sith was far more effective because the entire film was based on the fall of the Republic and Anakin Skywalker.  Lucas also used 2 hours and 40 minutes to do it.Another weak entry is the Ewoks.  To my mind, only Jar Jar was worse.  A little too cutsy, and entirely unbelieveable that little teddy-bears with spears could out-fight AT-STs and a legion of stormtroopers.  I understand that their objective was to provide a diversion, but even this is not very credible.  It would have been far more effective had George been able to go with his original intentions of a planet of wookies.George Lucas has said that he loves to show 3-4 things going on simultaneously.  But, he isn't very good at it.  Instead, he sacrifices a lot of story by constantly jumping between Luke and Vader, the battle on Endor, and the battle in space.  He may have been more successful, had he made the film longer so that he could devote the necessary time to each to make them even more compelling.Another problem I had was with Han Solo.  Even Harrison Ford had to practically be begged to come back as he was very dissatisfied with Han Solo.  Han goes from a confident sarcastic character to a love-lorne milksop!  All he can think about is Leia and it becomes very old, very fast.Even though Return of the Jedi is the weakest entry, I still feel the original trilogy is the best.  More attention was paid to the characters and story.There are enough extras and bonus features to keep the most avid fan busy.  The commentaries are fun to listen to.Even after all these years, you still can't go wrong with Star Wars.  And Star Wars still set the tone for all sci-fi films to follow.  My only hope is that George will leave well-enough alone.  Most of his additional footages are fine.  It will be interesting in 10-15 years to find out what changes he has in mind for the new trilogy.Enjoy the best sci-fi trilogy ever made. Somehow, you never get tired of watching them!"	5.0	Classic sci-fi series changed the way we see movies	2006-03-07	2	2	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A198COWO413ZR7	Sean Salisbury	"In 1977 I was 6 years old.  One of my earliest memories is waiting in line to see this movie just after my 6th birthday.  All summer vacation was spent playing with the action figures, flying my X-wing and having whiffle ball bat lightsaber duels with Mark down the street.  Does anyone remember nearly freezing his fingers off re-enacting the Battle of Hoth out in the snow? What about finding that long lost Snowtrooper figure after the first spring thaw?  Leia in the slave girl outfit?  C'mon guys, you know what I'm talking about.  Star Wars was life.The opening scene of the ""first"" movie, where you see Princess Leia's ship come into view, dazzles the eye.  You think to yourself, ""look at the size of that thing.""  Then, seconds later, Vader's cruiser proceeds to swallow up your entire field of vision making the first ship look like a life boat trying to escape the Titanic's death throes.  You knew you were in for a wild ride.As for the re-makes, well done.  It gives the original fans a beautiful remake to watch and gives new fans a prettier film to see.  Younger viewers spoiled by today's technology won't be so quick to dismiss these films and cheesy and poorly made when comparing them to 'The Lord of the Rings' and God help me 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.  I shudder to think of anyone comparing Harrison Ford's brash Han Solo to Depp's creepy Willy Wonka.To me, the original trilogy is just more fun to watch.  The acting is a little better.  The characters are more likable.  They get rid of the silly Ewok song at the end of 'Jedi'.  No Jake Lloyd.  All solid reasons to pick up this boxed set.  And on your way home, swing by the toy store and pick up a brand new whiffle ball bat.  You'll thank yourself later."	5.0	My opinion may be a little skewed...	2005-12-12	9	7	2

Pinnell	"The DVD versions of the original Star Wars trilogy being released are neither the original theatrical versions or the 1997 SE versions.  Apparently Lucas has made even more changes for the DVD release.  Looking at the Digital Bits website I saw a photo of the ""Force Spirits"" scene from the end of Episode VI.  The Skywalker spirit had changed to look more like Skywalker of the Prequel movies.  Myself I just want to get these on DVD.  However I think Lucas should consider his fans and maybe release a special edition set with the original versions and most recent versions packaged together.

I view the original trilogy as a fun, marginally entertaining adventure story. Let us not speak of the new trilogy. This review is going to be centered around the remastering, and the remastering only. We've ALL seen Star Wars.George Lucas may not be the egomaniacal fascist the pursits who revile his changes insinuate. But he's still ruining three great movies for a quick buck. George Lucas claims that he didn't have enough money to adequately articulate his original ""vision."" (""Vision,"" rofflecopter.) Truth is, most of the alterations, besides the boatloads of CGI, are superficial and are plot-oriented. For example, when Han choppily avoids Greedo's laser, and fires back. You didn't have enough money to fund that asinine exchange, Lucas? Sure. Besides ruining Han's character and further-sugarcoating the movies in sickeningly sweet censorship, you're also insulting my intelligence. Let's not mention the occasional dubbed-over voices.Besides those tepid, unnecessary changes... There's alot of GCI. Alot. Little CGI creatures running around doesn't make scenes seem more lively. It seems Lucas has no sense of imagination-- Out-of-place CGI raccoon monsters only accentuate the archaic nature of any special effect that wasn't tampered with. It seems cheap and plastic, just like the Star Wars universe as of late. Alot of CGI was used to add sophomoric, childish humor, cementing these films that could once capture the imaginations of all ages as mere children's movies. Changing some movies is one thing. Dulling the public's perception of art is another.George Lucas, you are no longer relevant. If anyone was grinding their teeth while skimming through this miniscule review, feel free to lynch me with ""no"" votes.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3UGIXMJHZHJY3	"Seth Cooper ""cooper76"""	"I love the Classic Star Wars Trilogy, and so I anxiously awaited its release on DVD.  The main characters, the quirky dialogue, the basic themes of the story, the sounds, the visual effects, the cool ships, the interesting creatures, THE EMPIRE, that wonderful John Williams score-the all combine to make one of the best movie series' of all time.  On a personal level, the movies are particularly endearing to me, having watched the movies since I was small.The sound and picture quality of this DVD release far exceeds any other format in which these movies have previously been released.  The Trilogy is also accompanied by a disc featuring over four hours of bonus materials, including trailers, featurettes, and a short little preview segment for Episode III-which makes me look forward to its theatrical release in May, 2005.  Unfortunately, no deleted scenes are included.  From what I understand, some of them are available in the CD-ROM ""Behind the Magic.""This release includes some small changes to the movie-changes that go beyond the 1997 Special Edition changes and additions to the Classic Trilogy.  I have mixed feelings about the SE changes.  The worst change is the ""Jedi Rocks"" song in Return of the Jedi.  Few things in life drive me absolutely up the wall, but this song is one of them.  The song is horrid and the animation is tacky and lame.  It actually makes me embarrassed to see the scene.  The original song from Jabba's Palace, ""Lapti Nek,"" was much better.  I had hoped the DVD version would see the return of the old song, but alas, that was not to be.  The Han Solo vs. Greedo change is not appreciated either-the SE version is still there.The DVD release does make an alteration in Empire Strikes Back.  Darth Vader's communication with the Hologram of The Emperor from his Super Star Destroyer is altered.  Both the face and the voice of the Emperor's hologram have been changed to make it fit in with the other Star Wars movies.  Even the dialogue is somewhat different.  I didn't really care for that change-I liked the way it was before.  The worst change made in the DVD is the insertion of the image of the young Anakin Skywalker at the very end of Return of the Jedi.  It was really awkward and bizarre and I do not like it one bit.All that nastiness aside, I still do love these movies.  They will always be among my all-time favs.  I understand that there will be a newer generation of DVDs around the corner, with even better sound and picture quality.  This will give George Lucas a chance to make even more money off of people, but if you're like me and you have already given him so much of your money, then it really won't matter to you at this point, will it?If you love Star Wars, this DVD release is a MUST!"	5.0	(4.5 stars due to silly changes) BEST It Has Ever Looked!	2004-10-11	12	8	4

If not search up Star Wars Special Edition on YouTube or Google and you'll find out what I'm talking about.

One side SE, one original, with cleaned up picture and sound.I compare this to the restoration of Michelangelo's David.  They simply cleaned him, removing dirt and restoring him to his original glory.They didn't decide David would look better with armor or a nifty new sword.  It might look great, but it's not David.My problem with the major changes are simply that they look awful. i.e. Greedo shooting first.  Besides the fact that it changes Han Solo's character and makes no sense; really how do you miss shooting at somebody 3 feet away?  It looks bizarre.  Han's head jumps in the completely unnatural fashion that makes it looks like he can willingly dislocate his spine.Rumor has it, the SFX guys did it awful on purpose in hoping Lucas wouldn't use it after seeing how phony it looked.  Well he did.The Jabba scene is pretty bad.  He looks totally unrealistic, like something out of a Nintendo game.  Han ""stepping on Jabba's tail"" is a poor cut n' paste job to get around the fact that original Jabba was a humanoid creature, and not a giant slug.Also, why does Luke scream now after falling in Empire?  In the original, he can't bear to live with the fact that Darth Vader is his father, and deliberately let go of the railing, rather than be Vader's son.  Why would he scream when he CHOSE to fall?What's even more bizarre is what they DIDN'T fix.  The Rancor still looks horrible."	1.0	Well...at least the box looks nice.	2004-05-30	16	9	7

"I sense a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of fans cried out in agony at once as Lucas once again mutilated their favorite stories...Have you seen the new DVD release of Star Wars yet? This one's a real travesty, folks. First off, it is NOT the ""Classic"" Star Wars Trilogy as it has been advertised, but it is the Special Edition in disguise, with all its painfully obvious added scenes, glaring oversights, blatent special effects showmanship over actual quality, and just plain poor blending. As if this weren't bad enough, Lucas has seen fit to further adulterate the work by fiddling some more! I've only taken a cursory glance so far, but Ian McDiarmid has been added in place of the hologram of the Emperor's head in Empire (but the credits still bill Clive Revill as the voice of the Emperor), and at the end of Jedi, Luke peers into the forest as three figures appear... first Ben, then Yoda, and finally- Hayden Christensen?!?!? AAAAAGGGHHHH!!!!! Oh, and as the final sequence shows worlds across the galaxy, Naboo has been added into the shot. Could the DVD release have been more of a commercial for Episode III? And that scene with Han and Greedo- He's fiddled with it again! And it's still not believable!! What Lucas seems to have failed to learn is that at some point, you have to walk away from a project because the more you try and add to it, the worse it gets! Maybe the Big Guy has finally realized that he has lost whatever writing/directing talent he had and needs something else to sell his next over-decorated, under-acted big screen disaster! Or, maybe he figured if he went back and made the first ones worse, the new ones would look better! Whatever, the motivation, we can be sure of one thing- George Lucas has completed is journey to the Dark Side...The only reason at all for ranking this trilogy with 2 stars instead of none is for the sake of the original, plus the bonus disk is the only part of the set worth keeping. While it has some interesting behind the scenes featurettes and documentaries, I was getting angrier and angrier every time Lucas came into shot. That's when I knew it was a waste of my money and time.Save your money for the ""Purist"" edition of Star Wars.

There are even a couple of scenes that're ""restored"" for perhaps no other reason than he had the footage lying around.Yet, this is probably the reason to get this four-disc collection of expert filmmaking and behind-the-scenes footage: to uncover the, um, exciting and traumatic discoveries. There's even a spectacular two-and-a-half hour documentary that's worth the price of admission alone.If you, like me, still find yourself giddy every time John Williams' theme score ushers in the famous prologue ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.."", then this is a no-brainer of a purchase; it's the kind of stuff DVD technology was made for."	4.0	DESPITE ALL THE TINKERING, WELL WORTH OWNING!	2004-09-25	9	6	3

Warswick ""High School History Teacher"""	What can I say about a set of movies which almost EVERYONE on the planet has seen at least once in their lives?  NOt much, right?These are the special editions, and I didn't have too much of a problem with them.  MOst of the extra footage rounded the movies out and gave the viewer a better idea of what Lucas was trying to do.  The best example of this, in my mind, is the scene in Episode IV: A New Hope when Luke and company enter Mos-Eisley.  You get a better view of the city and it's population.  Another plus was the scene at the end when the rebel fighters are rounding Yavin on their approach of the Death Star.  You get to see the pilots heads moving and they don't have such a one dimensional feel to them.Episode V had the least amount of changes, and remains my favorite.  I particularly enjoyed the expanded scene with the snow monster.  In the original the limitations were painfully obvious, as we saw very little of the monster.  Now you can see him eating, moving, etc...  I feel it adds a certain amount of tension a scene which was lacking.However, I didn't think all of the additions were good.  I didn't like the added footage of Darth Vader nor was I impressed with Jabba. I could have done without the comic performance at Jabba's Palace in Jedi, but I did enjoy the new ending.All in all these films are classics and should be part of ANY movie fans collection.	5.0	GREATEST SERIES EVER!!!!!!!!!	2001-01-31	3	3	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3PIPJ3XGWFXAA	"Shayne M. Whitehead ""Shayne Michael"""	All three episodes here, with or without them, are so much better than the new trilogy. Let's face it, Jaba the Hutt's appearance brought very little to A New Hope. But destroyed it? Please. I could care less if Greedo shot first. And if Hayden Christensen replaced the guy who originally played Vader in a brief scene: So what? Here's what was better. The story was so much simpler. Save the princess. Get the plans to the rebellion. And destroy the evil Death Star before it destroys us. Is it remotely possible to sum up any of the new movies so simply and elegantly? Well that's what makes a great film. A simple story told with great detail and great artistic touches. That happened in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. That's why they're all in the IMDB's top 250 movies to this day despite having dated special effects. Who cares? You liked the characters. You knew what there mission was. And you were routing for them from film one to film three. The reason these special touches, every one else is whining about, can't ruin these films was it was never the special touches {or the special effects} that made them special in the first place. It was the story line. And 3 DVDs plus a bonus {making of all three films} for $45 when an average DVD costs $20 sounds like a great deal to me no matter if Lucas revised the original content a little bit at all.	5.0	No Matter How Much You Dislike The New Touches	2005-10-30	4	2	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1QWWT367BZC9D	Shellie	"As three of my favorite movies growing up as a kid on the outskirts of Sydney in the conservative 1980s; these timelessly wonderful films were a truly welcome means of escape from the pressures of daily life, and I am glad to say that the classic Star Wars Trilogy is still great entertainment after all these years. Now they are finally available on DVD, cleaned up and restored to a stunning and pristine condition, one can at last enjoy them again and again. These quasi-mystical space opera's; replete with brave Jedi Knights, strange aliens and their many worlds, Androids, Starships and Light Sabers can now be experienced in all their epic glory. George Lucas in making these three groundbreaking films quite literally, forever changed the way Hollywood made its movies.Although now as a adult I can be very critical and expect much more from a movie than sheer spectacle; and while they are somewhat dated and the dialogue might seem a bit corny and naive in these very dark and troubled times, that's okay. The films also tend to be too simplistic, or black and white, but then most folklore or mythology is much the same, so that's okay as well. In spite of these minor criticisms I still thoroughly enjoy watching these three visionary films once in a blue moon. For I realize that when all is said and done, they are just swashbuckling intergalactic adventure stories not to be taken too earnestly! When I watch these films I experience a strong feeling of romantic nostalgia, as I guess many around my age do; those in their late 20s and 30s. There is a longing for a time when life seemed to be simpler and less complex; a time when people were more radical and nonconformist, a time when people were less jaded, selfish and cynical as they are now. And I don't actually have much of a problem with many of the changes George Lucas has made to his films; after all art history is full of artists who have gone back to change and redo a piece of art they've never been satisfied with, mainly in painting. It's just a shame that he hasn't made available on DVD the original theatrical release versions as well, for posterity, if not for fans. I was disappointed at the relatively small amount of special features included on these disks and think that's just cheap and stingy; especially considering how many studios put a lot more effort into the ""extras"" these days, George Lucas really had no excuse and could have added more... a gallery of concept art would have been great for example. Or featurettes on Ralph McQuarrie, who did so much to define the visual aesthetic of the films; and one on John Williams who wrote, composed and conducted the memorably rousing soundtracks for these wonderful movies. For I think it can be argued that these two highly creative artists have done almost as much as Mr. Lucas himself to establish the popularity and success of the Star Wars franchise.George Lucas was inspired by such diverse sources as the gripping serial adventures of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon; to romantic tales of Medieval Chivalry and the Japanese art of Bushido to ancient myths, legends and fairy tales. Old documentary footage from both World Wars I and II inspired him too; and early modern decorative art styles, such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco. He was also strongly influenced by legendary fellow filmmaker Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) and the pop folklorist and writer Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) who worked as an advisor on the films. He deftly wove all these varied inspirations together to create an archetypal and mythic masterpiece of good and evil, heroes and villains, which taken as a thematic whole forms an aesthetically unified and prime example of science-fantasy in film. In doing so he has created a modernistic fable for the late 20th Century and beyond that has inspired generations of dreamers. May the force be with you!"	4.0	A Science-Fantasy Saga	2007-07-16	2	2	0

(Which I might add - I thought was a rather shoddy product in itself, as aside from the outrageous 'additions'... had some rather sloppy editing/effects (nastier cheap-looking Jabba, rubber-necked slow on the trigger Han, and black squares around some of the ships to mention a few), not to mention a rather cheap box. (I knew something was up when I first picked up that box... and it practically half-collapsed in my hand)Fortunately, I never bought that first set (just conveniently rented it from the library)  and after reading the reviews here on Amazon BEFORE opening the packaging of this latest bit of nonsense...

In fact, the first time I viewed Star Wars in the theater as a fifth-grader, I simply didn't ""get it.""  I'll always remember walking out thinking ""What's the Force?  Darth Vader..is he a robot or human in costume?  A Wookie...is he from the Planet of the Apes, or Dogs, or what?  Rebel forces...are they the good guys or bad guys?  Sand People?  Alderan?  etc., etc. etc.  What the heck is this stuff all about?  Why do people like it so much?""I loved the spaceship special effects, but that was about it.  Luckily, my dad hadn't seen the movie, and after all the huge publicity, he wanted to see it, but not alone.  So I agreed to go with him (what the heck, why not?)  For some reason, upon the second viewing, my eyes were opened.  I suddenly understood it all, and loved it!!  There's so much introduced in the first movie that it was more than my brain could process and understand the first time around.  It's definitely one of those movies (at least for me) that needs a second viewing to truly appreciate and understand.  It's not your typical Star Trek type of science fiction (which I've never liked).Empire Strikes Back came out, and I was blown away.  Not only had I grown a little older, but the characters had as well.  Darker, deeper themes throughout the movie.  More exciting as well.  It's ultimately my favorite of the bunch.  Revenge of the Jedi?  Well, we all know it was pretty lame, but at least it finished the story.Anyway, I recorded the original Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back from TV about 12 years ago.  I'm so glad it did.  I actually love the graininess of the film and the lower quality special and sound effects.  If anything, I think it adds to authenticity of the story.  It's almost like a new film that has purposely been film in black-and-white with fake scratches to make it look older.  It's fitting, especially since it takes place ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.""  It takes you to that place as you would expect to view it today--appearing like some ancient relic recently dug up from an archeological find.  This is especially true for those of us who viewed it as children.Now, look at the ""new, improved"" Special Editions.  They may as well be New Coke.  The computerized special effects look more fake to me than the original ones.  Everything looks so clean, so perfect...too perfect to be real.  At times, I feel like I'm viewing some cheesy ""Star Trek - Deep space nine"" TV show.  The mystic is gone, ruined forever.If Lucas really wants to make more money (which we ALL know it's what he does best), he'll re-release the original films on DVD.  He recently said you could still buy the originals on VHS, but I can't find them anywhere.  The demand for originals is huge.

But his latest tampering with his original trilogy is just ludicrious.

I have not watched all of the films yet on this dvd set, but I have watched the end of Return of the Jedi, and yes the rumors are true. Hayden Christainsen does indeed show up as a ghost of Anakin rather then original actor Sabastain Shaw. Luca$ explains that he did this because of the fact that rather then have Anakin return as the old man, he would be all machine then, when Anakin was young as a young man, before the whole Darth Vader ordeal, he wasn't almost all machine. To you and me, this is just plain bs.I have no problems with changing and adding effects in, but completly cutting a charecter out and sticking a new one in is just bs.But don't let this stop you from buying this otherwise excellent set, it's defintily worth it.

Most sources say it's the 1997 special editions, while rumours have persisted that the films have been further retooled to make them mesh better with the new prequel trilogy. One things for certain, it won't be the trilogy as seen from 1997-1995.And you know what? At least for now, that's okay. I'm sure somewhere down the line, Lucas will release (or be forced to release) his movies in their original form. Given the demand for them, it's almost a sure thing FOX will put pressure on him to do so. In the meantime, we have these discs. While my opinion's only one among thousands of fans, I'm mostly fine with the Special Editions. The only thing that really needs to be removed is Greedo shooting first. Lucas can keep everything else, but Greedo needs to go. And if these movies have indeed been further altered, don't you want to see what's been changed? Even fans who hate the Special Editions like something nasty while probably buy this set either out of morbid curiosity or to complete their collection. You know you're curious about how Lucas has ""further defiled"" his movies, and you know you'll probably pay to see it.Besides, the video and audio for these discs will probably be demo quality, and the bonus features look pretty sweet. They've put a lot of effort into this release, moreso than Lucas's other holy trilogy, Indiana Jones. Can we really pass this up?Don't look at this set as buying the definitive version of the movie, but rather George's definitive version.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A319P50FFUV4RP	Sinthetik Devil	Millions of fans around the world adored his films, bought the toys, made him millions, perhaps billions of dollars. And in return, he takes the original films, butchers them with CGI and scene alterations, then procalims he will NEVER rlease the original films, because to HIM these ARE the originals. What an ass.The SE revisions are horrible. In A New Hope Greedo shoots first, making Han look like a pacifist. He was supposed to be a scoundrel who slowly transitions into a good guy. We see Jabba in a pointless conversation, ruining the suspense and tension throughout the 3 films. Originally there was a sense of dread caused by Jabba...who was he? What did he look like. You never saw him until the last film. But now he shows up in the first film like some skinny weakling. Han steps on his tail and he does nothing. The Jabba in the third movie would have thrown him to the Rancor. In Empire, when Luke jumps into the chasm, he screams like a little baby, ruining the powerful moment in which he was supposed to COURAGEOUSLY jump into the chasm rather than join the dark side. The scream only makes sense if he were pushed, but he CHOSE to jump. This was supposed to be the scene where Luke becomes mature, a change in character from when he was a teen on Tatooine. Ruined. In Return of the Jedi we get a horrible musical scene with a thing that looks like the Honeycomb guy singing. Unwatchable. Also, Boba Fett's death is put on the level of a fart joke with Lucas adding a burp in after he is swallowed by the Sarlaac.There would be no complaints if he released BOTH and gave the fans a choice which they want to buy. But no. It's his way or nothing. Imagine if this happened with every old film. Dirty Harry could have some CGI explosions, they could update Al Pacino's hair in Scarface, dub dialogue into silent films. Where would it end? Lucas is a one trick pony who got lucky with an idea and now his ego is ruining the franchise that was one the most powerful on the planet.Buy the LOTR trilogy instead if you don't have it, or look for some original trilogy bootlegs.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2CNKDQD2KWQD2	Sir Bradley G.	"Since the release of Star Wars Episode I there has been a growing number of crazed anti Star Wars fanatics. These people acquire great joy from bashing all the work that George Lucas has done on the series since 1994. They refute anything new and uphold the original trilogy on a pedestal. I scratch my head and wonder; why are these people being so brutal in their criticism on the new Star Wars material but absolutely refuse to employ the same criticism on the original, pre special edition, movies? How perfect are these movies? These movies are full of just as many mistakes as the new ones. In fact critics unequivocally hated the original Star Wars movie, yet it went on became the biggest selling movie of the time. So maybe this lingering negativity is not so unusual, however it has almost become a trend to condemn the new movies and it doesn't just end with the Star Wars sagas. It seems to me that the ""special effects"" generation (referring to those who grew up with high quality digital effects in movies) detests the way that modern movies are made, while the older generation that remembers the entire evolution of effects in movies is genuinely amazed at and appreciative of the advancements.Where did this start? It started with Jar Jar Binx in 1999 with the release of Star Wars Episode I. Audiences were so displeasured and annoyed with the character that born from this discontent was a craze to hate modern CGI effects. From then on the new Star Wars films along with the Special Editions were disregarded as special effects movies. Where they see nothing but mindless special effects I see an evolving art form. Even with the many mistakes that these movies have I am happy with both the new trilogy and the special editions. However, the ""special effects"" generation has spit so much vitriol at these films that I have become increasingly agitated with this judgmental fad.While attending college I come across hordes of younger people who gather in circles and endlessly, I mean endlessly, complain, complain, complain, complain, complain until I want to throw-up. Everything and everyone is on their hit list. Nothing can live up these people's standards and Star Wars is one of the main topics that these people like to sit around and endlessly smash. It is an orgy of negativity and it quite disparaging to witness. I can't even talk to these people without my subject being attacked at the very moment it slips off my tongue. This segment of the ""special effects"" generation hates everything and this negativity toward all the Star Wars movies is being perpetuated by this rigid and unforgiving cultural phenomena. This is fad conjured up by this depressing class of people.So Lucas made some mistakes, so the movies aren't perfect. George Lucas isn't a god you know. I'm tired of hearing your endless, mindless and negative bantering!  Just shut your caustic mouth and go away. The only people that want to hear your endless unprovoked attacks are those from your own social disorder.Now for my actual review: I own the original movies on Video. I probably will never watch them again. When I think of Star Wars I think of Episode I-VI and the special editions were an attempt to blend the new series to the old. He used this method is reverse when Lucas incorporated antiquated latex effects in the new movies. We can endlessly complain about mistakes in the production of these films or we can buy these films and enjoy twenty years of sacrifice that Lucas has made to bring us these movies. If you're a Star Wars fan you will buy these DVDs and enjoy them, if not why are you even reading this?"	5.0	I'm sick to death of hearing complaints!	2004-08-07	11	2	9
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2JV8PH4NGQPJ6	"Sir George Martini ""Verbalosity"""	I am tired of all things related to Star Wars.  I bought the VHS Special Edition in 1997 and the changes that Lucas made were really disappointing.  From what I read in some of these reviews, Lucas has done it again and this version has even more unnecessary revisions.  All I want is the original movie remastered and restored to its original state.	1.0	Waste of Money	2004-10-09	27	21	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AWS5AKJPT2WD8	Sir William of Occam	"Ranking myself in Star Wars fandom on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I'm definitely 5 stars; however this dvd release on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, definitely does NOT receive 5.  Last year's release of the equally disappointing 4 disc set and the price are completely irrelevent, Recardo from San jose.  What most of the reviewers have tried to express but may not have done so effectively, is that any legal version of the first Star Wars trilogy on DVD that is for sale or ever has been for sale by retailers only contains the Special Editions of the films that were released in 1997 and the additional inserts put in for the first release on DVD in 2004.  These DVD releases do not contain the films exactly as they were presented in theaters in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  They are not the films we grew up with.I'm with Kevin from Philly, that George Lucas has his right to alter his works since he is the artist.  However, he would not have any success without the continued support of the fans for decades, who would appreciate the option of viewing the Star Wars films in widescreen on DVD in their original theatrical versions and not being restricted to have only these new ""Director's Cut"", so to speak, special edition versions.  The packaging doesn't even warn you that the DVDs only contain the special editions.  The cover art of the box is fantastic, and the movies are fine if you prefer digital paint on every frame of the original movies.  The box is misleading in that it claims that you are getting all three classic films digitally remastered.  Using the word classic was wrong since the box contains the post 1997 versions and not the actual classic versions.  I for one don't like seeing the semblance of a Venus Fly Trap superimposed onto the Sarlac in the Tatooine Desert in ""Return of the Jedi"" or the horribly choreographed new Ewok music at the end of the film.  The cantina scenes in Jabba's Palace wreak also.  ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" were altered a bit also, but ""Return of the Jedi"" was butchered the most.Here's some Advice for all of you who are purists and believe that Lucas got it right the first time, don't get your hopes up that he will release a non-special edition of the first three films.  He is ashamed of them and doesn't want people to be able to see them the way they were anymore.  He thinks his revisions are the only acceptable versions.  Just like Lucas said about the corny Star Wars Christmas special that aired on TV in 1979?, that he wishes he could have every copy of it rounded up and destroyed, he would probably like to do the same with all the old pre-1997 VHS versions of the movies and the Laserdisc versions.  For right now, what might be your last chance to own a legal high quality widescreen DVD  copy of the original theatrical versions of the films is to buy a copy of the Laserdisc definitive edition and some DVD digital transfers of the Laserdisc off *bay or transfer it yourself if you have the equipment.  This is legal under U.S. copyright law to have a backup copy of a work if you own the original, hence a having a DVD backup of the Laserdisc set that you own would be legal.  I hope this helps some of the fans out there.Again, mine nor most other's gripes on here are about the price or the lack of a bonus disc.  As stated previously, the problem is the lack of availability of an original theatrical, non-special edition version, with or without a bonus disc.  Just as retailers can sell two separate boxed sets, one with a gold bar on the box that says full screen and one with a silver bar that says wide screen, why can't they be given one to sell that says Theatrical Version full or wide screen and one that says Special Edition/Revised Version full or wide screen??  I already own VHS, Laserdisc, Laserdisc backup, and 2004 DVD release of the movies but if the theatrical versions were to become available on DVD in stores I would buy one in a heartbeat.  Lucas would make a lot of money off it, but he won't because the newer versions represent his creative vision which has obviously changed dramatically since 1977.  Someone should start a nationwide, even a worldwide petition to Lucas to offer the films in their original, unaltered theatrical versions."	1.0	Still the special edition revised versions, beware!!	2005-12-11	20	15	5

The clarity of the picture and the surroud sound is amazing !!  Now you can feel the connection between the prequel and the trilogy in more sense.  Needless to say, some changes in these versions is perfect and make Star wars movies much more value.  The main changes that i could notice are.EP4 - The new jabba the hut (the best Jabba in SW movies)EP5 - Ian replaced the emperor scene (both act and voices !!!)EP6 - The victory scence, Naboo is added in the ceremony scence  and the most fantastic change and it made Star wars movies completed is Hayden act as Anakin !! (stand beside Yoda and Alec guinness !!).  Even i am the hardcore SW fan since 1977 but i could accept these changes. You have to accept the truth that these are George's movies, it is his intention to let the movies change and i respect that.  Forget the original version (or even 1997's versions) of trilogy if you foreseer the future that the people will continue to watch Star wars again and again in the next 100 years !! 5 stars is not enough !!

Hmm. How very odd.I don't have the time to actually go through every review to create a mean score but it wouldn't surprise me if the rating is being electronically manipulated to ensure that one of most anticipated DVD releases of all time, will stay that way.

I won't go into great detail but it seems that one of my posts has been removed due to a policy about conflicting material, i.e. I submitted a post (thinly) disguised as St. George himself.  I can only assume that a Lucas Arts crony saw my post and leaned on Amazon to remove it.The post was funny and mostly harmless (when I say harmless I mean it was acerbic and it mocked George's credibility as a visionary, as well as a human being).  But the fact that I happen to think George:a. Has lost his touch.b. Never had it.c. Is a power hungry, money grubbing, sociopathic, megalomanical madman.ORd. All the above.Doesn't give them the right to censor my opinion about his tactics and/or his films.  That's what writing reviews are supposed to be all about, sharing opinions so everyone can make an informed decision.I want to end this by saying, anyone that grew up with these films(actually saw them in the theaters) and can stand by his new abominations, has been sadly misguided.  I can only hope that after watching these ""new"" films, some of you will say, ""That (put expletive here) was right!"", and the truth will be revealed.  Maybe one day George will have his own truth revealed to him.  Being inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, surely one day he will be able to understand the mythology that has been formulated around his original creations.

I've even come to terms with some of the changes George has made to the original series (as a comedian recently said, he's really just making his own fan-homages to them).  What I can't abide though is the repeated finger-in-the-eye to his original trilogy fans.  I pre-purchased this set back in January when it was first revealed and waited patiently for it to arrive (Amazon sqatting on it for a week once it was released is best left to another review).  What really made me write this review is my astonishment that the bonus features were left out of this set.  Once more George is telling me that my preference for the original trilogy is not an acceptible opinion. And if I persist in this belief, I must be reminded of the error of my ways.  Now I have little choice but to buy the whole set, try to find the bonus disks on ebay or wait and hope they appear in a future re-release.  Being a fan of this franchise is starting to feel like being the red-headed middle child.As to the disks I did receive, the movie does look amazing, the sound is very good and the clarity is stunning (I didn't know Carrie had freckles).

For someone who was against colorizing movies, it's ironic that Lucas chose to change these movies again. Why couldn't he simply do what Speilberg did with ET - both old and new editions in the DVD set?For people who may not understand the complaint, imagine if someone went back and added CGI effects to the original Flash Gordon serials. Those bad special effects had a certain appeal to the fans and any ""enhancement"" would ruin the experience. We want to see 1977-1982 movies with special effects that reflect that time period. It simply doesn't look right when you mix an old movie with new effects. It becomes obvious that the movies and effects are not from the same decade. Lucas could have easily followed Robert Wise's approach to Star Trek: The Motion Picture - Director's Edition. Wise demanded that the CGI look like 1979 effects. Lucas could have made the new creatures look like stop motion creatures.There is no way I could recommend this edition of the movies to anyone because of what I've stated above. Some of the extras may be nice for true fans. Empire of Dreams is a good documentary. However, I will stick to my old LaserDiscs for now.

I understand your point of view because I have a similar problem with Ridley Scott DVD version of ""Blade Runner.""  Yet, these two directors have not been doing something that the rest have.I don't want to get to technique here but for everyone to understand there are two simple facts to know.  The numbers 4x3 and 16x9 are only the size of the rectangular object.  In my following discussion these two sizes only represent a Television Set.Second, for ""Star Wars"" that was film in 2.35:1ratio, to be able to fit your 4x3 TV Screen they had to cut the picture.  Black out mainly the Left and Right portions of the film so it could fit into a 1.33:1ratio that is a 4x3 picture tube.The DVD suppliers have release ""Star Wars"" in both versions.  They could have done this on the same DVD but why do that when you can make more money?  Some of you out there understand the difference between Widescreen and Formatted to Fit Your TV.  You know that none of the original picture that you saw at the theater is missing on the Widescreen version.  This is the 2.35:1ratio version.  While the Formatted version is missing a lot of the original picture but it does fit your 4x3 Television screen.Let just imagine what it would be like if you compare the 2.35:1 version to the 1.33:1 version and discover that they are identical.  Remember, I am not saying that you will find this with any of the ""Star Wars"" films.  They are all truly in 2.35:1ratio.  Yet, what would you think if the 1.33:1 version of ""Star Wars"" had two black bars put into it to black out even more of the original picture?  Remember, this is not the case with ""Star Wars"" but it is with almost everyone of your 1.85:1ratio movies.  I have found only 6 exceptions but out of the 200 movies that our presented in 1.85, that I own on DVD, is nothing more than the cut version for TV and then they black out even more of the picture.  Check out the DVD version of ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.""For the past 9 years they have been selling DVD's with movies that have even more missing from the original theater release and no one seems to care.  Well, suppose they did this to ""Star Wars""?Ron Howard's film ""Cocoon"" shows you what you have been missing from the original formatted version on VHS.  ""Cocoon"" is shown in both formats on the same DVD.  It is the original theater 1.85:1ratio aspect and if you watch a particular scene from both version you will see the major difference.  Yet, ""The Fugitive"" has been formatted to fit your 4x3 TV and then they cut more out of this copy by adding black bars so it will have the 1.85:1ratio.  Sure, for the people who own 16x9 TV's this movie fills the whole screen.  Yet, if you were to compare with a 1.33 version you will discover the top and bottom parts of the picture has been removed.This is a rip off.  False advertising.  Please, take a notice of this.  There are thousands of original 1.85 movies being sold this way.  You are not getting the original theater release version.  Sure, it is still in 1.85:1ratio aspect but they have taken the original 1.85:1 version and cut it to fit your 4x3 TV and then took that copy and added the black bars to make it fit the 16x9 TV.  So, if you can find the 1.33 version of any 1.85 movies on DVD buy it.  This is the only version that is available were the original picture has not been black out twice."	5.0	What is Different From the TV Version?	2005-07-05	6	1	5

It was very smart of Lucas to bring her onboard.  The documentary included is extensive and in-depth, taking you deeper into the Star Wars' universe than any DVD prior.

I loved Star Wars and Empire as much as I have since their original release in the theater.  The real surprise was Return of the Jedi.  I found myself liking the sixth episode of the series a lot more than I did the last time I watched it, in 1997.  Sure, it has Ewoks and too many close-ups (it's like an advertisement for nose-hair trimmers), but it also has one of the best lightsaber battles of the trilogy, the speeder bike chase through the forest of Endor and HANDS DOWN the best space battle featured in any of the films!  This was the apex of special FX.  CG has never matched the realistic look of this battle.  The current FX king, LoTR, still has a long way to go before it matches the segment.  The seemingly endless array of tie-fighters and the wild ride through the new Death Star featured in Jedi are just as exciting as they were in 1983.  And what more can be said about episode IV and V?  A New Hope is the amazing film that started it all.  There are a few scenes that haven't aged well, but this movie really did change the ""event"" film forever.  And Han Solo is never cooler than he is in the original film -- even if he does shoot ""second.""  The Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best movie in the series, is a science fiction masterpiece.  There has been a lot of talk over the past few years that the prequels took away some of the magic from the original trilogy.  Maybe Lucas took some of the magic away with the Special Edition stuff he added, but the movies still hold their own.  The Empires Strikes Back isn't just the best ""event"" film ever made; it's the best movie of all time (and the one Lucas basically left alone).  And this set will be the favorite in any Star Wars' fans DVD collection; at least until Lucas releases all six films together in a ""super-deluxe-mega-fanboy-will-drool"" collection after Revenge of the Sith leaves the theater and makes its debut on DVD.  I agree that Lucas should release the original films along with the not-so-special editions, but it's probably not going to happen and I'm not going to give myself a stroke worrying about it.  As it stands, this DVD collection is one of the best out there and was well, well worth the wait!"	5.0	Worth the wait!	2004-08-28	11	5	6

If they release the original versions (which they didn't, dang!) even better. But seriously, why are you complaining. IT IS THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS ON DVD!!!!!! BE HAPPY!!!!! I am overly excited. I've been watching the movies since I was 8 (I am 16 now, and still enjoying my VHS tapes) and I really enjoyed the Special Edition versions and thought they were nice. Some Special Editions or Director's Cuts aren't as nice. Ex: In E.T. 20th Anniversary, when they took away the guns out of the police men's hands and put walkie talkies, THAT WAS THE DUMBEST THING EVER!!!!! That ruined a classic. I am so glad that Spielberg (my second favorite director) put the original version in the DVD set, that way I can pick that one over the new version. Anyway, I am so happy with the Star Wars movies on DVD. Now I don't have to search on eBay for those bootleg DVDs or the original laserdiscs (which I was going to get if I had to wait one more year for a Star Wars Trilogy DVD Set) I only have one complaint about this set: why not have individual second discs for each film like with the Alien Quadrilogy set? Lucasfilm and Fox getting a little cheap with us? Since it will only be 4 discs, the 4th one better have lots of good stuff on it, besides that 2 hour documentary which I am sure will be very nice. Just wait patiently fans, (and to you fanboys who are upset about the Special Editions being the ones on DVD, GET OVER IT!!! You wanted the movies, YOU GOT THEM!

As I recall from the original version, Luke made not a whimper, making it a memorable act of defiance.  Sadly, the special edition edits in an unintentionally hilarious scream, rendering Luke into what sounds like a chug-a-lug taking his first bungee jump.  Just as 'Greedo Shoots First' robs Han Solo's character of valuable shading, the 'scream' robs Luke of his heroic grandeur.  Kiddies don't seem to understand the value of this--the value of strong characterizations and dramatic subtext--preferring instead to ramble on about the pretty but meaningless add-on visuals and SFX--more opium for the gaming generation.  Consider these special editions alongside the useless remakes of other important 70's films, likewise robbed of their mature underpinnings and societal context for the continued ogling of the increasingly unrelatable and uninspired movie-going public.	1.0	"Not just ""Greedo Shoots First""..."	2004-09-09	45	33	12

Due to this and a cast that could never be matched, It has endured the test of time and is still as thrilling today as it was back in 1977.  Rarely do you find a movie series where the follow ups are just as good or very close to being just as good.  The Star Wars Trilogy delivers the same relentless excitement, tremendous story and superb acting throughout the entire series.Since today's generation sadly doesn't have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, DVD is the next best option.

They screened empire strikes back on the theater, I was esctatic, until I realized it was not the original but the 97 digitally enhanced fiasco.  It is a shame that these films have been taken under the knife again.  Has Lucas become so hollywood now that he has to keep performing plastic surgery on what he percieves as imperfections.

However if you have any love for the original film do not buy this dvd set.The low score applies only to the altered Star Wars Trilogy for the dvd resleased on Sept 21 of 2004.P.S.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3OEOTG0OHK69M	Some Guy	Raise your hand if you remember how long it took for the Star Wars Trilogy (any version at all) to become available on DVD.For nearly two decades, Star Wars was *the* movie with which to showcase high-end home theater systems.  Any store that was selling big-screen TVs and Surround Sound receivers (back when both were prohibitively expensive for the average household) was guaranteed to have a copy of Star Wars on hand, to show off the hardware.Then DVDs came out and blew VHS and LaserDiscs out of the water.  And long after DVDs had firmly been established as the video format of choice, George Lucas still waited years to release any version of Star Wars (even the versions he tampered with) on DVD.  It seemed ridiculous that these movies, which were so ahead of their time that they were still being used as the litmus test of home theater technology 20 years later, were only available in an inferior and obsolete format that was rapidly losing market share.And now, he's doing it again.  Giant TVs and high definition video are rapidly becoming the norm.  Judging by George Lucas's unprecedented use of spare-no-expense digital movie magic, it's clear he's no purist or technophobe.  So what's the hold-up?  Why must we *again* wait for what was once the greatest home theater showpiece to play catch-up with the mainstream technology?  The entire Star Wars saga should have been one of the first things released on Blu-Ray, not the last.  (Though I'd still hold out for a remastered-but-otherwise-un-tampered-with version of the original trilogy.  I don't much care for the edited versions or the new trilogy).	1.0	Once again, George is late to the party...	2009-10-24	30	21	9
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1IYDM5M6EKT47	"Some Guy's Opinion ""for what it's worth"""	"First, Lucas said he was remastering the original films for sharper picture and sound with maybe a few deleted scenes added in. What we got were more than a few rewrites, cutting scenes, rearranging them, and the character-altering blasphemy of Greedo shooting first in the most absurd cowtow to the ""helmet generation"" (can't let these kids ever be hurt or upset!) since the police in ET traded their shotguns for radios (which would no doubt be the government response if an alien ran loose in the states).When they finally came to dvd, Lucas continued to refuse to restore the originals without including his alterations, claiming they didn't have copies anywhere. Instead, we got the same absurd changes of earlier with even MORE tinkering to bring the movie in line with his inferior prequels, including ridiculous voiceovers, CGI overwrites, and senseless musical changes that already sound as dated as the numbers they replaces (Jabba's palace).Somehow, despite his claims of not having any copies, he was able to respond to fan pressure and release the originals. In a nice passive-aggressive FU to those fans though, he refused to remaster them at all or  make it anamorphic/widescreen, instead trying to deliberately make his edits look more impressive by giving the only choice of originals a tiny, grainy screen presentation.Now here's the bluray... same butchered versions. Will he cave and give the originals on bluray again this time? Who knows, but I'm off this ride. Even though my DVD copies of the original lack widescreen or sharp sound and picture, they easily are superior to a bluray of his hack edits. Maybe he will soften with age and present a remastered version of the original films (like Coppola did with the Godfather) on bluray for all of us.

Rather than replacing Clive Revill with Ian McDiarmid for these so-called new and improved versions of the classic movies we all know and love, George Lucas should have donned the dark robes himself for the part. Imagine the terror he could ensue on the rebel scum! Instead of destroying entire planets, he could simply start changing all of their favorite movies! And when the new one is complete in all its terrible glory, he'd destroy all copies of the original. The rebels would surrender without hesitation!Seriously though, Mr. Lucas, you should be ashamed. I'm absolutly sickened at the way you treat your fans. Star Wars geeks (myself included) love these films. We buy your merchandise, we play the video games, we argue about which of the first three is best(Empire!), and we wait in line, some for days, just to be first to view the new trilogy unfold. All of this stems from one film. One movie that caused an iternational phenomenon upon its original release in 1977. That film is ""Star Wars-Episode IV: A New Hope"", and it gained perhaps the largest cult following for a movie ever. ""Use the Force"" became a household phrase, and it all happened literally overnight.All this hysteria, Mr. Lucas, and you don't think there's an intrest in seeing the ORIGINAL trilogy on DVD? Star Wars fans have went through a lot over the years, but this just might be the straw that breaks the bantha's back. RE-releasing the new editions without the bonus disc, sticking the original poster on the front, and misleading thousands (if not millions) of die-hard loyal fans into buying a product they already own and are DISSAPOINTED WITH.So, congratulations on being able to use your fans to add to your undeserved and grossly overweight fortune. Congratulations on turning one of the greatest achivements in film-making into an incresingly cheesy and soulless franchise that doesn't care what fans would like to see but only about making money any way possible. And finally, congratulations on losing this particular fan. I doubt that I am alone in feeling this alienated. I hope your bank account is well fed and you are happy with the way you make your fans feel, but from this end, us Geeks only have dissapointment and resentment to bring to the table."	1.0	Evil Empire	2005-12-24	14	8	6

I guess he does, because here they are.If da Vinci had gone back to the Mona Lisa years later and painted a mustache on her, would it still be a work of art? I guess it would, but it would not be the Mona Lisa anymore. So these DVDs may be works of art and may still be worth watching, but to label them ""Star Wars"" is nothing short of a lie.You could buy these DVDs today, or you could wait (maybe forever) for ol' Georgie to release the original versions of the movies on DVD.

The three movies earned gigantic sums of money.  A whole generation loves the movies beyond words.In 1997, the 'Special Editions' were a lot of fun to see on the big screen.  I, like so many others, was thrilled to see the new additions and surprises.  I didn't realize then that those editions marked the end of Star Wars in it's original form.Now the 'Special Editions' have become even more 'special', with - as many have documented already - lots of additional ""surprises.""  I've had enough.  Putting Hayden Christensen in the end of Return of the Jedi really takes the cake.  Bottom line: whether you think the new movies (Phantom and Clones) suck or not (they do), I don't want to see cameo appearances by the new cast (especially in what was one of the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the trilogy: Luke see the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his father).I have resigned myself never to give Lucas another nickel."	1.0	New Hayden Christensen cameo?

These movies have been my all time favorites for about four years now, when I first saw them. I've had a lot of favorite movies in the past, but none of them did Star Wars justice in terms of characters, story and music.I'm not going to go on about the plots because most of you already know them. But I have to say, unlike many of you, I was glad this was re-released because I never owned the widescreen versions of these but now I realize they are visually better than the standard format.Like many of you though, I do wish they would release this on DVD but it didn't really matter to me at the time because I hadn't owned a DVD player when they were released but now that I have one I will count the days until it's released on DVD.As for the Episode II stuff, it wasn't really worth the wait but it had it's moments, especially with the anecdote of Anthony Daniels talking about what it would be like if C-3PO found out Darth Vader was his father.Anyway, great movies, great release, it's just great. 10/10	5.0	The greatest movies ever made!	2001-02-24	1	0	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A265IVK9XLNJN	Squirrel Bait '68	"Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]  The following is a brief review of the current Blu Ray release of Star Wars: A New Hope, from the ""Original"" Trilogy.  For starters, this is not the original trilogy, but the enhanced version with extra scenes and CGI that were added in the 1990's.  The actual original theatrical releases of the trilogy, as seen in 1977, 1980 and 1983 are not present in this Blu Ray edition.  This review is only for Star Wars, as I have not viewed The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.Here are my observations:- Picture clarity: phenomenal!  In terms of sharpness, Star Wars has never looked so good!- Color saturation: overdone, pure and simple.  I love rich, vivid color and there certainly is no shortage of it here, but it's to such a degree that bright primary colors often ""bleed"" too much, especially where special effects are concerned.  Skin tones are off quite a bit (too many pink faces).  This release requires some adjustment to your TV's settings to get the right balance, whereas most Blu Rays I've seen are just fine right out of the box.- Contrasts: exceptionally sharp.  But as with the color in many instances, too sharp, especially in the outdoor desert scenes.  It almost adds a cartoonish effect.  It looks unnatural.  Indoor scenes, however, are fantastic except, again, for the over-enhanced special effects (lasers, stun rays, electrical currents, holographic images).- Artifacting: mostly around CGI images but it is minimal; not quite as distracting as the old-fashioned effects as they were originally presented over 30 years ago.- Sound effects: some substitutions that were not in the original release or, strangely enough, in the enhanced re-release; in other words, something purely on Blu Ray; most notable is Obi-Wan's call that frightens away the Sand People: it sounds less like a strange approaching beast of some sort and more like a man who's falling off of one of Tatooine's cliffs;  pretty ridiculous, really and, as stated in regards to color and contrast, overdone.- Sound: horrid.  Yes, it's loud, crisp and free of distortion, but it also sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.  It almost sounds like a mono soundtrack.  I had to take a second look at the packaging to make sure I hadn't been ripped off with a pirated copy.Overall Blu Ray impression: Star Wars: A New Hope has never looked clearer or more colorful.  But the last DVD releases, though not visually as stunning, are still far superior in terms of contrasts, balance and sound.  I almost feel cheated, really.  But man, is that picture ever sharp!  Almost too much detail, really.  Buy this release if you must, but be prepared to play with monitor (TV) settings and just live with the sound.  Personally, I cannot wait to see if this receives a second release on Blu Ray with the true original theatrical release, with improved sound quality and better balance of color.I cannot in good conscience rate the Blu Ray any higher than 3 stars, though Star Wars (the story) is and always will be 5 star entertainment."	3.0	Star Wars (IV: A New Hope) Blu Ray Review	2012-05-20	12	10	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A14XKVSVZRA0WY	"S. Reisenauer ""Sci Fi Fan"""	For those of you complaining about the extra footage being added, just shut up.  George Lucas wanted these DVD's to be like the Directors Cut, previously he was unable to add the extra footage because there wasn't enough room on the VHS.  Now that he has the capability of adding the shots he wanted, fans are lashing back at him.He enhanced the sounds and quality of the movies, which are much better than the original, and the extra footage he added is only space scenes and a few shots of Tatooine.  Its not as if he changed the entire plot.	4.0	Great	2004-09-25	14	4	10
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	"THE STAR WARS movies (the original trilogy) are perhaps some of the greatest movies ever made.  They had great characters, a fantastic story, brilliant acting (at some parts) and were just all around fun.  I grew up, of course, after they came to theaters, but like most people, I had them on VHS.  I was also one of the millions of people who said Star Wars deserved a huge DVD release.  In 2004 I got it, and much to my dismay, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  Some of the changes are not for the better.  On the contrary, the majority of them are worse.  The DVD set released in 2005 is essentially the same, only you don't have bonus features... which is alright, the bonus features were nothing special anyway.  The release in 2004 had four documentaries (the only good one being the A&E; Special: Star Wars: Empire of Dreams), an XBOX demo (not a big XBOX fan) Star Episode III Preview (useless now) and commentary.  That was about it (at least the bulk), and after such a long wait I wanted more.  Like say... the holiday special that I, someone who grew up in the 90's NEVER got to see.  Ever (say sorry).  I also wanted the indiviual makings of the movies.  When this DVD relese came around, I was disappointed that none of that stuff was included.Star Wars was full of fun, action, loveable characters (well developed too), story and just about everything that could make a good movie.  The Empire Strikes Back is often cited as the greatest sequel ever made (especially with the line: ""Luke, I am your father"").  With how successful and well accepted the films became, why did George Lucas decide to change it?  Especially to connect it with the prequels?The changes aren't just small things either.  They're things that have me pretty upset.  I'm talking more than just ""Who shot first?  Han or Greedo?"" (but we all know the scene really is messed up and somehow lessens Hans' character).  What I'm talking about are the even bigger changes such as Hayden Christensen appearing in Return of the Jedi, the CGI which is supposed to be superior, but looks a lot worse.  I'm also tired of Lucas doing things like, replacing real life extras with CGI characters.  This might stem from the fact that then Lucas had virtually nothing to work with, and now he has just about everything to work with.  He's opting for Computers over raw talent.  I'm not against computers, I'm just saying these films were already perfect the way they were, and now that Lucas has come in trying to make them even more perfect, he's destroying them.  A trilogy that once stood above everything, is now being reduced.  Boba Fett's voice is now the same one who did Jengo Fett in the prequels, Anakin's ghost is Hayden Christensen, even the music score has been altered to some extent.  Conversations have been altered with terrible dialogue (most notably is the conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back), things that were already given CGI treatment for the 1997 release were given even more CGI treatment and it looks terrible (most notably, Jabba the Hutt in A New Hope).Overall, I'm disappointed with the DVD release.  And this isn't the last to come.  According to IMDB, Lucas has another release of the trilogy scheduled for release in 2007.  I probably won't pick that one up.The 1997 release was much better than this.  The 1993 release even better.  Movies shouldn't be altered to let them compete with ""newer"" movies.  I think people have enough common sense to say to themselves, ""You can't expect a movie made in 1977 to look like a movie made in 2006.""  There's a reason why the color version of Casablanca caused an uproar, and there's a reason why the original Star Wars trilogy being tweaked is causing an uproar.  You're supposed to preserve classics, not ruin them.  I doubt Lucas will ever let people nostalgic for the original have it.  Honestly, he should have two sets out.  One that's completely the original versions, every single mistake every CGI taken out and everything we loved about the original and one with all these ""tweaks"" for those who actually like them (you can always strap that one with a warning sticker or something).  But don't limit our choices to only being able to have a trilogy that's been tarnished.I'll let it slide with a three.  Three stars because they were three great movies.  But some of these changes aren't for the better.  Digitally restored pictures and sound I can deal with, altered sequences I can't."	3.0	Great Movies, Horrible Tweaks	2006-04-07	30	28	2

I don't see how difficult it would be to put both versions out. The original for sentimental reasons. I saw A New Hope when I was six years old in '77. I was awestruck. I'm actually quite curious of the new things they're putting in. I'm not too sure how it's going to work out with Hayden's face being put over Sebastion Shall's at the end of Jedi. I hope it won't be a destraction. The only thing I completely dislike above everything else, is Greedo shooting first in ANH. That is absolutley insane! For just a split second, it looks like a wax dummy of Harrison Ford. But other than that, I think I can live with the changes. One thing I hope they add to ANH; In the trash compactor scene, right after the creature under water makes it's sound, Luke turns around and MOUTHS ""what was that?""

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A30RAN3JQ4E874	"S. R Spencer ""James S."""	"Star Wars was my childhood. I still have the very original trilogy on VHS. My favorite edition of the trilogy was the ""Definitive Edition"" THX version that was released on LaserDisc some time ago. The crisp sound and picture were welcome touch-ups to the original film transfer.But apparently, ""Definitive"" wasn't good enough for Lucas. I admit, when I was a kid 1997, I loved the Speical Editions. But as soon as I got the VHS of the SE trilogy, I realized that what I liked about it was only the thrill of seeing the trilogy in theatres. I watched the tapes once.  Whenever I wanted to watch the triolgy, I watched my LaserDisc set.If there's one thing I hate about action films today, it's the sore thumb I call CGI. It's just lazy, obvious, and inauthentic. I remember in films like Ben Hur where if a filmmaker needed thousands of people for a crowd scene, he would cast thousands of extras. I definitely prefer puppet Jabba to CGI Jabba, puppet Yoda to CGI, hopping, light-sabre dueling Yoda, and no character at all to Jar Jar Binks.The new music in Jedi is obnoxious. I can only thank God that they didn't tamper with the classic Cantina Band songs.And why does Greedo shoot first? Someone explain that to me please. I didn't want to see the Wampa and I didn't want to see the Sarlaac monster. I laughed myself silly when I heard the added scream when Luke falls after having his hand cut off.But it's not like these additions make the movies bad, I would just prefer to watch the theatrical versions. The movies are still classics. Not to mention that the DVD format will be a welcome change to having to stop the movie to change the side 14 times to watch the whole trilogy on LaserDisc."	3.0	Dear Mr. Lucas	2004-08-07	4	0	4

Look I have seen every one of these films in the theater since I was 6 (1977). There is nothing wrong with any of these movies. Granted I do enjoy some more than others, but with Attack of the Clones and Im willing to bet Revenge of the Sith as well will make it into my top 3 favs in the series. That said, I have the VHS of the originals and the only thing that got changed that screwed up the movie a little is the Han Shot first scene. Other than that, the new effects are good and I dont have a problem with it. Granted I can now burn the originals on DVD from my Video tapes if I really want them that bad. But I can live with that one scene. Mr. Lucas is doing a fine job getting these out with good commentaries and tons of extras.

Then when he started messing with the original series from 1977 - I just couldn't believe it. Yes a director should have the final say on their work, but.....I have lost interest.  What made Star Wars special to me was the humanity of it - it had an almost mythological significance to our culture - it wasn't something we went to see simply for the special effects - it was deeper than that. Unfortunately, George Lucas has lost sight of what made his films special - and he is trying to 'improve them'.

Now I think he did to see how many of us fans are gonna complain about his altered changes. Well he did a very good job of that by adding a ""NOOOOO"" into Vader in ROTJ which really is unnecessary in that scene. The kryat dragon call change was also unnecessary and very comedic and if you have heard the new sound of it it would have you laughing to tears in disgust. I totally hate for George to change these wonderful classic film into something very awful. I mean he should go back and change the 2nd Death Star in ROTJ into a completed CGI look of the Death Star and this would have made it better, don't you agree? I also wish GL would change the scene in the Cantina where Han and Greedo were having a discussion back to where Han shoots and Greedo dies and that's the way it should be cause Han is a scoundrel not a defender.  He did however made a good change like covering the Wampa's piece of arm pole that had been exposed for over 30 years which looked a little fake with a cgi arm. So all on all I think the SW Trilogy on Blu-ray will somewhat have me buying despite some of these absurd changes just for the brilliant picture to these films. So that's all I have to say and hopefully GL will change and put the unaltered versions of the original Star Wars onto Blu-ray soon. I know a lot of us are disappointed about these changes but it's GL's movies and he can do what he wants to them. But when most of you are protesting it by not buying his movies then it will give George an idea and give us what we really want and that's the original theatrical versions and maybe the 1997 SE edition too."	3.0	George Lucas Has Altered The Star Wars Trilogy Once Again That Made It Worse	2010-10-16	0	0	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1RQCAN0GDV2E1	StarWarsFan	"I have never been as dissapointed with a director as I have been with George Lucas in the last few years. I consider my self a Star Wars purist having seen each of the original Star Wars Series movies in their original form several hundred times. Lucas has disappointed me twice in recent years. The first time was with the release of the horribly acted Episode II. Mind you I forgave him for Episode I which many considered equally flawed. I let it go with the expectation that he was building to something. And yet that ""something"" never truly materialized in Episiode II.  While there were certainly outstanding special effects (ala fight sequence with yoda) and Natalie Portman's on screen chemistry had improved, the addition of Hayden Christensen (or at least his acting or direction) was a complete dissapointment. His incessant tantrums as the young Anakin Skywalker were WAY over-dramatized. I don't know if it was poor direction or he simply couldn't act, but I am guessing poor direction since he clearly had other scenes which were less dramatically distasteful. And then there was the dream sequence where Christensen is moving around in bed, apparently sleeping nude, in what vaguely resembles an excercise in self-pleasure rather than a distrubing dream. This recieved well more than a few chuckles form the audience when I saw this film opening night. Some people fell out of their seat laughing. Even portman had some ridiculous scenes like when her character falls off a craft in the sand dunes and moans a little then jumps up and says something like ""I'm fine"" and runs off. So was she intentionally faking being hurt or was it just bad acting/direction??? then there was the infmaous fireplace scene where Amidala and Skywalker are eating dinner and the scene abruptly cuts to a dimly lit room with a roarig fire and the two on the couch looking like they are about to get it on. While portman brought much to the role this time, Christensen's chemistry was virtually absent and his acting left much to be desired. Lucus, if you are listening, with all due respect, you are not a romantic film director. Leave that to the professionals or get some help on your next project, PLEASE!!!!And let's not even get into the introduction in Episode I of the annoying character JarJar Binks, who I can only assume Lucas wanted to be the equivalent to C3PO form the original series in terms of comic releif. But the otherwise lovable C3PO was only annoying to the characters in the film , and this played well with movie goers. Jar Jar, by contrast, was annoying to the audience as well, and this is a no no. By the the second introduction of Mr Binks, the audience was already jeering him and by the third it seemed many people hoped Obi would strike him down with the lightsaber already. Lucas apparently may have realized this and reduced Jar Jar's part in Episode II, but he was one character we could have forgotten all together.We have come to associate special effects with Lucas films, but all the special affects in the world will still not make up for poor acting performance. Special effects are not the only important thing in making a movie.This brings me to the second and equally, if not more dissapointing, faux pas on Lucas' part. With his release of the newly remastered triliogy, Lucas has butchered what was a phenomenal cult classic. He didn't simply enhace flaws (which might have been forgivable). Instead he made obvious and distracting additions to what was already a phenomenal movie which had the effect of making it less phenomenal.Just a couple examples...1.) The addition of Hayden Christensen to the scne at the end of Return of the Jedi when Yoda, Obi-wan, and Vader are shown as apparitions.  While yoda and Obi-Wan are seen as they appeared at the moment of their deaths, Vader is now seen as the young anakin Skywalker (Christensen's face is digitized over the original Anakin). Perhaps this was symbolic since anakin ""died"" when he started to turn to the dark side. But if that is true then he was also ""reborn"" at the end of Jedi, when he turned away from the dark side.2.) The Music for the Creature Cantina (Episode IV) and the scene at Jabba the Hut's Palace (Return of the Jedi) is DIFFERENT. As someone who has seen the originals many times before, this was extremely disruptive because I remeber the original music. Not to mntion there are ton of newly digitized  characters.But there are many more examples including adding characters or backgrounds that weren't inthe originals, changing voices, etc.Perhaps the only true ""enhancement"" is the addition of Ian McDiarmid's voice to Empire Strikes Back. Since he was already voicing the Emporer in the original Retunrn of the Jedi, this served to increase continuity succesfully.I realize these digital ""enhancements"" for the DVD, many of which were initially introduced by the Star Wars Gold Editions, may have been what Lucas originally envisioned, however, they are highy distracting to purists who remember things a different way. It's a lot like watching a pink elephant walk accross the screen while you are trying to enjoy a rerun of a favorite old film.In fact what perhaps what Lucas should have been striving for is a way to make the new films seem more like the old films where the acting was good and the sets seemed real and not just like an over budgeted blue screen production. Think back to the original land speeder sequences, and the days when X-wing fighters actually looked like they had been used in battle and not just like silver bullets whisking throught the sky.  If we want a glamourous obviously fake space ship movie we can watch the Star Trek movies.  Star Wars has always been unique in that, despite the fantasy, there was a sense of realism. A sense that what is on the screen might actually be happening.Or how about the cinematography of a real desert (without the blue screen) which makes us think we are actually onthe planet tatooine. A veiwer could easily get lost in the story and forget that it was not real. With the overboard remakes of the new Trilogy DVD and poor acting in Episodes I and II, it is hard to forget this is not real be cause we are always distracted by poor acting and/or direction, or things that are OBVIOUSLY digital.At least with the Gold Edition VHS release, viewers had the OPTION of buying the original unaltered VHS movies instead. I waited for the DVD thinking the same option might apply. Unfortunately it does not.  So that very significant piece of my child hood that I remember so fondly, and invested so much time and allowance money into, is no longer what it once was. I realize I can't go back and re-live my childhood, but movies used to be one of the things that were left untainted by the progress of time. With remakes like these, it seems even movies are no longer sacred. Its a good thing George Lucas doesn't own the rights to the Declaration of Independance or other historical treasures. If it were up to him he would probably airbrush some of davinci's paintings and dress the figures in more modern or even futuristic attire just because he could.While it is hard to be optimistic given his recent track record, let's hope Lucas gets it right with Episode III.  My advice to him... Go back to what made Episodes VI-VI the phenomenal cult icons that they were (before you destroyed them). Good story line, good acting, SUPPLEMENTED and NOT REPLACED BY special effects, and make us forget what we see is not real. And PLEASE (if you have ANY concern for the feelings of fans who have contributed and continue to contribute so much in adoration and revenue to your films and merchandise) release the original UNALTERED Trilogy on DVD."	2.0	A Disgrace to Star Wars Purists Everywhere	2005-02-05	32	22	10

But the other freedom here and the one that is most important in this issue is ARTISTIC FREEDOM!!! Mr. Lucas is the one who has dedicated his life to his imaginative film career NOT YOU!!! He has every right to do with his films as he chooses. The man is a perfectionist and a genius. He has always said that the technology in the era these films were produced 1975-1982 was inadequate for his vision. So he changed and or added things, so it was more what he wanted it to look like. The tie-in changes from the first trilogy to the second trilogy are there to give a better transition from the first three to the last three. Also lets not forget all of the technical achievements Mr. Lucas has given the film industry. A NEW HOPE is probably the most influential technological film of the 20th century. It could also be argued that it has one of the greatest character driven Good vs. Evil stories ever created. The theme is centuries old, yet I know of few others that pull off this conflict so well. So show these films and Mr. Lucas some respect. If you don't like the new changed films don't watch them and enjoy your old copies of the films on Laserdisc or VHS. I have the originals on VHS also, fun for nostalgia.

However, the ORIGINAL ""Star Wars"" should not be lost from existence in the process, since it is a genuine piece of film history. No matter what Lucas calls it, it is much more than a ""work in progress""! I don't care how many ""Special Extendo Director's Deluxe Definitive"" editions of the movies become available in the years to come. The more the merrier.  Clearly, no one has ANY right to demand that Lucas stops changing his own movies. Just ALSO give us the original 1977 film that changed cinema (for better AND for worse), NOT to satisfy our 70s nostalgia, but to represent an extremely important turning point in film history.The ""two stars"" rating I've given this boxed set is for the uneven quality of the DVD presentation (which was outlined thoroughly in the earlier ""Gotta Get This Off My Chest"" posting), and not for any personal opinions about the merit of ""Greedo shooting first"" or ""Hayden at the end of Return Of The Jedi""."	2.0	...	2005-04-03	15	12	3
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2CC84TUMMGPPB	steel breeze	"All right, here we go.  Yet another rant, I'm afraid, that will fall on deaf ears.  I'm 34 years old, and was 6 when the original ""Star Wars"" movie came out.  They say that ""you like best what you see first"", and I'm sure that there's some truth in that.  Personally, I don't like what Lucas has done to one of my favorite films.  But let's take a bigger-picture view of this, and let's put aside what he's done to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return Of The Jedi"".  They were, after all, just sequels.  Relax... I know ""Empire"" is an extraordinarily good sequel, but it IS still just a sequel.The original ""Star Wars"" is a bona-fide film classic.  Forget my personal opinion.  There're 30 trillion ""personal opinions"" available on the Web; who the hell is going to care about mine?  I'm talking HISTORY here: ""Gone With The Wind"", ""King Kong"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey""... you don't go back and mess with these classic films just because you CAN.  Does the stop-motion ""King Kong"" truly represent what the filmmakers had intended, or would they have PREFERRED to make Kong look more real and menacing, but simply lacked the technology?  When George Lucas says his new edition of ""Star Wars"" more closely represents what he WOULD have done in 1977 if he'd had the resources, I have to say ""WHO CARES?!""  The fact is, the original ""Star Wars"" doesn't belong to George Lucas anymore.  Or it shouldn't, anyway.  As of May 25, 1977, when he put it out into the world, it became the property of the fans.  And Lucas has stolen it away from us.  What would George Lucas himself say, I wonder, if the estate of Willis O'Brien had been given instructions (before his death in 1962) for the old special effects in ""King Kong"" to be destroyed and replaced with new, more convincing effects when the technology improved?  What if we were never again able to view ""King Kong"" as it had played in its original release?  It would be a cinematic tragedy.  And I'm willing to bet money that George Lucas himself would object to that, even if it had been the intention of the original filmmakers!But enough about all that.  Let's pretend that this version of the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" actually deserves a place on your DVD shelf.  To add insult to injury, the quality control on these DVDs is TERRIBLE.  I'm a professional feature-film Director of Photography, and I've been through the process of transferring and mastering films for DVD release many times.  I know when a sub-standard job has been done on the transfer.  For one thing, the black levels are often WAY too low.  A significant amount of shadow detail has disappeared entirely!  For example, you can barely see the TIE fighters in the asteroid chase in ""Empire""!  Now, I like dark.  I was the DP on ""Groove"", and we made that sucker DARK in its DVD release, but these black levels are ridiculous, and do NOT accurately re-create the original cinematic experience.  And it's not as if it's ALL too dark, so that you can compensate by turning up the BRIGHTNESS setting on your TV.  The X-Wings flown by Luke and Wedge are glowing too brightly as Luke declares he's going in ""full throttle"" over the Death Star; the snow on Hoth is blowing out the highlight detail during the AT-AT attack; Han, Leia, Chewy, and 3-PO are completely ""blooming"" with over-exposure as Han declares ""never tell me the odds"" in the asteroid chase.  It's all over the proverbial map.  (And don't worry--I know how to set up my monitor; there's no problem there!)  The work is so shoddy and uneven, my normally idealistic brain (I really DO like to give people the benefit of the doubt) can't help but wander into cynical territory: Lucasfilm MUST be making this DVD release intentionally sub-standard so that we'll want to buy the next re-release of the trilogy (probably on the upcoming HD-DVD format), which will undoubtedly have even MORE changes to our beloved films!In my opinion, the ""powers that be"" did NOT troubleshoot this release thoroughly enough.  In the first film alone, the opening ""Star Wars"" title recedes MUCH too quickly into the distance (compared to all previous incarnations, and all sequels); the Star Destroyer in the opening shot is firing WHITE lasers instead of green (because someone involved with the film restoration forgot to complete this particular effects element); the dialogue quality is all over the map (witness the conversation between Leia and Han after escaping the Death Star: the sound levels and hiss are incredibly uneven) despite the fact that we have amazing amounts of ""sweetening"" technology at our fingertips.Why does the public accept such a shoddy release?  What choice do we have?  It's not as if George Lucas is EVER going to admit an error.  He's the ""George Bush"" of film directors.  It's a shame that the fate of one of the most beloved films of all time is in the hands of someone like him.But, go ahead and buy it anyway.  The original trilogy WAS truly great, and this is all we're ever going to get... unless Lucas finally listens to the OVERWHELMING public opinion in favor of releasing the original, and that simply ain't gonna happen."	2.0	Gotta get this off my chest...	2005-04-02	27	19	8

However, expecting George Lucas to do anything that makes sense is smoking something.  Sadly enough, I don't think that decisions regarding Star Wars are going to make any sense until he has left this mortal coil.What I mean by this is that you should expect the blu-ray versions of the movies to come out, although they'll probably come in a box with 1-6 first and 4-6 will be the special editions.  Then they'll eventually release them individually (this process will take about 5 years). Then another 2-3 years after that we'll finally get the original versions of 4-6.  Then 2 years later, a new technology that has 2-4x the resolution of Blu-Ray will become available and this process will all start over again.  But, by then, they'll have remade 4-6 as a completely new movie with new actors,etc...

I even bought the Toshiba XDE600 dvd player with extended detail to upscale the DVD onto my HDTV, specifically with Star Wars in mind.  Then, when I ordered some big home theater speakers on sale, (Polk Monitor 70's, highly recommended,) I waited another two weeks for them to arrive.  It then took me another week to convince the girlfriend to watch Star Wars with me...So last night, I dimmed the lights and played the movie, only to find that I can't get the aspect ratio right.  I tried every option on the DVD player trying to fix the problem. The only way I can get it to keep the correct ratio is to set the DVD player to 480p and the TV to overscan.  The image is terrible, I can't believe how low resolution it is.  The film artifacts and color/contrast issues are to be expected, but why not provide even a DVD-quality transfer??? With how I have to watch it, its got so much static and snow I feel like I need to adjust the bunny ears.  Its WORSE than VHS.WORSE THAN VHS!I then went to the back of the DVD box and noticed the new THX versions are widescreen enhanced but the originals are letterbox widescreen.  Ah, Lucas, you are a joker.  I popped in the other disc and we watched the ""enhanced"" version for the second half of the movie.  The ratio/ stretch problem is fixed.  I upscale to 1080i (best my TV does) and set the extended detail to enhance sharpness.  Looks great.  I must say the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track is very enjoyable.I give the original versions ONE star.  They are an insult to all Star Wars fans.  They ruined my special movie night.  They raised my blood pressure and gave me heartburn.On the plus side, the THX versions are bearable.  If only there weren't added characters etc.GEORGE LUCAS, PLEASE...

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ALGKFL9K7J921	steve keeney	I waited a long time to buy any Star Wars movies, and I'm glad I waited for this set, along with the 'matching' prequel set.  I saw the original Star Wars at the theater when it first came out and was blown away by the story, action and special effects.  It truly was groundbreaking.  I didn't see 'Empire' or 'Jedi' in the theaters, but watched them on VHS  when they were released.  They looked lousy on VHS and I lost some of my enthusiam for Star Wars as I felt # 5 & 6 were just ripping off and copying the original.  Remember this was in the day before sequels were accepted as 'legit' movies.I decided to invest in the whole series when I found this box set and the pequel set at a good price.  This set has a very good digitally mastered newer version that looks great.  On my upconverting DVD player on a 32 inch 720i screen, it looks almost like a bluray hi def picture.  I mean its that good.  The bonus disk with the original theatrical release has not been remastered or cleaned up and looks it.  It is also in an extremem 2.85:1 aspect ratio and even on a wide screen set, the black bars top and bottom are huge.  But its nice to have as a bonus piece of nostalgia.If you haven't bought Star Wars yet, this would be a good purchase, or get the Bluray version of this set.	5.0	Star Wars done right	2011-04-16	4	2	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A36S6ESZJYEN9G	Steven Alpert	Very happy with the video quality and the sound is very good in Surround EX, though two things disappointed me: They didn't go with a DTS soundtrack and the packaging is just too commonplace for the long awaited release of Star Wars on DVD. This Star Wars boxed set uses the standard plain-old dvd cases. I would have liked to see packaging in a cardboard jacket as they did with the deluxe editions of Lord of the Rings, or The Godfather boxed set, or something even more special like the fold-out packaging of Band of Brothers encased in a tin container. Good news is that movies each fit on one disk, and the wait is over.	4.0	Very Ordinary Packaging.  Great video and very good audio.	2004-09-24	9	6	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2NX6HF0Q9NFS4	Steven G. Lougher	I cannot believe that these movies are on DVD.  The special effects are incredible.  I cannot wait for the final version when the have all 6 Episodes cleaned up to Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith(ROTS) standards.  When the special effects finally complement, as in add to, (not compliment) the brilliant actors of the day.  I will be so intrigued, that I will devote an entire week to watching the movies 1-6.  After all, they are all on movie broken up in to small segments.  I cannot wait for them to return to theaters in 2007 (educated guess because it is the 30th anniversary of the saga on screen, 2006 will be the 30th anniversary for the book versions) .  They will be able to show episodes one through six with ROTS special effects one right after another, which is what they tried to do in 1997.  (Which was the first time I had ever seen a Star Wars film in the theaters, it was amazing).  I am 20 now so I do not remember the original releases because I was not yet born.  And being in the science field.  I want a story to make sense.  So, when I see episodes one through six  I do not have to worry about the fact that Jango Fetts unaltered clone Boba would have a different voice, logically that does not make sense they are identical twins in every way except age and environment.  Temuera Morrison is the new Boba(clone), because he was Jango(genetic template).  And it looks that the the Stormtroopers are in fact clones of Jango as well which is what we found out in Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones(ATOC).  However, they did not mess with their voices, yet.  I just think that they are waiting for the release of ROTS to see for certain that the Stormtroopers and the Clonetroopers are in fact one and the same.  This is truely the best work of art of all time.  I just cannot get enough of it.	5.0	Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) DVD	2004-09-21	4	1	3

I originally had no interest in it simply because of the title ""Star Wars!""  War to me was never something to enjoy and the previews seem to imply some of this.  So, I simply was not interested but my girlfriend was so I went.The theater was pack and we had troubles finding a seat for the both of us.  There were a lot of kids there and also adults.  We finally found a place to set and throughout the movie my girl friend kept on throwing her arms around me.  So, when I left the theater I felt I was wrong because I thought I enjoy the movie.  Well, we broke up about a year later after I took her to this movie 10 times.A few years later they re-release Star Wars again accept this time I saw it alone.  This is when I discover that this was exactly what I thought it was.  A war promoting film!  Sure, I have had the same speech given to me about that it is only a movie but I have seen other movies that seems to get people upset.This movie is suppose to be a fantasy but yet war began to look like a game instead of the deadly hell it really is.  War is destruction and if there were no real wars going on then I would agree.  Star Wars is just a movie.I did watch all 3 of the films including the Episode One.  I enjoy it some because there was little killing in it.  It let the robots do the fighting and dying for them.  I am aware that some aliens got killed but not too many.  Episode Two I cannot say anything about it because I haven't seen it.  The preview implied that it went back to the original concept.  Murder and slaughter the bad guys.I did rent Star Wars IV because I wanted to hear what George Lucas had to say about the movie.  So, I watch the commentary first and then I watch the movie.  The only reason I watch the movie was because it's mention that in 1977 they actually did a 6-speaker sound track for the large theater that had this equipment.  Then they did a stereo version and then the majorities were monaural.  Since I have a 5.1 surround sound system I was curious to what would sound like.  I was amaze by the sound effects and the music but to bad the story of the movie wasn't as good.I give the whole Star Wars series a one star because I simply hate war films.  War films are dangerous because they make war look like a game."	1.0	Star Wars	2004-09-25	47	4	43

Especially bad - 1) the edited Greedo scene 2) the added Jaba scene in the original 3) all those stupid CGI monsters especially roaming around the cantina that did not need to be added 4)changing the song in Return of the Jedi 5) adding more monsters in the Return of the Jedi Jaba scene looking like some cheap 3D movie.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AL277B4AQCWBG	Steven Reynolds	"I love the Star Wars trilogy, but I won't be buying this set given Lucas' decision to release only the miserably botched ""special edition"" versions on DVD - on grounds of ""artistic integrity"", no less. This from the creator of Jar Jar Binks! His recent claims that ""these are the movies I really wanted to make"" and ""the originals were only about 25-30% of what I wanted them to be"" wouldn't ring so hollow if the special editions were 70-75% better. But tell me, does planting a ludicrously unrealistic digital Jabba into Docking Bay 94, or fiddling with the colour of the sky on Bespin, or re-scoring the Ewok finale add 75% more quality or enjoyment to these films? Apparently George thinks it does, which actually goes a long way towards explaining why the CGI-heavy prequels are so appallingly inane. The truth behind the Special Editions, I suspect, is more commercial: in 1997 they were a marvelous opportunity for Lucasfilm to capture a new generation of child consumers, and promote the prequels by whetting our appetite for the potentials of CGI, not to mention collecting a couple of hundred million for their trouble. Now, once again, alternate versions are being used to empty the pockets of ""completists"" who have to own everything in the Star Wars product range. Even if you buy George's argument, surely DVD compression technology is on the brink of being able to offer a kind of dynamic editing whereby you can choose to watch a movie with the ""special"" sequences OR the original sequences, all on a single disc? Why not wait until, say, 2006 when we can do this, and release a ten-disc set with Episodes I-VI plus bonus materials? Why not give the fans the chance to enjoy the movies they grew up with, rather than the politically-correct (Greedo shot first, yeah right), digitally enhanced embarrassments forced on them twenty years later? It obviously isn't enough for Lucas that he's ruined our dreams for Episodes I, II - and presumably III - with abysmal writing, ham acting, and a CGI obsession bordering on clinical insanity. He's had to go back and put his ruinous stamp on Episodes IV, V and VI as well. Of course, this might not always be the case. Never one to shy away from an opportunity to cash in on the greatest cinema franchise in history, you can bet your lightsaber Lucas will eventually release the original editions on DVD - just as soon as 99% of the fans have wasted their money on this set. Way to go, George. It's all about you."	3.0	Stick with your VHS (and your childhood memories) for now...	2004-12-27	15	12	3

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1FJFMX9S83298	Steven smith	I like the Original Trilogy of Star Wars just as much as the next person, perhaps even moreso. These movies were classics in film history, and will never lose their status as such. Star Wars came along, and changed the way movies were made from then on. For the better? Definitely! New directors and writers aren't afraid to make fantasy or sci-fi movies anymore. We have a lot to owe to the Original Trilogy.But do we have a lot to owe to the DVD's?A New Hope: Lucas goes on to further change this one since he made the first real changes back in the Special Editions of 1997. Not only is Mos Eisley crowded, but we get 'new aliens' in the cantena. Sure, the graphics and CGI are good, but they subtract from the actual storyline. One instance of this is Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo by the Millenium Falcon. The CGI on this version of Jabba is just TERRIBLE to say the least: he looks like an half-finished piece of computer work that a CGI student did in college or something. Not only does he NOT look real... but he looks downright pathetic. Remarkably, he is a step-down from the CGI of 1997. In this scene, Han Solo proceeds to step on Jabba's tail. There are technical reasons for this having to do with a Jabba stand-in being originally a human, but it totally confuses the story and characters. If Jabba is such a feared and exhalted being, how could Han get away with stepping on his tail and showing BLATANT disrespect and disregard for his authority? Jabba comes across as very unscary now, thanks to the DVD and Special Editions.The Empire Strikes Back: The change of adding in the snow-monster happened back in '97. It wasn't a plausible and useful addition to the movie: instead of being elusive and more scary, we get to see the snow monster now. I have to admit that some of the shots of Cloud City were interesting, and perhaps forgiveable. But what about the original unedited versions? Were they so bad? Did they subtract from the story? No! Not showing all of Cloud City helped the movie be more mysterious... But now the city is layed bare like a nudist woman.The Return of the Jedi: This is the weaker movie of the Original Trilogy, in my opinion. But that is for another time and place to discuss its actual weaker points. With the exception of the abomination that was Jabba's palace, the CGI changes were almost non-existant to the naked eye, right to about the time at the end when the spirits of the Jedi are standing and watching the celebration of the Ewoks. Notice anything? Of course you noticed! Hayden Christensen has replaced Sebastian Shaw! Why? I don't know! George claims continuity... but if he really cared about continuity, he would have made the Prequel Trilogy better, wouldn't he? It is a cop out and disgrace. This is unforgivable, in my opinion.There are some bonus features on this DVD, but they hardly make up for the bastadization of the actual movies. Such as commentary (sub-par commentary by sound effects artists, George Lucas, and the director of ESB.)Also, there is a documentary called 'Empire of Dreams.' THAT is indeed worth watching, if you fail to understand the point of view that older fans of the Original Trilogy have of Star Wars and its legacy.Do I suggest buying this DVD? No. Would it be a good edition to your collection of ridiculous and cop out editions of classic movies? Yes.	1.0	Cop Out edition of Star Wars.	2006-07-24	22	15	7

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A254MEO41PLII	Steve S.	In a moment of weakness I pre-ordered the Special Edition DVD. I really hate paying money for a version of these films I don't care for, but am pretty sure the originals WON'T be offered on DVD anytime soon, if ever.I saw the Special Edition movies when they were re-released in theaters before the horrible Episode I and was under-whelmed by them. The new CGI scenes only diminished the movies I had loved as a kid.Obviously, Lucas cares little about the moviegoers who obsessed over the original films and gave him the bucks to create his 'empire'. Would it be such a tremendous faux pas to at least offer 'A New Hope' in its original form? Sure, clean up the picture and tweak the sound, but give people the chance to re-experience, scene-by-scene, what they were so wowed by in '77.Given that these DVD's are #1 here on Amazon, I doubt Lucas cares about some upset fans who will end up purchasing the Special Edition anyways. Still, it would be interesting to see if an Original Edition would out-sell the CGI enhanced bastardizations. I certainly believe they would.One more thing, the bonus disc with the two-hour 'Empire of Dreams' documentary; it just aired on A&E; last week! What gives? Four hours of 'special features' now becomes only two hours because I've already seen half of it for free on a cable TV channel!Lucas is a man out of touch with what attracted people to his original movies. His last two films are proof of this. Lightning, it would appear, does not strike twice.	2.0	Why did I buy it...?	2004-09-19	30	16	14

Most of the new scenes are simply awful; much of the digital imagery doesn't fit the original feel and is poorly crafted - the new scenes look as if they were thrown together at the last minute without any faithfulness to the originals.  The Jabba scene in ANH is probably among the most blatant hack jobs, and the jabba's palace scene in ROtJ is a close runner-up.  There's also many instances of cut and/or changed dialogue.  These are most certainly NOT improvements.  My father used to say, ""If something works don't fix it.  It's likely you'll screw it up.""  Lucas did just that."	1.0	Hack jobs	2004-10-28	41	31	10

I got the trilogy yesterday, had a party with my family, and watched all 3 films back to back to back.  A New Hope was just like it was years ago and it was better.  Even Greedo did not get in the way of enjoying this movie.  When it was over, we all clapped for the credits and agreed at how great it was.  The seconed one was spotless and even the lightsabers were just right.  The new Boba Fett voice was just right!  Empire Strikes Back has not changed!!!  The last one , ROTJ, took the cake with the Battle of Endor and the final lightsaber battle.  These three films were an epic journey that I had not enjoyed that much ever in my life.  These are so much better than the originals.  I know that the Hayden replacement sucks now but after watching the episode three trailer, I have no doubt that people will have a different respect for him after they see episode three.  The trilogy I saw last night was the same trilogy I had seen when I was little.  It also can now pass for the best trilogy of all times!PS:  In case you were thinking that I must not be a true star wars fan who knows all the little details, your wrong.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3B5A9YBC4HGZA	still6345	The Star Wars trilogy has finally come to DVD and it looks GOOD.  It sounds GOOD.  My primary complaint though, is that things have been changed.  I don't mind adding something here or there, though there was nothing wrong with the original.  It's just that some things don't match.  While most of the movies got a complete digital makeover, the faces of the people remain relatively unchanged.  This makes the film seem without a time period.  Overall though, it looks great especially the second two films.  However, the ending to Jedi has been changed, and in my opinion ruined. SPOILER:  Rather than have a quick ending with a little celebration and a catchy YUB YUB song, its replaced with a bunch of different planets celebrating, Anakin is changed to the new anakin, and an extended Ewok celebration of CG graphics.  Ewoks doing flips and cartwheels to new music is not my kind of an ending.  You can't fight Lucas, and who knows when he will release the originals as they were, so go buy it, and maybe if you watch the film enough you'll forget how it once was, and enjoy it for what it is.	4.0	He's not a Yub Yub.	2004-09-27	2	0	2

But I love the collection more than anything because of the extras. You can't beat seeing Mark Hamill's screen test, George's 70's hair, and the documentary on the evolution of Darth Vader for Episode III. Not to mention the nerdy pleasure I get out of watching the films with subtitles so I can see how names and places are REALLY spelled and see how they translate R2's beeps and whistles. I LOVE IT!!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A12SC9SEDBGL3W	supergeek5000	The great thing about DVD is the quality of the sound and picture. Though many say its just putting a VHS on a disc, they are completely wrong! DVD digitizes the media so that it is crystal clear and the quality of sound is improved dramatically. When playing the VHS versions of the Star Wars Trilogy you find the surround sound... well lacking.Now that the Trilogy is on DVD, you finally get the surround sound you've been looking for. Now I know that it has not been released as of yet, nor have I been able to view it, however I do know that when compared (even with old movies) to DVD, VHS doesn't come close. Imagine a tie fighter screaming over the Millenium Falcon as  the sound comes from behind and speeds towards the front speakers of your surround sound!I reccomend these DVD's for people with surround sound and/or want the behind the scenes scoop of the Star Wars Trilogy. However for the overall price of people just wanting the extras, its not worth your money if you don't have surround sound. My advice to people is that you should stay away from action DVD's if you don;t have surround sound; you'll miss the bang that the creator wanted the movie to give you. The only other negitive thing I would say about this DVD is that people without surround sound will be missing a lot of what DVD really is; quality sound entertainment.	4.0	Major Surround Sound Improvements!	2004-07-11	6	2	4

I'll get the real versions off ebay or at a comic book convention since you don't have the brains to release them. To all the upset fans who dislike the SE DVDs I say go to the library, or look around here on Amazon, there are a lot of good books that they don't go back and rewrite.All this garbage about ""original vision"" is just talk.  So, I guess Lucas didn't have the cash to pay for the special effects for Greedo's first shot so he just had to settle for Han firing first till he'd sold $10 zillion in toys to pay for a remake?  Whatever, the SE are just more marketing by a guy who got lucky and wasn't smart enought to pass the creative reins over to someone qualified for the job.  That's the cue for all the indignant fans to chime in with the ""HIS vision...HIS story"" schtick or even a Binksy ""How wude"".  Well HIS vision is crap. And if the ewokies, gugunguhs, midichlorians and the romance between 8 year old boy and 15 year old girl hasn't convinced you I can't imagine my review will change your mind.I have only $7 more for you George and that's for the episode 3 admission.  It will be mighty embarrassing sitting in the theatre with all of the other people who's curiosity insists that they pay the cash for a ticket to that travesty instead of spending it on something more enjoyable like getting 50 baseballs straight to the skull at the local batting cage.

I just wish he'd either made 2 different sets availabe (ex: 1. original, pre-special ed. cut and 2. Special Ed.) or had simply included both versions in one set...which has been done for other films.Also, to clear up something mentioned in another review: I do not wish to see Han shoot first because I want him to be a ""cold-blooded killer."" I want to see him shoot first because Greedo was there to kill him or take him in and, Han would be smart enough to waste his a$$. It makes both characters look stupid: A. It makes Greedo look like a sorry bounty hunter to miss point-blank. B. It makes Han look slow. Part of the fun is seeing Han transfrom from a mercenary to a hero. There is no reason he could not kill Greedo and still be a good guy.Also, I WILL buy these editions on DVD but, thank God I also have DVD copies of the Pre-Special Edition cuts from Laser Disc.

On one hand I understand the sentiments of the Old School Fans but on the other hand also agree that ""its the filmmaker's choice"". George Lucas created StarWars and I guess has every right to alter it as he pleases. Inspite of having grown up watching the Originals, I thought pretty well of some of the changes that were made in 1997.(The Jabba Scene,The First Flight of the Millinium Falcon, Han Solo Bumping into over a hundred storm troopers during that comic display on the Death Star,The Hoth Wompa, The look of Bespin)I absolutely hated the Prequels and I'm dreading the Revenge of the Sith. Hayden Christensen simply cannot act and the thought of him being Darth Vader is a little difficult to Fathom. Vader brought out the Fear of God in me when I was a boy but Hayden C is some guy out of a ""chick flick"" who represents squat!But coming back to the Trilogy. The one point i'd give Lucas 100/100 on is the quality of his products. The sound in 5.1 Ex will be absolutely spectacular, the remastering of the picture will be amazing and all in all the fact that it has THX attatched to it says it all.

I can't get over how smooth everything looks, not at all grainy and gritty like the original VHS, which wore down over repeated use. However, I don't like how they messed with it, inserting Hayden Christiansen at the end. It was amazing the way you did it, DON'T MESS WITH IT! When I first saw it, I couldn't believe my eyes.

The movies are (or should I say were) fantastic, and yet he seems to have nothing but contempt for what they were. They were an adventure through a new world, with characters we loved and scenes that we endlessly repeated. All he sees is a dirty old movie with strings and puppets, and he whips out his shiny computer and makes it into what he wanted it to be. Great for him. I sure hope he is finally happy and satisfied. To me, I think he is a selfish, greedy man who has succeeded in spite of his blunders and short-sightedness.The DVD's will sell, of course. What other choice do we have? He won't even give us the satisfaction of the old versions included on the DVD. It's almost like he is too afraid that people will actually like his old work more than his new spiffed up work, and he is right. With re-making the trilogy, he has botched it up, and he keeps trying to change things, and he just keeps getting it worse. I wish I had the fortitude to boycott this DVD, all his toys, and Episode 3. But alas, I am too big a fan to let it drop, and I must be content with the fumbling, clumsy steps that George Lucas takes to reclaim his work.	1.0	Sad, sorry, and sick of George	2004-09-21	27	14	13

Further...AND THIS IS MAJOR...there is are sound errors in a couple scenes of a new hope where the channel got flipped in the surrounds causing it to be muffled (e.g. Leia talking to Tarkin).  They have been compared by numberous A/V forums and they are screwed up.  Lucasfilm has gotten a high volume of complaints already, but released a statement that it was artistic creation.  Garbage.  Many people are calling for a recall.  This is unacceptable.Kershner and Lowry have commented on further work being done on the HD set for release on Blu-Ray/HD-DVD for 2007 (30th anniversary) and that it will have deleted scenes and a number of the ""making of "" documentaries that have been lost.Will we get the OT in its original form?

I don't think a single day has gone by in the eight years we've been running The Digital Bits that we weren't asked: ""When is Star Wars coming out on DVD?"" We've struggled to answer that question as best we could of course, constantly checking with both 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm. We've repeatedly tried to convince George Lucas himself to release these films on DVD, eventually succeeding in getting at least the prequel films on disc (after a LONG campaign with other websites in which we jointly collected over 30,000 signatures and took out a full page ad in Daily Variety). But as to the ultimate question of when Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi would be released on our favorite format, Lucasfilm's answer was always ""eventually"". Well... eventually has finally arrived, hard though it is to believe.The Star Wars Trilogy arrives on DVD in the form of a new 4-disc box set, containing not only the much-loved movies, but also a separate disc of all-new bonus material. So let's take a closer look, shall we? We'll start with the films themselves.As most of you know, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space. It seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil Galactic Empire and the freedom-loving Rebel Alliance. Luke longs to fight for what he believes in, but the conflict is raging a long way from his far-flung world... at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncle's farm. Luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a Rebel princess, intended for a wizened Jedi Knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who happens to live nearby. The droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Unless these plans can be safely delivered to the Rebel forces, their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all. So with the help of Kenobi and a wise-cracking pirate named Han Solo, Luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life, pursued all the while by the Empire's most sinister agent of evil... Darth Vader.It's really unnecessary to say much more about this film, as you're all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now. Released as a lark in 1977 by 20th Century Fox, George Lucas' original Star Wars became a hugely successful blockbuster almost overnight and it quickly changed the landscape of Hollywood filmmaking, not only reviving a long-lost cinematic genre but also pioneering the field of movie visual effects. The film had an incalculable impact on my then ten-year-old life, opening my eyes to the possibilities of the film medium and firing my imagination like nothing before it. I'm certain that, like me, most of you have a very special place for the film in your hearts. But Star Wars today is somewhat different than you might remember it from 1977... or even the 1997 special edition re-release.As you may have heard, a number of new digital changes have been made to the Star Wars films for this DVD release. As with the 1997 special edition, A New Hope has received the majority of the attention. Many shots have been altered in very subtle ways, which only the most zealous fans will notice. There are, however, a number of more major changes. In A New Hope, these include a revised opening shot as Luke's landspeeder enters Mos Eisley Spaceport (the speeder model is more detailed and moves more naturally), an improved version of the Han/Greedo fight (Greedo still shoots first, but only just - the blasts are much closer together and Han's movement is smoother), a new CG model of Jabba the Hutt (it's a revised version of the Episode I model of the character and is much improved) and re-rotoscoped lightsaber blades throughout the film (blade color is more pronounced and the animation is more like the prequel films). Personally, I quite like most of these changes. The Han/Greedo fight is still less than perfect, but it does look more natural. Han's head doesn't jerk like it did before - instead his whole upper body shifts over slightly. And the blaster shots are VERY close together now, so the encounter is not as implausible as it was in 1997. I still wish George would just let Han shoot first as he did originally in 1977, but I can at least stomach watching this scene now.Three years after the release of the original film, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back continued the epic adventure. After successfully destroying the Death Star, Luke and his Rebel friends have been pursued across the galaxy by Darth Vader and the Empire's mighty space fleet. While hiding out in a new secret base on the frozen planet of Hoth, the Rebels are discovered by Vader. After a massive snow battle, our heroes barely escape with their lives and are scattered across space. Luke finds his way to the jungle planet Dagobah, where he begins training to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, Han and the princess find refuge on the planet Bespin, unaware that they've been followed by Vader's forces. Soon, Luke must abandon his training to come to his friends' rescue, ultimately risking his fate in a reckless confrontation with Vader himself.Widely considered to be the best of the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back tells a much darker and more personal story than the original film, despite the inclusion of several dramatic action sequences. In a risky move, this unconventional sequel sees the good guys basically getting their asses kicked from the start of the film until the very end. It's not a happy or upbeat adventure by any means, and it ends with a stunning and unforeseen twist that left theater audiences hanging on the edge of their seats for more than three years after its original release in 1980. Despite the cliff-hanger ending (or perhaps because of it) Empire ranks easily among the best film sequels of all time. It holds up well to this day.The digital changes to Empire for this DVD release are fewer than they are in A New Hope. In fact, there are only three major changes. These include the use of Temuera Morrison as the voice of Boba Fett (which I suppose makes sense given that Boba is a clone of Jango from Episode II), the elimination of Luke's scream when he jumps to escape Vader on Cloud City (which had been a source of much debate among fans - why would he scream if he were jumping willingly?), and the use of actor Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor (replacing the old woman and voice actor Clive Revill who played the character originally). I should note that the Emperor alteration also involves a change in the scene's dialogue - one that is at first confusing. The Emperor now tells Vader that he has no doubt ""the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star"" is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker, to which Vader replies ""How is that possible?"" That doesn't seem to make sense, because we know that Vader is aware of who Luke is from dialogue earlier in the film (""That's it. The Rebels are there. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.""). I suspect, however, that we'll find out in Episode III that Anakin DOES learn of Luke's existence as an infant, and he hides this knowledge from the Emperor. What that would mean is that Vader's been waiting all these years to find Luke as an adult and turn him to the Dark Side so that they can overthrow the Emperor together - a plot Vader ultimately confesses to Luke at the end of Empire. We'll have to wait for Episode III to see how this new bit of dialogue fits in.Concluding the original trilogy in 1983, Episode VI - Return of the Jedi opens as Luke, now a fully trained Jedi Knight, returns with his friends to his home planet to rescue Han Solo from the vile crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke then revisits Dagobah and learns that he must ultimately confront Darth Vader if the galaxy is to have any hope of peace. Luke also learns a surprising secret before rejoining the Rebels as they prepare for the final, decisive battle in the conflict between Rebellion and Empire - an all-out assault on the Emperor's second and even more powerful Death Star.As the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi fails to be either as fresh as the original film or as surprising as Empire. Too much is predictable here (such as the appearance of a second Death Star) and too many compromises were made for the younger audience members (the very presence of the Ewoks, for example) which is especially noticeable after the more adult themes of the previous installment. That said, Jedi does manage to adequately complete the story arc of the original trilogy. There's nice symmetry with the way the character storylines are wrapped up, and there's enough action to keep the film interesting. I'll be curious to see how well this conclusion works in the context of the overall 6-film saga once Episode III arrives in theaters in May, 2005.As with Empire, are three major digital changes to Jedi, all of which appear at the end of the film. When Luke removes Vader's mask to reveal his father's face, the eyebrows of actor Sebastian Shaw have been erased (presumably because Anakin's face will be badly burned in Episode III). Then, after the second Death Star is destroyed, when the film cuts to the various celebrations around the galaxy, Naboo is now included among the planets we see. Finally (and this is a big one), when the Force ghosts of Ben, Yoda and Anakin appear to Luke at the very end of the film, actor Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with Hayden Christensen (as he'll appear in Episode III). That's going to piss off a lot of fans, but it makes sense. I suspect the rational is that a Jedi's Force ghost is frozen in appearance at the exact moment of his or her death. Since Anakin Skywalker basically ceases to exist in Episode III (becoming Darth Vader), his ghost remained at that age. Yeah, it's a stretch, but hey... within the logic of the universe, it does make sense. Like it or not.Ultimately, I've accepted that Lucas is entitled to change these films until he's happy with them. The fact is, he's been changing them since 1977 (for example, right after the first film was released and became a hit, Lucas quickly went back in and added the Episode IV - A New Hope tag). These new CG alterations are simply the logical continuation of his desire to overcome the technical challenges he faced when he originally made the films. I have to tell you, I'm as surprised as anyone to find myself actually appreciating most of these changes. With the sole exception of the Han/Greedo scene (which still bothers me, although less now than as it was in 1997), I think all of the changes are either genuine improvements or simply make sense given the ties to the prequel films. I still think Lucas has a responsibility to save the original versions of these films out of respect for the fans who have supported them all these years, the artists who creatively invested themselves in the original work, and as a way to remind us all just how far the films have come since they were first released. And I still have hope that we'll see those original versions released on disc... eventually... in a more elaborate box set of the entire saga. But more on that later.So that's the films as you'll find them on these new DVDs. Now let's talk about the DVDs themselves. Click to the next page of the review and I'll tell you all about it.Part Two - DVD Presentation Quality & ExtrasThe most important part of any DVD presentation is the video and audio quality of the film itself. So how do the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs stack up in this regard?Simply put, the Star Wars films have never (and I mean EVER) looked this good before. The films presented on these discs absolutely sparkle, in all their anamorphic widescreen glory. The folks at THX and Lowry Digital worked for months to create new high-definition digital masters of these films, transferred directly from the original negatives. Once the films were transferred, painstaking efforts were made to clean the digital masters of dust, dirt, scratches and excessive grain. To give you an idea of just how much work was involved, more than 100 bits of debris were digitally removed from EACH FRAME - ultimately entailing the removal of over 10 million such blemishes in all over the three films combined. As a result, you will not find a single speck ANYWHERE on any of these films. The snow-white slopes of Hoth and the sand-baked dunes of Tatooine have never looked so pure.Because the transfers were done from the original negatives, you're going to see detail in these films that you've never seen before. You'll notice this right from the opening shot of A New Hope, when the Star Destroyer chases its quarry over the surface of Tatooine. Just look at the subtle swirl of could patterns on the planet below - astonishing. Best of all, not a lick of added edge enhancement was required to bring out this detail. What else is good? The color palette here is more lush and accurate than ever before. You're going to be blown away by everything from subtle flesh tones to the vibrant gold plating on C-3PO's chest to the bright orange flightsuits of the Rebel pilots. Contrast is also spectacular, with deep detailed blacks and clear, accurate whites. All three films in this set are just going to absolutely blow you away, and the bigger your screen the better it gets. The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is the best excuse you're ever going to have to go out and buy yourself a good anamorphic widescreen display. Until true high-definition arrives, it just doesn't get better than this.On the audio side, all three films have been fully re-mixed in true Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX. The dynamic range in these mixes is impressive - everything from the softest passages of John Williams' signature score to the most explosive moments of action will full your home theater space with natural, immersive sound. The mixes are packed with atmospheric fill, active panning and surround play. The matrix-ed EX center back channel is nicely active - you'll definitely be glad you have an extra speaker back there, believe me. Dialogue is at all times clear and the LFE will really give your subwoofer a workout. These audio mixes are an absolutely appropriate match to the near perfect image quality. The sonic experience of these films on DVD will floor you.As with the previous DVDs for The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, each movie disc features there different menu sets themed to the various planets visited in the film. These appear at random when you boot up the disc (although there are codes you can use to see specific sets - see the Easter egg guide on the previous page).In terms of extras, each movie disc also features a full length audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew. For all three films, George Lucas provides his thoughts on the overall themes and concepts, as well as interesting anecdotes on the characters and production. Actress Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) chimes in as well with her thoughts and shares some particularly funny behind-the-scenes stories about working on the films. Sound designer Ben Burtt discusses his audio work and the creation of various sounds for each character, vehicle, prop and environment. And Dennis Muren addresses the elaborate special effects work. For the Empire commentary, director Irving Kershner joins this group to provide his insights on the making of the film. As with the The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones commentaries, the name of the person talking will occasionally appear at the top of the screen to help you identify them. I don't want to spoil anything here - you've all been waiting so long for these DVDs that it's just better for you to experience it all yourself. Just know that the commentaries are fascinating and absolutely worth listening to.The majority of the extras in this set are contained on its fourth disc, appropriately titled Bonus Material. This opens with an animated menu that depicts the Falcon flying through the asteroid field in Empire (you eventually end up in the Falcon's cockpit to make your selections). I should also note here that nearly every item on this disc is presented in anamorphic widescreen video - a very nice touch.Arguably the most important bonus feature on the disc is Kevin Burns' 151-minute Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy documentary. Burns was given full access to the expansive Lucasfilm Archives and was able to uncover hours of behind-the-scenes footage from the making of these films that you've definitely never seen before. The documentary begins with Lucas' original idea for the films, then covers the development, pre-production, filming and post-production of the original Star Wars in tremendous depth. Burns' idea was to take you back to 1977, to relive not only the struggle that was the making of the original film but also the film-going climate into which it was ultimately released. You are there are at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, waiting in line to see the film for the first time. You actually get to see the original version of the opening crawl, sans the Episode IV - A New Hope tag (and it will give you chills to see, believe me). You get to hear from absolutely everyone involved in the making of these films. Over 40 new, in-depth and original interviews were conducted with all the major cast members, the production staffers, etc. They're all here to give you their thoughts on the films.The first hour of Empire of Dreams is devoted exclusively to A New Hope, and then the remaining time is split between the making of Empire and Jedi. As I said, you're going to see things you never knew existed - footage of the cast clowning around on the set, a couple alternate versions of scenes from the films, plenty of production artwork and still photos - you name it. Irving Kershner tells a great story about how the secret of Luke's parentage was kept hidden from the cast, crew and fans. It's pretty amazing stuff. The documentary does drag a little bit once you get past the first hour, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it and you'll probably watch it more than once if you're a fan.Also on this disc are a set of three production featurettes. The Characters of Star Wars tells of the development of each character within the story and how each major role was cast. This includes some great, never-before-seen video of actors who tried out for the parts but didn't get them. Can you imagine Kurt Russell as Han Solo? Cindy Williams as Leia? William Katt (yeah... The Greatest American Hero) as Luke? It's fun stuff.The Birth of the Lightsaber addresses how the traditional weapon of the Jedi came to be. We get to see rare video of fight rehearsals and on-set raw footage (without the blades rotoscoped in). Ben Burtt tells you how he came up with the sound, etc. Again, good stuff.The Force is with Them: The Legacy of Star Wars looks at the influence the Star Wars films have had on Hollywood filmmaking (and filmmakers) as a whole. It features new interviews with the likes of Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and many others as they each talk about how the success of these films affected their careers and their work.Fans of Star Wars minutiae will be pleased to learn that a whole gallery of rare theatrical trailers and TV spots for each film has been included on this disc, each in anamorphic widescreen video and presented in quality you've never seen before. There are also galleries of original poster art for the films, as well as a gallery of rare production photos. The production photos are very cool to see, but they're also a little frustrating because they include images from many deleted scenes we've all been waiting to see for years. That's all fine and good... except none of these actual scenes are included on the disc. That's right - you will not get to see Luke and Biggs on Tatooine from A New Hope, the Wampa attack from Empire, or the sandstorm from Jedi. The fact that they're not here is deliberate and tells you something else - they've been held back for inclusion on a more elaborate special edition release of these films in the future (I actually have word from sources that Lucasfilm is already planning the high-definition box set of the whole 6-film saga, possibly for the original film's 30th anniversary in 2007). It shouldn't come as any surprise that more elaborate special editions will eventually be released, but I found the lack of deleted scenes here to be irritating and I think others will as well. It's a major strike against the extras on this set.There are three other cool extras on this disc you'll want to check out (and others many of you won't give a rip about). The cool stuff includes a long-awaited sneak peek at the forthcoming Episode III. This takes the form of a featurette on the return of Darth Vader. We get to see the production staff building the new Vader costume, actor Hayden Christensen talking about what it's like to don the familiar black helmet, and Christensen and co-star Ewan McGregor practicing the infamous lightsaber duel that will climax the film. I think it will get you sufficiently pumped for the last Star Wars film ever... at least enough to hold you over until November when the teaser trailer for the film will arrive in theaters.Speaking of trailers, as with the previous Star Wars DVDs, these discs include DVD-ROM weblinks to an exclusive online site where you may get the first look at additional footage from these films, the Episode III trailer, etc.The other cool extra is a nifty Easter egg hidden in the bonus disc's menus. Like the previous DVDs, ""1138"" is the code to unlock it. When you do this successfully, you'll be treated to a funny gag reel from the original Star Wars films (see the Easter egg guide on the previous page for instructions on how to access it). I should also note that two of the aforementioned production featurettes on this DVD have funny little moments during the credits that you'll enjoy as well.What's left on this disc is the not so cool, by which I mean the marketing fluff. This includes a trailer for the Star Wars Battlefront Xbox game and a preview teasing the making of the forthcoming Episode III videogame. I frankly don't care about either, but I suppose some of you out there will. It's also worth nothing here that if you put this disc on your Xbox machine, you'll get to play a complete preview level of Star Wars Battlefront. Again, I couldn't give a rip, but I'm sure some of you will appreciate this.So that's the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, circa 2004. The films themselves definitely look and sound better than you've ever seen them before, and there are enough little (and not so little) tweaks and changes to each one to either thrill you or make you want to pull your hair out (or both). The extras on this 4-disc set are generally quite good, with the exception of the marketing material and the lack of deleted scenes. None of it is truly great, but it's certainly good and worthy of your time. Going through these extras, you definitely get the sense that what's been included here is just the tip of the iceberg, and that much more elaborate special editions of these films are likely to find their way to disc in the years ahead. Given the long wait to get these films on DVD... well, no DVD release could probably be equal to that level of anticipation. Still, with picture and sound quality like this, it's pretty easy to justify the purchase price for this set. Throw in the documentary and the audio commentaries, and it's really a no-brainer.After all my bitching and moaning about getting these films on DVD over the years... my occasional tantrums and frequent soap box proclamations... am I finally a happy Star Wars fan? You know, I don't even know what the words ""happy Star Wars fan"" mean anymore. But am I secretly giddy that I finally have these films on DVD? Yeah, I am. I hate myself a little for it, but such is the curse of Star Wars geeks everywhere. No matter how angry and jaded I get, I still get chills when that logo crashes across my screen and that familiar John Williams fanfare blares over my speakers. Yeah, I got a bit of the goosebumps when I found out that Episode III was going to be called Revenge of the Sith. And yeah, I'll go to whatever crap movie the Episode III teaser trailer is attached to just for a couple minutes of eXtreme geek-out time. Don't even try to pretend that a lot of you don't feel the exact same way. We're a pretty pathetic bunch aren't we?Anyway, I hope you all enjoy these DVDs. God knows you've waited long enough to get them."	5.0	May The ***** Be With You..	2004-09-18	11	10	1

That release made you a billion dollars then and later for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". Perhaps you loathe them now. Perhaps you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, and tortured over the hell you created 35 years ago. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You are a billionaire thanks to moviegoers that saw your movies between 1977 and 1983, NOT 1997, 2004, and 2011. I am going to be the one to say it: You OWE US the original theatrical versions. Why? Because those are the ones that gave you your fortune, that we fell in love with growing up. The ones we paid for in 1977, 1980, and 1983. So yes, George, you imbecile, you owe us THOSE versions. Anything else is a stab in the back and an insult to every moviegoer that made you a billionaire. Period.

I watched, and enjoyed, the Original Trilogy in the theatre and laserdisc, but these Special Editions are truly distasteful and really show that Lucas was a far superior film maker in 1977 than he is today.If he or his heirs ever release a DVD collection of the critically acclaimed Original Trilogy, then I'm buying, but until then, the wallet is closed!	1.0	Lucas Won't Get My Money!	2004-04-12	0	0	0

These are not the original versions but the ""enhanced"" by computer re-released versions.  I believe that perfection should of been left alone but as we know as technology gets better, we like to make better of the old.  Anywho.........Considering the 1st was filmed in 1975-1976 for a 1977 release, this and the 2 follow ups are excellent fanfare.  Not even a sci-fi hater would shun away from these great soap opera of the stars epics.  John Williams music adds power and panache to the films and George Lucas has the imagination of a 12 year old that could only mean greatness when it comes to story telling.  His THX sound system only pushes the the audio envelope even further.  Definately worth the money.  Especially for the enthusiast.  And as I say with every review, DON'T BOTHER WITH THE FULL SCREEN VERSION OF ANY MOVIE.  THERE IS A 100% LOSS OF ARTISTIC VALUE AND DIRECTION.

The special features and long lost trailers and tv spots are worth having alone.I own copies of the original films, before they were changed into the Special Editions, and must applaud the restoration of these decades old films. The picture quality of the DVDs is worth the price of the set by itself.I saw Star Wars when I was 4 years old.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3GL1GASO93WF3	T. Brink	For everyone who is upset at only the Revised editions being available on DVD, well, I agree with you. With the capacity of the DVD disc, there is no reason why both the revised and &quot;classic&quot; versions of the movies couldn't be placed on all three discs. This is what I hoped would be done, but alas, George wouldn't get twice the amount of money that way. The latest piece of information I heard, and I hope this is wrong, is that the ghost images of Obi Wan and Anakin will be replaced with Ewan McGregor and Haydn Christensen in the DVDs.	1.0	Wait, it's worse.....	2004-08-06	15	9	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2LP48V0UWL8BB	"T. Brissette ""Hiker Tom"""	"Lucas is updating the orginal three films (the middle three episodes) because he wants to link with the newer ones (the first three episodes to create a cohesive six-part series.  Don't forget, Lucas' original idea was a nine-part series.  He made what were the middle three parts of this epic and said he'd never make the other six.  Well, a long time later, technology had progressed to the point where Lucas was able to go back and make the first three parts.  Like them or not, the new films are episodes I, II and III, and are part of the Star Wars canon.  I can see why he wanted to go back again and update the original films so they would mesh with the newer ones; he is the creator of Star Wars and is his right.  If I had made Star Wars the way he did, I would do the same thing.  It's kind of silly to have two sets of movies that are parts of the same overall story not agree with each other.  The original films in an unchanged state, are, according to Lucas in a USA Today article about the DVD set, ""dead"" to him, so consider them gone; they're never going to be on DVD.Judging from what I've read here and elsewhere, there are not that many changes to the original three films, aside from the technical fixes (like the matte line removal) that really were needed.  I mean, let's see what was added to episode 4 (I'll always call it ""Star Wars"" and not ""A New Hope""):  1. Han and Greedo firing changed; if it has been changed again so they now fire at the same time, then it's ok with me.  2. Deleted scene with Jabba and Han added; looks like Jabba has been redone and is much improved over the ""special edition"" version, so no harm there.  One can debate over whether the scene itself needed to added.  3.  Deleted scene with Biggs added; didn't fans WANT to see that?  No harm there, though I think the scene disrupts the flow a bit.  4.  More ""activity"" in Mos Eisley; the scenes needed it, since the place always looked too dead for what is supposed to be a bustling spaceport.  And that's it, what so many are whining over--just a couple of minutes or so.  People, it's STILL Star Wars.  Most of it is still the same as it ever was--Vader is still evil, Luke still destroys the Death Star--but now looking real spiffy and with better sound.  As for the other two, ""Empire"" had the least changes done to it, and anything done to ""Jedi"" is a good thing.Everyone has wanted the original three movies on DVD for a long time, and now they're here, and there's all this crying over minor bits.

I remember seeing the original version as a kid, and I loved it.  It was such an amazing experience.  There was really nothing like it at the time, and the story pulled me in to such an extent that I saw the movie(s) multiple times and loved them each and every time.  It was not only my experience of the movie, but that of my family and my friends as well.  It was a shared social experience to see the original version of the story.  So what that the special effects weren't perfect.  My imagination filled in details that weren't specifically shown on the screen.  And, as many times as I saw that story, like many kids, I want to see THAT version of the story.  I don't want to see George Lucas's ""Oooo, I really wish I could have done this when I made this movie.  It would have been so much cooler if....""  I really hate George Lucas for mucking up a social icon.  I want to see the story that I experienced and loved as a kid, not the version that George Lucas felt compelled to tweak.I refuse to buy this version of the movie.  If George ever decides to put out the ""original"" NON-special edition version of this movie, I will buy it in a heartbeat.

The movies are worth five stars, but since we are once again not getting the mid-nineties THX Original Cut Remasters, this set only gets three stars. I get that George likes to tinker with his old work, but why deny fans what they really want? Include both versions or at least offer a choice of what to buy. Yes, Lucas created the series, but after the fans and pop culture as a whole embraced them, they became as much ours as his. We want cleaned up versions of the original prints. That's it. If Lucasfilm released these, he could do whatever he wanted and most wouldn't care. As long as access to the original works is unrestricted, the fans' concerns would probably be eased. I don't even know if my old vhs works. I'd just like to see the old films as they were but in widescreen/hi def.	3.0	The Originals...	2011-09-09	6	6	0
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A17Z7Q1JPI7CWA	T-Dog	This review is basically to tell everyone who gave this DVD set a 1 star rating - to get a life.If you don't like the changes - then watch the VHS tapes that I know you own.  Give me a break!!!Consider this set on DVD to be the Director's Cut that Lucas has always wanted.  And also, consider that he has to relate these 3 to the new trilogy.  So the changes are necessary.If you're a true fan like I am - you have every version on VHS.  I have the original THX release box set from 1995, and I have the Huge box set of the Special Edition on VHS.  This edition on DVD is a much improved version of the Special Edition.And, if what I heard is true - the original versions of the Trilogy will be out on DVD in 2006.So, please - stop raggin' on George.  It's his vision - not yours.  Lock yourself back up in your closet and stay there.  Leave the reviews to the true fans.Thank you very much George Lucas - for the best set of movies on DVD I've ever owned!!	5.0	Everyone needs to get a life!	2004-09-29	0	0	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1WGSYKU3ZT81C	ted  clark	I notice ORIGINAL fans applaud the ORIGINAL movies and trash the 2nd trilogy for it's CGI effects and untraditional cinematography. Here's the thing; the 2nd three was NOT meant to be the same. If George Lucas meant for them to be the same, he would have produced them sooner. Personally, George Lucas made the right decision waiting for the right time to make the 2nd three movies. He personally said that the technology to produce them the way he envisioned it in his mind was not available in the 80's. Simply stated, Get Off His Back for not sticking to the original ways! Yes, this trilogy is good, and we will always love the way everything just seemed so cool back before computers caught up to filmmaker talent. I definitely suggest getting it whether you are a fan of the originals or not. However, don't judge the newer versions by the standards of the old; they just to mesh. Like mixing yesterday's mashed potatoes with todays or judging apples and oranges, if you judge Star Wars by the same standards, you're just mixing 2 good things and hating them both for being original.	5.0	New versus Old... like apples and oranges	2014-05-07	15	0	15

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2F70UKIRBUJ	"Terri A. Frazier ""THX1138"""	I just finished watching Return of the Jedi from the boxed set.  All of the films are great!  I believe the changes George Lucas made to the films not only make them better, they help tie them into the first three visually and helps with continuity.  I was really worried as there was a different feel from the original films to the prequel films.  With the additions to episodes IV, V and VI, the transition will be much smoother.  The changes to the films were minimal and did nothing to change the ultimate story line.  The picture and sound quality are 100% better, especially in A New Hope.For those of you that can't handle change, I suggest you select another genre.  SciFi is about change and progress.  These are George Lucas's films, he is an artist.  No artist creates to please others, they create to please themselves.  If others are pleased and enjoy it, so much the better.  It is not why you create.  He can do with these films as he sees fit.  The many problems he encountered in the making of the films did not limit his vision, just his ability to express his vision.  This was corrected in the DVD set.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he doesn't tweek them further after the release of Episode III.So once again I say, Thank You George Lucas, you did a great job, and I really hope everyone with vision will buy this set of DVD's.  They are a BLAST!!!!!	5.0	Thank You George Lucas	2004-09-27	9	4	5

I thought I'd be a bit more fair than some other reviewers who aren't happy about what Lucas did to these movies.I have a friend who recently bought this trilogy (watched only once) from another friend for three per movie (grand total of nine dollars).  Now, I don't think my friend got an unfair price, although I feel it's a bit on the high side to be paying for butchered classics.If I were to buy this trilogy, six dollars (two per movie) sounds more reasonable to me.  Despite the fact that Lucas destroyed a legacy and toyed with the childhood dreams of many of us, if he decides to drop the price to six bucks for the whole thing I'll consider buying it.After all, DVD's can make attractive drink coasters.	1.0	Just to be fair...	2005-03-20	35	20	15

In fact the only bonus is a behind the scenes featurette of Episode II but even that is a disappointment.With the first video release of the Special Editions back in 1997, the videos featured the theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes feature before the actual film.  Those bonuses are absent now to make room for the empty Episode II featurette.  The new packaging has a sporty new look and retitles the trilogy with their new &quot;Episode IV, V, and VI&quot; handles and the sound and picture quality is first rate... for a video release.As for the films themselves, they are first rate entertainment.

This is an awesome movie trilogy, as we all know. It is great to have it on DVD.But I, like most other fans it would seem, do not like the intrusive nature of some of the digitally rendered add-ons in these movies. The most infamous of which is the insertion of a young Hayden Christensen to take the place of Anakin's ghost. (You know - from back when Anakin Skywalker was a member of N'Sync?) It's more than a little disconcerting.George Lucas has definitely gone off the deep end. He keeps blabbering on and on about how now that he has the technology, he is just remaking these movies into what he wanted them to be before the technology existed. Yadda yadda yadda... whatever. Personally, I think he is full of crap myself. (But maybe that's just me.)I seriously doubt that when George Lucas was making Star Wars, he was thinking, ""Geez you know this Han Solo guy is really too much of a bad-a__. I think I would rather have Greedo shoot first, but I just don't have the technology to make that look realistic."" or ""Much as I would like to show Anakin's ghost being a hot young hunk, I don't have the technology to do that. So I think I'll use this old geezer instead."" GET REAL!The simple truth is that Old Georgie just can't stop messing with his movies. He's like a person addicted to plastic surgery. He keeps seeing flaws where there are none. He doesn't know when to leave well-enough alone, and the result is something that really tees off at least 50% (probably more) of his fans.And that's something else that really rankles: Lucas' Hypocrisy. I have heard him repeatedly state that he just makes movies ""for the fans."" That he ""just wants to make fun movies that people like."" But simply put, that's a lie. He doesn't listen to his fans. He doesn't give us what we want. He simply does not care.And why should he? After all, they're his movies and he is making them the way he wants them to be, right? Well that's fine. I don't have a problem with that. But if he is serious about pleasing the fans, why doesn't he give the fans what he wants? He's a hypocrite.""But we wouldn't even have Star Wars without George Lucas!"", the fanboys say. Sure. That's true. But that doesn't mean that I don't have the right to still feel irked when he jerks the movies I REMEMBER out from under me.""But they're his movies and he has the right to make them however he wants!"", the fanboys say repeatedly. Again, I have no problem with that. But what people REALLY mean when they tell you that is ""You just need to shut up."" I'm sorry, but I won't shut up. I won't shut up until George Lucas gives his real fans what they want.Maybe they'll release the real movies on DVD someday 100 years from now after Lucas has been dead for a while. That might be the only way we will ever get it. But knowing him, he'll probably stick it in his will that ""No One Will Ever Mess With My Movies."" Sure. I'm hanging on to my old VHS tapes, myself.

Of course Lucas decided to include his ""Special Edition"" versions which essentially add pointless CG and other ridiculous edits to the original and beloved films that made the Star Wars series and Lucas popular in the first place. The Special Editions have been hated since they were first released on VHS tape, then again the first DVD set was special edition only and people had to wait a while to get the originals they wanted. Even then you had to buy a 2 disc edition with both, because Lucas feels a need to force these new versions on the fan. If the special editions were included as a bonus on this Blu-Ray release then that would be fine. However you are forced to watch the revised editions of these films.Most people have to worry about their art being censored by media or other corporate factors, however Lucas has become his self censor and changes up his own films. I seriously see absolutely no reason what so ever to buy this set, and the original Star Wars films are some of my favorite movies ever. Also, apparently Lucas has added more new things so it is essentially a special special edition, so now we have alot more ""great"" revisions to look forward to.Lucas has known since 1997 that people do not like his special editions, but forces us to buy them first, why you ask? It's not just because he has lost his mind and thinks these are the definitive versions, he knows some hardcore fans will reluctantly buy these versions and then later buy the original versions which will most likely be released in 2 years or so. Nice cash grab George, as if those toy sales and TV shows aren't making you enough cash on the side you have to screw over your fanbase.

This I can understand, but what people don't realize is that this set contains the original versions of the movies, and not the versions George went back and screwed with. No more out of place CGI shots. Disc 1 of all three movies is the CGIed versions, but the bonus disc contain the original versions (which are the ones to watch). Although a lot of people would complain that the original versions aren't in anamorphic widescreen, it doesn't mean much to me at all.For the movies themselves -Star Wars - An amazing, campy movie. Great characters, special effects (for the time), and a story with nonstop action. A lot of fun, and nothing else. 4.5/5 StarsThe Empire Strikes Back - One of the greatest movies of all time. Simply an outstanding movie chalked full of amazing special effects. This movie combines the fun of the original with a hint of seriousness and black humor. One of my favorites. 5/5 StarsThe Return of the Jedi - The most action packed of all the movies. I thought that the sub-plot with Jabba The Hutt went on for a little too long, but the rest of the movie is up to par with the first two. Great fun all around. 4/5 StarsSo overall, what do I really need to say about the trilogy?

I was 14, perhaps the best age to see it, and I completely fell in love with it.  Of course, so did everyone else.(By December, I was also completely sick of it and ready for the next great sci-fi film released that Christmas: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND).I still think the first is the best, no matter how much tinkering George Lucas does with the special effects.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was good until it stopped.  It did not end.  It stopped.  I remember being infuriated walking out of the movie in 1980.  My sci-fi nerd buddies were ecstactic and I was asking, ""How long do we have to wait now to find out what happens?""Three years later came RETURN OF THE JEDI and I hated it.  Harrison Ford's Han Solo, the most interesting character, took a backseat to adorable little furballs.  I'll always remember watching JEDI in a theatre filled with little kids making the laser sounds and then walking out to see the toy store across the mall with piles of Ewoks and crap from the movie.  A 2-and-a-half hour toy commercial that ends with the signature ""yearbook photo"" shot of everyone standing together, all smiles (even the bad guys return as happy ghosts to wave from the sidelines).So I was pretty disillusioned with the FIRST three films by the early 1980's.(I saw THE PHANTOM MENACE in theatres.  Snooze-fest.  Caught part of ATTACK OF THE CLONES on HBO.  Like the online newspaper parody, The Onion, said, it was ""like C-SPAN from another planet.""  But I'll probably see the last one when it comes out, out of loyalty for the first film that entertained me in a lifetime far, far away....)"	3.0	Three Stars for the First Film	2004-06-19	24	7	17
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AZ84F3SE2A7B	T	The theatrical version is probably the worst transfer to dvd currently available on the market.  The VHS and Laserdisc versions look better because the media was optimized for use on that particular equipment.  The current dvd theatrical release of the original Star Wars, was not correctly formatted for dvd. As a result, the transfer makes the film look older than the dvd release of 'Forbidden Planet' made in 1956.Look at the dvd release of Star Trek 1.  What you have here is the correct balance between restoration and artistic integrity.  There's no need to add anything to it, and in doing so take away the original effect and power of the film.  Lucasfilm cannot grasp this concept.So once again, the Star Wars fan has to put up with the incompetence of a multi million dollar corporation, in an effort to rediscover the works of a now deceased young visionary, by the name of George Lucas.Apparently the originals will never be restored.  I'll be hanging on to this for now, but when I locate a good fan edit, I'll be buying that.  The Lucasfilm corporation has now earned my disrespect.	2.0	Worst dvd transfer of the best film	2005-06-13	1	0	1

"I recently purchased a used laserdisc player and all three original ""Star Wars"" films in their original theatrical versions. Why? Because of this monstrosity. Even the extras are dissapointing (I rented them off of Netflix) since the bulk is a 150-minute MTV-style documentary, about 10 minutes of which is actually interesting. Really, I'm a die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan but this won't ever be on my shelf. Pick up Lucas' ""THX 1138"" for an example of how an update should be done.

Other reviewers have gone into great detail about the technical quality of the Blu-rays. I will summarize this based on my experience.This is the last Star Wars I will need to buy. The image and sound quality is spot-on given the age of the film. I can tell they did quite a bit of work to clean it up without ruining it with any new enhancements. There are several places in the films where the sound volume was off by quite a bit: certain lines were very loud or soft compared to everything else. This has all been corrected on the Blu-rays. Image-wise, there are places where the video is very sharp, and others where it is more grainy. This is actually a good thing in my opinion, it means it is as true to the original as possible and Lucas did not decide to change even more things.	5.0	Awesome	2013-05-19	1	0	1

With all of the film captured on these discs, you can sit there for about 6 hours watching the Rebellion crush the Empire in strategic, intense, and fun scenes. Now, on to each episode. Before I start, I want to say these are originally episodes 1, 2, 3 but were made before the real episodes 1, 2, 3 but since these were written to be later on in the saga, Lucasfilm, the company in charge of Star Wars turned these three movies into episodes 4, 5, and 6.Star Wars Episode IV (4) A New Hope: Luke Skywalker is just recognized in this movie, in which him, Han Solo, Ben Kenobi, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca fly in on the Millenium Falcon onto the Empire's project the Death Star, this large space station can destroy a single planet, as it did to Princess Leia's home planet Alderaan.As Ben Kenobi gets struck down by Darth Vader, Luke sees and gets depressed, because Ben Kenobi was a mentor to him.Review on Episode 4: Great! I am really impressed by all of the film captured on this disc, for me being 25, I wasn't around for the actual airing in the movie theatres, I liked this episode, because it got modified and is better than the original.Star Wars Episode V (5) The Empire Strikes Back: Now, we look at the 2nd installment of the Original Star Wars Trilogy, and see that Luke is more wise, he is training to be a Jedi, just like his father before him. Luke heads to Dagobah to where he meets a Jedi Master, Yoda the Whill, Yoda for short. He then finds out that Yoda knew his father. But, as Luke travels farther in the Star Wars galaxy he heads for Bespin, to where Darth Vader waits for him. As both Vader and Luke engage in a powerful, epic, battle. As Darth Vader tells Luke a tragic line (Well, I will leave that for you to find out) Luke purposely falls down a large tunnel.  Han Solo then gets frozen in carbonite and sent to Jabba the Hutt a large, slimy, low-class, no manners, no good creature on Tatooine.Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back Review: Wow! This one was highly enjoyed, because of the epic action that deeply covered the larger parts of this movie!Star Wars Episode VI (6) The Return of the Jedi:  Luke Skywalker has become an official Jedi Knight, and has returned to his home planet Tatooine, to save his frozen in carbonite friend from Jabba the Hutt's terrible palace. Luke succeeds, but also has to fight Darth Vader. Luke also finds out that Princess Leia is his sister and hears that Darth Vader will turn Leia to the dark side if Luke doesn't so Luke prevails and fills himself with even more preserverence and cuts Vader's hand off.Star Wars Episode 6 Return of the Jedi Review: This movie was well written and I highly enjoyed the action filling the scenes of the movie!Thank you, I highly suggest buying the Star Wars Original Trilogy Boxed Set.	5.0	Great DVD  Set!	2007-04-15	3	2	1

Yes, in all it's grainy non CGI glory.  It looks just like it did in the 70's, is it really necessary for him to rerelease the original in every format?  Now your saying, wow he is not a true fan!  Just so you know I waited in line over 100 hours to see the new movies on opening night so stop thinking that!  If you watch the original theatrical version on DVD, you may find your self saying, wow these don't look as good as when he retouched them.Color in the originals is by no means anywhere as good as in the new movies.  The 70's versions look very drab, the lasers are not bright, the spaceship thrusters are bland looking, and some of the aliens look very clunky.  Plus in the blue ray there are going to be deleted scenes never seen before, Luke constructing a light saber for example.  The whole point of Blue ray is it is in HD, it is supposed to look good.Lucas should get props for trying to keep it modern, how many other film makers do that?  Some might say this is blasphemy, but personally I am buying it on the first day, as will all the true fans.  Why? Because it is Star Wars in HD!	5.0	Relax!

He finally released his pride and joy on dvd on 9/21/04 and it was absolutely worth the wait!!!These are the most important films in the industry today, especially Episode IV, because Hollywood was ready to roll over and die; the film industry was in the toilet. Studios made bad movies just to keep busy (the only good movie up to this point was ""Logan's Run""). When the original ""Star Wars"" was released on May 25, 1977, it marked a new beginning for Hollywood.People lined up around the block and waited for hours and sometimes days just to see what the fuss was all about. When they walked out of the theater, they started to dream about the future. One patron, screenwriter Dean Devlin, said after seeing the beginning of  ""Star Wars"", knew right then and there what he wanted to do with the rest of his life: write screenplays and scripts for films.Devlin was the of the first of my generation to follow his dream, a dream created by George Lucas, the man who inspired a generation to follows their dreams.Lucas cleaned up these films once again to restore their original luster. He made subtle changes to all of them (visual effects, sound effects, etc.), but most of all he changed a couple key scenes in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (the communication scene between Vader and Palpatine) and ""Return of the Jedi"" (the insertion of Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker). He also tinkered with the Han Solo-Greedo shootout in the cantina again to make it seem like both characters fired at the same time (nice touch, but i still prefer the original shot where Solo kills Greedo in cold blood).All told, this is the FINEST trilogy ever to be released on dvd.5 stars, highly recommended!!!UPDATED, 7/8/05: First off, I want to say this to all the whiners out there: SHUT UP!!!! George Lucas is a pioneer in the movie industry. Without him, nearly all the modern technology that goes into today's films wouldn't exist.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's get on with my review. The Star Wars Trilogy is THE BEST thing to hit dvd since The Indiana Jones Trilogy.These are not the same films that most of us grew up with, that's true. The up side of that is we get to see how these films were INTENDED to be seen. George saw an opportunity to improve these films and the one that needed it most was Episode IV: it was incomplete, had primitive special effects (though they were state of the art at the time), and just looked old and dated. George changed all that and finished the film the way it was INTENDED to be seen.My only gripe with Ep. IV is that he added the scene on Yavin 4 between Luke and Biggs, which does add a little continutity to the film, but if you're gonna do it, add the earlier content when Luke goes to Tosche Station to talk to his friends and finds out that Biggs is joining the rebellion. This way, the added scene makes helps with the flow of the film. Other than that, it's an AWESOME film!!!The rest of the trilogy was fine in my eyes, including the insertion of Hayden Christensen as the spirit of Anakin Skywalker. Most folks don't understand it, let alone like it, but it makes perfect sense. Anakin was seduced by the dark side as a young man, so it's only fitting that he join the light side at the point when he was seduced, because there was still good in him and he had redeemed himself.The other surprise was the insertion of Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor in Ep. V. The dialogue was a bit different, but it gives you the viewer, insight as to Vader's true intentions at the time.All in all, these films still get 5 stars from me!!! *****"	5.0	THIS TRILOGY WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!!	2004-10-29	13	6	7

At last I thought we would be able to see a box set that would have met the expectations that the orginial trilogy deserved. My God! just alone,episode IV, A New Hope, deserves better. This is the episode that made Lucas his money and fame.  The features that I would have put into this set would have been the original and special edition versions, (so the fans could make their choice of what they wanted to watch), the makings of all three of the trilogies, the deleted scenes from the cutting room floor and given you the option to intergrate them back into the movie so you could see how they would have added to or detracted from the movie, screen test that you have to hunt for on the internet, all the original theatrical and special edition trailers, the original story boards artwork, etc., interviews from then and now of the cast and crew (this does not mean Lucas sitting in front of a camera for 30 minutes boasting about himself). Yes he did do a great job, but could not have done any of it without the talent and support of  people you rarely ever see.  I know why Lucas did not put the original version on this set.  It is a marketing ploy so he can re-release the original version of the trilogy for the 30th anniversary.  He is only listening to the voices in his head,  instead of the creative driving forces that made it great prior to the prequels.  To him it's not ""may the force be with you"" but ""may the MONEY be with him""!!!

I was an avid Star Wars fan and I gotta say, my jaw hit the ground when I watched ""Return of the Jedi."" When they changed the music scene in Jabba's Palace to this really bad, made for Saturday morning cartoony replacement scene. It was like it was an exercise on ""how can we make cool CGIs???"" When they put in Christian Hayden or whatever his name is, to replace the original actor in the ""ghost scene"" and when they changed the scenes at the end during the celebration. It was really obvious. Plus the music was horrible.I will say however, that the movies do look better after been cleaned up. Some of the things were hokey though. When Greedo shot first-pause it right before and play it in VERY slow motion. You see Han's head flick to his right to avoid the shot-it almost looked like an amateur did some kind of horrible photoshop animation with a cut and paste of his head!Luckily, I do have the VHS versions. If I ever want to watch the last 3 episodes again, I'd watch the first 2 on DVD and the last one on VHS.The saving grace was Empire Strikes Back, which could pass off as a fairly modern made movie. Luckily, of the 3, that was my favorite one."	3.0	Hmmmmm...	2004-10-08	9	8	1

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3ORSHVW3QB9JQ	Timothy J. Marshall	I find it amazing that so few people(most of the reviewers here included) understand the depths to which George Lucas has fallen since making Star Wars back in 1977. Back then, he was an apsiring filmmaker with two great films- THX 1138 and American Graffiti- under his belt, an idea for a movie called Star Wars, and unlimited creative potential. I don't need to tell most of you anything about Star Wars- you probably know more than I do. But what I can tell you is that after Star Wars, Lucas gave up directing and just about abandoned the creative film process altogether. Of course, he returned to the director's chair with The Phantom Menace, but the resulting film made me wish he'd just stayed away - permanently. OK. Back to the point in hand. The three films in this box set are not- I repeat- NOT the Star Wars Trilogy most of us saw when we were kids and have grown to cherish and love. Lucas has succeeded in revising history by presenting the 1997 SPECIAL EDITION versions of the Star Wars Trilogy as THE- one-and-only, original- Star Wars Trilogy. This is not only wrong, but downright evil. It is not Lucas' place to change things- and we shouldn't let him. The National Film Registry certainly wouldn't agree with Lucas on this point- they have the ORIGINAL STAR WARS in their possession. I know some of you may like the SPECIAL EDITIONS better than the ORIGINALS, but don't ever forget that they aren't THE ORIGINALS. I certainly won't.	1.0	This ain't the Star Wars Trilogy.	2000-11-28	27	14	13

I love the original trilogy and the prequels as well, and I've been a fan of the series since I was very young, and the movies are still great. They really defined what people get excited about movies over, and few other film series have the kind of story and characters that draw you in as George Lucas's space epic masterpieces. Never mind that this DVD contains the special editions of the movies rather than the original versions. The films are still great, and if it's any consolidation, Lucas did listen to complaints and change Han's cantina shootout with Greedo back to it's original form. We probably still have the cheesy musical number in Return of the Jedi, but I think I can live with that. I will definately be pre-ordering this set, because I've been waiting for it ever since I bought my DVD player.

I mean the only reason they didn't do that Obi is because it was the famous Sir Alec Guiness (who I love, BTW).  Either way, it was terrible mistake for the Lucas Enterprise to that and yes I miss the original ending music and the dance scene where the funny looking chicken kind of lady sings, I want the original back - I can't believe how expensive it is to obtain it - I don't it on special Blu-Ray, DVD is fine, if lowers the PRICE, PLEASE!.  This is a case in point of life ""If isn't broken, don't fix it"", because it doesn't need to be.

Well to say that this is anything but spectacular would be a lie. What we get is the three orginal ""super"" special editions of the trilogy on dvd along with a fourth bonus disc featuring lots of goodies.Now the first thing you will ask is if these are the orginal classics I saw in the theater back in the 70's and 80's and the answer is no. Nor are these the special editions we saw in the theater in 97. These are actually the retooled ""yet again"" versions scene in 97 or as I say ""super"" special editions. Some of the changes are minor like the cleaning up of the digital effects used in the special editions ""example jabba in ANH"" to major boba fetts voice is now done by temuera morrison ""aka jango fett in episode II"". While some or a lot argue that this is not the version they wanted, I feel it adds to the overall completeness of the saga. And now on to the movies themselves...Disc one, A New Hope - This is where the story begins of a young boy with dreams and a princess in danger coming together with everyones favorite duo Han and Chewie, to save the galaxy from the evil Darth Vader and empire. Probably the greatest thing to happen to movies, and George Lucas's masterpiece. Great effects, top notch story, and great baddies. 5 starsDisc two, The Empire Strikes Back - Episode V picks up where ANH left off and delievers a knock out. Our heroes go to hoth to bespin and we meet yoda and learn the father/son connection. This has the deepest story of all and features more great effects and action scenes, ""yes I'm talking bout the battle of hoth"" gotta love them AT-AT walkers. 5 starsDisc three, Return of the Jedi - Boy does the orginal trilogy go out with a bang, A death star sized bang! We get ewoks, space battles, the emperor, and even some romance, ""ok so empire had more of that then ROTJ but its still in there. The series ends in great fashion and proves that good triumphs over evil in the end. 5 starsDisc four, Bonus material - The final disc is filled full of good stuff. The most important edition is the empire of dreams documentary that is the biggest and best star wars documentary ever put together. You get the best look at all three movies behind the scenes and its just that good. Worth buying in its own right. Then you get lots of trailers and tv spots for all three movies along with a trailer for star wars battlefront. A game demo if you put it in your xbox and poster stills. Last of all you get a look at episode III which you'll watch even though you've seen the movie four times already! 5 starsIn the end this is one of the best box sets on the market right now. These are great films with great special features. Everyone should own this and if you don't well it ain't my fault if Lord Vader comes knocking at your door demanding why. 5 stars"	5.0	Star Wars on dvd can it get any better	2005-07-02	7	1	6

Kelly	"This is in response to some of the people complaining about wanting the original uncut and unedited versions on Blu-ray.Are you people dense?I have seen a HD version of the original episodes 4 and 5 and can without a doubt say that they really show their age. The sound was great at the time of it's theatrical debuts but is really lacking in the modern world. The same goes for the special effects.What was state of the art in it's day can not stand up to the scrutiny of HD versions including blu-ray.Do you really want every flaw in the movie to be exposed in dramatic fashion. Do you really want to see just how much makeup was used on the actors faces. How about seeing the backdrop paintings lines as they run across the floor or to see how miss matched the colors in Matte paintings are compared to the foreground.Some people have the wrong impression that what they see in a theater is HD. Wrong!!!Theater projectors project a semi HD image on the screen, its actually just slightly more HD than a DVD version. But blu-ray disc and a good transfer will put nearly 3 times as much detail and information on a screen for your eye's to take in.Under those circumstances the original films have more in common with buck rogers of the 50's than it does with sci-fi of today.Here's another example of a scene where to much detail is bad.Episode 4This scene takes place on the death star and is in an imperial conference room. Tarkin and Vader are standing when an officer comes in to report that ""they have reached Dantooine and found the remains of a hidden rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time"". Now that you know the scene I'll let you in on the flaws you see with HD. When the scene starts Tarkin is saying something because his lips are moving but theres no dialog. When the officer begins speaking his lips are saying something different than what his words are. Same goes for Tarkins response. Apparently Vader is making motions and hand motions as if he is also saying something but there's no dialog coming from him.The scene was perfect as it was during its day, but under the microscope of HD it is in need of some serious work.Or how about seeing princess Leia with more rouge on her checks than Bozo the clown or better yet Han and Luke with rouge.No Thank You.I like them just fine on my dvd and VHS versions. Blu-ray will just destroy the mystique of the originals.Enhancing them is the only way these films could ever be released on blu-ray."	4.0	Be careful what you wish for.	2009-11-30	30	14	16

Here's my take on the differences.It's easy to see what George Lucas thinks of us that want the original in Blu-ray quality: This version (with all it's digital 'enhancements' is beautiful. The colors look as if they were filmed on well-lit locations, not done with 1970's technology.The 'original' DVD, on the other hand wasn't even given full-screen status; it's shown in a box on my TV (on my DVD player, although my Blu-ray expands it automatically) as if I was watching it on YouTube. Even in a reduced size version, you can't miss the compression artifacts that cover the screen like a low-rez mpeg. It looks better upscaled on my blu-ray, but I still see the artifacts.The updated DVD is much better. At least it covers the full TV screen and lacks the digital artifacts. Both DVDs are a bit too bright in all conditions, probably to show detail that would be lost in the darker scenes.If you want the original story without the new distracting clutter, you won't want this Blu-ray (stick to the Limited Edition set, if you can find it). If you can deal with the changes (maybe consider it a good remake, instead), the color, detail, special effects, and sound make this a beauty to behold.As to the ""Han shot first"" complaints; I personally don't care who shot first, but I have a question for Mr. Lucas: If someone (a professional assassin at that) is holding a gun (bullet or laser) two feet from your head and pulls the trigger when he's confident he's safe, how likely is it that he'll miss?"	4.0	If they'd only do this much for the original version!	2012-04-11	5	2	3

I'm glad he didn't have those tools back in the 70's or these movies probably would have sucked. The prequels are an example of what happens when he gets to play with technology.

Seems that old Georgie has really stirred up a controversy here with his mods. Hmm. I'm an old boy, comparatively speaking, and here's my spew: I saw the original first run of the film in the theater as a kid way back when and I still have a beloved dog-eared copy of the book. See, back then in my day, there were no VCRs (let alone CDs, DVDs or the Internet) so the only way to re-live a great film was with a book and your imagination. I even remember a radio broadcast of the complete movie which I recorded on a cassette tape (remember those?) which I replayed many times and practically memorized. I won't mention the music sound track on 8-track.Star Wars paradoxically became a universally personal experience for many people. And with great expectation and some trepidation, we anticipated the subsequent chapters which all built on the previous films' magic and did not disappoint.Perhaps Lucas was too close to it, and then perhaps too far from it, for too long; the recent prequels do not measure up. They miss the magic by a wide mark (did we really need an explanation for the Force?) but granted, kids today might like them as much as my generation liked the first ones - so be it.As for tinkering with a classic, it might seem only its creator would be capable of pulling it off, but here, even Lucas has not quite succeeded. What he does not realize is that the affect the original films had on the viewer is itself part of what created the story's mythology; the audience is itself a part of the films' history. It would be like visiting the Louvre to discover DaVinci had returned to add acrylic highlights to the hair of 'Mona Lisa' and added Botox to her lips. Or gave her a nose ring.For Lucas, not having the technology in the `70s to complete his vision was unwittingly a good thing. A sort of forced editing that streamlined the story and left more to the imagination. The giant skeleton as a backdrop to 3P0 and R2 after landing in the desert has greater impact and is more suggestive than a CG dino running around Mos Eisley. And no Jabba until `Jedi' builds tension over all three films.In the end, I suppose I don't begrudge him his effort. There was, after all, a chance the tweaking might have been more enjoyable. And I'm sure a new generation of fans have themselves only seen the enhanced release on VHS and have come to enjoy it as much as we did the original. If I knew the originals were coming, I would hold out for them. But if never to be seen again (like the theatrical release of `Blade Runner,' but that's another story...) then I will probably pick these up, throw some Jiffy-Pop on the stove, and crank up the surround sound. I guess it beats dusting off that old book and digging out that tape - even if I had something to play it on. And may the Force be...oh never mind.	4.0	I've got a very bad feeling about this...	2004-09-06	18	13	5

But.. they were actually... good compared to the trash he's sticking his name to now.I can understand some changes. But, to me, changing your movies because you can seems.. slightly hypocritical to me.I thank God that only George Lucas seems to think that changing amazing movies with unnecessary details is necessary. I mean, what if Francis Ford Coppola just, decided that he wanted the Kool-Aid guy to kill off Michael Corleone's brother at the toll booth in the Godfather series? He wouldn't. And you know why? Because Francis Ford Coppola isn't a tool like George Lucas is.And another thing, Hayden Christensen CAN NOT ACT. I guess it's good that he's replacing the other guy at the end of ROTJ, all he has to do is stand there and look pretty, and NOT speak. In my opinion, it'll be his best work to date.	3.0	confusion?	2004-09-05	13	0	13

It has all of the major themes of a major epic. Darth Vader is the greatest!

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3I2EC4DRFWI26	Todd	"Look, I agree with both camps. Lucas should be able to make whatever changes he wants to make and release updates every year if he so chooses. It's his work of art and it isn't done until he says so. Just because he has given the public a glimpse into the first drafts of his vision, doesn't mean they were ever truly finished in his eyes.However, the reason he has been able to finance his artistic vision of a 6 part saga is because of the ungodly amount of money he made on the original three movies. These movies have won countless awards and are an important part of our cultural history. For this reason they should be preserved for future generations to appreciate in the form in which they were originally presented. As much as Lucas doesn't want to, he will eventually give into pressure from the Hollywood community and release these films for archival purposes, although this will most likely not happen until HD-DVD becomes a standard and is in all likelihood many years away.What I think he (and everyone else) is missing is the fact that the movies do not have to (and in my option, should not) be viewed in the order events take place (parts 1,2,3,4,5,6) in order to best enjoy the story. The public that has grown up with these movies viewed them starting with part 4, and I think in 100 years that this will be the preferred order of viewing these films. By then people will have moved on from movies to some newer form of story telling/viewing and these films will be seen as a historical slice of art in time (from the late 20th century). Most people who view an artists work (such as Lucas's) will want to see it presented in chronological (production) order, and will get more from it that way. You can see an artists progression as their work changes over the years. When it comes down to it, he doesn't need to make the films fit together so people and can watch them in the ""correct order"" because they were made in the correct order already. Anyone who views these movies in the future should start with Star Wars (part 4) and go from there, as we all have.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a prequel and the opening of Last Crusade contains the opener where Indy is a teen. Does anyone suggest that I should pop in Last Crusade first for the opener, then take it out and watch Temple, then watch Raiders and finally pop Last Crusade back in to finish it all off in the ""correct order"". I'm sure someone has done it (as I know people have figured out a way to play the Pulp Fiction DVD in the order events take place), but does that make it the ""right"" way???Play them in the order they were made and know the history of the films and you will enjoy them for what they are. No one should care that may actors change, minor plot points may not be in sync or special effects may be of different quality if they have an appreciation for the process (and history) of the making of these films."	4.0	respect the history...	2004-09-23	9	7	2

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AG4OWT0G254FH	Tom Potter	"After many years of waiting, Star Wars fans are finally getting their wish:  the original trio of Star Wars films is finally coming to the DVD format.  This release showcases the ""Special Edition"" of the films released back in 1997 with updated scenes and special effects, and it's rumored that this new release will feature even more changes and updates to the films.I grew up with these films when they were initially released in the late 70's and early 80's, and I collected many of the toy figures and spaceships which are now quite valuable if the price guides are any true indicator.  I also went to see the ""Special Editions"" on each of their premiere nights back in 1997.  Of the two, I personally prefer the updated versions.  To me, they were vastly more entertaining than the original versions of the film and gave a much better glimpse of life in the fascinating Star Wars universe.  I'm quite interested & curious to see what the new additions are to the films and if the rumors I've read about them are correct.To those hard-core fans who are complaining about the original version of the films not being offered... I'd like to point out that George Lucas himself has stated many, many times over that the update of the films was more in line with the vision he'd always had in his mind, but technology simply hadn't evolved enough to allow him to do his movie the way he wanted.  Whether or not you agree with the changes/updates is immaterial... Lucas is the originator, owner & author of the story, and if he chooses to bring the film more into what he had in his imagination initially when he first made the film, he has the right to do so as *he*, not the *fans*, thought up the concept of the story.  The only thing fans have done that I've observed is increase the film's juggernaut-like commercial and merchandising status.I'll be brutally honest, it's hard-core fans like yourselves that ruin & destroy the otherwise pleasurable experience of viewing and appreciating a cinematic triumph of a movie like ""Star Wars"" for me as you nuts take the story *WAY* too damned seriously.  To quote Bill Shatner's speech on SNL, ""Get a life, move out of your parent's basements and grow the hell up.""  If anything, you people ought to be grateful that there even *is* going to be a commercial DVD release of the films in the first place.If what Lucas has said in the past is any indicator, the initial version of the film will not see the light of day again and I personally agree with his assessment that the initial version is an inferior product as I said previously the updated version gives a much better & interesting glimpse of life and day-to-day activities in that galaxy far, far away.  However if you absolutely have to have the 1977 version, I'm sure there are many laserdisc and VHS versions available to buy at your local second-hand dealers & on other Internet websites."	5.0	One of the greatest cinematic trilogies comes to DVD!	2004-09-18	5	1	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1DKD2KN7PH993	Tony	I'm reviewing this from the standpoint of never having owned these on blu ray.I have as much hate for the majority of the changes made to the classic trilogy as any other fan does but I bought this with the mindset that the bad stuff only takes up a few minutes per film and the worst of the bunch, Ep4's Jabba scene and Jedi's musical number can be skipped. The universally hated &#34;Greedo shoots first&#34; scene has been much improved with both of the blaster shots happening at almost the exact same time. For now, this is as close as we're going to get to the original on blu-ray.The picture quality is outstanding with textures in clothing, details in some of the models and matte paintings really popping out for the first time. One thing that's a bit odd though is the pink aura/tint that many of the explosions have especially when the stormtroopers are boarding the rebels in the beginning of Ep4. Not a real atrocity but just seems a bit too harsh.It would have been cool to have a few docs on these but I guess they're just going to keep those with the complete saga set. The commentary tracks included in this set are pretty cool since they include Alec Guinness and Ralph McQuarrie as well as others that you rarely ever hear from on a commentary track.The set certainly isn't perfect but getting to see the trilogy in unmatched clarity is well worth it if you never bought the complete saga set.	4.0	Worthwhile if you've never owned these in HD	2013-12-04	6	5	1

The situation with the audio has already been discussed to death in these reviews, so I'll leave that one alone; suffice it to say that I have no speakers and I'm listening to this in mono, so I have low audio expectations anyway.As far as the lightsaber issue is concerned: much to my surprise, I found that the WHITE CORES of the sabers do indeed return if you turn your contrast setting all the way up.As our example, let's look at the scene where Luke and Vader's sabers cross in front of Palpatine.  With the contrast in the middle of the range, you can't see lightsaber cores; you see unsightly colored-in sabers with a very strange intersection, making it look like the sabers are in fact passing THROUGH one another.  Now ( without raising the contrast ) pop in the bonus disc and start the ""Empire of Dreams"" feature.  Watch the scenes in the beginning.  There's our lightsaber-cross scene again, except it's the way it's SUPPOSED to look!!!  I mean, I'm glad to be able to get the cores to come back, but shouldn't they be there on the average contrast setting, as with the clip in the documentary?Having the saber cores makes the occasional inappropriate ""edge"" color less noticeable.  However, it's always troubling when film footage used in a DVD feature is of higher quality than that used in the film track itself.  As background for one of the menus on the bonus disc, Van Ling has used the scene where Luke practices with the remote on the Falcon.  Except in the menu background, the saber is the correct BLUE color, while in the corresponding scene on the actual Episode IV disc, it's GREEN.  How did this come about?  My guess is that coloration of the actual film tracks was the responsibility of Lowry Digital Images and was separate from Van Ling's task.  It seems that the saber coloration issue was obvious to Van Ling ( or someone ) and was corrected for the bonus disc DVD menu.  How this correction did not make its way back up the hierarchy so that it was reflected in the released version of Episode IV is beyond me.There are some interesting things to be found on the bonus disc, such as the outtake of Boba Fett shooting at an Ewok on the Death Star ( I wish it had been worked into one of the films even though it's wholly inconsistent ).On the commentary of ROTJ I think it's implied that there will be some digital Wookiees in Episode III.  Also, Lucas mentions that the Emperor's tower on the Death Star II is stylistically connected to the spire of the Jedi Temple, which I hadn't realized."	4.0	Review Version 3.0: COREWARD!	2004-10-04	12	5	7

The brightness is a problem, but that's already been addressed. As have the most of my other issues with the films.In fact, the only reason I'm writing now is to argue that it still makes absolutely no sense for that boy to appear as the spirit of Anakin.All right, so the original man was healed and an old version of himself. If you recall, Vader redeemed himself just before dying, thus making the leap back over to the good side ( and giving a reason for his ghost to exist along side Yoda and Obi-Wan in the first place ), meaning he was no longer a sith at the time of his death. That's only important if you listen to people who say he should be young again because he was only a sith after that point and his spirit wouldn't be a reflection of that.The rest? They say that the actor lost the scars and if he was going to be healed up he should revert completely to the way he was before those wounds struck him. I'm not sure why. Obi-Wan was decapitated just prior to his death and he appears whole at the end of Return of the Jedi.The only reason I have for Anakin appearing that way is because he wished to. I suppose I'd rather look like the young fop than that wrinkled oldie myself.The rest, CG has never made anything prettier to me. Small touches, like CG rendered mobs or armies are endurable, but the unearthly architecture and critters of Star Wars and the like take me away from the film and remind me strongly of Final Fantasy video games. I'd rather we'd kept a more toned down simple look instead of oversaturating everything with ""CG Prettiness"". It doesn't steal my breath, it doesn't inspire awe, it just makes me think about a fellow with a gun/sword hybrid.All and all? I guess it's worth having if only to avoid hooking up the VCR for a little Star Wars goodness. Still, I would have prefered the originals released to DVD at least in some way.And yes, I know it's Lucas' film and his franchise, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and I most certainly have the right to voice my opinions on it or any film in the form of a review."	3.0	Since when does gloating something with CG make it better?	2005-06-06	21	10	11

In about two years from now he'll release the originals with improved sound and picture in its own boxed set.  I love the original trilogy, but I will not be purchasing this at all along with the prequel collection, which is its own travesty.  There is a reason why Lucas keeps pulling stunts like this, its because the very same people who complain about it are the very first ones in line buying it.There is a South park episode that perfectly illustrates what George Lucas has done to Star Wars.

I ended with the other 2 episodes and no luck finding the  widescreen version anywhere, not even for auction! But my thirst will be  taken care soon. The thing I don't get is why not DVD?

One Special Features disc per film would have been preferable, like the EI and EII DVD's. However, between the multiple (awesome) animated menus, audio commentaries, 2.5 hr. documentary, 'Lightsaber' & 'Characters' Featurettes & easter egg Blooper Reel, this is worth the reasonable price tag (around $40 most places). Add to that the brilliant visual quality and completely 100% *new* sound mix and you have a solid debut for Episodes IV-VI, otherwise known as 'The Star Wars Trilogy'.My DVD's had no technical glitches but most huge shipments like this have a few units of duds in them. Just return your set and get a new one - it's worth the trouble.Since 1997, besides remastering the films & their audio, the poorly animated ANH Jabba has been redone *brilliantly*, Boba Fett has been revoiced by the actor who played Jango Fett in EII, and Hayden Christianson now appears as the resurrected Anakin Skywalker for continuity reasons yet unrevealed! The new changes are seamless and help integrate the sprawling 6 film epic.One thing that is truly wonderful - for all the FX fans out there - almost all the matte artifacting (discoloration, green lines, white boxes etc.) are now 99% GONE. You really have to look for them to see them - it's really amazing. They look as seamless as the new films.So: can't wait for the big 6 disc box set. A few Lightsabers still need fixing and the audio mix could use one more pass. Ti'l then: this is a must have. Enjoy!!	4.0	EXCELLENT FIRST DVD RELEASE	2004-09-28	10	0	10

For me, it's like Claude Monet going back to one of his original, innovative, beautiful paintings and adding is some junk that shouldn't be there. Another analogy I like to use is David Gilmour, guitarist from Pink Floyd, going back to ""Wish You Were Here"" and adding in guitar parts that never existed in the original recording.The fact that Lucas would even allow CGI to be inserted into the original films is completely moronic and uncalled for. What he's done is he's thrown all of the hard work the production staff, costume designers, set designers, etc. have done down the toilet. I can't imagine what these people who worked on these films thought of their work after seeing these butchered versions. Lucas should have learned his lesson by now. You don't tamper with the movies that made your name and brought you millions of dollars. It's as simple as that.Lucas, if you have any shred of sympathy in your body, then release the original theatrical versions of these films.

Some are controversial, but after watching the movies a few times the new material is much less jarring.It's ironic that George Lucas, a preservation advocate, chose not to preserve the original Oscar-winning cuts....but perhaps he has a surprise for us in the future?If you're a ""Star Wars"" fan, run out and buy these dvds!"	3.0	BUY IT NOW - HOPE FOR ORIGINALS LATER	2004-09-08	10	6	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2TSI1MUELZSED	tresi	With over 800 reviews posted so far, I feel there is little to be said about the actual content of these movies we know so well.  I do wish to comment on the issue of the special editions.  Yes, the rights are owned by Lucas and he has the legal right to release what he wants, and if he wants to digitally replace mark Hamill with Brad Pitt, or make C-3P0 green, then he has the legal right to do so.  But why affirmatively withhold the original versions that I and millions around the world prefer?  Why try to do everything possible to erase the very existence of the original version (believe you me, if he could go back in time and destroy all the VHS versions of the original trilogy, my bet is he would do so!)  My goodness, he would make billions more releasing the originals on DVD!  Maybe he will do so in the future, but I doubt it.  I just think he cares not a whit for what the original fans, who made him a billionaire in the first place, actually want to see.  I feel there is some sort of neurosis at work here.  Is he ashamed of the original version of Star Wars-- the most popular movie ever made?  What is there to be ashamed of?  Does he hold contempt for his fan base?  Or is it just that he has become a sheltered old man surrounded by yes men, permanently out of touch with the world?  I don't know, but it is puzzling.It won't take much to make things right George.  Heck-- if he would just release the special version without the Greedo shoots first scene, all would be forgiven!  Is that too much to ask?	1.0	Give us that old time religion	2004-08-23	48	41	7
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A24YVJWNLBU314	Trevor Seigler	"In terms of a ""nerd litmus test"", there isn't much more to it than your feelings regarding Star Wars and its sequels. To be fair, the diehards and the haters may see it differently, but to my mind there have always been those who loved the movies but didn't need the spin-off Ewoks films or the novelizations by all sorts of sci-fi hacks. I fall into that category, and apart from the Boba Fett figurine that stands guard over my DVD player there's little else to alert the casual acquaintance to my love of these films (which I've denied on occasion to my more snobby friends).But I had to have the original trilogy on DVD before George Lucas could ruin it by forcing the ""prequel trilogy"" into the package as well, and I'm glad he was persuaded to do so. The films come off better than ever, all ""special edition-y"" but retaining the core of the original films. Like any self-respecting fan, however, I have my gripes, enough to keep this from being a five-star review:First off, there are some technical problems, not so much with the sound (I really couldn't tell) so much as some of the graphics. The most glaring example (and I'm assuming I'm not alone in having this happen) is during the TIE fighter-Falcon battle, when you can almost see boxes around the TIEs when they go around the Millenium Falcon. I'm sorry, but that's distracting as hell and almost laughable considering how much care Lucas puts into his films and his newfangled love for all things digital.Another thing: at the end of Jedi, instead of the original actor Lucas has saw fit to insert Hayden ""I'm Emoting Now"" Christiansan as Anakin Skywalker at the Ewok celebration. Lame, lame, lame, and it doesn't even fit right. Excuse me while I push my glasses back up, they seem to have slid down my nose...Other than those minor grumblings, I have to say the DVD edition delivers remarkably well on the promise all SW fans were made. The graphics look better, the images are crisper and you really can't tell which is digital and which is models for the most part. My other grumbles (such as Greedo ""shooting first"" in Episode Five and the lame musical addition to Jedi's ending) are more to do with the Special Edition itself, not the DVDs. The fourth disc delivers with some excellent featurettes, and the look ahead to Episode Three has no doubt ignited endless discussions on various fan message boards. All in all, this is a fairly good set.So pick this one up if you're the only person left in America who hasn't. You might find the same techinal problems I did, but it's negligable compared to the way the movies come across on DVD. The Force may not be with the prequels, but this original set will make any fan's Christmas."	4.0	Some technical problems don't distract too much	2004-12-18	4	2	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching these DVDs is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining ""See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?""Although commonly blamed for the death of cinema as we knew it, in truth Star Wars was a huge breath of fresh air after the increasingly stale and formulaic week-in, week-out reality of woefully unimaginative and derivative downbeat on-the-cheap 70s cinema. It wasn't merely a matter of having a happy ending, more that there was a sense of panache and unapologetic adventure that had been missing for too long at the time (even the decade's best adventures, such as The Wind and the Lion and The Man Who Would Be King, saw their heroes destroyed by society in an age that had no place for them). Looking at it for the first time in years, its much better directed than remembered, extremely well constructed and beautifully designed, introducing the `future is old' concept that many would attribute to Ridley Scott. It also, unlike the prequels, has the saving grace of Han Solo, a character whose deprecating sense of humor undercuts the more solemn and potentially pretentious moments in a way that would be much missed amid the talk of apprentices, trade embargoes and midi-chloridians in the prequels. It's still fun and it still works, even in the very worst transfer of the originals.The Empire Strikes Back suffered the least in the special edition reworkings (although the clunky rewriting of the scene with the Emperor shows Lucas' leaden touch with dialog only too clearly) and as a transfer suffers the least of the original versions, but it's still not good enough. The film itself holds up surprisingly well, fully deserving its reputation as the best (and naturally least commercially successful) of the series. A lot of the credit has to go to co-writer Leigh Brackett, with the film's verbal sparring having a classic Hollywood feel to it that gives it a mixture of the best of both worlds, while keeping things moving at a brisk pace. Irvin Kershner's direction brings the best out of the cast too, while the action scenes - particularly the battle on the ice - are the best in the series. It's just a shame that the film's (genuinely unexpected at the time) cliffhanger was thrown away in the follow-up.Return of the Jedi isn't as bad as the scarred memories of working at a movie theatre showing it five times a day for 12 weeks would have it, but it's still the least of the series. With no producer or studio to rein him in this time, Lucas offers something that's little more than a rehash of the first two films, but with bigger Death Stars, more spaceships, more teddy bears and far, far too many Muppets, it's crippled by an atrocious opening section where one after another the heroes try to rescue Han Solo only to get captured in the most tedious ways possible. Richard Marquand's inability to direct action is much to the fore in this section, and he's not much better in the rest of the film, while Harrison Ford gives a particularly bad performance that's all too indicative of a bored man with nothing to do but stuck here anyway because of contractual obligation. If you can forget the dire first third, the rest of the film is okay when it's dealing with the Skywalkers' family feuds but less successful on the ground in the Teddy Bears Picnic - sorry, Ewok scenes. Still, it does have Princess Leia in the slavegirl outfit...The discs also include the revised special editions released a couple of years ago, which at least boast excellent picture and sound quality, though are all extras-lite with only a commentary and a Star Wars Lego promo."	3.0	Every expense spared	2007-01-26	13	9	4

It was not called A New Hope and I think I remember a scene in which Luke and his friend Biggs have a conversation on the planet Yavan just before the end battle sequence.  I think that scene was removed before the re release and the vhs release because it would contradict that Vader was Luke's father.  It has been 30+ years, but I wonder if anybody else remembers it.  I know that Lucasfilms has released the vhs versions a few times with different trimmings.  I do beleave as many have stated that this is a marketing ploy to sell sell sell and that the originals will ultimatly be released someday.

One cannot ""review"" films one has not seen, so any negative reviews of the new versions are pre-mature at this point. I intend to revise this review once the new DVDs are released to give my opinion on the set at that time.... however....The man who gave us the incredible works we know as ""Star Wars"" is the creator. He alone may revise, restructure, redefine his works as he wishes. He is a highly intelligent and imaginative man who would not ""molest"" or ""destroy"" works he so lovingly created for generations to come. He is seeking to improve the quality of the visuals for generations coming forth after we are long gone. The original Star Wars was ment to be part of a saga..... and the first episode (actually now the 4th) was made 27 years ago. In order for the saga to now come full circle, he almost had to seem the 6 films together. Next years release is episode 3.... and it needs to tie into episode 4 as seemlessly as possible. He is doing that in subtile ways with this new edition.Secondly, I own this trilogy on VHS and there are obvious gray frames around the spacecraft, grainy cover-ups under the landspeeder, and other flaws that they did not know how to correct in 1977. Today, film makers can digitally clean up the flaws and even add difficult scenes that could not have been made 10 or 20 years ago that were originally intended. I agree that studio bosses and producers should not be allowed to mangle films considered classics.... but this is a director and the man who gave us STAR WARS in the first place. If it were not for him, we would never have these films at all.Perhaps some are upset these films may be altered so that they do not ""conform"" to THEIR idea of what Star Wars should be. Trouble is, I have not met too many fans of these films that agree on their ""hidden meanings"" and metaphors.""Not proper to change these classics?"" Give me a break. In classical music, many famous composers changed, reorchestrated, updated and provided new transcriptions for their works. Bach, Bruckner, Debussy, Ravel, Telemann, Handel and many others altered their own works and new ""versions"" were published. In the case of Bach, his ""harpsichord concertos"" are performed on piano now... the piano did not exsist in Bachs time... they are still masterpieces.Let's see the films and then see how they work for us. My gut feeling is that I am going to love them..... as I am going to love ""THX 1138"" coming on September 14. As long as it is LUCAS giving me his revision, I am fully trusting these films I have loved for so long are going to look even better."	5.0	Classical Films, Classic New Versions	2004-08-10	23	7	16

And NO WHERE on the box does it say this.  I read every area on Amazon over and over and over, never seeing anything about a special edition or updates or anything.  They just kept saying original trilogy blah blah.When I got the box, I read every word on the box three times before opening the plastic to make sure.  Still nothing about special editions.  Open it, and ah, you motherfu...They're special editions.  They're slightly better (Han and Gredo shoot at the same time.  Still stupid, but better than it was I guess. And I think they took out the stupidly added Luke scream when he purposefully jumps off to be caught by the Falcon.)  I would have held out longer if the package had said ANYTHING about this.So the movies look good and stuff, but my low score is because it was impossible to find out how much these were altered. I should've known the internet would have shat itself the moment untouched versions were released on Blu-Ray, so I guess it's partially my fault.I'm just going to stick to watching my old DVD box set that came with untouched originals. If I feel like watching the trilogy and not know what they were able to pull off in the 70's versus in the 2000's, I'll pop this in.

They lost color and some footage but they got lucky when they found a good copy of the film. They use digital technology to restore the damaged scenes and colors. Talk about almost loosing a classic we all love. They did a great job at fixing up the films for DVDs. The new problem now is that BluRay players can show the fixes they made. Looks like a new restoration is needed now to fix it farther. I have episodes IV - VI when they were 1st done and I like them that way on VHS. Sad to say but the quality is dying on them that may me buy the DVD version. I have no problem with the new footage and quality I have now to VHS.Now to the technology of the films. Digital technology has been develop tenfolds thanks to Lucas and Spielberg. They created Industrial Light and Magic that everyone uses in Hollywood today for their films. With the development of 3D their are plans of film rereleases in the theaters from Lucas, Spielberg, Cameron and Jackson. To see the next evolution of the Star Wars films it will most likely be in 3D and made for 3D HDTVs.

I was too young to actually go and see Star Wars in theaters the first time around, however I still grew up surrounded by The Star Wars phenomenon. I loved the original three movies the way they were but when Lucas redid these movies it gave me a chance to see them on the bigscreen and with the added bonus of extra scenes that are visually stunning. It isn't like they removed half the movie. In this day and age people want to see movies with extra's, hints DVDs. The extra scenes let us dig a little farther into the storyline meshing the three movies together a little more as well as meshing them with Episodes 1-3. If you don't like the added scenes then go get a drink or use the restroom while they are playing. I myself love these movies with the added scenes. I like to know as much about the storyline and the backgrounds of characters as I can. Why do you think they make so many special editions or directors cuts. If you are too immature to get past the extras and enjoy the movies we grew up with, than maybe you should search for beta versions of this Trilogy or stick with your VCR.	5.0	Give me a break	2004-08-04	15	4	11

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AW7M4T2G9HEQ	Turin Turambar	I'm bored with these people who are saying that they want the original trilogy. Your complaining is no sense. The story is the same and the modifications are normally for the better. I also saw the originals, I also fall in love with them. I liked them when I was a child and I like them now when I am a College professor. There is fun in Star Wars, but there are also some important messages for our time. But I'm not writing this to talk about that, but to tell everyone that those who are claiming that this DVD is an adulteration of Star Wars are wrong. The story is the same and the modifications are, as I already said, normally for the better. First let me tell you about the changes I did not like. I did not like the new Solo-Greedo episode and the two new songs in ROTJ (the one in Jabba the Hutt chambers and the one with the ewooks at the end). But the other changes are great. There is really someone who thinks that it is better to see that strange emperor with the freaky eye in Empire which has nothing to do with the Return of the Jedi character. I was disappointed when the special editions came out, because they didn't change that, and now I am glad they did it; this change makes Star Wars a better story, a more coherent one. Isn't it great to see more of mos-eisly when Luke and Obi-Wan enter the town? Isn't it better to have a look at the snow monster that attacks Luke? Isn't it for the better to have more realistic matte paintings in Bespin? Isn't it better to have some new fighting shots when the rebels attack the first Death Star, which gave the sequence more agility and excitement. I could go on and on, but I won't. Star Wars is just the same, the same epic, the same story. All characters do the same things because all the changes are just minor ones, decoratives ones if you wish, and they are normally for the better. Those who still complaint are just irrational people who are engaged in a stupid criticism of George Lucas. They just decided with no reason to hate George Lucas but to love the young version of him, to hate everything he does now and to praise what he did 25 years ago. Let stop this no sense about new editions; new editions are common practice. Nobody complaints when an author publish a second edition of his book, where he makes corrections and additions. Nobody is complaining that the subsecuent editions of Lord of the Rings corrected the errors and misspellings of the first one. No one criticises a scientist who publish a second version of an earlier work, in which he tries to improve his discoveries. Well I leave it at that. If you don't like Star Wars that is fine with me, but don't come saying that you liked the originals but not the new editions, that is plain no sense, contradictory babbling, because Star Wars has not changed, it is the same movie we saw as children and fall in love with but with some improvements.Let me say just something about the DVD set. It is great, the movies look awesome and the documentaries are fine. The only thing I regret is that they didn't gave us more documentaries material. The ones that are in the dvd are good, but they could make more: how about a documentary about the special effects and other about the construction of Skywalker Ranch and its facilities. They could put more commentaries, the same way the Lord of the Rings extended editions do: one with the actors, with the directors, etc. It would have been great to hear Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Anyway, understand what I am saying, the bonus material are ok (I specially enjoyed seeing the first Star Wars trailer) but because I love so much these movies I would like to have more.	5.0	It is Star Wars	2004-11-18	0	0	0

Anybody that makes films knows the film is never finished. It's abandoned or it's ripped out of your hands, and it's thrown into the marketplace, never finished. It's a very rare experience where you find a filmmaker who says, ""That's exactly what I wanted. I got everything I needed. I made it just perfect. I'm going to put it out there."" And even most artists, most painters, even composers would want to come back and redo their work now. They've got a new perspective on it, they've got more resources, they have better technology, and they can fix or finish the things that were never done. ... I wanted to actually finish the film the way it was meant to be when I was originally doing it. At the beginning, people went, ""Don't you like it?"" I said, ""Well, the film only came out to be 25 or 30 percent of what I wanted it to be."" They said, ""What are you talking about?"" So finally, I stopped saying that, but if you read any interviews for about an eight- or nine-year period there, it was all about how disappointed I was and how unhappy I was and what a dismal experience it was. You know, it's too bad you need to get kind of half a job done and never get to finish it. So this was my chance to finish it.AP: Why not release both the originals and special editions on DVD?Lucas: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be. I'm the one who has to take responsibility for it. I'm the one who has to have everybody throw rocks at me all the time, so at least if they're going to throw rocks at me, they're going to throw rocks at me for something I love rather than something I think is not very good, or at least something I think is not finished.I think that just about sums it up."	5.0	Star Wars as it was intended	2004-09-16	24	15	9

Unfortunately, you will not get the special edition versions (that version has probably been incinerated) that were Lucas' first attempt at editing his magnum opus. Also, the original versions of the film have not been cleared up in any way. I don't mind that so much because I actually like watching a movie that has a movie feel to it (audiences today have been ruined by expecting perfection and have absolutely no taste for atmosphere).  The real problem with this set is that there is no new material here. It was all released just two years ago. This DVD set is just another attempt by Lucasfilm to cash in. They are one company that is excellent at getting people to buy the exact same thing of something they already have.The only reason to buy this DVD set is if you don't own the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD. Otherwise, keep your cash and stop giving it to George until he offers something worthwhile.	2.0	Another Re-hash From the Flim-Flam Man Named George Lucas	2008-11-19	14	9	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3POUK5BO810DD	T. Wu	"If this trilogy were only to be judged on the original breakthroughs it made in science fiction film, especially space film, and its appeal to children, it would be a solid, yet only average trilogy.What allows Star Wars to rise a bit ahead of the pack is the multidimensional and believable human story that underlies the grand saga. Luke's story is a touching coming of age tale, and despite the many differences between his world and ours we identify with his desire for adventure, his youthful awe of ancient wisdom, and his struggle to expand his spiritual self. Unlike many science fiction worlds this one struggles with a theme familiar to ourselves: the survival of religion and faith in a world of science. In a way it is also a period piece of contemporary America, if one sees the Soviet Union as the ""evil empire"". Finally, the relevations and unfolding of the plot are truly shocking and will keep this trilogy alive in the popular consciousness for decades to come. The only flaw comes in the final installment, Return of the Jedi, which foreshadows some of Hollywood's later reliance on overwhelming battle scenes as a replacement for storytelling magic.Overall though, still a solid legacy and to this day it's a bit underrated."	4.0	Science fiction is only half the appeal	2005-11-21	3	1	2

Beyond Greedo shooting first. Beyond crappy CG Jabba. Beyond abysmal ROTJ Musical number. Beyond three mediocre-to-awful prequels. Beyond insertion of Hayden Christiansen. Beyond the solar-ring Death Star explosions.You added crap that looks and sounds like a 6 year old's youtube fan edit, George.To quote an old friend of yours, ""George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can't say it."" Harrison Ford was referring to your script, but the same definitely goes for your newest additions.I wish you liked the original films as much as I do... or did, anyway. They didn't need this kind of facelift. People love them for the stories, the characters, the action, the comedy. Han Solo the badass, Luke the noble Knight. Lando the token character, but still COOLEST man in the galaxy. The powerful, emotionally charged lightsaber battles. The space wars. THIS IS WHAT WE LOVE, AND WE LOVED IT SINCE THE BEGINNING.But you obviously hate the originals. Why else would you inject these juvenile changes? We were already disheartened by the ""enhancements"" in 1997, then in 2004 for the DVDs. Now, you've lost me as a fan.I wouldn't have minded the deleted scenes, and will probably watch them and them alone at some point. But you did a disservice not just to fans, but to the films that made you who you are. Most people would have respected that.I will not buy this set, and have cancelled my preorder.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1977K5HJLKUYI	Tych Sel	The Star Wars Trilogy.  No movie series, with the exception perhaps of the James Bond movies, can even compare with Star Wars when it comes to popularity.  And Lucas tells a superb story, following the model of the heroic quest, and using many long-overlooked literary techniques. The charcters have personality, even those who never speak a single word.  The three heroes of the trilogy all fill in each others weak points, making the group stronger as a whole.  And Star Wars is so much a part of popular society that anyone who hasn't seen the films might be missing a lot.  If you haven't seen them, or don't own them, at the very least, see this set.  Or better yet, buy it now, while we fans wait for the Flanneled one to release the Trilogy on DVD.	5.0	Simply the best of the best	2001-10-13	0	0	0

Well, that happiness quickly faded when I learned of something... umm... bad.Biggest downside, as everyone mentioned, is the exclusion of the original versions of each movie. I mean, come on! How hard is it to include the original versions? Steven Spielberg was able to include the original E.T. movie with his special edition of that movie. Terminator 2 had THREE different versions! Even Disney's Beauty and the Beast was able to have THREE different versions! Mr. Lucas' response? ""It will cost millions of dollars to do"" or something like that. Pfft! He could've gotten every penny back plus a helluva lot more had he included the original versions. Now I will never get to experience what audiences felt when the movies first came out.But now we have these ""more special editions"" as I call it. We now see the ""Hayden Christensen"" Anakin form at the end of ""Jedi."" I just wonder how Luke would recognize him as his father? Luke had never seen his father before. The only time he saw his face was when he removed the mask, which was the older Anakin. Now alluva sudden the young, snobby, and selfish Anakin version comes out and Luke recognizes him right away as if to say, ""Hey, there's my dad... younger looking, I guess..."" A totally unecessary ""addition"" to an already botched up version of ""Return of the Jedi.""And some of the added/edited scenes have been altered much more to look better, I guess. The only addition I've only accepted was the Wampa monster scenes. The rest just distract and bug me. *sigh*... who knows? But this is what George claims he's always wanted done. He b!tched and moaned about how ""incomplete"" his movies were, now they're ""complete."" He's happy, but millions of Star Wars fans aren't. But am I happy?Despite my rants, watching these movies on DVD was a truly amazing experience. Crystal-clear and sharp images (though it does reveal some ""limitations"" of parts of each flicks) and of course, the sound is truly amazing. I haven't watched the extra disc yet (I hear it contains spoilers for Episode III, so I'll skip it for now), but I'm happy with what I've got here. Sure, a lot of George's enhancements bug me, but there are few that were actually good.""Star Wars"" (aka A New Hope) is still fantastic. The one that started it all. While watching this on DVD, the very beginning of the opening credits and John Williams' score just gave me goosebumps. Even though I knew these are the ""more special editions"" I was still in awe while viewing this movie.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is easily the best out of the trilogy. A darker storyline and ending sends chills through my body. The battle at Hoth was yet another kickass sequence. And this is when Darth Vader gets his theme (bum-bum-bum-bum-ba-dum, bum-ba-dum...) and it has never sounded better.""Return of the Jedi"" is the most botched up of the trilogy which really ruins the experience of the movie. But the epic battle sequence at the new Death Star blows every other battle in the trilogy away. Cute lil' Ewoks running around as well, and, maybe it's just me, but I wasn't really bothered by them as were just about every other Star Wars fan. Actually, the Ewoks never bothered me. Oh well, ""Jedi"" is still cool.Better developed reviews of each movie will come up soon...Anywho, are the DVDs worth it? Well, I don't see George releasing the originals on DVD at all since in an interview he said he won't do that. So, if you're truly hard-up for the orignals, skip this. It'll only make you angrier. But, in my case, I was moderately pleased with this collection.

I did the unthinkable today, having watched the DVD release of the trilogy ... I PUT IT BACK IN ITS BOX AND INTO THE STORE ROOM... I do not wish to acknowledge the fact that it was ever made or existed, for me the special edition release of the trilogy is the accepted pure unadulterated, uncontaminated ""TRUE"" version.Today George Lucas has become the very corporate entity he once hated, meddling with his own films, cutting splicing adding and deleting unnecessarily in very much the same manner as the studio executives did with his earlier films.For a product that has been in development this long, even a newcomer to the DVD edition of the trilogy will pick up on huge editing and post production faults, take for example episode 4 ""A new hope"", notice how the film skips frames at certain points, or the lack of color correction and the green bounding boxes around the Tie Fighters in the fight sequence when the Falcon is escaping the death star, The escape pod lying on the desert in the first scene where the chroma key blue color has not been removed, or the fact that there is a scene in which Vader finishes his sentence early and then continues to move his hands about mouthing something to governor Tarkin when the sound track is silent, or maybe the annoying yellow smudges of color whenever the light sabers clash.Disastrously poor production quality control aside, classical elements which all star wars fans have always loved have been heavy handedly altered without any reason, remember that beautiful music score as the attack on the death star begins, which is the high point holding the entire sequence together ... anchoring the emotions the rebels are going through .... ITS ALL GONE ... muted so low that you can barely hear it, instead all you get is all the sound effects of laser bangs and whirls ... perhaps it is to do with politics between the two departments or whatever.George Lucas once said that the only thing exceeding his expectations on the original production was that of the musical score ... today he has succeeded in diluting even that.If he ever reads this I would like to say to him, Star Wars belongs as much to you as it does to the millions of fans who loved it and made the phenomenon it is today, you have taken a pure undiluted work of art and corrupted it to the point where, it people like me walk away feeling that we have been cheated. Please for the films sake realize that people loved and accepted it the day you released each of the films, you have created your masterpiece now just let it go ... step back and let us enjoy it the way it is, not the way your creative department thinks it ought to be."	2.0	A huge disappointment for true Star Wars Fans	2004-11-03	29	26	3

As for ""The Empire Strikes Back"", it revealed a truth unimaginable at the time.  That scene between Vader and Luke set up ""Revenge of the Sith"" to be a great movie.

I watched Star Wars twenty or more times before I lost count in less than a month as a child. I drove my siblings mad, and to this day I can verbalize every droid beep and Jawa noise. Shown any portion of the movie I can word every line and mimic every piece of music if given enough to drinkCurrently I find the films difficult to watch, including the original cuts and this is largely because Lucas has beat these classics into the ground and then some, quite literally out of existence. That is very sadAfter a certain period of time surely every piece of artistic work becomes public property. Isn't this copyright law? When is this going to happen with Star Wars? Apparently the answer is 95 years after publication. So we'll have to wait until 2072 unless Lucas lets go. Only the Empire could be so meanSeriously, why does Lucas not simply look right here on Amazon or Google. Just a few days after release over 2000 people are protesting with negative reviews for these blu-ray discs.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A24CY2G8W4IFRN	V. Anderson	First of all, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, but watching the re-released  trilogy left me feeling sick to my stomach. It is my firm belief that  George Lucas has become completely senile! And I'm not referring to that  complete debacle known as the Phantom Menace. He has ruined the original  three too! First of all, there is no redeemable features from the new  versions. The new scenes look completely out of place with the antiquated  effects of the original versions. Sure, some of the old effects were  cheesy, like Luke's speeder, but at least the gave the movie  continuity...seeing old and new affects insults me. One of my favorite  parts of the first one was the scene with Greedo and Han...they ruined it.  Then they insert this ridiculous scene with Jaba into the first one. Jaba  looks entirely two-dimensional, especially, if you look closely, Jaba's  entire mass fits between Han's arm and the front of his torso. I agree to  that the scene with Luke and his old buddy was completely out of place too  and only hurts the film. A major problem I also have with all three  &quot;enhanced&quot; versions is the lasers and lightsabers...they look  like Mike'n'Ike candies...they're more neon and brighter now, but still  look like they just colored over the original film. The old lasers weren't  great, but they didn't look like someone colored over them with a magic  marker. If they wanted to improve the original, they should have fixed  MISTAKES, like when you can tell Obi-Wan's lightsaber is just a wire and it  sizzles. Next is the ESB. This was probably the least offensive of the SE  versions. A new scene with the snow monster..and some scenes from the Cloud  City that again seem completely out of place and disrupt the continuity of  the movie. Then we come to the Return of the Jedi, which made me furious.  This enhanced version is completely worthless. They add this really, REALLY  lame digitized scene to the part where the band is playing in Jaba's throne  room. The creatures all look ridiculous and very poorly done, especially  the furry creature they added...which basically just embarrassed me. It  looks like a cross between a cartoon and fraggle rock, and that in a room  next to darkness and guys like Bobafet....need I say more? I will! The  worse part of this, is I actually liked the old song by Jaba's band...this  one is terrible. Then there is a new scene with the Sarlacc Pit  Monster...where they actually made it so a head would come out of the pit.  Totally ruined the seen. Monster looks sooo cheesy and ruins the mystery of  &quot;what is this thing?&quot;...all it is is this thing that looks like a  cross between a worm from &quot;Tremors&quot; and the venus flytrap from  that movie with Rick Moranis. Everything is ok from here until the very  ending, which they have completely changed. Gone is the scenes with the  ewoks and now is scenes from Coruscant and the Cloud City of people  dancing, which, again, are completely out of place. And the worse part? The  song!!! The old one was kind of catchy and uplifting. Now it's just some  stupid anthem with a flute that sounds worthy of Celine Dion. My final word  on the SE Trilogy: Don't buy it! Go to a garage sale and buy the originals.  Rent them, copy them, tape them off of USA if you have to.	1.0	Nauseating	2000-08-15	12	9	3

Imagine a new and improved Casablanca!2)Bulky, ugly box set. With all the bulk, I expected lots of DVDs. Not so, there's more plastic and cardboard than DVDs.3)Much of the extra footage has been aired before. But there are some new things.Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan. But, honestly, I think this set is too expensive for what you get. After waiting so long for the box set, I was disappointed with it.	3.0	Kind of disappointing...	2004-12-07	17	12	5

Where's the love for your craft?With the additional, ADDITIONAL changes to this latest release of Star Wars on Blu-Ray, it's become evident that Lucas has lost his way and is no longer in love with film, or story, or really knows how to create anymore.A quick review of the the changes to the original trilogy: An audio change to the original krayt dragon call made by obi-wan to scare away the tusken raiders (ep iv); jabba's door is...bigger (ep vi); a new cgi creature with hemorrhoids (seemingly) is added in Jabba's Palace (ep vi); Vader says ""NNNOoooooooooo!"" when tossing the emperor down the shaft (ep vi); Oh and let's not forget the ewoks now blink...wow.Now, that ewok change...no big deal, that's fine. But the other changes, plus the first few changes made since the Special Editions/Prequels came out, have shown me that Lucas lives in a cold, cruel world of his own making. Imagine, back in 1977, a true artist surrounded by peers and friends who constantly gave him feedback, structured notes, important insights, and original ideas to fuel his creative process? And he, in turn, giving BACK to them by listening, learning, and allowing a wonderful story to emerge that people all over the world fell in love with?That artist was George, but no longer.

I think I speak for a large consumer population when I say that we are not disappointed with the new editions.  We are only disappointed that the original release is not available as well.  I don't mind the butchered version of the film so long as it isn't released at the expense of the original, which it has been.  This has nothing to do with Star Wars fanatics or spineless reviews defending Lucas.  It has to do with the simple fact that I and those out there like myself cannot take our VHS copies and stick them into our DVD player and watch the classic films on our DLP screens.  We've been robbed of our original purchase by Time.  Well, it's our own faults for purchasing these releases.  They are well aware that if they release the original version on DVD that they will not collect the market for these pathetic revised editions.  They will give the people what they want.  Tell them what you want and accept no less.  I am not about to put another Ferrari in someone's garage that they haven't earned.  Don't buy this copy.  It's not worth it.  It's not Star Wars.

I guess I should have checked out some websites or reviews of this DVD set before I bought it, but unfortunately I failed to do so.I was so excited to see that finally, the Star Wars Original Trilogy (as they call it) was on DVD for everyone to enjoy.  But when I bought the DVD and brought it home to my family, we were horrified to find that these were not the wonderful movies we remembered at all, but the awful 1997 Special Edition versions with even more awfulness added in.Needless to say I returned the set immediately and got a full refund.  Calling these mockeries of Star Wars the ORIGINALS is an outright lie and total false advertising.  Who does Lucas think he's fooling here?  He may have tricked me into buying these DVD's once from the cover's false facades, but everyone, even I, know this is not the original trilogy.	1.0	Original Trilogy? Lies! Lies!

Visually, it's absolutly stunning and I don't know what people are complaining about, George Lucas simply re-edited the trilogy so it can appeal to audiences for years to come so that it is up there with Episode I, II, and III in the visual effects category. I didn't think the changes were too extreme but was thoroughly pleased not only with how this DVD really cleaned up the picture but the sound quality which is superb. I personally liked the new Ewok song better as I think it really fit into the whole mood of the scene. The Star Wars movies have done something that not many  movies have done before; it has the perfect blend of scifi action, drama, romance, and humour and George has outdone himself again with the release of a truly great DVD set to the greatest movie trilogy of all time.	5.0	A Visual Masterpeice	2005-06-10	11	9	2

I am not a big fan of CGI myself.  If you look into older movies pre-CGI they came up with many interesting solutions to making the special effects work.  Now, they just insert computer generated objects.  To those who think that George Lucas has the right to change his work since it is his are gravely mistaken.  Once he released Star Wars, it became a masterpiece, an icon in Sci-Fi and thus belongs to the fans in its unaltered work.  Just imagine if Leonardo da Vinci repainted the Mona Lisa because he felt that after all these centuries he could do better?  No, it is a piece of art for its flaws and its perfection.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A34JVYH4NVZO50	Waterbury	Blu Ray discs can hold AT LEAST 50GB when using double layer, and more when using more layers. Both the original trilogy AND the special edition of a single movie could EASILY fit on the same disc. Given that original trilogy Blu Ray box set will come with 3 discs, I assume that each disc will hold a single movie. As I said, storage space IS NOT a problem.George has previously stated his resistance behind not wanting to remaster the original trilogy in higher quality versions is that it would cost money. Money in which he does not want to spend to remaster something HE feels is no longer worth of his time, his original UNALTERED films.To that, I say he needs to get over it. His arrogance is astounding. This will be the FORTH format of media that the movies will be released on. He has numerous fans that have repurchased the same movies numerous times, not to mention the ticket sales made from the original releases, and theatrical releases. There are many fans that have literally paid hundreds of dollars per film in the course of their lives.In closing I say this, George is filthy rich, and could afford to remaster the original versions if he wasn't such a douche. Even if he doesn't, it isn't hard to slap the originals on the disc with minimal up-scaling, but he doesn't want to. If each disc has both versions, it's not as though a fan could cut the disc in half and cause Lucas to lose a sale. It still would be ONE trilogy per every ONE buyer. This is about greed, pure and simple. Greed off the backs of people who already paid hundreds of dollars to see the same thing multiple times. He KNOWS he will eventually re-master the unaltered versions in HD in the future, and is using it as an excuse to RE-RELEASE the re-releases yet AGAIN.

Most of us assume that the rich and famous don't have access to ""our world"" and instead shut themselves away in their ivory towers with ""special stuff"". But how hard is it to log onto amazon and search for a product?You are here reading it - how easy was that?So maybe he does read stuff, even if just out of mild curiosity.In which case, the general vibe I am getting reading all this is one of betrayal. People seem to feel deprived or cheated of the one thing (the only thing in this instance) they desire. To underline this, I am of course talking about an HD version of the original theatrical releases of ANH, ESB and (because it would be churlish to ignore it) ROTJ. Uncut, Unimproved, and completely Unforgettable.This leads me nicely to my second point. The reason we all feel so impassioned about this subject is because it is part of us (even those of you that have ""moved on"" and don't care anymore). Trust me, I know exactly what you mean and how you feel, but if you are really honest, isn't some tiny, insignificant, brilliant and beautiful part of you, still that little boy or girl who was first captured by this amazing soap opera set in space.It is worth reminding ourselves at this juncture, that this particular opera was conjured up in the genial mind of George Lucas and no matter what else is said or done, I for one will always be grateful for what he gave us. He doesn't ""owe us"" anything. We however, will forever be in his debt.The more discerning among us figured out a long time ago (indeed in a galaxy far far away) that this ""debt"" did not include buying every lame reinvented, repackaged ""special edition"" that hit the stores. No, we decided to wait... in the hope that one day our wish would be answered. I sense we are large in number...I have deliberately avoided until now mention of TPM, AOTC, & ROTS because (as most fans of the originals will concur) they were... somewhat disappointing. To many they have ""spoilt"" the entire universe that we so lovingly clung to all those years while in real life we actually just grew up. I came to realise that these films were not really aimed at us (mostly 30 somethings) and were in fact aimed at a whole different generation. Shrewd move perhaps. I certainly know many kids that thought the prequels were pretty cool. Maybe this was the intended target audience. The ones that are gonna buy the action figures today!Mr Lucas, If these films are released, they can be safely messed with to your hearts content. It is unlikely to win over any original fans but the kids will probably love it!This brings me to my last point (thanks for hanging in with me!)The target audience for the original films was undeniably us (albeit us when we were much younger). We may all be kidding ourselves that this innocence will ever be recaptured, but we have the absolute right to dream that it might. One thing is for sure - tampered versions do not rekindle youth. At best they are jarring and I personally find them oddly offensive.I firmly believe that IF (and that's a big IF) the films are released in their original guise, they will become the biggest selling Blu Ray discs in history.

"This isn't the original theatrical versions, but the later, computer enhanced ""special editions."" That makes me just a little sad; One of the great things about those original editions was finding how many bloopers you could spot. Who could forget Luke Skywalker landing his X-Wing after blowing up the Death Star and shouting ""CARRIE"" (not LEIA) at the top of his lungs?! The special editions got rid of all that great, human, trivia.Still, I've purchased this trilogy as a gift for my daughter and a trip down nostalgia lane for me.When the movie first came out I really didn't pay much attention to it. It's probably hard for younger audiences to believe, but ""Star Wars"" was originally a largely underground hit. The studio didn't mount any massive ad campaign for it and it's popularity grew mostly through word of mouth. As the film was literally entering it's last week of release, a friend took me to the Central City Mall (now defunct) in San Bernardino to see it.Like most others, I was stunned by the opening graphics. The pan from the surface of Tatooine to the small diplomatic ship to the huge Star Destroyer in blazing pursuit was inspired and effectively changed science fiction films forever.It would be years before I saw the original Star Wars again. (Remember, this was before you could see any movie and be sure that it would be released on VHS or DVD in less than six months.) So, Star Wars fans had to wait for years (well, at least two - my memory fails me) for ""The Empire Strikes Back."" To me, this was (and is) the best of all the Star Wars films. I saw this one at least a dozen times.The mini-adventure that launches ""Empire"" (Luke attacked by the Wampa and using the force to kill it; Han venturing out in the face of certain death to rescue his friend, and so on) became a Spielberg trademark, but Lucas did it here, first.  These introductory vignettes have since gone on to become a staple of the action-adventure genre, showcased at their best in the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy.The sudden - and unexpected - sexual tension in the triangle of Luke, Leia, and Han made this movie instantly provocative and riveted my teenaged attention. In the original Star Wars, the suggestion was that Luke and Leia were an ""item."" Putting Han into the mix was an inspired twist. Of course, the revelation that Darth was Luke's father (and Leia's brother) made this an instant soap-opera hit.Those were happy days, idyllic in hindsight, when all you had to worry about was how long you had to stand in line and whether or not you could get the perfect seats - center aisle, a few rows back - and revel in the newly released THX sound, following the plot so closely that you could (literally) quote the dialog along with the film!I still have my VHS copy of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and I drag them out from time to time, just to remember days gone by.  Just for the record, I still feel that ""Return of the Jedi"" was the weakest of the three - it felt like George was tired of the series and just wanted to tie up all the loose ends.When I finally get the DVD's, er, that is, borrow them from my daughter, it's going to feel a little strange to be sitting in my den with a 50 inch HDTV listening to THX grade home-theaterBut I believe a little of that earlier magic will still come through."	4.0	"Not Your Father's ""Star Wars"""	2006-09-14	6	5	1
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A963IA9VZU91C	Wayne E. Facer	I will say that Star Wars DVD was worth the wait but I cannot say that honestly.The music on the DVD is outstanding and can never be matched.  This helps if you still have the old VHS version and never bothered to get a special edition.However unlike the special edition VHS cassettes, the DVD version atleast to me are very dark.  I had to put on my brightness just to accomodate this movie.  This never was like this with the VHS version.I think Lucas screwed this over big time.  He should have not made major changes and just used the Special Editions as they were.  I don't approve of making more changes espeically adding in characters or settings from the first three prequels.  I don't like that at all.He should have taken his time to get the DVD edition out.  Now I feel like  I wasted my money for this.	3.0	Good sound, lousy picture	2004-09-25	8	3	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"It appears messing with a classic has created mixed feelings among fans even if the guy that did it made these films. The ""Star Wars Trilogy"" has been accused of being recycled garbage and the reason that movies have been dumbed down ""events"". It's also been applauded for bringing fun back to movies even as it tackles some themes common to more serious films. Naw. They're both wrong. The ""Star Wars Trilogy"" is just plain fun. Lucas attempted to recapture the wonder and excitement of cliffhangers all the while dealing with some heavy duty stuff he read in Joseph Campbell's books on mythology and heroes.I don't believe I have to recap the story here. Let's move on to how the discs look and sound. The big question outside of the quality of the DVDs is has it been changed yet again? Yep. The optical effects have been spiffed up one more time making the film look even better than before. It's not on the scale of the first facelift these films received when it was reissued in 1997. Voices and images have been replaced and the sound remixed as part of Lucas' attempt to make these three films more consistent with the prequels he did. ""Star Wars"" has become so much a part of our modern mythology that there's really nothing critical I can say and it wouldn't really matter. It's a pity that Lucas didn't release these versions along with the original theatrical cuts that played in 1977, 1980 and 1983.First off, all three films look terrific. It's clear a lot of care went into these transfers. The image quality is smooth and, although it's clear these were transferred from film, there's little of the omnipresent grain that hints at an optical effect. Secondly, the depth, clarity and sharpness are among the best I've seen in a DVD transfer. There's minimal edge enhancement and it's rarely distracting like some other recent releases. Comparing this edition to the previously released laserdisc and video editions of the film, the DVD collection is like comparing a rich desert to a candy bar. While they both taste sweet, the desert belongs to a completely different class altogether.  The sound is, for the most part, outstanding. The website The Digital Bits indicated that there were some issues with the sound. Lucasfilm responded that the soundtrack was remixed a bit for this edition. While these moments are a bit distracting, they don't impact the overall experience of the movie. Overall, after a long, long wait ""The Star Wars Trilogy"" on DVD was well worth the wait.With a 150 minute documentary discussing the creation of the ""Star Wars"" universe from conception to execution, ""Empire of Dreams"" is among the best original and most exhaustive documentaries ever on a film series. The documentary has loads of behind-the-scenes footage shot on locations and sets for all three films. I'm surprised at how much documentation exists for ""A New Hope"" as it was the first in the trilogy and Lucas had no idea if he was going to be able to make any additional films in the saga. Lucas discusses the script itself and how the three films in the series all have their genesis in the 200 page script Lucas wrote. Since he couldn't possibly get a green light for a 200 minute movie, he broke the script into its three acts borrowing the conclusion of the Death Star destruction from the end of the script and transposing it to the end of ""A New Hope"". There's also an Easter Egg on the fourth disc. Go to the menu where you can select the games. Browse over to main menu but don't push enter. Instead, hit the ""10"" on your remote and enter ""11"". This will take you to a spot next to main menu where you enter ""38"". Hit enter and you'll be takent to the DVD credits where there is about two minutes of bloopers from all three films.Original producer Gary Kurtz, optical effects wizards Dennis Muren and John Dykstra along with various crew and model makers are interviewed for the film discussing the creation of ILM in Van Nuys, California.  We also get three marvelous featurettes, a sneak peak at the new ""Revenge of the Sith"" (with Hayden Christiansen suiting up as Vader) as well as a sneak peak at the new X-Box game ""Star Wars: Battlefront"". Like the laserdisc edition of the ""Star Wars Trilogy"", there's audition footage shot on video from 1975 featuring a most unlikely mix of actors (everyone from Kurt Russell to William Katt). There's the usual assortment of trailers, TV spots and a few Easter Eggs along the way. The featurettes cover the creation of the Lightsaber (Which has behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage), the characters of ""Star Wars"" and an appreciation by film directors such as Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. If you're wondering how much these films have been cleaned up and improved, you need to compare the original theatrical and TV spots to the improved editions.The first three discs consists strictly of the movies with audio commentary from Lucas,  sound effects editor Ben Burtt,visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren and actress Carrie Fisher. All four appear together on a single track cobbled together from different sessions. While the result can be a bit distracting at times (as there's no interplay between the speakers), the result is a film commentary that's well balanced and never boring. We get everything from the difficulty in shooting in Africa to the origin of R2D2's ""voice"" (think baby sounds run through a synthesizer and babbling sliced and diced). The commentary track for ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" tends to be the most interesting because of the fact that Lucas was breaking new ground and challenging the preconceptions of the movie studios.The ""Star Wars Trilogy"" has never looked better and the film has never received such an exhaustive array of extras covering the films. The inclusion of the 150 minute documentary provides all the nuts and bolts one needs to know about the films. Lucas along with Spielberg changed the face of entertainment in American film bringing back both a sense of wonder and fun that had been missing. While that may have overwhelmed more serious filmmaking, it brought back a quality that had been missing for far too long."	5.0	The Force is very strong in these films.	2004-09-22	19	15	4

Has there EVER been an actor so wantonly, and grossly miscast? There is absolutely no menace, no snarl, no underlying tones of darkness in the posture, eyes, face, or voice of Hayden Christensen. No edge AT ALL. Lucas, how COULD you send a BOY to do a MAN'S job? Oh, wait, that's right - you're the same ""genius"" responsible for destroying a legacy. Your poor casting choices should not and DO NOT come as any surprise. I cannot wait until ""Episode"" 3 opens in theaters. The feelings of awe and wonderment that should have been, will now be replaced with howls of derisive, scornful LAUGHTER. Can't blame Hayden though; his participation in these films has locked in his meal ticket for the rest of his life. If he (or Ewan MacGregor for that matter) had any integrity, they would have bowed their heads in shame and refused to cooperate in the ineptitude that has become George Lucas' whimsy. What an utterly tragic way to end it. Really, the best thing one can do is pretend the prequels were never made. At best, after watching the horror that is Phantom Menace / Attack Of The Clones, and probably ""Sith"", you can tell yourself that the storytelling DOES get better. But even then, you'll have to search and scrap to find the real and the true Star Wars. The original films are what have endured; it is the originals that have made Lucas RICH; to deny the countless millions of fans what's true and dear, is an out and out travesty and disgrace."	1.0	HAYDEN AS DARTH VADER??

I think this trilogy was (and still is) fantastically successful not for any one reason, but because it includes basically all of the elements that audiences typically like in films: a suspenseful good-vs.-evil plot, likeable characters, great action scenes, big special effects and (to top it off) a monumental score by John Williams. Although often referred to as a ""science fiction"" series, Star Wars really involves little if any science. It's more of a mythological fantasy that happens to take place in outer space. (In this sense, it is distinguished from Star Trek, which sometimes got bogged down in technical details and trying to make ""intelligent"" commentaries on current events. Not that I dislike Star Trek, but it can't quite achieve the level of pure entertainment seen here).STAR WARS (1977), rechristened after its release A NEW HOPE, was the dream project of George Lucas which everyone else thought would fail completely. (In fact, so did Lucas himself, until opening day when it began its record-breaking run at the top of the box office). It's also the only film in the series that can be understood by itself, without the others, not surprisingly.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) is often considered the best of the series, thanks to its darker and more dramatic tone, and its skillful character development.RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) has been criticized for leaning towards ""cutesiness"" in the form of the furry Ewoks, but it also has moments of great intensity in the final battle between the good guys and the evil Empire.Of course, it has to be said that these are technically not the same films that came out over twenty years ago. The changes made in the late-90s Special Editions are still here, along with a few more odds and ends altered. The changes do not detract from the overall entertainment value of the films, and personally I think you would have to be a true purist not to want to own this set, as it looks and sounds great.There is also a bonus disc with a two-and-a-half hour documentary that takes you through the making of the trilogy, and some other goodies that any Star Wars fan should naturally see.Overall, a pretty nice set."	5.0	By all sane standards, this is an excellent DVD set	2004-11-26	27	17	10

Yes like many I am a purist and favor the original theatrical releases the best. I was, though, just happy to have a digital copy of the special edition films. After waiting nearly 8 months to receive the dvd set, I was shocked and horrorified,  to find the films have been changed yet again!So what's different?The smallest changes are in A New Hope, basically the added scene with Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt has be redone to look smoother.In Empire Strikes Back, there is all new dialog between the Emperor and Darth Vader in the hologram chamber as well as a new image of the Emperor using Ian McDiarmid. Finally, gone is Boba Fetts original voice over, replaced with the voice of Temuera Morrison, who plays Jango Fett in the newer trilogy.In Return of the Jedi there are some cosmetic changes at the final ceremony which now includes celebrations on Curascant and Naboo. The most significant change in ROTJ is as Luke looks into the forest and sees the spirits of Anakin, Yoda and Obi-wan the original actor playing Anakin has been digitally removed and replaced with Hayden Christensen!Lucas says these changes were done for ""constistency."" If it's constitent to have Boba Fett sound like Jango Fett, presumably because he's a clone, why do all the stormtroopers, who are also clones, sounds different? As for the spirit scene, if it's more consistent to see the younger Anakin Skywalker spirit why didn't they digitally add Hayden to the scene where Luke removes Vaders helmet?On top of the changes is an all new 5.1 surround sound audio track that lacks DTS Surround and has several glaring audio drop outs and incorrect signal placements.The special features disc has an interesting documentary on the original trilogy and several other featurettes.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3IS4F99JW8HNZ	WildDenali	"We always knew that ""Star Wars"" was Episode IV; that there would be more movies to come.  Science fiction fans gobbled this movie up as they were starved for the good story of an old-fashioned ""Western, set in space.""  Star Wars is not about the special effects.  At the time, though, they were fantastic!  Ask any other 10-year-old boy who saw the movie that summer of 1977, as I did.  Star Wars was about the story, black vs. white, good vs. evil--as clear cut as a director could make it.It's interesting to hear Steven Spielberg and George Lucas talk about Star Wars on the 4th disc in the ""Indiana Jones"" DVD box set.  They fondly recall that George wanted the Indiana Jones stories to be like the old serials, just good stories with the best effects that could be accomplished at the time.  George never set out to make a blockbuster with Star Wars, he just wanted to tell a story, and it was a great one.  That's why all the old-timers, mentioned in other reviews, are upset.  The story is still a good one after all these years.  It has stood the test of time.As for the ""Special Editions,"" well if they're the Only Editions, then they're not really that ""Special"" anymore are they?  I still have my VHS versions if I want to see the originals, but what I was hoping to see were cleaned up versions of the original trilogy when I went to the theater in 1997, not altered versions.When we saw the special effects in 1977 of X-wings and TIE-fighters flying through space, especially as the scenes became more complex and visually dazzling in the later 2 films, we didn't think about what the movies would look like at home.  VHS was not mainstream until the mid-1980s, if you recall.  Yet when we watch the VHS titles now, the escapism of watching a fantastic movie is lost because you see things like the traveling mattes (little translucent squares used in special effects to combine the blue-screen shot of the fighter with the star field background) surrounding X-wings flying through space.  This shows up in the Star Trek original series shows too, when seen on television.Those effects were cleaned up for the re-release, but things like the:1)plexiglass dowel being clearly seen in some of the duels (rather than the special effect glow which is meant to cover the prop) is still there !!2)The death star firing sequence uses a standard (at the time) television switcher (keyboard for changing video sources) as part of the firing sequence.  I've always found this humorous as I now work in TV, myself, but something that might've been updated too.As for plot changes, why did Greedo have to fire first?  We know Han Solo isn't the squeakiest clean of characters!  I love the scene with Han and Jabba, but the clean up of him stepping over Jabba's tail is absolutely HORRIBLE!  It ruins the escapism and calls attention to the fact that we're watching a movie.As for enhancements, the Tattoine scenes outside the bar look great with all of the enhanced detail.  So do the added desert scenes with the Storm Troopers and there lizard mounts.Overall, I love these movies.  I'd still say that they're in my top ten and were at one time my top 3.  I will be buying this boxed set, if only to update my existing VHS titles.  I don't love the changes, but perhaps we will be able someday to create our own favorite versions of the films using iMovie.  Shouldn't be that hard.

Mostly my problems lie with the ""cute"" additions that Lucas felt the need to make, such as the little robots taunting each other as Luke and company zip by in the speeder in A New Hope, or the totally unnecessary Max Rebo Band sequence in Return Of the Jedi. Lucas was obviously aiming these scenes at kids. Little little kids.The film that the new additions actually work best in is, no surprise, Empire Strikes Back. The nuances of Cloud City and the extra scenes of the snow creature are wonderful and -- most importantly -- subtle. Not the ""insert new scene here"" look of A New Hope.But all of that aside -- the films themselves are really good and very fun to watch, even after the 100th time. The bonus material here is great as well, with interviews with the majority of the cast and some neat outtakes that will make you laugh -- check out David Prowse's Vader dialogue and Peter Meyhew's Chewy dialogue.

There was no hype, no lines, and Lucas hadn't even imagined that there would even be a sequel at that point. Than being said - it truly was a landmark film. What bothers me is that the original masterpiece will never be seen by future generations. For whatever reason, Lucas decided that he would rework it with all the digital wizardry he could muster. Should other landmark film be re-worked? A revised Citizen Kane or 2001 perhaps? Beyond restoration techniques that are utilized to restore a film back to the closest approximation to it's original incarnation, there is no legitimate reason to tamper with a masterpiece, let alone refuse to let the original ever be seen again. The added digital effects and scenes add little if nothing to the story. If anything there is an incongruity with the rest of the film.

And it's easy to see why.This began the story, with the introduction of protagonist Luke Skywalker, his mentor, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and an entire galaxy's worth of a cast, including veteran stage and film actor Peter Cushing and the always-entertaining Harrison Ford.In the prequel trilogy, the rise of the Galactic Empire is seen. This trilogy, however, focuses on the events of nineteen years later; on the Rebel Alliance and their fight to restore freedom to the galaxy. The end of Darth Vader, formerly known as Anakin Skywalker, is every bit as dramatic as his fall to the Dark Side in the prequel and the closing of the saga is just as entertaining now as it was twenty years ago.The trilogy has been digitally remastered two or three times at this point, and this includes all of the footage added for the Special Edition rerelease of the films in the mid-90s. From the additional background characters in certain shots to redone sequences to an entirely new musical number in Jabba's Palace, Lucas went all-out to improve the look and feel of these movies, and his efforts were not in vain.I purchased this and the prequel trilogy in these thinpack box sets. Each movie has with it a second disc that has lots of bonus features. Whether you're like me and like to sit and watch all six in a day-long marathon, or watch one a day to stretch the enjoyment out all week, or just want to pull out a particular favorite to watch once in a while, these sets are perfect. (And you can pick up both for about what you'd pay for a single trilogy in normal-size cases in a retail store.) If you're a Star Wars fan, these sets are the perfect way to treat yourself. (Even if you're not a fan, they make the perfect gift for someone who is.)	5.0	The original classics.	2009-03-04	12	10	2

I just can't bear to watch Han Solo step on Jabba then get away with it and then call him a wonderful human being (or a close approximation). It's a stupid, redundant scene with no new exposition. It looks ugly. And it steals drama from ROTJ. I'm just not going to give George any more money until he edits this stuff out. I don't have to have the absolute originals. I like some of the digital touch-ups. But every single bit of dialog he added since 1997 should be trashed.And one more thing. Why is he continually changing the original trilogy to match the crud he delivered in the prequels. That's just plain dumb. If Star Trek II could survive Kahn's recognizing Checkov who wasn't on the Enterprise when he was, then the original trilogy could have survived the plot holes between it and the prequels.Uggh!	2.0	You're a wonderful human being.	2011-09-12	11	10	1

And that is George Lucas... Stop being so selfish and making us watch this CGI ""special edition"" bull crap instead of the ACTUAL original trilogy.  Look if you want to make a bunch of prequels that don't make any sense and are full of ""crazy awesome"" CGI that is just to wow the audience and appeal to your own idiotic interests as well as fill your wallet then go right ahead.  But Leave The Original Trilogy Alone!  It is not yours to tamper with and you have no right doing so.  It belongs to the fans now.  By making it and putting it out there it becomes theirs to watch, appreciate, relate to, and enjoy and no longer just yours.  And I, as a Star Wars fan, will not ever buy another Star Wars product again until this man releases the original trilogy In Good Quality.  None of that laser disc quality I don't care what these films look like not in CGI stuff.  The Original Trilogy in GOOD QUALITY.  And if you are an actual Star Wars fan then you won't buy another Star Wars product until he releases the Orginal Trilogy either.  And not to be a complete and total geek, but he is the emperor now and we (actual Star Wars fans) are the Rebel Alliance.

DVD Versions (2004, often erroneously referred to as ""Special Editions"")3. Original Theatrical Versions (adapted to DVD 2006)4. Blu-Ray Versions (2011)Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987.  And I've been a huge fan ever since.  The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times, although this review will discuss some of the changes made (and not made) to the films.I actually own the six-film Star Wars Saga blu-ray set linked above, and I reviewed that.  The movie discs in this product are 3 of the same discs from the larger Saga set, so I thought I would edit that review down to only discuss the classic trilogy discs themselves and post it here.  This is meant to be an overview with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.DISC PHYSICAL QUALITIESThe discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen.  The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings.  The movie discs (1-6) have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral.THE FILM DISCSThis is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray.  There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from ""archival interviews with cast and crew"".  I would expect that the word ""archival"" to mean pre-1997, which should be a real treat for all the purists.  I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions.  This may mean more to you than it does to me.  My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350.  My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter.  My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old.  My line of vision is exactly 90 to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen.  I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.The Films on Blu-rayAll three films sound and look awesome in HD!  I fully appreciate all the pain-staking effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 6 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame.  The Millennium Falcon is amazingly detailed, with all of it's charming dents and carbon-scoring.  The Death Stars seem even bigger and more epic due to the incredible level of detail now visible.  I could go on and on, but you're really just going to have to see it for yourself.There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade.  A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters.  Throughout the films, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding ""reality"" they are projected into.  This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real.  The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media.  A very nice touch.A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1997.  Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic.  Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe.  Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD.  The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all.  Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been ""raised"" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings.  This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.  Above, I mentioned how great the Death Stars and the Falcon look.  The asteroid field effects are improved all the way around, and Cloud City looks fantastic.  The upgrade to high definition is more noticeable in the original trilogy and thus strikes me as even more stunning overall.  For the most part, the lightsaber effects are improved and match the prequel effects.However, there are some aspects of some scenes that you can only do so much with without completely new effects.  The squares around the ships flying in front of outer space are no longer visible, but ships flying in front a capital ship still sometimes show a barely noticeable amount of distortion surrounding the smaller ship.  The snowspeeder cockpits viewed from the pilot's point of view are now completely opaque against the Hoth landscape, but you can still just barely see the moon of Endor through Han's head and the cockpit of the shuttle Tyderium.  And some distance backgrounds that were previously just out-of-focus in the original camerawork are now just understandably flat-out blurry in HD.Episode IV: A New HopeObi-Wan's simulated Krayt Dragon roar (to scare off the Tusken Raiders that had attacked Luke) has been changed yet again.  While I don't understand Lucas' need to change it, I also don't understand the big uproar this insignificant alteration to the film has caused among fans.  A live Krayt Dragon is never seen onscreen anywhere in the film saga.  Who's to say what a fictional off-screen animal should sound like?  I would think Lucas is the only one that would even care.  I certainly don't give a damn what the dragon is supposed to sound like.  The fictional simulation of a never-seen creature's roar only has to convince the fictional Sand People, not us.  You may not like a particular sound effect, but I think the harsh criticisms I have read about this (for any version of the roar) for something so inconsequential are ridiculous.Rocks have been added near the opening of the little cave that R2 is hiding in when Obi-Wan shows up, and the negative criticisms to this are completely unfounded.  It has been spread throughout the internet that the rocks inexplicably ""disappear"" when R2 is later shown wheeling towards Obi-Wan and Luke, but the purists that have stated this are totally misinterpreting the scene.  When R2 is coming out of hiding, the shot is from a different angle than the previous view into the cave, and the rocks that had been added to the previous shot would be behind R2 who is obscuring the mouth of the cave.  So how are you supposed to see the added rocks through R2?  There is no discontinuity caused by the added rocks, and I suspect that some purists are misreporting things in an attempt to fuel the fire of their hatred of Lucas and all changes in general.I mean, there nothing wrong with aesthetically disliking the addition of the rocks in the shots they appear in, but it is incorrect to misrepresent a change as creating a new discontinuity in a subsequent shot when it doesn't really do that.  I don't really like the added rocks but I don't dislike them either, because it really has no impact on the scene, just like the variations of Obi-Wan's dragon roars.  The details of these two changes are just go in my ""Whatever, George"" file and are then given no more attention.  And some people say Lucas is all OCD about Star Wars!The scene where Luke first turns on his father's lightsaber has been edited more tightly to better conceal the disjointedness that occurred from the original editing of two different takes together to appear as one continuous live action.  I'm pleased with that minor but needed improvement.  And now, Greedo and Han shoot virtually simultaneously (more on Greedo later).The SequelsBoth sequels overall look great, but almost all the changes were made to RotJ.  While holograms have been left in a lower resolution, the Force Ghosts have been fully upgraded to HD further differentiating between the two effects.  For the purist muppet-lovers out there, rest easy.  Yoda and Jabba the Hutt remain the original muppets they've always been in the sequels, but even the muppets look better in HD.  And I'll throw in here that contrary to false rumors, Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin de-masked remains unchanged from the previous version of the film (besides the upgrade of it to HD).Episode VI: Return of the JediThe static shot of the droids moving up to the blast door to Jabba's palace is now slightly expanded into a wide pan-in to the droids starting with a larger door.  It adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure - a nice touch.The ""thawing out"" of Han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like it's ""melting"" away, an improvement to the original effect.A Dug (the species of Sebulba in TPM) is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace (not a close-up), and some people say it looks fake.  I think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace.A few shots of Ewoks show them blinking, and a couple close-ups of Wicket show the details of his eyes, making Ewoks seem more like real animal life-forms and less like midgets in suites.It does seem like a few TIE Fighters were added to the Battle of Endor, another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale.When R2 is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker, I noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced.  My wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of R2.  I'll watch for that next time, but since I didn't even notice the new gadgets I doubt I will have any problem with the change.""No... Nooo!""When Vader is watching Luke getting zapped by the final attack of the Emperor's Sith lightning, Anakin now says ""No.""  Then as he picks up Palpatine, Anakin more loudly says, ""Nooo!""  I've read this described as a ""scream"" but that is way overstating it.  And contrary to what is commonly being reported, it is also not quite the extended ""Noooo!"" from RotS when Vader finds out that Padme is dead. (That may have been the recording they used as a basis, but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in RotJ.)When looking at the complete Star Wars saga, these two additions of the word ""No"" do not seem out of place to me at all.  Obi-Wan yelled, ""Noooo!"" when he saw his Jedi master get struck down by Darth Maul in Episode I.  Luke yelled, ""Nooo!"" when he saw Vader strike down Obi-Wan in Episode IV.  Luke has his mega-no sequence to Vader in Episode V, ""No... No! That's not true. That's impossible! ... Noooooo! Noo!""  It seems that now Anakin in Episode VI is just following in a time-honored tradition among his master and son.  But at the climax of the six-film saga, it's stated at the prevention of the negative outcome.  This broken man who had killed his wife and Jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the Sith master. My wife, who had made it a game when watching the blu-rays to point out every change to the films she noticed, made no mention of Anakin's new No's.  It seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu-ray once, she thought they had always been there.  Anakin's new No's make perfect sense to me with respect to the entire film saga.I have read criticisms that the new No's were out-of-character for Vader.  Well, it is not Vader who said them!  It was the buried persona of Anakin Skywalker who was emerging back to the surface to conquer Darth Vader.  The titular Jedi who was at that moment returning.  I like Anakin's new No's!STILL UNCORRECTED...I've long ago accepted the fact that I am a severe minority among first generation Star Wars fans.  Many of the fans from our generation like to point out things they would change about the prequels, or changes to the original trilogy they don`t like.  So now that the films are all so close to perfection, I thought I would represent a radical view by going ""anti-purist"" and provide my fan-boy list of things in the classic trilogy that in my opinion still need changed or corrected!Episode IV: A New HopeAfter the droids land on Tatooine, the inside of the escape pod's open hatch that was previously blue is now a slightly more realistic-looking black in the blu-ray.  But later when the stormtroopers search the area, the hatch is still blue.  What, it is a black material than turns blue under the hot suns?  This is minor point but just seems unfinished.Lucas has long stated that the cantina scene was incomplete in the original release.  He ran out of time and money to finish it.  By now he's had decades, no shortage of money, and obviously no qualms about revising his movies.  But one of the two Duros has long alien fingers while the other still has normal human hands.  A little CG fix in a dim background, come on!And in blu-ray it is now more than ever apparent that when Ponda Baba (walrus man) is shown at the bar he has fin-cup hands, instead of the more humanoid hand of the severed arm shown on the floor after Obi-Wan slices it off.  The ANH deleted scenes even have the original shot of the severed fin-cup hand on the floor.  Changing it to more humanoid hand in post-production for the original release was a completely sensible decision because without a humanoid hand it wasn't very clear what was on the floor.  But now, with all this financial success and time, Lucas couldn't just go ahead and fix the previous shots of the alien to also have the five-fingered hands?  A couple minor CG fixes, come on!Also, I really don't see the need for all that blood on the floor by the severed arm.  Putting the humanoid hand with a gun makes it pretty clear what Obi-Wan had cut off.  All the other cases of limbs and heads getting chopped off by lightsabers throughout the rest of the film saga do not show any blood (in fact the severed body parts sometimes also conveniently disappear from view).In watching the blu-ray, I noticed for the first time that Greedo's shot didn't leave the slightest mark on the wall near Han's head.  Of course I realize that this problem was created by an alteration to the original scene, and the reversion back to the original would eliminate this oversight.  See below for more on Greedo.In 1976, the remote-control R2 was unreliable and often failed.  So they improvised in some shots where only the top of R2 is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs, which resulted in R2 appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in-universe.  Even as a kid I thought that looked ridiculous because R2 just shouldn't move that way.  On blu-ray, the CG R2 in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga, so there is really no reason that they couldn't have just corrected the bobbing R2 shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in.An often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of Skywalker's lightsaber blade on the Falcon.  The fix the blu-ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing.  Sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blade's appearance in RotS and TESB, bold and bluish.  But other times it still appears weak and turquoise-tinted.  Why only fix some of the scene and not all?In TESB blu-ray, it looks like R2's blue parts that originally appeared black while in Luke's X-wing have finally been made blue.  But in ANH's Battle of Yavin, there are still shots of R2's blue parts being black.  That should have been cake to fix them all by now.I'm a huge film score music aficionado.  TESB's iconic ""Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)"" was based on the ""Imperial Attack"" theme from ANH.  There was no longer a need for the original ""Imperial Attack"" so it never appeared in the saga outside of ANH.  ""Imperial March"" was used in the subsequent five Star Wars films as appropriate.  When the saga is viewed chronologically, the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after ANH makes ANH seem somewhat at a loss without it.  I feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of ""Imperial March"" into ANH in two places: When Vader first appears in the film as he enters Leia's starship, and when Vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his TIE fighter and flies away.  Thematically, that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of ANH as a whole.Episodes V: The Empire Strikes BackIt makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop-motion photography.  Intuitively, machines moving in that non-organic fashion seems realistic.  But I have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns' moving.  I do understand that in 1979, claymation was the only way to bring tauntaun's to life, but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by today's standards, especially on blu-ray.  I still have no problem with the muppet Taun-Tauns used for the close-ups, but for a couple distant shots they should have CGed the tauntaun scenes.It seems to me that the scene where Han rescues Luke on Hoth uses a little short-cut in the upgrade to HD.  The scene is now darker, which of course means less detail is needed.  It actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports Han's dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold Hoth night.  But there is one shot of Luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change.  Is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment, or a flaw in the blu-ray itself?And in the modern age of ILM, there is no longer any need to depend on the 1979 live-action short sleeve/long sleeve ""effect"" to portray Luke with his hand cut off.  Just fix his really long-looking arm with CG.And as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks, Vader's lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots.  So the blu-rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy.  And at the end of TESB when Luke, Leia and the droids are watching the Falcon fly away, R2's blue parts are still black.Episodes VI: Return of the JediLike almost everything on the Star Wars blu-rays the surface of the rancor's body looks impressive, but the rancor still seems too slow-mo to really seem that menacing to me.  I'd love it if the Rancor is redone in CG to appear both large and not so slow.When Yoda dies, the blu-ray still uses the archaic original effect of Yoda's blanket fading out with Yoda, while at the same time the blanket without Yoda can be seen fading in (but not exactly the same position) before it falls into the vacuum left by Yoda's passing.  So for a time, two blankets are visible as Yoda fades away.  It should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a CG blanket over both of the original blankets, with the CG blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after Yoda is completely gone from the shot.Although it does not appear as much as the Luke's ""long-sleeve"" severed arm in TESB, a similar live-action ""effect"" was used for Vader/Anakin when Luke cut off his hand.  This is more visible when in the close-up on Anakin after he throws Palpatine into the pit, the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it (because in the real world, it does).  But Anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit?  OK, fine.  But it really stands-out when Luke is dragging Anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off.  CG it!Future Revisions to the Films?Based on Lucas' pattern since 1997, the classic films get changed every 7 years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to the saga coming by 2018.  However, it has been announced that all 6 films will be re-released theatrically in 3D one-at-a-time starting with Episode I in February 2012.  If the 3D films come out at the rate of one per year, the final episode will come out in 2017 which is also the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film.  Now that I am seeing commercials for 3D TVs and even 3D smart phones, it seems extremely likely that the films will be re-released in a home 3D format either one-at-a-time or all at once by 2017.  Either way I suspect that I'll need a 3D TV by 2017).  I doubt that Episode I 3D will have any changes from the blu-ray version since it is coming out so soon, but there is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films, especially the classic trilogy.  I'd be thrilled if they revised anything from my ""still uncorrected"" list above!  Lucas won't live forever so I doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home 3D versions.  So when will Lucas stop revising his films?  My guess is 2017.HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND DIVERGE FROM G-CANONWhen my wife and I were watching ANH on blu-ray, we watched the Greedo scene and then paused it so my wife could use the restroom.  While she was gone, I went to YouTube and watched the original version of the scene in which Greedo never shot, and I noticed something I had forgotten years ago.  In the original version of the scene, it does not actually show any blaster bolts at all, even from Han.  Han says, ""Yes, I bet you have!"" and then it just shows the impact of an attack on Greedo.  It seems obvious that Han had shot, because Han had stealthily drawn his blaster and Greedo got hit with something and died.  But I realized that the original version of the scene actually also allows for the possibility of Greedo also getting off a shot.  And if Greedo had gotten a shot off before or at the same time as Han's, Greedo had obviously missed because Han was fine.  However, besides it being extremely unlikely that Greedo could have possibly even missed Han at point lank range, there was no blast mark anywhere near Han, and as mentioned earlier in this review, there still isn't...Then I went back to the blu-ray and watched the latest version of the scene again.  In this re-viewing, right as Han said, ""Yes, I bet you have!"" something wondrous occurred.  I sneezed.  Wha?!  How could that possibly be significant?!  I'll tell you.  As you may realize, it is impossible to keep our eyes open while sneezing.  Even if only closed a split-second, yours eyes will close.  In this case, my eyes were closed during the camera shot of the blaster bolts being fired, and they reopened when Greedo gets blown away.  I was playing the ANH blu-ray, but because of the sneeze, what all I had seen with my eyes was the original version of the film in which no blaster bolts were visible and there was no evidence that Greedo had fired his gun at all.This made me realize that when watching ANH going forward, I could enjoy the overall superior blu-ray version and all I have to do was close my eyes for split second at the right moment, and I personally have restored ""only Han shoots"" to my personal ""viewing"" of the film!  Then I thought about how silly that sounded, and after we finished watching the movie, that caused me to seriously reexamine my previously self-imposed standard of defining my personal Star Wars canon as including all elements of G-canon appearing on screen in the latest version of the films.I thought back to Lucas' statement that there is a Star Wars multiverse.  There is his universe, the expanded universe of publishing, and there is also each fan's personally-defined universe.  I had already personally defined my world as being expanded from the Lucasverse by diverging from some of Lucas' statements about some off-screen elements of his universe and some of the secondary g-canon elements (novelizations, comic books and radio dramas) that do not appear in the films.  My SW universe has plenty of original elements of my own devising and differing interpretations and explanations of elements not overtly explained or portrayed on-screen, and my universe includes only some elements of the Expanded Universe but far from all.  But I had previously still chosen to not diverge from Lucas' on-screen g-canon (of the latest versions each film), which had included the dramatically inferior Greedo getting a shot off at all.That ultimately lead to my full embracement of Lucas' statement that I am completely free to define canon for my own personal Star Wars universe, even if it contradicts his G-canon.  Since all my non-Greedo-related criticisms of the blu-rays are just visual effects or musical score concerns, I have now officially updated my Star Wars universe to include all the story continuity seen in the blu-rays except that Greedo doesn't fire at all.Contrary to how WEG statted Greedo, I still think that Greedo was not a PC-caliber bounty hunter.  Greedo was just a mook, a two-bit thug.  It is likely that he did have to drink some liquid courage to even get up the nerve to confront Han, and Greedo being intoxicated is still a good explanation for how he could possibly not even notice that Han had drawn his blaster.  It's still not a huge deal to me, but it is undeniably better if Greedo never shot.I may try to rig up a bookmark device in the blu-ray to allow me to skip over the second showing the blaster-bolts for when I first show the movie to my son when he is older.  That way, my son will be able to experience the heightened drama of Han's moral ambiguity, so Han's return to help Luke at the climax will be that much more satisfying.  Then, after the movie is over, I will do what the ""Parental Guidance"" rating of the film expects. I will discuss the morality of shooting first, making it clear that Han did not choose to completely become a good guy until the end of the film.  I think this discussion will even work better than Lucas' solution to his concern because it will further emphasize that morality is about choices.  And this goes right along with Anakin's story arc in the saga.  I don't need Lucas' revision to the Greedo scene to do my job as a parent for me.FINAL WORDSYou may not agree with all the opinions I expressed throughout this review, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level.  If so, then do yourself a favor and watch the films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them.  You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words.  And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.In my first viewing of Star Wars on blu-ray, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray.  While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better.  As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before.But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!If you have any questions, please feel free the ask.  If you have also seen the blu-rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review, please also feel free.  May the Force be with you."	5.0	The Star Wars Trilogy on BLU-RAY	2011-10-05	14	10	4
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ASZEK2N0EYMXG	"Willy Boy ""Willy Boy"""	"I am not sure that Star Wars is the best movie trilogy ever, but it definitely ranks in the top 5.  This box set is an excellent presentation of three movies with a bonus DVD that is actually worth watching (in other words, it is not just for hard core SW fans).  The quality of the DVDs I bought is perfect (to be expected).  However, I was surprised at how much the individual movies were cleaned up.  I saw the original releases in the theatres when I was a kid.  I then saw the updated versions when I was in my 20s.  Now I have seen these new versions and the differences from the originals are dramatic.  Some reviewers have critisized this release because the DVDs do not contain the original, theatrical versions of the films.  I do not find this a problem.  How many of us already own the original theatrical versions on VHS or Laser Disc.  Adding the original versions onto this DVD series would have only increased the costs to the consumer.  At only $41.99 a set I find this to be very reasonable.As mentioned above, the difference between the updated versions of the movies and these new versions are not so dramatic, but the difference between the theatrical and the new releases is astounding.  All three films have been cleaned and reformated for THX sound and modern special effects.  The explosions are more crisp, the colors more vibrant and the space background more polished.  Very impressive and much appreciated.Unlike a lot of ""special"" DVD releases, this DVD series contains bonus material which actually adds to the whole and is worth any extra costs we are paying for the set.  I had seen many of the vinnetes regarding the making of Star Wars at different times from different programs.  To see it all together in documentary format was incredible.This series is a true tribute to the fans and welcome departure from the typical ""rake the consumer for every penny"" mentallity which seems prevelant in the industry today."	5.0	Worth Every Penny	2004-10-18	8	5	3

Little does Mr. Lucas realize that these movies now belong to all of us and we want the originals, not these altered versions! Yes, folks... These are the unnecessarily altered versions that just really dissapoint and ruin the whole experience. I was disappointed from the moment my movies arrived, when I saw the simple flimsy packaging and especially the lack of any extra footage DVD's or within each movies extras... There is nothing aside from the boring commentaries. You would think that a trilogy of this magnitude would be worthy of so much more, but no... Not even decent packaging.The quality of the picture and sound of the movies, however, are absolutely amazing! I couldn't believe how fantastic and how new these movies looked, because they definitely do not look like they are well over 20 years old! I was really excited watching the first movie and extremely pleased with the picture and sound quality, until I saw a fake Jabba The Hut slithering across my screen asking Han Solo why had he fried poor Greedo...  That's when my excitement ended and I when I knew, that there would be more of this in the other episodes. For now, this is as good as it gets...	3.0	No... Noooo!!!	2012-04-21	3	3	0

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3ICVJQMZAGQV5	wisdomstar	I just bought this set today - and paid too much for it at K-Mart ($40.00). But I'm happy anyway. I came home and immediately played the first disc on a blu-ray player and an LCD widescreen (32 inch). When this saga ever comes out on real blu-ray, I can't imagine how it is going to be any better than the clarity of this set. Although I was there (32 years ago) for the original release and remember very well the awesome impact of the original, I like the expanded edition and the upgraded special effects. Sometimes, when you go back to a movie you loved, you find the effects dated and disappointing. So hats off to Lucas for doing the work to keep his beloved trilogy current and entertaining. It's also convenient to have the thin cases to make room in an overstuffed bookcase. As for the content, which practically everyone knows, Star Wars is a fairy tale of good guys, evil villains and magic enchantment. To be honest, I prefer it to the prequels where good guys go bad and the innocent suffer. My advice: sell your old copies here on amazon and buy this set.	5.0	worth the upgrade	2009-09-10	2	1	1

Videotape, DVD, Special Edition DVD, Blu Ray . . . how long will George Lucas continue milking this cow? I would prefer he leave the classics alone without fiddling with them, but he can feel free to completely alter the horrendously bad prequel movies. These original movies, in my mind, are the only true Star Wars movies. They're not perfect--Lucas tended to get carried away with the creatures, many of which looked cartoonish--but the basic story that is woven through these originals is perfectly laid out. What's interesting is that Lucas keeps altering these movies because he said the technology didn't exist when the originals were made, but that's not really why people love the movies. If that were the case, the prequels, which featured many special effects, would have a greater following.	3.0	Yet another collection . . .	2011-09-16	4	2	2

It's bad enough that the blacks are crushed, the lightsabers haven't been fixed (save for maybe 2 shots), audio errors from the 2004 set remain, there are weird color casts, etc, but adding insult to injury by adding the NNOOOOOOOOO!!!, obi's howl, and adding all of the other pointless revisions shows a stunning level of mistreatment for some of the most important films in cinema history.  With a fraction of the money used to revisit and change the films they could have been *easily* restored the theatrical versions as well, and released them along side this one.

We grown ups have much memories of original Star Wars series. the Answer is, for whom they've released this DVD set? For kids and teenagers or original fans? Original Fans I guess cause Star Wars original movies are not that intresting for today kids and todays standards. If we bought this DVD set, first expectation of ours was too meet our memories again!in first movie, they added more than 15 minutes of deleted scenes. 15 minutes of boring and even ridiculous additional Scenes that made Episode IV a boring movie. the original movie was approx 100 minutes and it was Dynamic and pure action! but in these new release, Action scenes have lost in that additional boring scenes. at least they could make them play at will, but there is no such an option. you condemn to watch them cause George want too! No need to say that they've manipulate old timer controllers and 70s costumes in the original movie with modern ones! and at last, they've remade some scenes with computer, Although that was not a bad Idea but they had no right to sell us a manipulated movie in the name of original!Second movie was better. a least there is nothing that bothers you so much!and the Third movie! OH MY GOD! They've sticked their rudness to heavens in this sequel! Instead of adapting newer sequels with old ones, they've manipulate the originals to adapt with newers! and what a brilliant manipulation! They've added some desperate Unsophisticated CGs based on The Cities Created in Episode I & 2 that show people celebrating for Rebels victory! CGs they've added are not even qulify to use in Copmputer games and they've added them to the end of such an Important movie. Episode IV Dissapointed me, on that base I tolorated Episode V, but this one was really a Repulsive Complex! They've changed the ghost of Anakin Skywalker with a Young guy to adapt with new sequel too!I've sold my DVD set for a low price cause each time I saw it on the shelf, I got bad feeling. I still Stick to my 80s VHS tapes and Recommand for All of the owner, Don't miss them!Let's have some words about Bonus Disc too! I don't know if you have Indiana Jones trilogy or not? in that DVD set, each movie have it's own documentary and very useful documentaries. but the bonus disc in Star wars trilogy is not even worth to discuss! a nearly 2 hour unspecialize documentary. well, don't expect them to release original documentaries cause they want to fool people that these are original movies and we don't manipulate them. full releasing that old documentaries may reveal their trick!	2.0	Keep Your Old Time VHS Types!	2005-07-13	9	4	5
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ACXEQLO2DZXVG	Wovenflame	Quality: The picture in all 3 films is absolutely superb!! (especially apparent when you look at before and after photos)  The sound is also top notch...though I've heard people talk of a few inconsistancies (though I didn't hear them myself).  The box art on the outer case and the individual cases is awesome!  They go perfectly with the already existing prequel dvd cases.The Changes:  Personally I think that the Special edition is better than the original.  George Lucas improved on a lot of things (and also left a lot of things that still needed improvement for that matter)For the DVD release, he has improved a great many things.  Many of the smaller changes people don't even realize.For those of you that are too stubborn to realize this, I will explain why you see a YOUNG Anakin Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi and not an older Anakin.  When Anakin became Darth Vader, the good that was in Anakin ceased to exist.  When they become one with the Force they take their true (good) form.  In Anakin's case, it was when he was still young.  George Lucas explains this himself in the Commentary if you're willing enough to listen...instead of just turn your head in disgust without putting any thought into the matter whatsoever.Overall, this is an EXCELLENT trilogy of superb quality.  2 Thumbs Up and 5 Stars.	5.0	These ARE the BEST versions	2004-10-11	16	7	9

I have fond memories of watching the movies for the first time in the theater with my father and I've always cherished them for the fine works if imagination they represent. After years of weening a generation on these films, George Lucas releases the Special Editions to mixed reactions. While many of the changes made the movies feel fresh, many of them seem out of place or just plain wrong. Certainly there is room for both versions of these films. While the new versions are suitable for refining George's ""vision"", the originals need to be preserved so  they won't be lost forever. The Star Wars trilogy inspired a generation and regardless of their creator's ""vision"", they deserve to be remembered as they once were.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A257946FG7O1GR	"Xam ""mixed media man"""	George Lucas seems to have really lost all touch with fans and reality. First he reworked the original brilliant star wars movies and released special editions, which were not any better (most consider worse) than the original versions. This was (obviously) a way to make a bunch of money, and get everyone excited for the prequels. We've had the (dis)pleasure of seeing the first two prequels, and boy were they disappointing. Ok, maybe they're a little better than your average hollywood garbage action movies, but not much. These movies prove that Lucas has lost his touch, although the second did improve slightly over the first. In my opinion, by taking such a long hiatus from making movies, Lucas has lost all sense for the artform (although he seems to remember how to pawn star wars junk off on the public). It's a sad and repeated tale- the young artist makes great art, gets rich and famous, loses touch with reality, and gets sucked into making more money instead of making good art. I'm not saying that Lucas is totally worthless, but at this point comparing him to any great directors is like comparing McDonalds to a fine gourmet restaurant, it just ain't gonna happen.Now on to this DVD set, which will come out in the fall. My main grievance is like most others, the special editions are lame. It would have been so easy to include both the special edition and regular original edition, one on each side of the DVD. The technology of DVD makes something like that very easy and would make so much sense. But of course if we had a desire for Lucas to make sense we would probably be driven insane. For instance- how could it take so damn long to release some of the biggest American movies ever on to DVD? Meanwhile, every third rate low budget movie has been released on DVD, and the big trilogy (which has hundreds of millions of hugely loyal fans) isn't released until more than 5 years after DVD has been declared the new standard. Well that makes lots of sense, doesn't it? No, of course it doesn't, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it took five years to transfer the film using new super slow technology, or maybe they had to completely refilm the original versions with new A-list hollywood actors (Justin Timberlake as Luke Skywalker), because of course that was what Lucas originally intended. Or maybe Lucas has just gone utterly mad (and lost any sense of what is good and bad in this world). Considering the amount of money Lucas will make (and considering that seems to be his main motivation these days) i'm totally confused as to why it took so long to release. But to only release the pathetically extended lame editions is truly an act of a mad man. Lucas- don't you get it, we always loved the original versions, they were the best and still are the best. I wish they would just release the original editions so we could all be happy. But try this on for a scenario- Lucas will release the originals a year or two after these to make even more money, you can count on it. Any artistic integrity Lucas may have had is now transformed into corporate money making schemes and merchandising operations. I absolutely love both the original Star Wars trilogy and DVD technology, but i'm tempted to boycott this DVD on my own moral grounds. Well, at least i have my VHS version of the original classics.	3.0	Classic trilogy on DVD...oh no the lame editions!!!	2004-06-29	11	8	3

It's obvious Lucas knows the theatrical versions are in high demand. I don't have a problem with this being released, but it should be available alongside the original edits of the films. It's not even about which versions are better: it's about being given the choice to see whichever version you prefer. If Ridley Scott can provide five versions of one film in a single box set (Blade Runner) and countless other films get two releases (theatrical and director's cut) in one box, then I'm quite sure LucasFilm could and should have provided both versions of the trilogy here.I'm not sure what good it'll do at this point, but there's still a petition over at originaltrilogy.com that might be worth signing if you care about this.	1.0	Same old story...	2012-06-06	15	13	2

Instead, they were released in VHS only and rumors were that Lucas was going to release the original trilogy in DVD format only after the second trilogy (Episodes 1-3) was completed. There were grumblings from the fan base that Lucas was being greedy in which it forces people to buy the trilogy twice or three times. Also, many from the fan base do not like Lucas ""tweaking"" the films. To paraphrase Lucas in the ""Special Edition"" interviews (VHS versions) ""A director never completes a film, a director merely abandons it."" That's how he felt about STAR WARS and Lucas wanted to complete the films to his vision. When one thinks about it, he's not changing any story plotlines, but just adding a few things visually because of time and money constraints back when the movies were being filmed and to take advantage of the CGI age. Also, as it is shown on those VHS-Special Edition Interviews, the negative of the original film was all ready deteriorating in such a short period of time, and part of the tweaking was to save the film for future generations. Lastly, the further tweaking in the DVD releases are to enhance the bridge between the first trilogy and the next trilogy. Whatever Lucas' intent, it's his films, and he should be able to do what he wants to do with them. Now that the original trilogy is on DVD.  The DVD's have no indication of being the ""Special Edition"" versions from the 1997 re-release, but these are the versions with the changes (and there are even a few more surprises included).  Therefore, this is the definitive Lucas versions (at least for now). However, grumblings should subside because the films look great and Lucas didn't wait until the second trilogy was completed --or at least the final/3rd installment was released (it's probably completed but in post production and editing--also it is a marketing ploy to promote the film being released in May 2005). Overall, just watch and have fun.  Don't let the minor additives be a distraction, because the overall dynamics and spirit of the films are left intact.

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A10VEQOASSJJRX	"Yoda Lives ""Scott S"""	Like a lot of people, this trilogy revisits my childhood. I didn't think I would get this excited about this trilogy, but I rank this release on a level of Lord of the Rings DVD's. Is there some eleven year old who sat in a multiplex and got as passionate over LOTR as I did in 1977? I hope so. I bought the bubble gum cards, models, Marvel comics, and action figures.The best digital remastering was Empire Strikes Back. I loved the movie when it came out, but even back then I thought the film quality could have been better. The sound quality is great and the documentary is required viewing for any SW fan. Carrrie Fischer talking about Jabba, the slavegirl outfit, and Lucas wanting her to lose ten pounds before the start of A New Hope is great.	4.0	Return of the Child Dreamer	2004-09-24	4	2	2
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A2J3MR64L567OK	Yossarian	This is the Star Wars Special Editions on DVD.  Unlike typical Director's Cuts, the Special Editions include many altered original scenes rather than merely additional footage.  In other words, these are not the original A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, although this is intentionally non-obvious from the packaging and marketing.The original three Star Wars films are great.  This marketing campaign is not.  It is worth noting that aside from a few rare laserdiscs, Lucas has intentionally refused to release the original films in any permanent form.  His attempts to pass off this DVD set as the original is vile enough, but also merely assures in a few years that he will likely release an 'original' Star Wars DVD set for another round of gouging.  Be advised.	3.0	Great films, sleazy merchandising tactics	2004-04-22	14	10	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A1UU9DUPEHC5C2	YYZ-2112	This is a fine box set if all you want are the 2004 special edition versions of the Star Wars films of the 70's and 80's without the bonus disk.  The sound and image quality is very nice; much better than it was in 1997.  There are a few tweaks to effects and sound from the 1997 versions.  Like so many of us have opineons on changes for the better or the worse with the special editions, I have my own as well but I'll leave that out of this.Sadly I had to give this product a lower rating because the packaging is deceptive.  It leads the buyer into thinking they're buying the classic unedited versions.  I think consumers have the right to know what they're buying.  That said, assuming one goes into this with knowledge; it's not a bad buy if you don't want the bonus disk.  You can save a couple bucks and get the same films as the 2004 box set.That's my basic review of the product.  Now I'd like to say something that not many have said.  Although Lucas sais he will never release the Originals on a new format I think he's bending the truth for the sake of his plans for the films themselves.By telling the world he won't release the Original films, he's essentially starving the consumer.  In this way when he does decide to release them; it'll be a full blown sell out of every copy on every shelf.  As an independent film maker; he's taking a big gamble editing his classic films; which i think if done in a technically superior form of film crafting is better for the story and the films.  Regardless if we as the audience believe that; it's what Lucas believes.  He puts up his own millions to make this happen.  If he fails to sell, he bears all the damages.Eventually he'll be done editing the series.  He's even editing footage in the prequels, so none of it is sacred territory.  My belief is his goal is to make the six part series flow as a single body of work; it's supposed to be one movie according to his own words.  When it's all said and done, the OT may be all but consumed by the edited version.  But the unedited versions are still safe and secure in the Lucasfilm archives as well as the Smithsonian.Regardless of his financial success or failure in the future, releasing the Unedited OT is his ace in the hole.The point is; don't sweat it so much.  Ofcourse the classic theatrical versions of the OT will see the light of day again. We may not see it on DVD but perhaps BLUERAY, HDDVD or whatever format takes us to the next stage.Lucas isn't a moron; he's just looking out for his investments.  If he releases the Original Form now then he plays his best hand too soon, before all the chips are in.  The guy knows film history and can appreciate old films for historic and nostalgic reasons.  The films themselves are born of the power of myth.  If anyone understands how OT purists feel, he does.  Just give him a few years to finnish what he started.  In 2007 the series starts its' run in theatres in 3D.  My hunch is this will be the final version.  After that makes a financial recovery, there's no reason not to expect the Original Versions soon after.  It's a nice way to say goodbye to the series and move on to other things.	3.0	Be mindful of the future, but not at the expense of the moment	2006-01-27	11	7	4

0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	Quite possibly the most epic collection of science fiction stories ever made, it is the brilliantly designed brainchild of creator George Lucas. Telling the tale of the evil senator palpatine's rise to power and the legacy of the Skywalker family, you are wintered into a world where numerous aliens, planets, vehicles, droids, weapons, technology, and culture of a galaxy far, far away wrap your greatest imaginations in amazement.Episode IV: A New Hope - There's a lot of things I could say about this film, but I'm pretty sure most of you reading this have already seen this movie. The special effects are fantastic for this film even by today's standards, and the character development in this film is one of the best I've seen in years. The story will have you on an epic adventure of many proportions, so it's no wonder this film is still remembered even today. Although there are certain story elements that aren't really original and the story can get predictable at times, it doesn't ruin this film. George Lucas does a great job directing this film and has the story and special effects work together beautifully; the soundtrack for this film is superb. With so many great memorable scenes like the showdown between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or the classic flight scene with Luke Skywalker. This movie will have you cheering and begging for more after it's finished.Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back - The story gets a little darker with this film and has some very surprising plot twists. This movie not only surpasses the original, but is a great movie in its own right. The acting, directing, cinematography, musical score, and special effects are great, and compliment the story quite well. This movie will have on an emotional roller coaster that'll leave you gasping for more. With epic scenes like the showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader or the tragic end Han Solo faces in this film, it's no wonder why this film is considered the best out of all the Star Wars films.Episode VI: Return of the Jedi - What can I say about this third film? It's another masterpiece in movie history. The story can get a little cheesy at times with the ewoks and a bit predictable, but it doesn't ruin the experience. George Lucas not only produced a great story, but he also delivered another great musical score and special effects to back it up. The original Star Wars trilogy is one of the best movie series of all time with great moments like the final confrontation Luke has with Darth Vader and the Emperor or the touching love story with Princess Leia and Han Solo, so this movie series never stops being interesting. A true classic for any movie fan.Overall, the original trilogy is truly a masterpiece.My favorite character in this trilogy is definitely Han Solo.He's got this cocky, bad ass attitude that I like.I first seen these when my dad bought the trilogy on laserdisc in 1995.I loved these after since I watched them for the first time.After seeing the ORIGINAL films, this DVD box set took awhile to grow on me.As I watched Episode IV, I adapted to the changes.The picture and sound are phenomenal. The films look like they were made TODAY. Now THAT, my friends, is AMAZING.Lucas said he wanted them this way, so I guess everyone who wants these on DVD will have to accept that.He's never going to give us the originals, but these will do.	5.0	The (original) Star Wars Trilogy	2005-02-25	14	8	6
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	A112EFTALQ9G37	zak	"I will never buy this lousy excuse for a DVD collection.  The Lucas camp says that Star Wars is his vision and he can change it if he wants to.  I disagree!  From the time the first three films were made they belonged to our culture in their original form. The creation of  the ""Special Editions"" is complete infanticide.  To make Han shoot second, and above the table wipes away the opportunity for a powerful character transformation. That transformation the character of Han one of the most enduring of the trilogy.  Even my 2 year old knows that HAN SHOT FIRST! Hey while we're at it why don't we go back and erase the scar on Indiana Jones' chin?Let's not even get into the fact that Carrie Fisher, whom I think is great, is the only actor participating in the commentary.  I'm sorry but the Lord of the Rings Special Editions set the bar and even with Lucas on Chewie's shoulders he doesn't get close."	1.0	Lucas Strikes Flat	2004-06-22	22	10	12
0793906091	Star Wars Trilogy (VHS Boxed Set)	ANKZJHPUR4OJF	Zan	After seeing the prequels i was pretty exicited to see the rest of the story so I bought the trilogy set. Quite dissapointing. The old movies are nothing compared to the prequels as regards the special effects which ofcourse is to be expected. But I must say the acting in these movies is much better. The last scene in episode VI with Hayden Christensen is a nice touch. But the first two movies are a bit slow and they tend to drag a little. I would not recommend this series unless you want some prehistoric special effects, average acting and some humour or if you want to complete your star wars collection like me. The music ofcourse is classic John Williams.	2.0	Nothing compared to the prequels	2005-05-25	78	6	72

I DO think it's silly to re-do a film like Lucas has, but that's a secondary issue at best.  The ""special edition"" versions just aren't what I remember.  So special effects are better now than they were thirty years ago... DUH.  And BIG DEAL: it's all done by computers and for the most part aren't any more eye-fooling than the clunky old creative approches.  Many people just want nostalgia, which is one thing these discs don't offer.  Thankfully, my dad has the originals on VHS.  So I won't be able to blast them on some monstrously oversized and overequipped televison.  At least through them I can return to the innocence and youthful adventure that the films once represented.  Try getting THAT from technology.P.S. Anthony Daniels ""admits director George Lucas' fascination with special effects had overtaken storytelling in later films,"" according to Reuters.  The character and story-driven films are what really made the original Star Wars films ""special,"" not the visual effects."	1.0	Not gonna buy it!	2004-09-12	43	27	16

The movies are instant classics for adults and children alike. But I'm just not convinced I want to buy these, as they are not the pure, original theatrical versions. Instead, they are the blashemed ""Special Edition"" versions released a few years ago on VHS. The Special Editions changed a lot of fundamentals of the trilogy. The worst crime is changing the famous showdown in the bar between the rugged Han Solo and Greedo the bounty hunter; Lucas felt it made Solo too much of a bad guy to have him shoot Greedo first, so a badly re-edited version was put in the Special Edition where Greedo shoots first. Not only does it look horrible, it changes the essence of one of the best characters. This is where my conflict brews: should I purchase this edition or boycott it until Lucas puts the original, classic versions out on DVD?"	4.0	Conflicted	2004-04-07	2	2	0

I even like the new films, despite Jar Jar not dying yet.Remember the ""yub yub"" song at the end of ROTJ? I used to jump up and down and sing with the Ewoks when I was a kid. GONE! I put that DVD in first, and though GREATLY surprised, I could deal with most of the changes. But when I got to that ending, I was like, ""What the...?!?"" Now the song is cut out, so my nostalgic childhood memory of it is all I have.And I know, nobody told me to buy the new DVD set, nobody put a gun to my head and said ""buy it!""But the commercials lie! They say own the original! That's what I actually thought I was buying. I put my order in advance on Amazon when I saw the commercial. Maybe the die-hard fans who searched online news sites or whatever knew it was the edited version, but I just went by the commercial, which said, ""Finally own the original.""Now as a reasonable person, if the commercials had stated, ""Own the new-and-improved digitized version,"" I could not complain about this DVD at all, because it is pretty good. But the commercials said ""original."" That is misleading. Can anyone just admit that plain fact that the commercials were intentionally misleading? I would have returned it but Amazon was gonna charge me shipping!My feeling is, isn't there enough storage space on a DVD to include the special edition AND the original, untouched version? How many movies are out there where you have the option to watch the original theatrical release or the director's cut on the same disc? For the price, it's really inexcuseable that it's not included.Lucas, please just add a ""Original Theatrical Release"" track like a normal person, I don't care if it's digitally remastered or not."	3.0	Cherish the yub, cherish the yub...1977 version = original	2005-01-05	11	6	5

Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, ""It is finished..."".13. We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.14. Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side.Read my October 10th 2004 review for more.Comments?Email me: SuperSonicX@gmail.com"	1.0	The HELL with the special editions Part II	2004-10-15	61	31	30

As I wasn't born yet when the original movies were released, I've never seen the ""real"" ones. The only ones I've seen were this and the Special Edition. Simply put, if you saw the original movies in the theaters in 1977, you won't like this.For everyone else, (like me) it's problably the best thing that's happend to Star Wars in a long time. The effects have never been better. Other things were fixed as well. My favorite change is Boba Fett's (now done by Temuera Morrison)voice. It's more realistic, him being a clone. It also sounds cool. Another change is Ian McDiarmid's face instead of Clive Revill's. This, in my opinion, was for the better."	4.0	"not for  ""original fans"""	2005-12-12	6	2	4
