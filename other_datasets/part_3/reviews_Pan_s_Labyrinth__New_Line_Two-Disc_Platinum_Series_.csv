B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AX8UXTLF70B8Q	3-006	As many of you know, Pan's Labyrinth is the story of a young father-less girl (Ofelia) who is taken from her home by her mother (Carmen) to live with a Captain in Franco's regime (Vidal) whom she has married and whose baby she is carrying. The film took place in the 1940's during Franco's reign, the Spanish Civil War having ended several years before. The fascist Franco was an incredibly violent man with incredibly violent and sadistic men working in his government and, unfortunately for Ofelia, her new step-father, whom she meets for the first time in the early part of the movie, is one of those incredibly violent men. Vidal is stationed in a mountainous area in which bands of remaining insurgents are hiding out and attempting against all hope to someday overthrow Franco. Vidal's job as Captain is to root out these insurgents, or freedom fighters, and kill every last one of them. This assignment along with Vidal's character as a human being results in some very gruesome scenes, though many are virtually bloodless. The film ends on a surprising and surprisingly satisfying note, as the writer/director del Toro is able to achieve a spectacularly fitting ending for a spectacular story.Ofelia, completely oppressed by her cruel stepfather who does not want to have anything to do with her, uprooted, living in an unfamiliar place in the middle of the woods with no other children, observes acts of extreme violence and cruelty (the area being a virtual war zone) which occur routinely and become part of everyday life, but this is a life that she wants no part of. As a result, and due to her ravenous appetite for fantasy books and old-time fairy tales, Ofelia, already troubled and possessing an overactive imagination, finds an old stone structure in the forest nearby and her subconscious begins to create (although there are those who argue otherwise) a fantasy that allows her to escape her dreadful reality and provides her with hope. This fantasy world, I believe, is strictly the imaginings of a very creative yet troubled girl who is living in a horrible world and uses all the images placed in her head from all the reading she has done to subconsciously create a place where she is important, where she has the freedom to make choices and, ultimately, to be able to live in a beautiful world with a loving family and be happy.There have been some rumblings about the violence in this picture. It is R-rated for a reason and that reason is violence. It would not be good parenting to take a child to see Pan's Labyrinth, or most (if any) R-rated movies. This, to me anyway, is just basic common sense. Now, about the purpose and necessity of the violence...The acts of violence that occurred in this film happened in the thousands in the general period when the story took place. But it is not like the situation in Spain under Franco and during the Spanish Civil War is anything unusual. The world can and is and has been and will always be a terribly violent place that all too often affects the lives of children, perhaps even more so than that of adults. Every violent scene in the 'real world' of Pan's Labyrinth was necessary and helped explain a character or the time period. Any violence in the 'fantasy world', del Toro says was necessary as he was attempting to write a fairy tale depicted as they have been from time immemorial. We all know that such fairy tales are exceedingly violent and designed to give the listener chills. Most must be at least somewhat familiar with these classic fairy tales and the fact that they are often gruesome and horrific beyond belief. They were told to give the young listener the chills and shudders just like what Pan's Labyrinth provided to its adult audience.I also believe it was 100% necessary to show the Captain's facial wound because it allowed us to witness the unbelievable resolve of this individual. There have been countless men throughout history who have possessed this resolve and brutal determination that was shown with Vidal.I simply don't believe that any viewer can offer a decent or reasonable argument that the violence was unnecessary or gratuitous. I believe that many people found the movie sad and it left them depressed because they could not handle, on an emotional level, honest realistic storytelling. Should you be afraid to show this reality? Of course not. And if you don't want to watch or read a fictional story that contains these terrible realities then don't.As far as the look of the film, the non-cgi artistry that is exhibited in this movie is absolutely stunning. I think it is becoming a lost art in Hollywood and I fear that people like Stan Winston will be the last of the great make-up artists. This was such an exhilarating movie to watch on many levels, one of those being the visuals. I loved the contrast between the real world and the fantasy world and I found both equally captivating and exhilarating. As far as the acting ... all I can say is that it is phenomenal. I was amazed at all the performances, but Ofelia's was mind-boggling good.We are lucky to have been given the opportunity to watch such a great, artistic, stylish, well-written, well-acted film as Pan's Labyrinth that provides such a powerful emotional impact on the viewer. There are far too few films of such profundity and overall brilliance as this and I hope those in Hollywood reflect on this after they get back on their chairs after falling upon learning that it only cost approximately 5 million to create.Awesome entertainment, intellectually gratifying, this is the best movie I have seen in many years and one of my all-time favorite films. I cannot wait to enjoy it on several different levels again and again ... and again.	5.0	Sheer Brilliance	2007-02-15	20	15	5

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	`Pan's Labyrinth' is a powerful movie voyage that juxtaposes the horrors of war with an enchanting world of the imagination.  Set in Francisco Franco's Spain as his infant Fascist government comes to power,  the film takes place in 1944, while the Allies are defeating the Axis, and Franco is fighting guerrillas in exile.  Ofelia has felt the grip of both worlds.  A near adolescent, she is torn between the reality of war that has taken her father, and the portals of imagination that help her flee from harm. She has a brutal step-father, Captain Vidal, who has impregnated her mother, Mercedes, and displaced them from her familiar surroundings to a military stronghold in the country.  As complications come upon Mercedes' pregnancy, Ofelia is horrified to see her mother hemorrhaging.  An avid reader, her books start to come to life as the details of her new arrangement become more menacing.  Characters from an underground world, such as a faun, offer her adventure and  solutions to key problems above.  They are often linked to the world of reality with tangible portals, such as chalk, a book, and keys.  Walking sticks become fairies, and so forth.  In the meantime, the audience is given the full force of truth from which Ofelia is partly spared.  There's the business of war:  espionage, fighting, and torture.  'Pan's Labyrinth' effectively blends together a tale of innocence and cruelty where both worlds meet and have meaning.I couldn't help but think that this movie is an artful leap from the old `Calvin and Hobbes' comic strip with, obviously, more weighty subject matter.  I also am reminded of  PC adventure games like 'Myst' that propel players to different realms.  (Any of these comparisons are merely meant to be hints or suggestions.  The genius of this movie comes to fruition on its own terms.)  Pan's Labyrinth' has fine special effects, but don't expect to have a myriad of creatures jumping out at you on the screen like blockbuster films. This movie, rather, tells its story well and explores the worlds of reality and imagination in a special way that reflects upon both.	5.0	Pan's Portals	2007-02-03	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1NOLEWY3EBW01	683	"Everything about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (or ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is amazing. The special effects, the cinematography, the twisted-fairytale storyline, the acting, the theme song, etc. One word to describe this film would be ""epic"". It's like a thriller-fantasy-action-drama film with a tint of horror. It all blends in perfectly. It should have been nominated for even more Oscars than it did at the 79th Academy Awards, and even though it's in Spanish, it should have at least been nominated for ""Best Picture"". It's that good. I guess for somebody who's reading this review and never saw the movie probably already know the plot (the plot is in a LOT of the reviews that were written for this movie), so I don't have to explain.I love how the film takes place in 1944, the time of the Civil War. That time-setting was perfect for the movie. It also has a well-crafted beginning. It makes you know you're going to get a great fantasy-thriller film. As the movie progresses and it finally gets to the scene with the faun, it starts getting way more interesting. The special effects with all the creatures and insects and fairies were done extremely well. Also, the cinematography is beautiful. The most well-done scenes in the film is when the screen has a blue-ish tint to it, and the very colorful scenes. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" deserved the three Academy Awards that it got (Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup).The scenes with the ""tasks"" and the final 30 minutes altogether are intense and well-executed. The ending also has one of the best endings I've seen. It even makes me want to see the credits. The film is really that amazing. For any film lover who hasn't seen ""Pan's Labyrinth"", you need to see it!"	5.0	One of the best Spanish films of all time!	2011-04-01	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3W30R4VPU8O1E	"A. Chan ""A.Chan"""	"Pan's Labyrinth (Laberinto del fauno, El)Directed by: Guillermo Del ToroGuillermo Del Toro was born in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a  poignant film that takes place during the time of Fascist Spain of 1944 after The Spanish Civil War.  The movie opens with a fairy tale wherein a princess' father is the king of the underworld.  The princess becomes curious about the world above, and travels to the surface where she forgets about her life in the underworld and grows old where she dies as a mortal. The king believes that her spirit will come back to the underworld someday.The young heroin, Ofelia embodies the reincarnated spirit of the princess. She is brought into the life of her cruel stepfather who is the captain of the Fascist army.  She is continually fascinated by fairy tales and encounters many mythical creatures that summon her to complete three tasks so that she might return to the underworld.To be honest, I planned on only skimming this movie because it seemed so fantasy-esqe and that's not really my personal preference. But, I went ahead and watched the whole movie to my benefit. I found that it was actually action packed, emotionally evoking, sad/tragic, and carried a sense of realism parallel to its polar opposite fantasy world. Throughout the film, the plot was well developed by the characters. From the beginning, I recognized Ofelia was having episodes of hallucinations almost as a coping mechanism to deal with the stress of her ill mother, her cruel stepfather, and her undesirable living conditions.  These episodes are made clearer when she only experiences them at the absence of others, and confirmed at the end when she's seen talking to no one in the labyrinth.  When considering that this around-ten-year-old young girl is suffering from hallucinations, it made me realize how much she really wanted to be out of her current living arrangement.  She had created a fictional world (with the help of her avid reading of fairy-tales) to help her escape from her own.By understanding the cruelty of her stepfather coupled with the death of her most beloved person, her mother, it made me pity Ofelia.  She desperately seeked to have a parental figure in her life.  Mercedes, the head housekeeper/servant was the closest person Ofelia had to a mother, and to ""return"" back to the underworld to the King/her own father was her way of seeking a father figure since her biological father had passed away.  Obviously, her stepfather was no where close to a father to her as she continually denied him as a dad and only recognized him as ""the Captain.""Finally, the last portion of the film where Ofelia has one last fantastic hallucination just before she dies is quite poetic.  She finally completes the last of three tasks (shedding her own blood) to enter the kingdom of the underworld as a princess.  Here she is greeted by the king, her father, the queen, her mother, and the at first questionable, but later proven trustworthy faun, who are basically all her most beloved people she knew at this point in her young life.  From Ofelia's point of view, she merely transitioned from one life to another better one.  Her death is parallel of fantasy and reality.  In regards to fantasy, her death/shedding of blood was the best thing that could have happened to her.  In reality, it was extremely sad that her stepfather selfishly murdered her and the very fact that she had not even reached adolescence.  This reality struck me as terribly tragic.  The fact that this film could evoke such strong emotions from one its viewers makes me recognize this film as a great form of art."	5.0	Poignant Film	2007-06-12	7	5	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1LZUJF8AQ796R	ACRA	I have to say I was unaware of the film until now, shame on me. This was one of the most powerful films I ever saw. I am aware of the injustice of Franco's fascist regime, and  his ties with Hitler, but this was a vivd portrayal of how far people will go to protect their power and superiority. Really, kudos to  Director:/ Writer  Guillermo del Toro for his bold and courageous story, and to  Ivana Baquero for an amazing performance  portraying a young brave Ofelia. This is a gripping film, and although it is in Spanish with  English subtitles you never miss a beat, it gets your attention and holds onto you the entire film! In fact the native language only helps the drama. This is poignant, heartbreaking, inspiring and eye opening!A must see film, with a clear and urgent message, with all the fantasy, it is relevant now,  this is not fiction!

This is truly a great, dark fairy tale that deserves to be watched again and again.The only thing I don't understand is why the title was changed when it was translated into English. This movie has nothing to do with Pan. The literal translation of the original Spanish title is ""Labyrinth of the Faun."" Since the faun's name is not Pan, I don't understand why the change was needed.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ASXW7UQXGMNJL	"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author"""	This Spanish movie is billed as a fairy tale for adults and it is a grim fairy tale.Ofelia, an adorable nine-year-old who loves fairy tales, moves with her pregnant mother to a remote military base. Ofelia's father is dead and her mother has remarried a military captain in charge of the encampment. The Spanish Civil War is officially over but a band of stubborn guerrillas fights on in the hills.The Captain, one immediately perceives, is the epitome of the evil step-father. He's constantly cleaning his weapon and polishing his jackboots and when he's not doing that he's torturing prisoners and taking sadistic pleasure from it. He also doesn't care much for Ofelia.She escapes into a fantasy world which suddenly comes to life when a faun appears and tells her she is the lost princess of an underworld kingdom and can reclaim her crown by performing three tasks before the moon is full.What distinguishes this fairy tale from others I have seen is the juxtaposition of reality, in the shape of the war raging outside, Ofelia's mother's dangerous pregnancy and her own uncertain status in the captain's household, and the magical world which seems equally dangerous and treacherous. Rain is constantly falling throughout the movie, greatly adding to the mood of growing disquiet and menace. The captain is revealed as one of the most evil characters depicted on the screen for many a long day.The two world finally intersect in a chilling and shattering climax complete with overt Christian overtones. I will not give away the ending, which to me was the movie's one weak spot, but suffice to say that this is a film that will stay in your head long after the closing credits.	4.0	Grim fairy tale	2010-06-15	3	2	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1TUZL12O7X1A9	Alexander G.	This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the &#34;other world&#34;, metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.This is a brilliant movie.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3VSU2A28ZQGU6	Al	"Guillermo Del Toro first came into my knowledge on a horror movie retrospective that labeled his film ""The Devils Backbone"" as having one of the most scary scenes in horror. I saw the film and was pleasantly surprised by it's unique subject matter and well crafted sentimentality. I have since kept an eye out for his work and welcomed Pan's Labyrinth with eager hesitancy.Much like The Devils Backbone, the main protagonist of this story is a child set amongst the setting of 1940's revolutionary Spain. THis time, however, the main protagonist is a young girl, Ofelia, who is unwillingly being shipped with her pregnant mother to live with her militant step-father to be, who will also be the father of her soon to be born brother.Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale of the best kind. It has a dark undertone that makes it's presence known from the very first frame. In this case, the villian has been recast as the evil-step father with a blood lust that our heroine has yet to witness first hand.The introduction tells the tale of a princess who escaped to the real world and died among exposure to it's harsh elements. Her father, the king swore to bring her back when she was reborn in the real world and have her return to her rightful place on the throne.Young Ofelia, meanwhile, lives in her own fantasy world and buries herself in books of such tales to escape the horrors that the real world brings her. Only too soon do her two worlds collide and before long she is introduced to a malevolent Faun who tells her she is the Princess and that she must complete 3 tasks to return to the kingdom she left beind many years past.What makes this film work so well is that it keeps the two worlds well seperated while keeping them congealed at the same time. Each scene builds upon the next, each one conversing the previous as we go back and forth between the Step Fathers cruel military campaign to wipe out local Spanish Revolutionaries and Ofelias explorations into her fantasy realm.Doug Jones does a great job as the Faun, playing the role as a bit of a trickster. One moment whimsicle and curious, the next, brooding and intimidating. He plays a Master of Ceremonies of sorts as he introduces her to the tasks she must complete to make her voyage realized and gives her any aides she may need in order to complete them.As fun and inventive as these scenes are, I do wish they had been a little more  lengthy. We spend so much time awaiting her next step in the process only to have it be done within a few minutes. Perhaps this a testement to the wonderous creativity exhibited in these scenes. Alas, they are over way too soon and we, the viewer are left wanting more.As with any good fairy tale, the ending is very satisfying. There is room for debate as to whether there is a deeper meaning however I doubt it. I think it is meant less as an allagory for life and death and more one girls journey to her destiny. That could definitely be argued. And any film that can spark a friendly debate should not be overlooked. At it's heart though it is simply a fairy tale. If you know how to choose your words correctly you could actually get away with telling this story to a child....I say that with discretion, of course."	4.0	a haunting and enchanting piece of work	2007-01-19	7	4	3

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AVAHA06K08ZKK	Alwyn Lau	"A movie like Pan's Labyrinth - popular for its mythical creatures, weird fairies and so on - is enigmatically interesting because it's possible that the 'genre' (and thus message) of the movie changes according to the status assigned to said creatures.If the creatures were real, then it's Fantasy and all that this implies for a war-oriented movie. If they were NOT real, then one could say that the movie is essentially about psychosis, escapism, people 'dealing with' the horror of war, traumatic realism, etc. in which case the director del Toro would have to be conveying a different message entirely.Then again maybe del Toro left it to us to decide, thus creating the paradox scenario where we, the viewers, have a say in ""what kind of movie"" we're watching. Given a parallax move, we could even say we were watching two different movies entirely. Or, to push the envelope deeper, what if we were watching two movies enmeshed, hybridize and juxtaposed together thereby creating a ""third"" movie, NEITHER a war NOR fantasy movie but a movie where possibility is always in the making, where perspectives fluctuate and **where the undecidability of what is real is ITSELF a critical element of the reality we inhabit**??In a word, Pan's Labyrinth is about the significance of knowing but not knowing. Ofelia experiences the creatures and the satyr but can never know if she is being really helped or simply cruelly misled. In a heart-thumping scene, Ofelia has to retrieve a key from a child-eating monster asleep at a table and, despite being told not to eat of anything, goes on and consumes two apples resulting in the monster waking up and almost catching her. Doesn't this scene suggest that Ofelia has trouble deciding on the nature of the knowledge imparted by the satyr and, yet again, didn't her ambivalence almost prove disastrous? Carmen, her mother, knows that being with the Captain is a necessary move but also 'knows' it's not (so what is it that she really knows?). The Captain, despite being an seasoned war commander, didn't know that Mercedes and the doctor was a spy, or at least not until it was too late and he was given a 'Glasgow Smile' (a wound inflicted by Mercedes whom he had tied up but who released herself behind his back but right under his nose). In the end, of course, Ofelia 'learns' that she is the incarnate (but amnesiac?) Princess Moanna. Her knowledge of this fact both redeems and ends her life and then the story. Yet this leaves all the other characters in the dark (of knowledge). So we have a girl who achieves (some kind of) immortality via true knowing, a knowing which generates a final un-knowing or, conversely, a finality of un-knowing.The quasi-suspended nature of the ending only heightens the point that the movie was always about the irreducible double-seeing, un-seeing and perceptive indecision which fills our world. Del Toro has presented us with a striking red herring. He's made it seem like we have to decide if we're watching magical realism or simply a story of a girl with an over-stimulated imagination, when in fact *the act of choosing* is the very enigma we are expected to recognise, appreciate and, ultimately, live with."	3.0	Two Tales in One?

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ATDE9JYCPI0L1	Alyssa A. Lappen	A review that equated this film with a comic book made me leery of seeing it. But I am glad I overcame my reluctance at my mate's urging. Rather than the flat, two-dimensional work I expected, I was happily surprised by a masterful mixture of reality and fairy tale, at once enthralling, frightening and (at some moments) excruciating to watch. Despite the pain (in places), at others the film was entirely delightful.The story is told from the perspective of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) a 12-year-old bewitched by fairy tales,  understandably so, one soon sees: She misses her father, a tailor who died suddenly, and has become the unwilling child of Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez), the new husband of her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil), and the father of her baby brother. The scenery is lovely as Ofelia and Carmen drive in a line of security cars to their new rural home in the Spanish countryside.But Carmen is so ill the cars must stop en route, and Ofelia is attracted to an ancient stone, inhabited by a large noisy flying stick, which she immediately identifies as a fairy.Bur rural Spain in 1944 is very ominous, something that the flighty Ofelia intentionally escapes through her fascination with fairy tales. Very soon, she is living a fairy tale: the flying stick from the ancient roadside forest stone follows her mother's entourage to their new home at the farm by an abandoned mill.At night, when the entire household is asleep, the bug flies into the room of Ofelia and her mother, and transforms into a fairy, in earnest, who wordlessly leads Ofelia to a decayed stone labyrinth on the grounds. Upon descending a spiral staircase at its center, Ofelia meets her Pan, the Faun (Doug Jones) who tells her that she is a long lost, immortal subterranean princess, but must perform three tasks to prove herself worthy of coming home and retaining her immortality. Ofelia completes none of these tasks, all mucky and dangerous affairs, without great difficulty.But for every ugliness and obstacle Ofelia encounters in the Faun's fairy world, she faces an even harsher reality at the farmhouse. Ofelia's mother grows more and more ill, and the cruel Captain separates Ofelia from her mother. He instructs the attending physician, if it comes to that, to save the baby and let her mother die.Ofelia wanders about the farm grounds on her own, with no one to look out for her but Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;), the housekeeper who organizes the kitchen, oversees the store closets and seems to meekly attend to the Captain's every need.As Ofelia pursues her tasks, General Franco's fascist captain grows increasingly determined to crush the resistance still hiding out in the surrounding hills. But the ogres above ground are equaled by other ogres underground, and in the end, it is impossible to separate the tortured reality from the tortured fairy tale.Many readers consider fairy tales light, children's fare. In truth, such tales over the centuries have always helped people to conceptualize, and thereby conquer, their worst fears. In Pan's Labyrinth, there is a real cost to that conquest. Both in the fairy world, and in life.Also in both worlds, however, the film emphasizes the undying human determination to defeat fascism along with all accompanying death cults.An incredible work, a must see film.--Alyssa A.

Combining fantasy that winds its way like fingers of fog through very real circumstances, it is simply something that must be, as you would a painting at the Louvre, seen and witnessed. Some movies try so hard to be meaningful and beautiful; this film effortlessly does so. Even the mystical creatures seem real or at least possible in the world Guillermo del Toro has created for us; certainly the so-called real world in which our humble protagonist lives in might be viewed (fascist Spain) as just as unbelievable. So where do we draw the line between fantasy and reality? It is a difficult thing to do when one considers the fantastic horrors committed in the name of fascist Spain and, of course in contemporaneous (e.g., 1940s) Germany where so many died simply because they were who they were. Fantasy? Maybe. Maybe not. But this film weaves reality and fantasy into a world in which, perhaps, we might want not to live in. But did. I cannot recommend this film more highly. 6 stars.	5.0	FIlm As Art	2008-02-29	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1INNIFY58JOZO	"Amazon Customer ""kwill10"""	"I was very anxious to see this movie, as I had heard critical acclaim and thought the premise sounded very intriguing.  I have to say that I was disappointed.I knew the story was set during the Spanish Civil War and that it would be violent, sometimes brutally so.  I also knew that much of the film would not take place in the fantasy world created by the young Ophelia.  However, the title IS ""Pan's Labryinth"" after all, and the previews show almost exclusively fantasy scenes.  Thus, I thought it reasonable to expect that half or more of the movie would be fantasy-based.  In reality, only ~15-20 minutes of the two hour movie are fantasy, and in fact Ophelia nearly disappears from the story entirely for about half of the second hour.This point created a disconnect. The critics indicated that the story shows how Ophelia creates a fantasy world to escape the horrors around her.  However, most of the truly horrific scenes in the movie don't have Ophelia in them at all.  That made some of the violence simply gratuitous and distracting from the ""young girl creates her own fantasy world"" theme.  Also, the first two quests that are given to Ophelia by the faun don't really advance the main story in any way.  I felt the fantasy scenes were too disconnected from the rest of the story to be the central theme.If the central theme was intended to revolve around the horrors of war, then (aside from a different title and trailer) the movie needed to develop the backstory of the rebels--and perhaps even the captain-- better.  As it was, most of the violence centered around one ficticious captain, which again made the violence seem gratuitous.The movie was beautifully shot, and I found it to be well acted overall.  I can appreciate the effort, and I even understand how some people could find this film entrancing and enjoyable.  But, for me, it fell short in what I consider to be key: it lacked a central theme, seeming instead to be a collection of sub-plots that never fully developed themselves."	2.0	Too loosely tied together	2007-05-21	46	31	15

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2SLA0SXRQV8M0	Andres C. Salama	"1944. Spain has just come out of the civil war, and the fascist Franco regime is in power. A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in ""reality"" and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too ""arty"" for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	It's taken me some time to actually get around to seeing this film.  I've wanted to for a while now but haven't had the opportunity.  The other night I found the opportunity and took advantage of it; thankfully.  Now that I have finally seen this film (often rendered a masterpiece) I feel slightly more complete now.  No, `El Laberinto del Fauno' is not the most amazing film to have ever been released, but it does deserve a lot of the praise it has received for it is truly an astonishing work of art that is honest, personal and rich with humanity.I'm going to go ahead and yell SPOILERS right now so that no one can yell at me later for ruining the movie for them.  I often try to stay away from any plot points that `give away too much' but for me to commit to writing a review about this amazing film without touching upon the fundamental reasoning for my five stars would be a waste of time for me.  So; if you have seen this movie then by all means continue reading but if you have not consider yourself warned, for I am going to discuss the ending.The film follows a young girl named Ofelia.  Her mother is heavy with child and recently married to an army captain in Spain, circa 1944.  Ofelia possesses a quiet maturity that doesn't always serve her best interest, especially when relating to her new step-father Vidal.  Vidal is cruel and indifferent and repels Ofelia to the point where she finds herself immersed in a world not unlike the one she lives in yet with a magical new meaning.  Approached by the illusive Faun, Ofelia is given an opportunity to live forever if she completes three tasks, tasks that prove to be more tempting and dangerous than she expected.  The events taking place within Ofelia's new world (the labyrinth) parallel those taking place in the real world as her family life comes crashing to a turbulent end.With all its talk of immortality I found that the films primary focus was that of death.  When all is said and done Ofelia receives her reward in her own demise, finally leaving the violent world that has enslaved her to fear and being whisked away to a world anew (inside the afterlife) with her mother and father.  This to me is what makes the film so brilliant, for it wasn't until the films end where the pieces came together and the elaborate story became so much richer and rewarding.My only complaint about the film is that the dark and mysterious world of Pan's Labyrinth is no where near as engrossing as the real world in which Ofelia lives.  I really wanted del Toro's visionary world to be more intriguing but I found my interest fully invested in the real world surrounding Ofelia's fantasy.  That is really my only complaint, and it is a small one at that, for the film is never boring or uninteresting, I just expected my interest to be invested in another facet of the film.The acting is superb on all fronts, especially with regard to Ivana Baquero who delivers what may be the most richly fulfilling child performance in recent memory.  She captures the unbridled curiosity of a child while balancing her characters unfathomable maturity.  She delivers a splendid performance filled with honest emotion and believable innocence.  Sergi Lopez is flawlessly ruthless as Captain Vidal, a performance that is memorable in its brutality.  Maribel Verdu is also memorable, and I don't normally like her (at least I haven't taken to her as others have).  Doug Jones also deserves some recognition for his dynamic undertaking as both the Faun and the Pale Man.  He truly gets under the skin of these two creatures, bringing the brilliant costume and makeup work to life before our very eyes.  Ariadna Gil is effective as Ofelia's mother, but the other performances overshadow her for the most part.In the end I must say that `El Laberinto del Fauno' moved me.  It managed to reach into the pit of me and draw out raw emotion and contemplation I feel more complete now that I've released.  There is beauty within the tragedy of this story, a beauty that helps answer the questions we often ponder about life, death and the here-in-between.	5.0	This tragedy brings forth an unexpected beauty...	2008-09-10	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	Where do I start with this movie?  Pan's Labyrinth is a marvel of modern filmmaking.  From the enchanting story to the beautiful visuals, Guillermo del Toro's latest film is a modern masterpiece.  Set against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain, a fascist regime has come to power.  Those who don't obey the law are subjected to terrible punishment.Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is a girl who likes to get wrapped up in fairy tales.  They serve not only as a form of entertainment, but more and more, she uses them as an escape from the harsh realities of what has become of her home.  The film begins as Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the Spanish countryside to reunite with Carmen's second husband and Ofelia's step-father Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez).  Vidal is a firm believer in the fascist government; he follows orders without question and expects those below him to obey him.  When Ofelia arrives, she finds a rock with a design of a king carved into it.  When she examines it, a large dragonfly emerges.  Later, Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;), one of the house-maids at Vidal's cottage, points out an old labyrinth on the edges of the estate.After settling in, Ofelia sees the dragonfly again, and learns that it is in fact a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her through the labyrinth where she meets the Faun (Doug Jones), who tells her that she is a reincarnated princess of the Underworld.  The Faun gives Ofelia a magic book that will reveal three tasks she must complete in order to return to her kingdom.As she goes about trying to accomplish her tasks, Vidal and his soldiers attempt to stamp out the local resistance movement, which is the reason they are stationed in the cottage.  His preoccupation with erradicating his enemies overshadows Carmen, who is getting sick from the pregnancy.  In a moment of sheer vileness, he calmly tells the doctor attending to her to save the baby if he must choose between the two.  Vidal's cruelty is sickening; he brutally killed a father and son he believed were part of the resistance, only to find out moments after they were dead that their stories explaining why they had guns was in fact true.  During a torture sequence with a stuttering guerrilla, he mockingly told the man that he would be set free if he could count to three without stuttering.Meanwhile, Ofelia's tasks take her to fantastic places filled with dangerous and terryifying beasts including the Pale Man (Doug Jones), a cannibalistic humanoid with eyes in his hands.  Her interactions with the Faun are both beautiful and creepy; the Faun is terrifying yet gentle and Ofelia's lack of fear around him is interesting in that she is petrified of her step-father, Captain Vidal.  As the movie continues, the real world and the Labyrinth begin to come together, ending with a wonderful climax.In addition to the great story, the visuals and sound are phenominal.  The creature effects, especially regarding the Faun and the Pale Man, are incredible, and the costumes and set designs are beautiful.  The sound usage is incredible.  Most sounds are accentuated, from the squeeking of the leather in Vidal's uniform to the opening of umbrellas, seemingly trivial sounds break the silence of the times without any dialogue, of which there are many.  However, the scenes without dialogue add just as much to the story as even the most verbose sections of the film.  The characters' varoius motions and mannerisms speak volumes about them.  But possibly the most essential use of sound in the film is the haunting lullaby Mercedes hums to Ofelia.  There are no words to it, and the melody, which is supposed to help people sleep, is beautiful and haunting.If there is anything I would change about the film, I would add more scenes in the Labyrinth.  Every scene in the film is essential, thus no scene can go.  I would gladly sit through another 30 minutes of film to see more gorgeous scenes of the fantasy world.  If a film's only problem is that it wasn't long enough, that is an amazing compliment.This is one of the best films of 2006 (it was released in the US in 2007, but will be counted for the 2006 Oscars), and deserves every Oscar it is nominated for.  This film is a modern classic and a perfect fairly tale for adults.	5.0	Possibly the Best Film of the Year	2007-02-01	11	5	6

Zip	"After watching Pan's Labyrinth, I now really want to see The Lives of Others as it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and if it beat out this film it must be really, really good.  I hesitate to use the word ""masterpiece"" or ""future classic"" in describing this film, but what I will say is that I think it is perfect in the sense that director Guillermo Del Toro accomplished everything he set out to do when making this film: to create a spellbinding, visually stunning fairy tale for adults that operates and succeeds on multiple levels.  This is the type of film that after you watch it you'll want to recommend it to all your friends, even those who aren't into films.  Anyone who doesn't like it, well, if they don't like this you might just never recommend them a film again.My one and only criticism with Pan's Labyrinth is the violence.  I realize that Del Toro isn't making a ""kid's"" film with Pan's Labyrinth and that violence is an integral part of the tale he's weaving but he really seems to revel in it.  Because of this, it took me out of the film at times as I started thinking ""Is that really necessary?""Despite the violence, this film is a must-see in every sense of the word.

Well,Y Tu Mama Tambien...enough said.That said, I believe Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck'sThe Lives of Othersis the better film (the best film in at least five years, in my opinion), and deserving of its Oscar this year.  I'll also note that I was more than a little jarred by how unrelentingly violent ""Pan's"" was.  Sure, it depicts guerrilla warfare and it's hard to dress that up as happy chat, but - wow - when Sergi L&oacute;pez takes a broken bottle to the that guy's face, it literally left me shaken for the next ten minutes."	4.0	del Toro's creativity and detemination...with unexpected levels of violence	2007-07-02	0	0	0

You will know &#34;what it all means&#34; in the end, but each time you watch it, you will discover new meaning(s).  Well-deserved accolades for this transformative journey deep into where imagination rules, & offensive things happen, (or are vaguely hinted at, or the threat of potential offense lies somewhere in between implied & actual occurance)- unrestrained by mass-commercial influence.What a priviledge- To be transported into a REAL story, loaded with substantive meaning, morals & lack thereof, respect for human life & lack thereof, kindness, generosity of spirit, forgiveness... And lack thereof- A glaringly harsh, difficult to embrace at times, true work of art, open to endless interpretations.  Wer you raised on Disney?  (I was.)  Fix it.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1C1SKWYHRYA8Z	Anonymous	When Pan's Labyrinth first came out, my parents asked if I wanted to see it. Not having heard of it yet, I asked what it was about. They told me it was about the Spanish Civil War. As it turns out, saying that Pan's Labyrinth is about the Spanish War is like saying Casablanca is about the beginning of World War II. Although technically true, these summaries ignore the very essence of the movie. After they saw Pan's Labyrinth, they told me I really should have come and that it had a lot of fantasy elements, too. If only I had known that before...Anyway, I did eventually see the movie, and it was fantastic. The main character gives one of the best performances ever by a child actress, and the plot is fascinating and enthralling. The ending is ambiguous, leading to disagreement, but in a good way. The mix between the fantasy and the real brutality was well done, too. I adored this movie.	5.0	Wonderful	2011-09-05	0	0	0

The weaving of fantasy with reality was remarkable, the special effects were all in service of the film, the acting was brilliant, the script created characters you cared about and sympathized with... I really, really wanted to like this movie, it's so well crafted. Unfortunately, the movie flops in the one category where critics and award judges fear to tread: it wasn't enjoyable.Violent? Extremely, to the point where it really becomes an uncomfortable film to watch. The trailers for the film emphasize the fantasy sequences, but while the vile Pale Man's appetite for babies is implied by paintings and a pile of tiny shoes, it is the horrific violence of the girl's stepfather that is unbearable and weighs the film down. The cruelty of this character was so far beyond what was needed it was beginning to border on the ridiculous --- but the tone of the movie is too oppressive to allow a laugh.I'm okay with the ending of the film. As with ""Brazil,"" I care less about a happy/sad ending than whether or not it's a sensible ending... and this worked. But getting there was an effort.When my wife and I got home, she went into the bedroom and sobbed: it was that unsettling. Now, it takes talent to get an audience to feel something... but if this was what the director wanted from his audience, there's something screwy. This wasn't billed as ""Schindler's List,"" so we weren't expecting a heavy-handed lesson on human cruelty.As entertainment, this film is a disaster. But I'll give it two stars, just for being a high-quality punch in the face."	2.0	Best Movie I Ever Hated	2007-01-29	40	16	24
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2QC6PABAQCZN	"Anonymous ""writetothefinish"""	"I have to say I am surprised by those reviewers that dismissed this movie because of the violence, and I disagree about the ""shock value""  of the scene. There was only one truly brutal scene, shot in the dark, and more suggestive than graphic.  The rest of the violence is reflected mostly in Vidal's threats, since by then we know what he's capable of doing. Also, few make mention of the magnificent acting which humanized the sadistic character of Vidal, and of the artistic rendering of the fairy world, which fortunately leaves Disney-esque cuteness behind and is rather reminiscent of Dali's disturbing surrealism.I think the best part of the movie was the intricate storyline, the juxtaposition of two parallel realities, and their relationship to one another.  I'm not one to appreciate ambiguous endings, but in this case, the choice the viewer has to make is resonant with the message of the film: the choice between fanatical ideology, (which has no trouble destroying lives because it does not see living beings, but embodied ideas), and the creative power of imagination and compassion, which is dismissed as surreal by those who see the harshness of life as ""practical"" and even ""pragmatic"", is posed before us on the most subconscious level in every moment of our lives.  Thus at the end the viewer is invited to make this choice for him/herself: the two ""realities"" are fatally incompatible and may never co-exist.  The ending transcends the gimmick and instead touches us personally, because when we question Ophelia, we learn that we, too, have already made the worst of the two choices, that we have already chosen by default to inhabit Vidal's cruel and indifferent reality.  We mourn not for Ophelia, but for the loss of our own innocence, for the sacrifice of our imagination to the demands of pragmatic life.  The film could have easily been maudlin and cliched, but it managed instead to be achingly lyrical.  As for the brutality of the sadist, it is a necessary contrast to the fantastical world of fairies: it is the appropriate moral opposite.  In fact, when I think of the brutality of an idelogical war, I think the movie was mild by contrast to reality.This was a beautiful film, and I'm pleasantly surprised to see that it touched the shores of the mainstream in spite of the fact that it is subtitled."	5.0	Lyrical and poignant	2007-06-30	7	2	5

And this not not recommended for family viewing (did you not notice the R-rating?). Actually this fits the description of a ""gothic movie"". A true gothic movie features a heroine who suffers at the hands of a male villian. The atmosphere or mood of the film is bleak (usually involving a dark house). The resolution of the story can sometimes end tragically (but the heroine usually comes to a moment of catharsis). The supernatural elements in the movie is provided through the power of Ofelia's imagination (or is it?). Anyway I would think fans of Gothic literature would be more fascinated by this movie then fans of fantasy novels.

But on the other hand when I try to recall some and primarily From Dusk Till Dawn comes to mind, I start thinking it's not a bad idea after all. So although you can call Pan's Labyrinth whatever you want - a fairy tale, a war drama, a fantasy or a Harry Potter for adults - it's neither of the above. This movie exists out of any genre and that's almost always a sign of a good picture.Ofelia comes along with her mother to a remote mountain village in the Northern Spain where mother's new husband is waiting for them - a sadistic captain Vidal who, after general Franco had taken over Spain, was directed to the rural fort to fight guerillas. In one of the nights Ofelia, who lives in her own imaginary world, meets Pan from a fairy tale who tells her she must accomplish three tasks so that the fairy tale kingdom he's from can go on.And so the action begins. Half of the film looks like real life where captain and his soldiers are tracking down guerillas in the woods and fighting them. Another half is Ofelia's adventures in the world that looks not so real. But who knows - you'll be waiting till the very end of the film to discover whether it was real or just a creation of Ofelia's imagination. So you have a salad of fantastic creatures, hidden underground world a la Alice in Wonderland, and cruel fights between captain's soldiers and partisans. But it only looks like salad from the first glance. When you take a closer look everything becomes pretty plain and clear with no fairy tale nonsense.The fairy tale part is rather dark and frightening. Ofelia comes across not very pleasant creatures and finds herself in places that are not very sweet. The episode with a child-eater who has eyes in his palms is pretty creepy and disturbing especially for a small girl to bear. But at certain point you start wondering: what is scarier - this fantastic stuff or events that surround Ofelia in ""real"" life? People are being tortured and killed around her, she has to see all kinds of atrocities that her stepfather commits and she has to live in this atmosphere of suffering and madness all the time. No surprise she choses a fairy tale evil. Here Guillermo Del Toro compares and shows us the difference between these two evils and comes to a conclusion that even the most intricate and sophisticated mind can't invent things that happen in real life. Real life evil, real life vice are more dreadful and more abysmal than anything we can ever imagine. Child's mind of Ofelia tries to escape the things she sees around, she seeks shelter in a fairy tale, but it turns out you can't run far...Pan's Labyrinth is utterly violent and what's most disturbing all the violence is shown through the child's eyes - it's not shaded, not sugar-coated, it's the way it is - simple and cold-blooded. The way soldiers are being finished off with a shot in the head after a fight, the way people are tortured (no hard feelings - just to get information) makes you shiver, and I wonder what a child must feel observing all this. Pan and fairies are only an excuse here, this ain't no fairy tale. Pan's Labyrinth is a thoughtful and serious story of growing up and trying to stay sane in the madness of the world. It's one of the most interesting, bizarre, sad and magical pictures I've seen lately. Surely not to be missed."	5.0	FAIRY TALE IS JUST A CLOAK; LOOK DEEPER	2007-01-03	14	10	4
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3I389XOSTO0F9	"Antonio Palacios ""Gimme music!"""	"I went to the theater two weeks ago to see this movie. What a good luck! the theater was almost empty so I could enjoy the projection without interruptions... especially the blabbering beneath my back. Lucky now we have the DVD to watch the movie in our houses without being disturbed.One thing I noticed in the first minutes of the movie is the confrontation between the magical world and the real world. Ophelia (a great performance of Ivana Baquero) is in a quite situation. She has to live wth her sick pregnant mother under the ""protection"" of a wicked army's captain (believe me, he's the devil) but also this magical world she always dreamed of. So she have two missions in his young life: To be a good girl, protect and try to please her mother, and complete que Pan's quest in order to gain her passsage to a fairy world. This juxtaposition of visions are what make this movie so amazing. We're not assisting a happy Disney film here. Even in the magical world we have troubles and things that are wrong and terrible (the dying tree, the feast guardian, the sacrifices) Just like the real world with this civil war, spies, and pain. Ophelia alternates between this two universes while the rest of the people is unaware of what is happening to her.Violence is pretty explicit and maybe will cause some viewers to turn their heads. Don't avoid to see the film because of this thing.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ARA48345JZPZR	Archmaker	"This remarkable film about the power of imagination to transcend the arbitrary cruelties and injustices of the ""real"" world is itself a powerful and wonderous expression of Guillermo Del Toro's considerable imagination and creativity.  Having no preconceptions, I was drawn into this beautiful and dark vision of the intersection of reality with myth much as a child tentatively enters the brooding and foreboding forests of the Brothers Grimm.  I was surprised at the courageousness and honesty of the story's unflinching depiction of the cruel Captain and the frightening places the young heroine goes in her imaginative quest.This is a beautiful film to behold, with a wonderful use of color amid evocative production design with just the right touch of CGI.  A savagely lush tale frought with tension and ultimate tragedy.  I had no idea where it was going and was greatly touched by, to me, an unexpected resolution.  A thoroughly original and brilliant conception, delivered with great care and intelligence.  I first noticed Del Toro with the film Mimic, and thought the guy has some good chops.  I had no idea that the man would be capable of such a strangely beautiful mythic tale, a fairy tale of monsters, human and other worldly, transcended.  A one of a kind film, well worthwhile."	5.0	A darkly beautiful Original...	2007-07-06	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2XXV9HF169LCF	A. Trotter	If you watch this movie and do not sniffle, you might not be human. It's not a happy movie. As a friend said, it can be a bit brutal. But it is also graceful, full of wonder and strangeness. It's sad and lovely and creepy.Don't worry; there are no spoilers here. You learn almost all these facts in the first few minutes of the film.This is the story. It's about a little girl.This is the other story. It's also about a little girl.In the first story, the little girl is the daughter of a tailor. He father is dead and her mother has remaried, and they are going to live with the new husband in his home in the woods.In the other story, the little girl is a princess, daughter of a king who rules below the ground. She envies sunlight and flowers, and runs away to the mortal realm above her head.In the first story, it is World War 2 and the little girl's new father is a Captain in Nazi Spain. Her mother is pregnant with his child, a son. He guards the valley through which the trains run from his headquarters at the old mill.In the second story, the princess dies above ground, old and cold and far from home. And her father says: her soul will come back to us in some other way, and we will wait until the end of time for her.In the first and second stories, there is a dark old labyrinth in the woods, near the old mill....In this story the fair realm the tailor's daughter wanders upon is as dangerous, as strange and difficult to navigate as the real world; there are monsters a plenty, and the fairies are not sweet children with wings. Trust is as strange and thorny there as anywhere, and promises have weight and texture.  Even the tales she tells in the real world for her own comfort, her fairy tales, have no happy endings; just prickly questions and loose ends that sit inside your mind and make you a little uncomfortable. Her fairyland is the fairyland that folks once knew, where punishment for laziness and pride lurked around every corner and stupidity would definitely get you eaten.	5.0	Amazing...	2007-09-24	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A278F98P04C6TM	B. Adler	"There are few movies like Pan's Labyrinth and although grim, worth sitting through to the bitter end. It's a very dark movie, dressed up in a fairy tale to tell a story about the cruelty of war, particularly on children. Without giving away spoilers, that's what I ended up getting out of it. From that aspect and not just the special effects, it's a riveting film and really worth seeing.It won three Academy awards that were mostly for the visuals, art direction, cinematography and makeup. Guillermo del Toro's direction is superb. The acting is terrific, too.The ratings here of 1 or 2 are because of the violence, and I do get that, although the most gory is the first scene. The rest isn't as repulsive. It's more psychologically frightening as the movie progresses, not visually. If your squeamish (I am), prepare to hide behind your hands.What kept me from walking away from it was the story. The film is set in Spain 1944, near the end of WWII and Franco's reign. In Pan's, a small troop of Franco's soldiers, commanded by the evil Captain Vidal (well, he's a fascist-dictator sort) are trying to drive out a band of anti-fascist rebels. The story, of course, is fiction, but based on the real life circumstances of that time. Franco was a Nazi sympathizer, after all. And people did flee to the forest to get away from him and his armies.I thricely uttered, ""Why am I watching this?"" during the film! It's not a happy film. But del Torro has something to say about war, life, death and immortality and how the most innocent copes with the pain of it."	4.0	A deeply disturbing film that you'll probably love	2012-04-29	1	1	0

I won't bore you with a repetition of what has been said many times in previous reviews, but I will reiterate the observation that this is really, in many ways, two separate movies.One is a dark, brooding, mysterious and excellent allegory about good and evil, innocence between corrupted by (or at any rate confused and beguiled by) evil. I was fascinated by this portion of the film, with its superb characterizations, acting and special effects.The other movie is a brutal, sadistic and overly graphic depiction of torture and killing. To linger almost lovingly over these scenes is NOT my idea of good movie making. A good film maker can deliver the same impact without the gore. This is the part of the film I hated. Unfortunately, it ruined the total effect for me and, frankly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone.	3.0	Loved it ... and hated it	2007-05-31	18	5	13

There have been portals open for years to bring her back to her kingdom, but before this happens, she must perform 3 tasks, to prove her immortality.Without making this too long and giving the whole storyline away, I will say that her quest leads her to the most visually stimulating scenes I have ever seen onscreen.They are terrible and wonderful all at the same time.There are creatures that eat fairies and babies...creatures who have eyes in thier hands, and places so over the top, I can't even imagine how the scenes were created...Beyond all the beautiful visuals though, there lies a very sad story of a lonely innocent girl that is quite touching...This is how Fairytales USED to be at the turn of the century,how  they SHOULD be..until Hollywood RUINED them, just like Alice in Wonderland was ruined, and ""Disney-fied"" as one reviewer put it.I purchased this DVD when it first came out, and have watched it many times since, and will watch it many more.It is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you in tears.Highly reccomended for adults and older children...NOT for smaller children !!"	5.0	An enchanting adventure of the heart	2007-10-10	3	2	1

Very brutal (for me a negative), but still interesting.  The fantasy parts were mediocre.  Some of the concepts were interesting, but the monsters were pathetic.  I called over my kids so they could laugh at the Pale Man.  Boy, he was scary, and real fast and muscular.  LOL.  The reason he eats very young children is slightly older kids would simply out run him, or even beat him up.  What a wuss monster, it reminds me of some from the worst Sci Fi monsters, like Robot Monster.Maybe I didn't like the movie as much because I had high expectations, and this is mediocre.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	I do NOT recommend children watch this movie.  What starts off as innocent fun quickly turns into extreme violence and severe swearing.  They say the F word a couple times, and there was one violent moment in particular that made me sick showing a soldier bashing a guys face in (including close-up shots of blood pouring from his face).  It was the biggest surprise of the plot, and I mean that in a BAD way.It's supposed to be a film about fairy tales.  The war storyline is what I originally thought to be a creation as a way for children to look away from the real-life nonstop violence and find a happy place in the land of fairy tales.  Unfortunately the fantasy land the little girl in this movie explores is filled with lots of blood and a twisted, disgusting atmosphere. The war story may be unrelated to the fantasy segments, but both stories are really violent and inappropriate for children.Some of the monsters in this game reminded me of those in video games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2.  Probably a coincidence.  Especially that one monster sitting at a dinner table who didn't like it when the girl ate some grapes off the table and then proceeded to run after her.  He had eyes in his hands, just like that big monster in Resident Evil 2 had eyes in his arms.Adults who like war movies won't find enough detail to keep them interested, and children who like fantasy elements will probably be too disgusted to really find the courage to watch Pan's Labyrinth all the way through without getting nightmares.  I have no idea what kind of person this movie was intended for.	3.0	strangely appealing	2007-08-18	8	2	6

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ACJ824J7LU12T	Beppo	"Pan's Labyrinth is a profoundly historical movie; Not only the interesting back ground the director superbly creates but also the implication of historical continuity the director skillfully proffers to audience through the destiny of various characters in the movie. Indeed, it is so rare that you encounter such a beautiful movie armed with stunning visual , superb acting and intelligent plot in recent years; holy trinity of movie making. Furthermore, the plot does not abuse usual deus ex machina type of device that have been abused by numerous screen writers in this genre of movies.Pan't Labyrinth is not ""Fable"" or ""Fantasy"" movie,nevertheless the role of Pan is the nexus between the reality and psychological world of Ofelia.In fact , the movie is terribly realistic and based on the nightmarich past that deeply embedded in the psyche of Spaniards who went through the civil and its more than three decades of nightmare. Yes, it is the movie that converges the reality and fantasy at the last scene that is both climax and anti-climax of the movie .The movie is a heartwrenching tradegy . I don't only mean the trageic destiny of Ofelia but almost every charaters of the movie. There is easy to catch pararell between Ofelia and her new born brother,begotten by Captain Vidal, the archetype of European nihilism and sickening sadistic fascist and the son of  one of Africanos(those who fought in Rif war in Moroco such as Franco ,Queipo de Llano,Sanjuro,Yague) and Mercedes and her brother Paolo. All of their destiny is bleak and tragic. However, Ofelia's refusal of Pan's offer provide the glimpse of hope , otherwise terribly tragic and depressing ending.It's my interepretation ,but Del Toro doesn't take a left-leaning perspective in this movie. The most obvious example would be the pale one eye monster scene and Ofelia's task. It skillfully shows revolution and the reason of failure;Avarice . And how avarice leads a revolution to blind destruction and bloodshed. 3 key hole symbolize three dominant left idelogiy during the war (Socialism, Anarchism and Communism)It is not a light hearted family movie that children can enjoy.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A20EEWWSFMZ1PN	"bernie ""xyzzy"""	Director Guillermo del Toro out did himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the results of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is really one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.It is 1944 Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, is the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze or are they figments?You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. In addition, there are always more surprises waiting.The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categor&iacute;a Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.This is one of the films that take good advantage of Blu-ray resolution and intensity.Bridge to Terabithia [Blu-ray]Pan's Labyrinth	5.0	In your hands is your destiny	2013-05-29	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3TUNGAU37KSQI	Billy Pilgrim	I understand that most people would like this movie to be all about the fantastical side of moviemaking, however that is not the point of this film. The point is that as children, we do believe in the possibilities of magic,fairies, beautiful kingdoms in far away lands (I suppose you could say as children we believe in any possibility), however the 'harsher' brutalities of life (can, and sadly usually do) erode our sense of wonderment. Adults confirm and transmit limitations of thought (onto children and themselves) and these thoughts and actions  'create' the world around them.The balancing of this, I believe, is brilliantly portrayed through this film. For instance, the serene beauty of the woodlands(I'm refering to the way this is shot with the petals blowing through the air, and the rich sepias and greens) is not even noticed by the adults, and it is only the child who 'notices' the stone markers. Honestly, Pan's Labyrinth is not a 'feelgood' movie, yet it is not intended to be. Pan's Labyrinth is a darkly entwined reflection upon the force of belief and what some refer to as morality, the 'reality' we choose to believe in and participate in. As far as the movie being 'slow' or 'boring', I found the movie anything but that, as the charachters were engrossing and the balance of the 'fantasy' and the 'reality' well paced.	5.0	What you believe in	2007-07-27	5	4	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AIMR915K4YCN	"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby"""	"I knew what I was getting into before watching PAN'S LABYRINTH. After all, it is rated R, and billed as an ADULT fantasy / thriller. Consequently, I realized that I wasn't going to see THE NEVERENDING STORY 3 or FREE WILLY 10. What I wasn't prepared for was just how wonderful this movie actually is. Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) takes us into a real, living nightmare, in the form of war and the evil men who profit by it. Within this hellish world, a girl named Ofelia (along w/ her ailing, pregnant mother) is forced to live w/ her stepfather, a spanish captain in Franco's fascist army. Ofelia's mind splits off into the safety of her imagination, allowing her to live her life as a girl on a mystical quest, rather than as a prisoner. She enters a stone labyrinth on the captain's property, leading to a spiral staircase, taking her down into the bowels of the earth below. Ofelia meets a faun (a goat-headed chap) who tells her of her past and her destiny. He also gives her a magical book and three tasks to accomplish. Reality and fantasy smear together as Ofelia's adventure becomes increasingly horrific. While Ofelia's stepfather murders the leftists he detests, and her mother grows weaker, Ofelia must accept greater challenges in her dreamworld, including the amazingly terrifying ""baby-eater"" monster! This thing is one of the best critters I've seen since HELLRAISER! Very disturbing to look at! I wouldn't want it coming after me! Ofelia draws on strengths she is unaware of, and overcomes ordeals that would cause most adults to wilt. I found PAN'S LABYRINTH thoroughly engrossing in it's use of imagery and symbolism to bring reality and nightmare together. I was afraid for Ofelia both in this world and the netherworld. Still, I found the ultimate message of life after death / good overcoming evil to be uplifting. Nope, this isn't G-rated family fare. However, it is a tremendous morality tale for grown-ups...

We are all Ofelia, the naive child struggling to survive in a world ruled by psychopaths! Sergei Lopez delivers a stunning portayal of psychopathy, emotionless, narcissitic, completely lacking a conscience - he represents our system of governance and how it is completely infected by psychopaths.The fairy tale aspect of the film is raw and real.

I actually hated how they ended the movie and disliked how I suffered through the whole thing WHILE paying to watch it.All in all, don't watch this if you have a weak stomach, dislike drama, and very dark tales. This is one of those I don't recommend to children under the age of 15."	2.0	Very Dark Tale...	2007-04-04	43	2	41
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"Prepare to be immersed in PAN'S LABYRINTH, the excellent adult fantasy film by Guillermo del Torro. Note the words ""adult"" here, because this is not something parents should take their little ones to see. Although stunningly beautiful in presentation, it holds back absolutely nothing when focusing on the barbarism of mankind. This includes gunshot wounds to the face, the sawing off of infected limbs, or the torturing of one's enemies.Set against the backdrop of 1944 Spain, Generalissimo Francisco Franco has his forces set to squash any rebels prepared to inflame Spain into civil war. Into the woodland areas of Spain's countryside is sent Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), a commander so selfish and heartless as to kill anyone or anything that gets in his way. This is immediately noticeable when his unhealthy and pregnant wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) is sent to live with him at this distant wooded post. Vidal cares not that she's ill and shouldn't be traveling in the late stages of pregnancy, but only wants his son born where his father can see him. With Carmen comes her preteen daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the daughter from a previous marriage in which the father died at war.The unabashed horrors of war are close to Ofelia and her mother's new war post home. Ofelia, feeling helpless and frightened, goes off into the woods and discovers strange runes and eventually an old stone labyrinth of indeterminate age. Soon a faun appears and discloses some interesting information to Ofelia: she is the princess of a lost underworld, a world of immortals where her father-king awaits her return. But in order to find her way back to this wonderland, she must accomplish three tasks in short order.But as the battle with the independent fighters draws near to the human world, the tasks set for her in the magical become nearly insurmountable ...and more dangerous.The question as to if Ofelia is truly a princess or not is completely left up to the viewer to decide. Whether all of the fantastical elements in the film were solely a part of Ofelia's imagination -- and a way to get away from the horrors of the war -- or were real are never given over to the audience. A definite high point for the movie.Pulling from Greek mythology, the faun (played by Doug Jones) is Pan, a half-goat, half-human, better known as a caretaker of woods and shepherds, and also a bit of a trickster. When we first meet Pan we're told that fauns ""aren't to be trusted."" Usually a wise thing when dealing with the unknown. Added to this problem is the dark nature in which we find Pan. He's in a tomb-like structure, full of shadows and decay. It's also noteworthy to mention that Doug Jones plays a double-role in the movie, as both Pan and Pale Man, a freakishly dangerous creature with eyes in its hands.Spinning the audience between the brutality of war and the beautifully surreal world Ofelia explores, the merging of the two comes to a close in a most satisfying way. But it's an adult way, not a fairytale one. Pan's Labyrinth isn't designed to be a feel-good flick. It's a historical recounting of the Spanish Civil War and what one young girl's reaction to it might've been.The film is a foreign language flick (Spanish) and subtitled, forcing those of us who aren't Spanish speakers to pull our eyes away from the sumptuous sets and down to the bottom of the screen; a necessity but still bothersome considering the extreme high quality of the sets.Young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia deserves all the award nods she's sure to get. Her performance was truly outstanding, making movie watchers cringe whenever she's in danger and applaud when she succeeds with one of her tasks. Her tough choices are felt more than seen, making us care about her all the more as she wanders into unfamiliar and potentially dangerous terrain. That she has to make tough decisions for such a little girl will cause many-a-viewer to reach for the Kleenex box.Because of these terrible decisions forced upon Ofelia, the audience is left to ponder one important thought: Caught between the stark beauty of a (possible) magical world and the brutality of human warmongering, which would you choose?"	5.0	The Brutal Beauty Of It All	2007-01-21	9	6	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AJ6A4QYZRMG0C	B. Middleton	This is an elegant and beautifully made movie - a wonderful and intriguing story surrounding the innocence of a young child's dreams while in the midst of a horrific and chilling environment.  The characters, storyline and cinematography are breathtaking. Yes, it is a foreign film with subtitles, but don't let that stop you from buying this incredible and enjoyable movie.  Be forewarned, some scenes of this story are not suited for young kids or for the faint of heart, as there are gruesome, violence and dramatic scenes. Still, it's a heartwarming story where you'll be pulled into the innocent and adventurous thoughts of a child, clinging to all that is magnificent and playful. Good luck on keeping a dry eye at the end of the movie.	5.0	Beautiful Story	2008-05-31	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M	Book & Music thief, from HI	"Pan's Labyrinth is a truly Unique, one-of-a-kind film.  It is hard to describe exactly what `genre' it represents = part horror/ suspense, part fable/Fantasy, part historical drama, part political thriller, part `coming-of-age' film, while completely imbued with that feeling of `Magical' realism, particular to Literature/films originating in South America/ or wherever the Spanish Language Exists!  This film was directed by the extremely imaginative Mexican filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro (who had already done the terrific `Hellboy'  and `Blade2' and 'the Devil's Backbone'). Pan's Labyrinth is very ambitious, in its wide-ranging scope, and philosophical viewpoint.  In terms of a perceived core `message' it actually shares some commonalities with the recent `Book Thief' movie = i.e. Even in the Darkest of times, and cruelest physical environments, traces of genuine  `humanity' can still be found, and even flourish, to some degree = if we know exactly `where to Look' (this is even a specific Line, in Pan's Labyrinth's End narration).  And again, as with the `Book thief' this film mainly concerns the moral choices ordinary human beings are faced with (in extraordinarily harsh/and unsympathetically evil times - in this case, the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930's), and the significant consequences of these fateful choices.  But, if this all sounds overly `serious' and didactic, let me assure you, Guillermo del Toro is such a masterful filmmaker - and Visual Arts Wizard - that the wildly creative/imaginative presentation of this Film, will literally `blow you away' (akin to a darker vision `Wizard of Oz' and especially `Alice in Wonderland' making Tim Burton's version, seem quite tame by comparison - and produced on only about 1/10th the Budget!)  I really can't praise this Film enough!  You need to see it, to fully understand - it can't be adequately described in mere words!additional note: this film is in Spanish, with subtitles - but after a short while, you don't even notice - as it `pulls you right in' to its fantastically weird World!!  Warning:  it does contain some scenes of graphic violence (doesn't hold back - definitely not for kids).Trivia:  I think this film was at least partially `inspired' by the Classic, and painfully `haunting' Spanish Film, ""Spirit of the Beehive"" by Victor Erice = an even more `surreal' film, full of cryptic symbolism (reflecting the same historical time period) with hardly any dialogue, but with Lasting/ searing images, that will never leave you!"	5.0	Fantastic/ Unique Film-making Artistry, of the Highest Degree!!!

"Okay, I don't know about the rest of you, but I was left with wanting Ofelia to discover more of the labyrinth and deal with more evil, shady characters. To be honest, my attitude towards Pan went from skeptical to acceptance. I honestly, thought Pan was out to get Ofelia as if he were the Devil incarnate.I give it 5 stars because it's truly an original and imaginative film, but I was disappointed we didn't encounter more ghouls and ghosts within the labyrinth and see more of the labyrinth. The story focused too much on the captain and his brutality rather than Pan's labyrinth.It was 2 stories within 1 film. On the one side, you have Ofelia's step-dad, a cruel Spanish captain, and on the other hand, you have Ofelia, a young, innocent child who is trying to escape the terrible events that surround her at every corner.This is an interesting film, but not for the squeamish.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2IGYM7K8MFJRC	Bo stergaard Jepsen	"This is definitely a movie to watch, no doubt about that. The sinister and twisted fantasy world of Guillermo del Toro and a good performance from the cast makes this a movie to remember.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is very dark, with the setting of the old mill in a big, dark forest and the mood being set very effectively with creative lighting and a haunting score. Also the villains of the movie add to the darkness of the film, the captain being nothing less than evil incarnate, displaying cruelty and absolutely no feelings. The film is very violent and bloody, a fairytale for adults indeed.The story resembles that of basically any fairytale of the brothers Grimm or HC Andersen, containing the number 3, tests/quests, fairies, toads, and evil as well as good. The fantastical parts of the story are finely interlaced with the action of the real world and the two ultimately blends together seamlessly. Whether or not the whole story has been nothing but the imaginations of the little girl Ophelia or it is real is up to the viewer to decide.I would have liked a bit more exploring into the background of the captain though. I think the character of the captain is a bit two-dimensional. You only get that he's cruel and concerned about his legacy.I also think that there is one instance where Ophelias actions are irrational and out of character (see [SPOILER]below).Other than that, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is top notch. Highly recommendable.[SPOILER] When Opehlia is told not to eat anything when she goes to pick up the dagger in the underground hall she eats the grapes anyway. I really feel this was put in only to show off that eyes-in-hands-creature. It really seems unnecessary and irrational to me."	4.0	Dark and bloody good story	2007-03-26	6	5	1

Aside from these squirm-inducing moments, this Spanish film lingers longer in WW2 reality than in fantasy. I wished for more interludes in the underground world, and fewer in the present when we must watch sadistic Fascist soldiers killing and torturing Spanish rebels. There's a lot of blood here, and this is certainly not a great movie for kids. Still, worth a watch if you enjoy a slight departure from Hollywood's inanities.	4.0	Very dark, very violent	2011-11-22	1	1	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A6IJQ0V37IIYJ	Brainy Babe	Let me begin by saying that this movie was not what I was expecting; the advertisements and print art led me to believe it would be more of a fantasy along the lines of The Lord of the Rings.  None of that, however, kept me from loving this movie.  As an avid movie watcher, I have learned that movies aren't always advertised/described as they should be, but if you are a true lover of cinema that will not keep you from appreciating a movie.  If it does, then I pity you because you are going to miss out on some amazing movies, such as Pan's Labyrinth.Everything about this movie is amazing.  The music is pitch perfect.  The special effects are good but don't overpower the movie and take center stage.  The acting is wonderful, and the plot moves at a steady pace with very few, if any, slow spots.  There is a lot of violence, but that is to be expected considering it's set during a war.In many ways I saw Ofelia as the equivalent of a modern-day moviegoer, escaping reality by plunging herself into an imaginary world.  It's a gross analogy I know, but isn't that part of the reason why we watch movies?My only regret is that I was unable to see this wonderful movie while it was playing in theaters.  It never came to the local cineplex because I live in an area where foreign movies are not well-received.

Dick ""the Cheese"""	"We have seen so much Hollywood garbage we actually forgot fairytales were supposed to be scary, think of "" Jack and the Beanstalk "" "" Hansel and Gretel"" those if real would be pretty scary right? Guillermo del Toro's "" Pan's Labyrinth"" is a about Ofelia, a girl who ailing mother marries a sadistic army officer after her own gentle father dies, she is forced to move with her mother to their new home or rather a quasi miltary base hideaway deep in the woods, a new home she is clearly not welcome in. To cope with this horrible new life, she begins to imagine her world and surroundings as part of a fairytale, and her companion is the very scary looking fawn ( Pan ) and he tells her who she really is... This is an incredible movie that has deep, deep viseral impact, by no means is this lite kids fare, it will grab you and involve you in a way that may surprise many viewers unaware of the genius of Guillermo del Toro. If you are not touched by this film you may be physically dead. by the end we only hope that the fairytale is really the truth for Ofelia and not the horrible reality, absolutely one of the best films of it's year and very highly recommended, and when your done go rent "" The Devil's Backbone "" as a double feature."	5.0	the perfect fairytale	2008-07-15	0	0	0

Guillermo Del Toro's fairy tale for adults, Pan's Labyrinth, is quite possibly the best film that I've seen in a number of years.The film has the ability to challenge the viewer to think about the choices he or she makes in daily life and to confront the results of those choices. The film deals with the idea that magic is a way to escape the brutal reality of daily life.At its simplest this is the story of a young girl, Ofelia who has to invent a fairy tale land of her own as she is confronted with the barbarism of post WWII Spain. The movie reveals itself in fairy tale fashion. Characters are either all good or all evil there is no middle ground.Forced to live witha sadistic Captain who has married her mother, the child escapes to magical realms and performs tasks in order to claim her rightful place as a princess. To offer more would be to give away a story that you need to become lost in.I viewed the two disc Platinum Edition whic features the commentary of the director and many production featurettes. The Commentary is especially insightful and should not be missed.Do yourself a favor and see one of the best movies of 2006. Don't miss it.	5.0	This Movie Will Blow You Away	2007-06-20	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"Pan's Labyrinth is a film about the role choice and blind obedience has in shaping the destinies of the individual as well as society. The film consists of two tales that are skillfully interwoven with the same twelve year old girl, Ofelia, at the center of each. One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each. However, as the film progresses, the magical world crosses over more and more into the real world. For example, the key, the dagger, and the monsters encountered in the magical world have definite analogs in the earthly realm.There is much that is left open for interpretation in this film. For example, until the end you are not sure if Pan is even telling the girl the truth. Is he actually leading her to a higher destiny, or does he just need someone to perform the three tasks in order to get something for himself? Why does Pan get younger and younger as the film progresses? Since Ofelia has a love of magical stories and nobody else actually sees any of the magical occurrences, are they real or just ways for the girl to escape her increasingly sad situation and environment? Most of the characters in the ""real world"" part of the film, however, are completely unambiguous. Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal, is the most shining example. From the beginning he plays a man devoted to detail, to the extinction of the rebels, and to his own legacy. He seems to have no human feelings and is as made of stone as the labyrinth that inhabits his property. This is made clear early in the film by a violent scene in which two villagers that claim to be hunting rabbits are killed by Vidal as suspected rebels. When he later finds a rabbit in the mens' belongings that seems to confirm their story, his only reaction is that of irritation at his men for not more thoroughly searching the villagers before bothering him with the matter.If you enjoy tales of magic and fantasy in which everything is not sewed up into a tidy happy ending, and you appreciate how the visual aspect of film can contribute to the mood of various scenes, I strongly advise you check this movie out. It is far more original and interesting than anything I saw Hollywood come up with last year."	5.0	Truly the best film of 2006	2007-05-16	3	3	0

They never said it's a kid's movie!""Fine.  So let's evaluate this as an adult's movie:1.  Pointlessly overviolent.  Really the violence is so graphic that whatever other message the director would like to convey gets lost in the shock.2.  The two plots cohere only superficially.3.  The mythical elements seem random, as if somebody had just read a copy of Joseph Campbell and decided to toss a whole bunch of random ideas into the soup.  What was the point of the eyeless guy and eating the grapes, for example?Lemme guess:  you're thinking, ""You're being too literal!

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A75A5BPJQ2A97	"Carl Jacobsen ""Forlorn Escapist"""	"As I write this review, I am listening to the Pan's Labyrinth OST for the sixth time on the film's official website[...]. Without question in my mind, Pan's Labyrinth definitely has the best soundtrack of 2006, perhaps even 2007, though as of this review the year is not yet ended.Like most movies, I read many reviews of Pan's Labyrinth before deciding to see it. As a long-time admirer of Roger Ebert's reviews, I took his praise of the film seriously and decided to dole out seven bucks. I missed the opening shot. Perhaps it was best that way, since it would have probably influenced my perception of the rest of the movie.Pan's Labyrinth was advertised as a fairy tale for adults and the trailers were predominantly concerned with the handful of fanciful creatures and little Ofelia. Coincidentally, a few months later, another movie used the same advertising ploy to draw in viewers. Many complained that the trailers for Bridge To Terabithia made it out to be another Narnia and thus misleading, even though they could have saved themselves the trouble by simply reading a synopsis of the novel the movie was based on. The parallels between Pan's Labyrinth and Terabithia struck me as sign that American cinema was veering towards a precipice over which it would plummet into the abyss of Roald Dahlian theatrics. Not surprisingly, criticisms for Pan's Labyrinth and Terabithia were very similar -- the ads were misleading, there was not enough fantasy and too much reality. Again, they should have simply done some reading before going to the movie. The old addage isn't always true, ignorance isn't always bliss.Much of the criticism surrounding Pan's Labyrinth is directed towards the violence and adverse ratio of fantasy to war, as well as use of subtitles (Americans hate reading, it seems). Both complaints show a widespread lack of understanding about some of the film's fine points and overall ignorance. With regard to the violence, Pan's Labyrinth is indeed a violent, gory movie. Seeing as how it's set during wartime, specifically WWII, it is really no different than other wartime films such as Glory or the History Channel mini-series Band Of Brothers. War is grisly and Guillermo del Toro doesn't pussyfoot away from that fact. He includes scenes of gore which, aside from that of Captain Vidal stitching his mouth back together - a sign of Vidal's stout resilience and possibly even an allusion to the Joker's smile - could hardly be considered excessive. Nobody loses a head or limb; guts don't spill out all over the ground; nails don't protrude out of eye sockets -- the level of gore in Pan's Labyrinth is hardly worth criticizing.Captain Vidal, the main antagonist, is what many would consider truly evil. Some argue his character is unrealistically evil, that he's too sadistic. It seems people are wont to forget Newton's rule of thumb -- for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Throughout the film, action and reaction drive the military and rebels. Action, reaction. Push, pull. One thing leads to another. Captain Vidal commands a military outpost resisting Republican rebels. His father died in Morocco and the death greatly affected Vidal. He takes his frustration out on the rebels. As a military man, he knows there is a possibility he might be killed, so he yearns for an heir. Enter his wife Carmen, pregnant with Vidal's son, or so he likes to believe. The camp's physician warns against presuming the child's gender, compounding Vidal's stress. Action, reaction. Push, pull. Carmen brings her daughter Ofelia. Had she been a boy instead, perhaps Vidal would have accepted her. Or perhaps not. Action, reaction. Enter the faeries.The beauty of this film is del Toro's weaving of reality and fantasy. As I said, I missed the first minute of the movie and as such may not have put it in the correct perspective. The first faerie appears separate from Ofelia as a mantis which follows her to the camp. One night it visits her in bed where she asks, ""Did you follow me here? Are you a fairy?"" at which point she shows the mantis a picture of a fairy and it turns into one, albeit with an insectoid head. Del Toro claims this was intended to distinguish his faeries from the classic beautified representations. Indeed, nothing in the fantasy realm is beautiful to the viewer, but rather grotesque and at times fearsome. Everything in the supernatural realm mirrors the world in which Ofelia lives. There is nothing wholly beautiful. Even the beauty of child-bearing is marred by pain and blood, as Carmen suffers numerous maladies as she struggles to carry Vidal's heir to term.The supernatural never appear in the same scene as any other character except Ofelia, excluding the faerie's nocturnal visit while Carmen was fast asleep. Aware of this, it's easy for the viewer to perceive everything as being in Ofelia's head, but the two worlds collide when Ofelia puts a mandrake root under her ailing mother's bed and Carmen gradually recovers, much to everyone's amazement. But Vidal, ever distrustful of Ofelia, mistakes her actions as an attempt on the unborn heir's life. Carmen defends her daughter and after Vidal leaves the room admonishes her for believing in such superstitions. She then tosses the mandrake root into the fireplace, at which point she immediately goes into labor and soon after dies during childbirth. Without Carmen to protect Ofelia, Vidal links the young girl with a treacherous maid and has Ofelia imprisoned in her room. At wit's end, Ofelia cries out for help and is visited once more by the ambiguous faun.It is at this point which the recurring assumption that Pan's Labyrinth is about escapism becomes fundamentally incorrect. In review after review, the fantasy realm is just that -- fantasy. It's all in Ofelia's head as a means for her to escape the harsh realities of the embattled world around her. In actuality, Ofelia not only brings the real world into the ""fantasy realm,"" but she brings fantasy into the real. The labyrinth itself is real. The faeries are insectoid. The toad was inspired by Vidal's umbrella. The terrifying Pale Man was an amalgram of metaphors. And her home kingdom... To mention anything about that would be a spoiler. But after she has been locked in her room, the faun visits Ofelia and gives her a quest: ""Fetch your brother and bring him to the labyrinth as quickly as possible."" At this point fantasy and reality collide head-on. Ofelia escapes from her prison through supernatural means and kidnaps her brother, thus involving Captain Vidal in the mythical quest.Escapism -- the desire to retreat into imaginative entertainment to escape the harshness of reality. Escapism is sitting in front of a television eight hours a day instead of going out partying. Escapism is chatting or writing lengthy reviews on Amazon instead of hanging out with friends. Escapism is definitely not what Pan's Labyrinth is about. For Ofelia, reality and fantasy are one and the same.And when all is said and done and the credits roll, you may find yourself questioning your own beliefs. What is real? What is fantasy? And just who really had the most fanciful thoughts? Ofelia with her fairy kingdom? The rebels with their fight for freedom from national oppression? Or Captain Vidal with his unwaivering desire for a son to follow in his footsteps?"	5.0	Bad Advertising, Ignorant Reviews, A Misunderstood Masterpiece	2007-04-25	56	50	6
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AIA5PLISC0V8F	Carlos	Okay I get it, it was violent, and I've read other reviewers say it was necessary.  Really? Okay, I'm guessing some would say 'yes really.' A better filmmaker would have been able to infer the violence without showing some guy get his face caved in with a glass bottle. Oh, I think they could. But since del toro could, he did. And it almost killed him, I don't think so. Almost getting killed would be someone is Iraq or Afghanistan. I liked Hellboy, so I'm not bashing all his movies, just this one. Switching from the civil war to the underworld seemed to disjointed; I wish it could have been one or the other. I also get that there was a paralell between the two, still I didn't like  it.  War movie, horror movie, or fantasy movie?  All three, yes it was, but done badly.  One or the other. Not worth your time.	1.0	couldn't find it's groove; what was the big deal; waste of time	2010-06-08	27	1	26
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1MRVSJAJHRRHC	Carolyn Schulz	Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent movie. The line between fiction and reality is nearly indistinguishable as the characters make their way through the hardships of the Spanish Civil War. The movie is similar to the Pandora's Box myth: many atrocities exist but hope outshines the rest. Pan's Labyrinth does show violence. I would strongly recommend using the suggested age guidelines.	5.0	Film Excellence	2009-03-19	2	1	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A21VGNU5959O85	CaterpillarGirl	"I grew up reading fairy tales that were laced with death and violent imagery. The Little Mermaid, the Little Match Girl, the Red Shoes, the Snow Queen, the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the Fir Tree. All of those and many more had such sadness, and loss, and they were meant to stir up the imagination as well as teach us a lesson. Pan's Labyrinth is supposed to be one of those tales, and it almost reaches the goals it sets but not quite. I allowed myself some time, between watching it and writing a review to let it all sink in, because right after you watch it you have a lot of emotional conflictions.I love foreign films, because usually they tend to give me another view of society, and cultures I am unfamiliar with. Different locations in this world have different tales to tell, and most are influenced by the history of that land. I always watch them in the original language, with subtitles, because you cannot get the message when it's dubbed.This movie started out well, its promise was apparent, but it soon went downhill for me. It had beautiful imagery, costumes, and the effects were both awesome and mediocre. They dropped the ball when it came to the real life drama, the gore and bloody scenes. While they were horrifying, I could tell what CGI was and what wasn't. The fantasy effects were amazing, especially with the Faun and the Baby eating demon. They were full and lush and inspiring. However they totally dropped the ball in the end, when Ofelia gets to the underworld it was the hugest most disappointing ending I have ever seen, worst even than Jodie Fosters ""Contact"".The story brought us through the hope of the princess returning, her heartache at losing her family, her love of her brother, her journey through the relentless tasks the Faun gave her and the peril she faced with her stepfather...and than in the end , after all that buildup, we get gypped. Her walking into that bright room, three thrones and a standing ovation by whomever...was in Eric Cartman's great words....""Lame"". I got no feeling of joy; I felt no awe over her return. Here they showed us this superb creature, the Faun, and really they just dumped all their eggs in that effect basket and ignored everything else.I would say watch it, for the Faun and for the almost awesomeness of it all, its worth a look, but don't expect to come away satisfied."	3.0	Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.	2007-09-09	10	4	6

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	This is one of the most imaginative and unique films I have seen in years. It is a dark fairy tale for adults and is not a children's movie. The film is a mixture of fairy tale and dark realism since it combines images from the Mediterranean's pre-Christian mythologies with the horror of Fascism in Franco's Spain. The overlap between these two concepts, classical mythology and fascism, is violence and threat as well as unreasonable power over the powerless. Myths often involve heroic action, often taken by an innocent person or child, that helps overcome the forces of evil. The film is very skillful in combining these concepts where they are verbalized by the mythical creatures but we see a parallel world in reality as the rustic peasants develop resistance to the forces of fascism.The transitional character between the fantasy world of mythology and the harsh world of fascist reality is a little girl, the daughter of the new wife of a Fascist officer. She travels between these world through an ancient labyrinth hidden in the woods outside the fascist compound. Here she meets mischievous fairies but also a somewhat threatening and mysterious faun who is ambiguous as to his full intentions. The faun is identified as Pan, the child of the god Hermes, who was the god of transitions and doorways. She is told she is the Princess Moana and must undertake 3 tasks to gain her rightful throne. As in many myths, this child is given three tasks to claim their rightful position with the gods. This puts our young heroine into danger not only when she is in the labyrinth performing tasks but also when she is with her mother and step-father among the fascist and hidden resistance fighters. The adventures within the mythological world with a giant toad full of slime to an amazing monster who is awakened when someone eats from his table and who sees through eyeballs in the palms of his hands.To achieve the tasks prescribed by the gods and to overcome the evils of fascism, resilience and creativity are required and so once again we see overlap between the two worlds. Monstrosity can be reflected in the world of imaginary monsters but also in the acts of the fascists as they torture and kill innocent villagers as well as resistance fighters.  The young female protagonist is not fully protected from the evil of her step-father by her weak mother, suffering with a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. She does not feel fully protected and she is indeed vulnerable to the dark gaze of her dark murderous step-father. She is most protected by the housekeeper who plays many roles in this complex film. Children may retreat into fantasy when threatened but this poor little girl finds a fantasy world that demand much of her and a real world full of real dark threats. This film has some of the best integration of fantasy and reality since A.S. Byatt's the Dijin in the Nightingale's Eye or the works of Borges.This film has a different feel to it from a Hollywood production, since it has some ragged ends and images that are more European than North American. This is part of the film's strength. The Pan creature for example would have probably been more of a Santa Claus with goat legs if the film had been made in Hollywood. Instead, he is mysterious and ambiguous in a world with little clarity.The child actress Ivana Baquero plays the child Ofelia. She does a super job. Sergi Lopez plays her evil, cruel, fascist step-father Captain Vidal. He is an excellent actor and he has the ability to radiate threat on the screen. All scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, and cinematography were excellent. It all comes together into a great film.	5.0	Myth and reality mix in a world of threat and renewal	2011-01-13	2	2	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PBV1899CX3TE	"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!"""	"Guillermo del Toro is a Mexican director, but El laberinto del fauno is set in fascist dictator Franco's Espana. But for all its fantasy and fairy tale elements, it might just as well be set in Neverland, where all stories begin with ""Once upon a time...""&iexcl;Vamanos! Our story begins as 11-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to meet her new husband, El Capit&aacute;n Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). El Capit&aacute;n is stationed in a lonely outpost in the wild country, quelling a rebellion. Carmen is with his child, and is in no condition for such an arduous journey. Nevertheless, he insists that his son should be born where his father is. Ofelia is skeptical of her new step father. Her real father was a tailor.-------------Carmen: The captain has been so good to us... Please, Ofelia, call him father. It's just a word, Ofelia, just a word.========Vidal is a heartless fascist, and Ofelia senses that immediately. She seeks to escape the harsh regime of El Capit&aacute;n through stories and fantasies. The lines of demarcation between what seems real and what seems fantastic start to blur. She discovers an ancient stone labyrinth, and her journey has begun.-------------Ofelia: My name is Ofelia. Who are you?Pan: Me? I've had so many names. Old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce. I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. I am... I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness.========There is a tradition in South American Literature known as Magical Realism, or lo real maravilloso. Though the term was first coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925, it was Alejo Carpentier who gave the term its current definition. The Venezuelan essayist and fiction writer Arturo Uslar Pietri was also eager to promote this literary mixture as an exceptional feature of Latin American literature. Magic realist authors include Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende, and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. ""My most important problem was destroying the lines of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic"" said Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.------------Mercedes: My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.========Guillermo del Toro has written a story that falls within the realm of Magical Realism. On a side note, he quotes Sren Kierkegaard when explaining the ending, but I can't reveal the quote without spoiling the ending.This story was very close to Guillermo's coraz&oacute;n, and legend has it that he turned down an offer to direct The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to do this film instead. He gave up his entire salary, including back-end points, to see this film realized. He was offered double the budget by Hollywood producers provided the film was made in English, but he turned them all down, unwilling to compromise. He even wrote all the English subtitles himself, to ensure that they were true to his original vision.For years he kept a sketch book where he would draw pictures and scribble notes about his ideas for the film, until one day he left it in a taxi. He was going to give up on the project, but the cab driver, realizing the importance of the notes, tracked him down and returned them. He took this as a sign that he should continue his quixotic quest.--------------Capit&aacute;n Vidal: I choose to be here because I want my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.=========The bottom line is that Guillermo del Toro's film is a masterpiece like Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bte or Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. It's a film that creates a fable, which is much harder to do than it looks. Guillermo speaks the language not only of films, but also of dreams, of myths, and of fairy tales. His notes and sketches for this film remind me of the recently discovered Red Book by Carl Jung, where Jung also attempted to capture the ephemeral dreams and notions of his subconscious and divine their meaning.--------------Carmen: You're getting older, and you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.[throws the mandrake onto the fire]Ofelia: No! No!Carmen: Ofelia! Magic does not exist. Not for you, me or anyone else.=========Though the film does have elements of the fairy tale it is not for young children, because the world's more full of weeping than they can understand. There are some quite disturbing moments of violence that are only too real. One character, the Pale Man, played by Doug Jones (who also portrayed El Fauno), was so unsettling that he even made Stephen King squirm. Del Toro was seated next to King at a screening and he compared seeing the horror king's reaction to winning three Oscars. Besides the three Oscars and three other Oscar nominations, his film also received a 22 minute standing ovation at Cannes.--------Ofelia: Mercedes, do you believe in fairies?Mercedes: No. But when I was a little girl, I did. I believed in a lot of things I don't believe anymore.Ofelia: Last night a fairy visited me.===Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Widescreen)(2008) Doug Jones was Abe Sapien; Directed by Guillermo del ToroThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix)(2005) Doug Jones was CesareHellboy(2004) Doug Jones was Abe Sapien; Directed by Guillermo del ToroAdaptation (Superbit Collection)(2002) Doug Jones was Augustus MargaryY Tu Mama Tambien (R-rated Edition)(2001) Maribel Verd&uacute; was Luisa Cort&eacute;sThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle(2000) Doug Jones was FBI Agent - CarrotThree Kings (Keepcase)(1999) Doug Jones was Dead Iraqi SoldierMystery Men(1999) Doug Jones was PencilheadTank Girl(1995) Doug Jones was Additional RipperBatman Returns(1992) Doug Jones was Thin Clown--------------Ofelia: Hi!

It is dark, gruesome, and facinatingly grotesque in it's own artful way, and it is meant to be a fairy tale for adults.Having said that, this film is wonderful in it's beautiful imagery, and breathtaking special effects. It is a foreign film, and is therefore subtitled, but as long as watching a subtitled movie doesn't bother you, then you definitely shouldn't miss this spectacular exercise in the flowing combination of pain and beauty.The story is set in Spain in 1944. A young girl and her mother are sent to live with her cruel and sadistic step-father. She soon discovers that she can escape into a bizarre fantasy world when she touches the pages of a blank book. There she is told that she is a princess, and that she must overcome 3 horrifying obstacles in order to prove her royal lineage, and meet her real father, the King.As most movies do, this film tends to drag occassionally, but even so you will be riveted by the rich imagery the film portrays. Although the movie is often disturbing and gruesome, it also has moments of sheer beauty and grace. The viewer is sometimes left with a sense of confusion, because after a while Ofelia's real and imaginary worlds begin to blend together, creating a very uncertain feeling as to what is real and what is not. In the end, it is sort of left to the viewer to decide for themselves what they believe the truth of the matter is. Was this incredible fantasy world all inside Ofelia's head as a way of escaping the horrors going on around her in real life, or was she truly able to physically escape into this other realm? You be the judge.Director Guillermo del Toro did a wonderful job in bringing this film to life. While the movie is all in Spanish, Del Toro translated the subtitles to English himself, as he did not trust other translators to do it properly due to a few bad experiences with some of his previous films.Despite the movie being titled ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which to me immediately sparks the imagination, do not expect this film to even remotely resemble much tamer movies that the title invokes, such asPeter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)or evenLabyrinth. Actually, the film is only titled ""Pan's Labyrinth"" for America and other english speaking countries. In reality, the film is titled ""Labyrinth of the Fawn"".Considering this film recieved a straight 22 minutes of applause at the Cannes Film Festival, I think it's definitely worth a viewing.

That just usually doesn't work.But, the connection of evil to beauty in this film is impossibly great.  Now, if you've never seen this film do not for a second think that I'm claiming that evil is beautiful or that evil is shown to be beautiful herein.  Yet, I am stating that beauty and evil coexist in this story without mixing.  In most stories that work these two words into the same context you connect evil with the outer covering of beauty.  Such a stress does not exist in this film.What does exist is a young girl's beautiful fantasy that takes her through the tragedies of real life in a real world that is anything but beautiful.  Evil resides in the nature of human conscience.  Beauty is found in that conscience as well, but rarely do evil and beauty live in the same conscience.  This little girl's breathtaking ride through reality is a trip into a fantastic dimension that allows her to find the justice of an eleven-year-old, if there is such a thing.Now, to tone down a little.  If you've not seen this film, and you have kids under the age of 13, watch the film first before allowing them to watch it.  I make this recommendation because I believe the film is suitable for minors.  There are no sexual references within the film, but there is some serious violence.  I believe that the film is good for kids as young as eleven, though, because it really generates a great transposition of reality with imagination, and it causes moral thinking to occur.  However, the film is rated ""R"", so I make it clear that the film is made for adults.I believe that what you get with Pan's Labyrinth is the beautiful voyage of a little girl through her own imagination while she rides through a world full of evil and darkness.  The culmination is hopeful and inspiring, and I'll probably watch this one again real soon."	5.0	Into the heart of humanity.	2008-03-20	0	0	0

It was dark, sad, unneccessarily gory and had a terrible ending.  The young actress was very talented, but that's about all I can find positive about the movie.  The part about the mandrake root was completely sickening to me, moreso even than the needless violence.  ( I even watched it a second time with the director's commentary to get a better understanding of his intent and was horrified by his viscious comments about the horses involved.  I'm 58 years old, have had horses since I was 11 years old, and few creatures are as kind and willing to do what we ask if we are kind to them.  Mr. Del Torro needs to understand that horses are so much bigger than we are that they have to do absolutely NOTHING we ask.  They are simply willing and generous when treated kindly.

Some have written that it had excessive violence and that nobody is a evil and cruel as the captain.....well, I can only say that those who feel that way are not aware of the realities of horror and war. War brings out all kinds of monsters and this was as realistic as it gets in it's portrayal of evil. Having family who have fought in the Spanish Civil War, the film portrays the violence completely effectively, in fact, it is downplayed.See the film; it is excellent and completely original.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"There are many words one can use to describe Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"" in the native Spanish): imaginative; dark; disturbing; heartfelt; violent; mature; intriguing. The one word I prefer is ""original."" This has to be one of the most amazing films I've seen this year; it's a well-crafted sight and sound fantasy that keeps a firm grip on the audience (despite having to read English subtitles). The characters are emotionally connective. The settings are a mixture of the mysterious, the drab, and the vibrant. The story is engaging. The makeup and special effects are creative. Everything about this film is indicative of an active imagination, which is a nice departure from the slew of unimaginative rehashes that have recently been released.The ads for this film have one critic saying that it's a fairy tale for grownups. I definitely agree with that; to say that this story isn't for children would be a massive understatement. This is not a sugarcoated fable of handsome princes, beautiful princesses, and happily ever afters, nor will true love's kiss awaken a fair maiden. This is a heavy-handed tale of discovery, and it includes a number of moments that some may find difficult to watch, such as shootings, torture, a near miscarriage, and needless deaths. While such material may turn some viewers off, I still think it's worth seeing. It was quite a refreshing experience, especially since a number of cliched fairy tale elements are put aside. Del Toro succeeded in creating his own fairy tale, one that's incredibly dark yet undeniably effective.The plot is actually a meshing of two distinct stories, both of which are connected by Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an adolescent girl of surprising character. Taking place in 1944 Spain, the first story tells of how post-war fascism is at its height, and how a repressive military faction led by Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) threatens to destroy a group of rebels hiding within the mountains. Vidal is a cold, ruthless individual who demands loyalty and has absolutely no patience for those who oppose him. He'll gladly kill innocent people if it gets him one step further to victory. No one dares second-guess his methods, not his officers, and definitely not his servants.Moving from the city to join Vidal at his rural estate are Ofelia and her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), who has recently wed Vidal and is pregnant with his child. Ofelia is clearly not ready to adapt to her new life, despite her mother's continuous pleas for cooperation. When she first meets her stepfather, she offers him to shake her left hand. He callously grabs it and says, ""It's the other hand, Ofelia."" Within the scope of the narrative, the film's main villain is established right then and there; it's obvious from such a tense introduction that their relationship will only go downhill, especially since she's aware of how distant he is towards her mother. It doesn't help that Carmen's pregnancy is getting increasingly difficult; she's frequently in pain, making her too weak to fully engage in her new life. Vidal's doctor, Ferreiro (Alex Angulo), warned him about moving his wife during such a delicate time, but Vidal insists that his son (somehow everyone knows that Carmen is having a boy) should be born near his father. He makes it very clear that his baby comes first, not his wife.Ofelia soon befriends Vidal's maid, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), who's secretly helping the rebels by giving them rations of food. Her brother, Pedro (Roger Casamajor), is among them, and they both understand that their chances of overthrowing Vidal's reign are slim. But they continue to fight, even when one of them is captured and subjected to torture.Meanwhile, Ofelia is having some interesting experiences, which brings me to the second story that's being told. When she first arrives at Vidal's estate, she finds a stone with an engraving of an eye. She sees that it's the missing piece of an engraved statue; upon reinserting the piece, a mysterious cricket hybrid emerges from its mouth. It continuously reappears throughout the film, and it eventually morphs itself into a fairy-like creature. It also serves as Ofelia's guide, leading her to a stone labyrinth at the back of the estate. In the center is a staircase leading to an underground lair. There she meets a faun (Doug Jones), a tall, fantastical creature with branch-like legs and a quasi-elfin face. He tells her that she's actually the mortal reincarnation of Princess Moanna, who was drawn to the sunlight and born as a human. In order for her to return to her own kingdom, she must complete three tasks, all of which are outlined in a special book provided by the faun.Thus begins Ofelia's quest for her true identity, highlighted by journeys into otherworldly realms. Her first task takes her to the roots of a dying fig tree, where a gigantic toad resides. She must retrieve a golden key from its belly. Her second task takes her into a room with a sumptuous feast, none of which she's allowed to eat. If she takes so much as a bite, a monstrous creature with eyes in its hands will awaken. She must also complete the task in a given length of time. Her third task I won't mention; it comes late in the film, and describing it will give too much away. Let's just say that she must make a decision, one that will affect her chances of returning to her kingdom.I was initially puzzled as to how these two separate narratives would be able to work together. One is very much rooted in reality, and it deals with difficult issues. The other is rooted in fantasy, relying on imaginary circumstances in order to exist. But as the film progressed, I came to see that the first story serves as a backdrop for Ofelia's journey. She repeatedly says that she's unhappy in Vidal's home; that she wants to go away and never return. Only a world filled with anger, hatred, and repression--a world Ofelia lives in--would instill such feelings. It is said that Princess Moanna's kingdom is one with no pain or sadness, qualities which are clearly preferable to the hardships of a mortal existence.""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't use the fantasy genre as a way to reinforce the classic Hero's Journey, nor is it used to tell a simple Good vs. Evil fable; rather, it's used to provide an escape for a lonely young girl who longs for a place to call her own. Despite the fact that Ofelia loves her mother, despite finding a friend in Mercedes, it's obvious that she's not meant to be among the world of mortals. Her soul is free. Her mind is expansive. Her heart is light. I loved these aspects of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" as much as I loved del Toro's sense of creativity. This is a truly original film, and I hope future fantasy films will be made just as well."	5.0	An A-maze-ing Story	2006-12-29	4	3	1

It is crazy and it doesn't make any sense, plus (spoiler alert!) there is no Pan even though there is a labyrinth.  I think they should have put more work into the script and put in somebody named Pan, so we could enjoy his labyrinth.This movie is like a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""We're No Angels,"" in that it is about a journey a little girl takes that happens in the olden days.  She is a girl whose father is very mean because he spends his whole time shaving and not taking her to the zoo or other places kids like.  Consequently she creates a world of her own that is like a zoo, and is filled with magic, crickets, and no carpeting.The dude with eyes in his hands is excellent and if they ever do a sequel (and I pray that they don't) they should make the whole movie about him.  For instance, what does he eat (besides fairies)?  Why are his eyeballs in his hands?  Does he use saline solution instead of handsoap?  These unanswered questions are just part of the problem I have with this filmmaker's ""vision.""And what a vision it is.  A lot of this movie is very depressing, and I don't think children should be depressed because they are our future.  Moreover, a better moral would have been for the little girl to overcome some of her ""issues"" and deal with the fact that stepfathers may be a little rough around the edges but at least their eyeballs are in their head.Oh, also this movie is completely foreign and so you have to read the whole thing.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AI0IC79H3M5EM	"Cica ""Krisztina"""	Pan's Labyrinth is set along the woods in 1944 Spain. Ofelia, the main character, is forced to move into a large house along the woods, because her mother, Carmen, is pregnant with Captian Vidal's child and he wants his unborn child near him.  Vidal is a cold-hearted, unmerciful character, the epitome of heartlessness and the entire lack of any compassion. He only cares about his unborn son, and not Carmen (his wife and mother of his child) and Ofelia (his step-daughter). Well, Ofelia finds out she has the soul of the Princess Moanna, a princess in a world outside our reality. However, as the fawn, or El Fauno says, Ofelia has to complete three tasks to actually return to her kingdom. Ofelia finds solace in her mother, but the Ofelia's situation is grim, especially since her stepfather is a shell of a human devoid of any emotions, her mother is incapacitated due to complications with her pregancy, and the house in which they reside lies along the woods where Vidal's troops are fighting resistance fighters. Danger meets Ofelia in the human world and as she struggles to fulfill her three magical tasks.The film has amazing special effects and characters, such as the fairies, el fauno, and the pale man. Ofelia's only solace from her dreary life is the prospect of entering this fairy world. You will both cry and smile at the ending. The cinematography is amazing. I strongly recommend Pan's Labyrinth, because you will become entirely enveloped in the plot, and though the film is entirely in Spanish with the exception of English subtitles, it only adds to the story.The special features are also interesting, especially the dvd comics that describe the backstory of el fauno, the pale man, and the giant toad.One note of caution: this is not meant for children. Captain Vidal is a violent man, and his military interrogation skills would be considered major violations of the Geneva Convention, if you get my drift (and if you didn't I mean very bloody scenes that make you weep for his victims.)I have never seen a movie so enchanting and in all amazing.	5.0	Amazing Film	2007-07-20	4	3	1

This is a story that will draw you in, spin you around, make you scared, elated, fascinated but never willing to stop seeing the next moment. Wonderfully shot and choreographed, just a master with an amazing tapestry.The PR write-ups don't do it justice because it's not a tale of good vs evil; its a tale about good and evil. It's heart-breaking, awe-inspiring, and life affirming. It's everything you could imagine in a terrifying tale that involves a young, optomistic girl caught in disasterous circumstances by currents of events far beyond her comprehension.There are several scenes of sudden violence that are so effective and so immediate, you cannot really prepare for them. I started wtaching this film accidentally because I wanted to load it on my iPod for an upcoming trip. I ended up watching the whole thing on the Mac AND still uploading it. For example, the encounter between the Capitaine and the rabbit hunters left me gaping with my mouth covered, still not believing what I had just seen.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Pan's Labyrinth in many ways is like the answer to the Chronicles of Narnia or Bridge to Terabithia. If you weren't fond of the kiddyness of those movies, a more adult fairy tale came your way in 2006 done by Guillermo Del Toro, director of Hellboy and Blade II. The problem with the latter 2 films was that they were alright films for what they were but they never really transcended the genre it was in. Hellboy was a well-made comic book film but it didn't reach the status that X-Men 2 or the 1978 Superman film got to that makes it a great film period, whether it was comic book or not. Pan's Labyrinth however is not only a worthy addition to the fantasy genre but it's one of the better films found within it.Set in Spain 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen is travelling the countryside to be with Captain Vidal, Carmen's new husband in the Spanish army. Vidal is certainly not the most sympathetic to say the least so Ofelia's fascination with stories and fairy tales useful. However she realizes in the woods outside the house lies an ancient cave and a magical faun who tells her she's Princess Moanna, princess of the underworld. But in order to prove her worth, she has to complete 3 tasks which are particularly dangerous and finds herself trapped between the violent real world and a magical fantasy world that may or may not exist.I should get something out of the way since people might have a misconception about the film. When I say this is a fairytale for the more adult set, I mean it. There's some violent, bloody acts (you should see what Vidal does with a beer bottle) and one particular unnerving scene involving a creature known as the Pale Man is evidence this is not for the youngsters. But in a way it's nice to have an film like this where the more harsh realities of life can co-exist with the more fantastic elements that are possibly out there. If there's one thing that can potentially turn people off is that the more fantasy elements are not that numerous with many scenes devoted to Vidal and his battle with fighters in the mountains. But it's also a healthy balance with one side not overpowering the other side and making it too cheesy or too serious.No fairytale would be complete without a main character to lead us through their journey and I can't imagine anyone better than Ivana Baquero who is very believable as Ofelia and is quite a performance beyond her age. And Sergi Lopez plays probably the nastiest, brutal character to come around in awhile. He's downright vicious and he's one character you wouldn't want to cross. There's also some good performances from Maribel Verdu and Ariadna Gil as Mercedes, the house's caretaker and Carmen respectively. Also special attention should be made for Doug Jones playing the faun Pan as well as the Pale Man (that eyes-in-palms dude in the the trailers) who always manages to pull off convincing performances under heavy makeup.The special features on Del Toro movies tend to be quite plentiful and this is no different. Disc 1 houses a director's prologue (essentially one of those ""I hope you enjoy this movie"" things lasting 30 seconds or so) as well as an excellent audio commentary Del Toro does solo. Disc 2 has the bulk of it with looks into the set designs and the looks of things to the music as well as a good Charlie Rose interview which features Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (director of the excellent Children of Men) and Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu (director of the average-except-for-the-Japanese-storyline Babel).Released the same day as this was the Fountain, which was one of those fantasy films that tried to hit you in different places yet came across feeling calculated and cold. Pan's Labyrinth on the other hand felt like a labor of love and for once, a passion that actually makes a good film in the end."	5.0	A fairy tale for the older generations	2007-05-17	6	6	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2GCHG6U8HTVIT	C. O. DeRiemer	"Pan's Labyrinth is a marvelous, serious movie full of allegory, the easiest being fascism and freedom, nightmares and dreams. This is a film that people who like movies about ideas and implications will chew over and come back to. And I hope Sergi Lopez is doing things other than bad guys. He's a first-class actor. Those who've seen Dirty Pretty Things will recall him. As Harry in the French psycho movie, With a Friend Like Harry, he's exactly not the kind of friend to have.I have one caveat. I wish first-class directors (and second-class directors, too) could resist indulging in the brutality ""wow"" factor some of their fans seem to love so much. I could see no purpose except to have the audience go ""yuck"" when the Captain's cheek is slit, when he sews it up himself and when he uses a bottle to smash in a captive's face. All are shown in close-up and in loving detail. Pan's Labyrinth is so good a movie that the three yuck moments aren't needed, in my view, except for pandering to a segment of the audience.But doesn't the face-smashing truly and quickly establish the really brutal and vicious nature of the man, particularly as an allegory for fascism? Perhaps, but did it need to be shown in close-up? The whole scene was threatening because of the way Lopez played it. His brutal character, for me, was quickly set through Lopez' performance and the fright of the two peasants...there was no doubt, from my point of view, about the Captain's character. That was established to my satisfaction by the Captain matter-of-factly personally shooting the father more than once, then turning to put bullets into the son...more bullets than were needed, and by doing it himself. Then following that by the discovery of the rabbits in the knapsack and the...what? just irritation toward his subordinate for not thoroughly searching the two peasants.I'll offer this as something to think about: If the three incidents I mentioned 1) had not been shot in close-up, but had been shown in medium shots or 2) with the bottle scene, the Captain starts to smash the bottle into the face but there was a cut-away so the direct smashing impacts weren't seen, and 3) if the cheek slitting had been shown in a different angle and the sewing had been seen from a different, non-close-up angle...would the impact of the story or the film be significantly changed in any important emotional or visual way? For me, the answer is ""no."" The cheek sewing, for me, established that the Captain really was an evil not of this world, worse than anything Ofelia had encountered in her world...but the director, from a practical, visual, emotional level, did not have to use close-ups of the needle going in and out of the flesh to establish that point. When I saw the movie the theater was packed. Believe me, when those three scenes came up all I could hear was ""Yuck"" from the audience with undertones of either delight or revulsion. It seemed to me people were caught up in the bloody close-up moment, just as they would be in some gory teen horror flick, and not in any expanded meaning about the characters or the story.The movie, itself, despite this directorial indulgence, remains a fascinating and thoughtful film that will most likely be remembered and watched years from now."	5.0	An extraordinary, major film...marred a little by three lapses into the genre of teen horror yuckiness	2007-03-28	11	3	8

It played like all other highly computer driven films.  The story is of war torn Spain around WWII, and a little girl who has to move in with her new stepfather, a colonel in the army.  They move to the countryside so he can be near the front line of a gorilla faction.  Amongst this chaos, a girl finds an escape into a fantasy world, where she finds out she was supposed to be all along.  Now whether this was supposed to be a War movie or a Fairy Tale, it's hard to tell.  They needed to split the two apart because I found the one storyline got in the way of the other.  The gruesomeness of the war scenes did not mix well with the discovery and the imagery of the ""underworld"" fantasy.  Definitely not a family movie, never meant to be, so do not let your kids watch this, but I would not recommend adults watch this either.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"Mexican born director, Guillermo del Toro's magnificently crafted fantasy ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a film geared toward an adult audience. Filmed in Spain, it is set in the post Spanish Civil War countryside in 1944.  A young girl Ofelia played superbly by Ivana Baquero is being transported along with her mother to an uncertain future in a rural province.Her widowed mother Carmen played by Ariadna Gil has remarried and is joining her new husband Captain Vidal played by Sergi Lopez.  The captain is a grotesque sadistic martinet who cares only for the baby carried by the pregnant Carmen.  The draconian circumstances of her surroundings pushes Ofelia into a fantasy world populated by fairies and a faun like creature presumably Pan.The fantasy world is based in a stone labyrinth adjacent to the mill in which the captain and his troops are headquartered.  She is convinced that she is Princess Moana, daughter of the king of the underworld.  She must perform some tasks designated by the faun to re-enter this magical land.del Toro finds a proper balance between fantasy and reality to tell this touching story in which a young child must navigate herself through a series of dire incidents which will delineate her future."	5.0	Fabulous foreign film fantasy	2007-05-20	3	3	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"Director Guillermo del Toro's film Pan's Labyrinth (as it is called in the U.S.) is more than just another fantasy film. It's a thematically complex fairy tale for adults. And it may be the most profound and personal film of the Mexican director's career.The story is set in 1944, in Spain where the fascists still hold sway over the people. Amidst this turmoil a young girl and her pregnant mother are leaving behind their home, their former lives and going to live with the mother's new husband, the fascist El Capitan. The girl finds that she can only survive through the use of her imagination, but the fairy tale world to which she escapes turn out to be more real than the world in which she is trapped. She stumbles onto an ancient ruinous labyrinth and in its center is a pit that serves as a doorway between the ""real"" world and the ""fantasy"" world. Living deep within this pit is the faun, an ambiguous and immortal creature. He tells the girl that she is a princess and a goddess, that she does not belong to our cruel and violent world, and that if she is to return her own she must first complete three extraordinary tasks. Meanwhile her mother suffers from complications of her pregnancy, and the Captain's command is under threat by the Socialist resistance, whose band is camped in the surrounding forests. Soon all of these elements collide and destinies are revealed.Guillermo's film is easily the most visually spectacular film of 2006 and is rich in detail. He brilliantly uses the screen as a painter would use a canvas and every color that he chooses has particular meaning, every shadow hides within it a mystery, and every light serves as beacon for hope. The visual effects and the cinematography are amazing. The world of magic is vividly brought to life in gold, red, yellow and orange. The other world, our world, is disturbingly cold in black, gray, blue and green. But as the two worlds affect each other the color palettes begin to mix. As director he also references other works of fantasy, both in literature and in film, and uses thematic components of countless fairy tales. The film could almost be seen as one part Anne Frank and one part Alice in Wonderland. The themes that are dealt with are truly universal: the importance of innocence, the power of sacrifice, the perils of ambition, the corrupting qualities of obsession, betrayal and doubt, but most prominently transcendence through selflessness. The characters are simple archetypes but the performances are complex and multi-faceted. The story is timeless, a truly modern fairy tale.Although a fairy tale it's definitely not for children. It deals with the darker aspects of humanity and the loss of childhood innocence. There are numerous scenes of graphic violence and most of the fantastical creatures would give children nightmares. It's quite obvious that this film is for adults once you've seen a man's face crushed with a bottle. This is an R-rated fantasy film; it's notHarry Potteror evenThe Lord of the Rings. It's Pan's Labyrinth.So if you aren't easily frightened maybe you might just take a journey through its winding passages, discover its mysteries, breathe in its poetry and find yourself lost in its vision.The2-disc Platinum Series Editionhas some amazing special features that will be sure to intrigue and enlighten those interested in the film. The special features include a film introduction with Guillermo del Toro, an audio commentary with Guillermo del Toro, trailers, image galleries, an episode of the Charlie Rose Show, Director's Notebook with introduction and interactive features, three fascinating featurettes, and DVD comics."	5.0	El Laberinto del Fauno	2008-05-09	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AIC7J32QZY2KF	Craig Moller	"Part gothic fantasy, part political statement, Guillermo del Toro's masterwork is clearly a labor of love, profounding, beautiful, and awe-inspiring.Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of young Ofelia (played by eleven-year-old Ivana Baquero), a child who is forced to move, along with her pregnant mother, into a massive old millhouse cottage which is nestled deep within a dense forest. This building also happens to house the militaristic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia's ""father."" From the outset it is clear that war is in the air, but none of this concerns Ofelia. She is fascinated with books and the amazing stories that fill them. Ofelia comes across a mysterious garden labyrinth found behind the cottage. the little girl encounters Pan (Doug Jones), a mysterious and magical character who informs her that she is actually the princess of the underworld. In order to return to her real father and take her place at his side, she must accomplish three tasks, each more dangerous and terrifying than the last.Pan's Labyrinth sports an amazing overall design, from makeup to sets to lighting and camera work. The lighting is gorgeous and moist. The sound design fits perfectly and does an excellent job of fleshing out the world. And Javier Navarrete's score, a haunting lullaby is one of the most crucial pieces of this expertly fantasy film. Ivana Baquero also deserves to be recognized, as it is her mature and captivating performance which drives the film to higher and higher levels.As the film finishes and the credits roll, you will feel as if you have woken from a fever-dream. Impressions, emotions, and memories may recede into the mists, but certain, vivid images will refuse to fade away. Ofelia, Pan, and their story burn into the brain. This is an amazing work of cinema by any estimation, and is by far one of the most original and memorable films in recent memory."	5.0	A masterpiece!	2009-02-27	2	1	1

It has been very highly regarded since its release, and the awards it has won include three Oscars and three BAFTAs""Pan's Labyrinth"" opens in 1944, and is set in Spain. Five years have passed since the Spanish Civil War ""officially"" finished, although there is still a Resistance fighting against the Franco's Falangists. As part of the state's solution, military outposts have been established to deal with the ""problem."" The film's main character is Ofelia, a young girl who is devoted to reading. As the film opens, she is travelling with her heavily pregnant mother to at one of these military outposts. Captain Vidal, the outpost's commanding officer, is Ofelia's stepfather and the outpost will become her new home. Vidal is as cruel, vindictive and selfish as you'd expect from a Fascist and Ofelia (unsurprisingly) grows to hate him. With her mother desperate to please him and provide a `safe' home, Ofelia's only real ally is Mercedes, the housekeeper. Mercedes, however, is anything but a collaborator : her brother is in the Maquis, and she helps them in any way she can.Luckily, there is the chance of an escape. A long time ago in a wonderful underground kingdom, a young princess dreamt of blue skies and bright sunshine. One day, she managed to escape her guardians and found a way to the human world ""up above"". Unfortunately, the brightness of the sun blinded her and wiped her memory. She suffered pain and sickness and, in time, she died. Her father, however, knew her soul would return at another time and in another place and he would wait for her return. When Ofelia follows a fairy into the labyrinth close to her new home, she meets a faun...who tells her she is the princess returned. Unfortunately, she must first complete three tasks before she's allowed to return to her former home. However, from the film's opening scene, you know things are not going to be easy for Ofelia.Despite the fairytales and mythical creatures, I wouldn't really say ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it a movie for children - it is quite dark and a couple of scenes are really very unpleasant. In fact, despite the fantasy element, the film's biggest monster is Vidal : poisonous, nasty, vicious and brutal, he barely tolerates Ofelia and views her mother as little more than a walking womb. Mercedes, on the other hand, is everything Vidal isn't - protective, honourable, loving and kind. However, it is an excellent movie overall and - so long as you don't mind subtitles - is totally recommended."	5.0	I believed in a lot of things I don't believe anymore.	2009-11-29	6	5	1

I'd rather read reviews on how a film such as this affected the reviewer while and/or after they viewed it.So fellow film fans this is what I think of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" after viewing it yesterday afternoon at a somewhat crowded 1pm sunday matinee. First off you could've heard a pin drop throughout(or maybe those were movie patrons chin bones hitting the floor?)anyway I had been waiting to see this film for a little over a year now ever since I first read a small article on it in Fangoria. I didn't know much about it(nor did I want too) all I knew was that one of my very favorite Director's in Guillermo del Toro was the meastro behind it,it had fantasy elements to it and that it had been getting alot of praise from critics throughout the film festival circuit. Now that I have finally seen the film it has by far surpassed my expectations wich were already of the highest standards. This film is an extraorinary work of cinema story telling art. It is truly a perfect balance of Drama,horror and philosophical depth. Guillermo del Toro not only masterfully makes a nightmarish reality run paralel with a colorfully dark yet truly hopeful fantasy world but he somehow manages to intertwine them in a way as to leave the individual viewer to take away from it whatever they may & for me that's finding  true limitless hope in the core of magic amidst a world of brutal reality(as we know it) that seem's to have lost both. This is a timeless film that is so complete in every sense of the word that in the end may very well stand head and shoulder's above all philosophical fantasy movies from 'The Wizard Of OZ' until now.I'm shocked that it has limited play in theatres,but then again when I look at the lost world that surrounds me I guess I'm not so shocked,wich gives this movie that much more meaning(for me).I know that saying this may affect my credibility as an armcheer movie critic(lol!) but I'm willing to take that chance and go out on a limb and say that to date this is not only one my personal favorite movies but with all it's film making elements perfectly placed & balanced just right it may very well be technically the greatest film ever made!"	5.0	Magnificente !	2007-01-22	22	17	5

The visuals and storytelling really are amazing. I won't go into too many details as there are plenty of movie reviews out on the subject.What I do want to touch on is the picture quality, which should be of importance for any Blu-Ray title. Reviews about the quality are mixed, mainly due to the supposed heavy use of DNR (dynamic noise reduction) on the film. This removes grain. Whether or not you appreciate grain in films (I love it as it gives the movie that ""cinematic"" quality) or hate it (some people feel it ruins the ""clean"" look of hidef media) this movie has been scrubbed. On the good side, it makes a very clean picture. On the bad side is that you lose some facial detail in closeups and skin can have a ""plastic"" look to it.All in all I didn't feel it hurt the quality much at all.

It is a haunting allegory set in an unlikely place - if you pay attention you can see the Biblical references and follow the line all the way to the end, where it becomes less subtle.If you're not into that 'stuff', it's okay - it's still a magical ride that is also a bit of a mystery. The visual effects are understated and lack the 'look at me' Hollywood glamour, makes them all the more attractive.The backdrop of the story adds historical realism and another layer to follow but complements the underlying meaning of this paradoxical tale of light and darkness.If you don't mind watching and reading you'll like this little bit of escape.	3.0	Refreshing, Imaginative, Different	2007-07-04	3	2	1

The actors all did excellent jobs in this violent cinematic outing, and the placing of the story in a dense, dark forest worked very well too. The main reason I am going out on a wobbly limb and giving this movie four stars instead of five is that to be brutally honest, I think Pan's Labyrinth left a lot needing to be explained. It has one of those plots that simply hands out what there is and leaves you no choice to but to take what you're given, sans much background or annotation of the mythology of its inner soul. It should have been a little bit longer and taken more time to make us feel more aware of what was at stake in Ofelia's quest. After the movie was done I felt like a huge chapter was missing. But did I like Pan's Labyrinth? Very much so. It had an originality that is sadly rare in the motion picture industry. It's also a movie that deserves to be watched in high definition, if you can.	4.0	The Most Imaginative Film In Years	2007-09-20	2	1	1

I think this film will stand the test of time, not only that, but right after I watched it I immediately wanted to see it again to see if I would perceive it differently (it is very detailed and nuanced).  Here are some caveats if you are wondering if you should see this or not: Are you expecting a ""feel good"" flick? Don't see this film.  Are you expecting a pure fantasy (yes, I agree with some negative reviewers who faulted the marketing for this movie)? Don't see this film.  Much of it takes place in ""reality"" (a harsh, brutal reality at that).  Are you annoyed by movies with subtitles? DON'T see this film (there is no English overdub, thankfully).  Well, if you're still interested after those last three questions, by all means, see this wonderful film.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	For me, this film sort of came out of nowhere.  It's not often that a Spanish film (with subtitles, at that) becomes all the rage in America, but I just kept seeing references to this thing all over the place.  Having watched it, I can see why - it really is a wondrous, compelling, emotional cinematic experience.  Many have dubbed Pan's Labyrinth a fairy tale for adults, and I think that designation is pretty apt.  A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that many fairy tales were, in their infancy, pretty dark little stories.  As often as not, fairy tale characters did not live happily ever after at all - in some cases, they didn't even live through the stories.  This particular film features pain and anguish alongside some fairly jarring and brutal moments.  Certainly, it's not a film for the vast majority of children out there, but I see no reason in the world for it receiving an R rather than a PG-13 rating.The central character of the story is a twelve-year-old girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an imaginative child accompanying her very pregnant mother to the military post run by her step-father.  The year is 1944, and Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is there to take out the remaining anti-Franco rebels hiding out in the woodlands.  He is an exceedingly cruel and ruthless man, as the audience learns fairly early on.  With her mother bedridden, Ofelia wanders outside to follow a fairy through the ancient stone structure called Pan's Labyrinth, eventually entering a circular underground structure.  It is there that she meets an otherworldly faun (Doug Jones) and learns that she is actually a fairy princess who lost all of her old memories when she ran off to the world of humans years ago.  Before she can return to her fairy kingdom, however, she must complete three tasks to prove that she is the rightful princess.  The tasks are not easy - but, on the other hand, Ofelia's human life is not easy either.  Her step-father cares only about the impending birth of his child (which he assumes will be a son), her mother (Ariadna Gil) is basically unavailable because her pregnancy has turned into a dangerous one, and she has no one else apart from a servant named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) who cares one iota about her.  It is not hard to see why she becomes increasingly enchanted with the idea of exchanging the miseries of human life for the joys of the fairy realm.Running alongside Ofelia's story is that of the anti-government rebels trying to survive out in the woods, despite Capitan Vidal's attempts to horde all available sources of food and medicine.  What Vidal does not know is that rebel sympathizers are hidden amongst his own personal staff - two individuals who will emerge as the two unquestioned heroes of this entire story.  Both of these worlds eventually smash together by the end of the film, setting the stage for a bittersweet ending that leaves much to the viewer's imagination.There's an amazing pathos to this film that might take you unawares, particularly if you are used to a steady diet of Hollywood throw-away scripts.  Pan's Labyrinth galvanizes your emotions and compels you to look beneath the surface of the mundane.  It may even rekindle that sense of wonder that you seemingly lost all those years ago.  It is truly a most glorious film.	5.0	A uniquely brilliant, visionary motion picture	2007-08-19	4	3	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3DGVB3T5QJNRE	Danny G.	"After Pan's Labyrinth was over I felt outraged and shocked. The violence in this film is so morbid and intense it was overwhelming.  In this movie you will literally learn the how to torture someone with the correct tools. You will see so many people have their brains blown out, most at point blank range, you will lose count. You will see the brutal murder of a father & son, a kindly teenage girl, a benevolent doctor, a man with a handicap, not to mention numerous young men. We get to see a rivers of blood while a women bleeds to death from childbirth.  A man have his leg amputated due to gangrene. Another man (who is merely human, in case your wondering)  is brutally stabed in the back, heart and face, and he gets up a few minutes later as if he just stepped on a tack. (Some guys have all the luck!) We even get to see him stitch his face back together again in graphic detail. (Sorry, I can't tell you more, at this point I was looking away).The world of ""fantasy"", on the other hand, is virtually devoid of all violence. This ancient Pagan world is, for the most part, quite loving and sane. A very sad commentary on Franco Spain during the early the 1940's. Unfortunately this magnificent ""fantasy"" world makes up less than a 1/4 of the movie, while the constant brutal violence and turmoil of the ""real""  world makes up the rest.Here are some of my conclusions: If you bring a child or an emotionally fragile person to this particular movie they may end up needing the services of a psychiatrist. THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR A GOOD REASON - EXTREME VIOLENCE! The critics who raved about how great this movie is should be on the front line covering the war in Iraq. Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic example of lazy filmmaking. It's cheaper to show flying brain goo than it is to create a maginificent fantasy world in all its complex beauty. Many of today's filmmakers and screenwriters think the general movie going public are idiots - nothing can possibly be left to the imagination. We need to be shown everything like a five year old child. The general public is divided in two very broad groups:  One that either enjoys and/or could care less about watching intense violence and suffering - and those who find it troubling or annoying and do not enjoy watching people being maimed and murdered.The movie ratings system in this country is a joke, and an extreme example of hypocracy. When Al Gore's brilliant documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" recieved an ""R"" rating for an under five-second scene of a Katrina victim's corpse floating on his stomach,  and a movie like Pan's Labyrinth gets the same exact rating - then it's time to radically change the movie rating system in the USA, pronto!! Perhaps, instead of  an ""R""  rating we could have two new ratings:  XV for extreme violence and XN for extreme nudity & sexual situations. P13 would become MV for moderate violence & MS for modest nudity and sexual situations. Meaningless PG would become G. Then those of us who don't want to read opinionated and biased reviews picking apart a film before watching it could get an honest indication of  how much sex & violence one could expect. ( By the way, there is absolutely ZERO nudity or sexual situations in Pan's Labyrinth! I guess sickening violence is more profitable!)I know we don't live in enlightened times, and  present day filmmaking is a graphic indicator of this unfortunate fact of life!

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film, but very dark and violent.However, as a big fan of del Toro's ""Hellboy"" movie(s), the obvious slant of this movie in the way it portrays the Spanish Civil War had to be its most dismaying aspect.After watching this movie, I did some reading about the history of Spain and the Spanish Civil War.Spain, like many European countries once governed by powerful kings, had an extremely messy and anarchic transition to democracy that started in the 1800's and staggered along into the 1900's.  Many internal wars were fought, and lots of people were killed in the process. The once proud Spanish Empire came apart and all of Spain's colonies were lost by the mid 1800's (unlike England and France, which held on to them until WWII finally bankrupted the home countries). Regional and political differences emerged as the result of this anarchy that threatened to tear Spain apart as a country.The Spanish Civil War was the ultimate conflict that resulted from this long series of internal struggles.  The Republicans vs. Nationalists war was a far more complex bloodletting than one can possibly get out of this movie.  Moviemakers seem to invariably side with the socialists, leftists, revolutionaries, or guerrillas in any conflict, and Guillermo del Toro has done the usual ""Hollywood"" or European Left treatment of the Spanish Civil War. Republicans = good, noble, simple country folk.  Nationalists = evil fascist killers.In truth, the Republicans were an extremely complex group of liberal democratic centrists, socialists, communists, outright anarchists, anti-Catholic church haters, poor people, Basque and Catalonian nationalists/separatists, etc., etc. They spent as much of the Civil War fighting and killing each other as fighting the Nationalists.During the Civil War, both sides routinely engaged in mass roundups and executions of anybody they did not like who had the misfortune of being caught in territory controlled by their side. Tens of thousands of people were executed by both sides in such fashion, and in all likelihood, the numbers of such executions were nearly equal on both sides.  For example, thousands of priests and nuns were murdered by forces allied with the Republican side because the Catholic Church was allied with the Nationalist side.  That part I found fascinating, and is something that is virtually ignored in almost all re-tellings of the Spanish Civil War.Now, for sure, once Franco and the Nationalists won, and started consolidating power, they rounded up and executed far more people. This movie does take place during that period of time, in 1944, when Franco was being threatened by a resurgence in the remaining Republican forces, since Nazi Germany, an ally of the Nationalists, was in the process of being defeated.And so if you were to just judge the whole conflict by looking at the scorecard for executed people, yep, Franco and the Nationalists sure do look far worse and more evil. But would the Republican side have done anything different, had they won? Their record for executions during the Civil War suggests that they would probably have done exactly the same thing afterwards to consolidate power. Remember Lenin, Mao, etc.? They led revolutions against corrupt, repressive regimes and were initially glamorized by the West, and then ended up murdering even more of their countrymen than the original regimes ever did. Had the communists (one of the main Republican factions) taken control, their history in Russia and China suggests that they would have committed far more mass killings than Franco.So many books, and movies, Hemingway, etc. have been made that have romanticized the lost cause of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War that all of this real history is what gets lost."	2.0	Dark, beautiful, and violent, and very much a revisionist history from the European Left	2008-03-23	14	5	9

What an amazing film!The director Quillermo del Toro deserves all the acolades he is receiving for this beautiful piece of work.  Set in the early fourties during the facists and bloody Franco regime, the story follows a young girl named Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother, arrives to live with her cold and sadistic step father, an army captain.  As an escape from the harsh surroundings and her mother's ill health, Ofelia begins to slip into her imagination (or is it?) to visit the labrinth of a Satyr who promises to return a kingdom in which she is a princess.  Once she has completed three tasks assigned by the satyr (and with the aid of his pets--faeries) she is told she will be returned to her royal family.Along side the story of Ofelia, we see the rebels fighting the facists and the troubles they face against a heartless and violent government. Though it is considered a fairy tale (for adults) this is not a Disney produced ""happily-ever-after"".  Then again, life is very rarely happily-ever-after.Beautifully filmed, with great effects and solid acting, ""Pan's Labrinth"" is a gem in a year that was pretty lack luster in the good film department.

The movie lulls viewers into a sense of fantasy, and then shocks the viewer with over-the-top violence. You sit down expecting an interesting, thought provoking fantasy and find yourself being abused.I suppose what really annoys me is the deceitful way the movie is marketed. It's really a violent war movie with some brief and absurd fantasy ravings from a disturbed little girls mind thrown in, just to put a veneer of acceptability and cutesiness to the film.If it was marketed as a violet war movie, I would never have watched it, and would not be writing this review. The fantasy components are short and pointless and seem to be only there to provide a juxtaposition to the extreme violence. I'm so upset about being deceived by this movie that I investigated returning the DVD due to the deceptive marketing. But it looks like Amazon won't take DVD's back just because the viewer was tricked into buying them. Instead I'll destroy the DVD as I don't want any other unsuspecting individual to be subjected to this disgrace.	1.0	Violent war film - Not fantasy	2007-11-11	48	8	40
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	Pan's Labyrinth (more properly The Labyrinth of the Faun) is the most imaginative film that I have seen for a long time.  The story is a beautiful mix of reality and fantasy - the reality being the grim Spanish Civil War that was grinding on in the remote areas of Spain in 1944 and the secret world of fairies and the faun inhabited by Ofeila.  The story of the film has been well told by other reviewers so let me say how remarkable the performance of Ivana Baquero as Ofeila is.  She was described in an article about the film as being 10 going in 40 (she is 12) and her maturity comes through in her remarkable performance of a demanding role.  Doug Jones (Abe Sapiens in Hellboy) is spectacular as the faun and the menacing pale man who sees with his hands.  Mr. Jones has a remarkable ability to play creatures and imbue them with life; he was completely believable as a faun from the first moment.  Sergi Lopez makes an effective Capitan Vidal, the true monster of the story and Maribel Verdu makes a great heroine as Mercedes. The casting of the supporting roles was impeccably done with Alex Angulo (just to name one performance) especially good as Dr. Ferreiro.In the end, one is not sure whether to be full of joy or cry; the audience is allowed to decide if Ofelia has fulfilled her destiny and become a princess or if she has been senselessly murdered. Guillermo Del Toro has once again shown that is a great storyteller, and this is a story that can be explored at many levels.  Pan's Labyrinth is a feast for the eyes and a thought provoking story that will stay with you and one that I am looking forward to seeing again.	5.0	An Astonishing Film	2007-01-02	4	1	3

First, the story was intentionally derivative of many other myths and movies.The idea of juxtaposing the ugly reality of Fascist Spain with a fantasy world was somewhat original, but overall the movie had a ""been there, seen that"" feel to it.  The acting is excellent, but production values verge on cheesy: grainy, dark, day-for-night shots, etc. A lot like the cheap movies Elvira used to host on the midnight movies of long ago.

""Pan's Labyrinth"" shows us the gritty and often gruesome detail that fills most of the original Brothers Grimm stories, setting it against a 20th Century background (Generallissimo Franco's Spain, 1944) which is hardly a pleasant locale either.Striking, if at times grisly, visuals fill all of the fantasy sequences.  The real world, meanwhile, appears as a place where bright colors often appear dingy, shadows abound, suspicion, and sudden, pointless violence wait around every corner.  It is a place from which one one might well try to escape in fantasy.  Alas, fantasies often carry much of reality with them.  So it is with ""Pan's Labyrinth"".One should not be intimidated by the fact that this movie is subtitled.  Many of the fantasy sequences in particular are largely visual and in others, dialogue is almost intrusive.  One could more or less ""get"" this movie with both sound and subtitles shut off--but that would deprive the viewer of a fine musical score which slithers through the background of the entire story.Portions of this film seem derivative of the work of Terry Gilliam, as well as Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth"".

And one should approach ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with whatever innocence one retains, even though it may end up sorely bruised by story's end.

This film mixes the two, with great success in certain departments, but in others, it disappoints. Clearly, the Spanish Civil War will live in the hearts of liberals to the end of time, always depicted in the same way , with virtuous liberals fighting depraved fascists. It is easy to turn the audience against the fascists; they commit terrible crimes like being mean to children, and even meaner to the cute children's lovely mommies. But how can you get the audience to love a cipher? For myself, I couldn't have cared less about the heroes in the woods, and of course I hated with snarling father in his Darth Vadar uniform. Instead, I grew intrigued by the goofy fairy tale animals which resembled the kind of weird creatures in Star Wars, only here they live underground and are menacing. Still, I loved the monster guarding the banquet table and thought his hand-embedded eye balls a real treat. Over all, though, I hated the Spanish resistance members for their goodness as much as I hated the fascists for their cruelty. The whole lot were losers. The story was numbingly predictable and unenlightening. Like the Cold War struggles in America between the evil McCarthyites and the virtuous Hollywood liberals, this tale will continue to be told as long as intellectual go into the arts, but for God sake won't somebody finally realize that the audience has moved on?	3.0	Loved The Costumes	2007-08-09	10	2	8

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3S6YZMZLUSLM0	Dean A. Anderson	"Fairies, an evil step-father, a faun,guns, explosions, Fascists vs. the resistance, tortureForbidden fruit, eternal life, blood atonement, sacrifice:the makings of a fairy tale, a war movie and a Christian parable, all to be found in Guillermo del Toro's Spanish language film -- elements that will certainly attract and repel viewers in equal numbers.Lovers of fantasy may be lost when they learn of the graphic scenes of shootings, stabbings and battlefield surgery in Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Faurn). Enthusiasts of World War II might not be pleased to learn that the central character of the film is a little girl, given three tasks to prove that she is the princess of an underground kingdom. And I read critics who were not pleased that with the film's Christian imagery.The film is an adult fairy tale, and the criticism that fairy tales are for children is addressed within the film itself. Ofelia, the heroine of the story, is told by her mother and stepfather that she is too old for fairy tales. And yet she finds within her fantasies wisdom to live in a difficult and dangerous world. The moral clarity found in such tales is occasionally scoffed at by some grown-ups as simplistic. They argue the world never has any clear heroes or villains, black or white, only shades of grey. They would also argue that only the material world exists and it is foolish to believe in anything outside of what we can perceive through our senses.I would argue that the stark contrasts between good and evil found in fairy tales can at times be found in the real world. In the Old Testament battles, God was on the good side in many of the battles between Israel and evil foes. During our Civil War, ultimately the side defending slavery was in the wrong. And in World War II, one side definitely could be defined as right and the other as wrong.And those who believe that there is nothing beyond ourselves and what we can see and hear, touch and taste and smell, they have bought into a lie much darker and devoid of truth than any story Disney ever animated.We are given a grim picture of what it was like to live under the repressive regime of Franco's Spain during World War II. The government kept the people dependant on itself for foods and goods. One scene shows soldiers dispersing bread to citizens, and as they do they announce that the daily bread comes through the beneficence of the government. God's providence is given no place in such a dictatorship.The very worst of the government is personified through Ofelia's stepfather, Capitan Vidal, a sadist shown torturing captives and casually killing the innocent. Those who would say such violence has no place in fairy tales just don't know how grim the Brothers Grimm could be.I found the most interesting aspect of the film was introduction of the theme of blood atonement. To avoid spoilers, I can't tell too much about how this theme is used in the film, but it is there, with great Biblical resonance.Hebrews 9: 22 says, ""Without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins."" This essential Biblical doctrine at times seems like an outdated piece of myth and legend. But by placing this theme in the midst of a war, a time when the shedding of blood is a daily transaction, we are reminded of its truth.We tend to think of sin as a petty offense that should be cleared up as one would pay for a parking ticket. The film reminds us that when dealing with issues such as life and death, war and sin, is not child's play, but we do need childlike faith."	5.0	Better Than Hellboy, And I Do Love Hellboy	2008-11-29	4	4	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	"Billed as a ""fairy tale for adults,"" del Toro's brilliant depiction of the brutal aftermath of the Spanish Civil War through a fantastical tale of fauns, quests, and a lost princess is far more moving than a straightforward account could ever be.  Bookish, creative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) finds herself at a remote military outpost when her pregnant mother marries the cruel commander, Captain Vidal.  Ofelia finds herself amidst men who don't hesitate to torture and kill and rebels who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for freedom.  The Captain sees Ofelia as a disposable appendage of her mother, and her mother, suffering from pregnancy complications, cannot care for her.  As Ofelia meets a insect-like fairy and a faun (Pan, in the English translation), she descends into a fantastical world that is every bit as dark as the one in the outpost.Through these two parallel worlds, del Toro manages to offer hope where there is none, and freedom in an unescapable situation. The relationship between the Captain's servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, ofY Tu Mama Tambien) and Ofelia is poignant as the two find refuge in a surrogate mother/daughter bond.  The chemistry between the two actresses is palpable and believable; without it, the connection between the real and the fantasy worlds would not have succeeded.Viewers who like more traditional methods of storytelling will likely be disappointed, as this film is darkly bizarre, with much ambiguity.  Those who like unusual foreign films (and don't mind reading subtitles) will embrace this twisted tale of a child abandoned in an unforgiving world.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"	5.0	A Haunting Tale of Lost Innocence and Brutality	2009-02-06	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1KZCR2AROPLAK	Denise M. Palmer	Pan's Labyrinth, brilliantly directed by Guerillmo del Toro, was easily the best film of 2006, and possible of the decade. If not the best, one of the best of the decade. Many people do complain about the violence, but it's not near the level of violence as other R rated movies, such as Saw or The Passion of the Christ. It's more disturbing than graphic or gratuitous. The violence is there as a plot developer (especially in the beginning with Captain Vidal and the teenage boy), and is there to portray characters. The violence level is probably on the same level as Flags of our Fathers.Moving on, Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliant piece of art that portrays ugly as beautiful. It's one of those films that serves a purpose. It's a film that takes you back to the early days of Hollywood (back when there was originality and people didn't want to film movies about murder or what ever was in at the time). The sets, makeup, costumes, etc are all top notch. It is a beautiful film that every future film director should see and study. This movie has heart. It will make you cry and smile, as well at the same time deeply disturb you and make you think. Great movie!	5.0	The most amazing movie I've seen in a long time	2007-05-30	6	6	0

Pan's Labyrinth is a Drama/Thriller Fantasy that's rated R and filmed in Spanish in its entirety.It's about a little girl Ofelia who travels with her sick pregnant mother Carman to live with her new Stepfather Vidal, a merciless army officer.  Vidal brings his new family to live in an abandoned mill where he can better, find conspirators and informers to persecute.Vidal despises Ofelia and her first impression of his exceptional cruelty becomes obvious.  With her mothers ongoing illness Ofelia becomes more cut off from the love and security she new and finds a world that exists beneath the mill.Within the labyrinth Ofelia hopes to save her mother, her unborn brother and herself from the brutality of the world above.Although heartbreaking, and perhaps hard for some to watch Pan's Labyrinth is an exceptional dark, sad and moving film that easily illustrates the innocence of children any place in the world (Darfur, Iraq, etc) using there imagination and fantasy in dealing with unspeakable atrocities.I loved this film.  Like most independent films it is devoid of Hollywood's constant regurgitation of mainstream, politically correct, censored depictions of  society.Pan's Labyrinth is in your face and doesn't hold anything back.  It doesn't condone violence but shows what Ofelia goes through.  There is hope and or surrender into fantasy.  And unlike the brutality of the real world Pan's Labyrinth's redemption is that it is just a film.	5.0	Touching independent film depicting a child's escape from war, violence and cruelty through fantasy	2007-07-16	1	1	0

Ofelia, lost in a world of make-believe and fairies, has recently lost her tailor father and her mother has remarried to give the captain an heir and to save herself in the midst of revolution at world wars. Ofelia rebels against the world as it is and slips into a fantasy world that the viewer never rectifies. She is supposedly the underworld's princess and lost daughter of the King of the Underworld. She is told all of this by Pan (played phenomenally by Doug Jones who you will later see as the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer) who also plays Pale Man --both of whom are the most cinematic characters in the tale. I trusted Pan almost as much as I trust Severus Snape (at least until this summer). I won't give away the ending or this on, dear readers.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2FEJIORC1MBG3	D. Hartley	"In 2001, Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro used the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop for his ghost story ""The Devil's Backbone"". Six years later, del Toro has returned to the tumultuous Franco era, this time with a twist of dark fantasy in his Spanish-language film,""Pan's Labyrinth"".12-year old newcomer Ivana Bacquero delivers an impressive, nuanced performance as the film's central character Ofelia, an intelligent,introverted girl on the verge of puberty who still clings to her childhood fascination with fairy tales. She and her very pregnant mother have just set up quarters with her new stepfather(the always brilliant Sergi Lopez), the brutal, sadistic Captain Vidal,a Fascist officer charged with mopping up rebel forces entrenched in the Spanish countryside.With nothing resembling love or affection forthcoming from the black-hearted Vidal, and with her mother becoming increasingly bedridden due to a difficult pregnancy, Ofelia finds an escape valve by retreating ever deeper into a personal fantasy world, which she enters through a gate in a nearby garden. This is not necessarily Alice through the looking glass, as you might think; this is a much darker world of personified demons and monsters borne from Ofelia's subconscious take on the real-life horrors being perpetrated by her truly monstrous stepfather and his Fascist henchmen.In certain respects, the film reminded me of 1973's (much more subtle) ""Spirit of the Beehive"", also set in Franco's Spain, and likewise depicting a lonely young girl retreating into a private fantasy world in response to feelings of estrangement from her family.While there are also some parallels here to the likes of ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""Spirited Away"", and ""The Secret Garden"", be advised that this is not your garden variety feel-good fairy tale with a warm and fuzzy ending that you want to watch with the kids. The fantasy sequences are closer in tone to Grimm morbidity than to Tolkien whimsy; and del Toro pulls no punches depicting the real horror and suffering that takes place during wartime.In the visual department, the director once again displays an admirable talent for seamlessly blending wildly imaginative production design and prosthetics to create a vivid fantasy world (del Toro's resume includes Mimic, Blade II and Hellboy.)I have a caveat: if you find depictions of soldiers being tortured and malevolent violence directed against women and children upsetting,proceed with caution. (I am aware that no decent human being in their right mind finds that kind of thing much fun to watch in the first place, but I see the potential for more sensitive viewers to become quite distressed)."	4.0	War is unhealthy for children (and other living things)	2007-09-25	1	1	0

I am not very brave, and I do cheat, so I went off and read the full synopsis on the internet before going back and going on with this beautiful and terrifying film. I had trouble deciding whether reality or fantasy were worse. The movie's reality Fascist Spain in the aftermath of the civil war is unspeakably brutal, but the fantasy world that lures our heroine in is equally terrifying and uncompromising. There was some terrific acting, and characters you could love as well as some sumptuous scenes, but the general tone is dark and verges on gothic.By the end I was weeping great buckets of tears for innocence and courage and thrilling vicious vengeance. But vengeance was unsatisfactory it doesn't undo the harm done and the ending was a lie - I knew it was, maybe you can soothe a child with that fairy tale but not an adult and that was a huge part of the strength of this movie the layers of storytelling and that nice sense of being in on the truth albeit one we would prefer not to acknowledge - even in fairy stories dead is dead.	5.0	Stunning	2007-08-01	1	1	0

The set designs are ingenious and supremely creative, the photography is lush and gorgeous to behold, and the makeup is simply genius.  This is a tale of a little girl who attempts to escape the horrors of the real world exploding around her during wartime.  She enters into a realm that at first seems benign and safe until her subconscious fears rise to the surface and her fantasies overlap her reality until she is unable to distinguish between the two.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a genuine masterpiece of adult fantasy.  There is a lot of gore in this film, so parents should beware.  While viewing this film in the theater there were plenty of moments that had the audience gasping and wincing at how much pain the characters must be enduring.  For parents who remain unconvinced I have only one thing to say, ""bone-saw"".  Cringe.  But far beyond the gory makeup, the creature effects are marvelous and completely wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that a minimum of computer effects are used in this film and the creatures are actually there moving, blinking, scheming.  The computer effects that are incorporated are blended seemlessly and add polish to the overall imagination of the film.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" slides easily into my top ten list of foreign films where it now holds company with greats like Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"" and Zhang Yimou's ""To Live"".

"I heard nothing but terrific reviews about this film and was a little reluctant with having subtitles. I found myself mesmerized by not only the story, the characters, the music, and the beauty of the film - that I could not only follow the subtitles but got immersed in the movie. I actually watched it twice in 2 days. There is only 1 part in the movie that was a little too gorrish for me [SPOILER] - and that is when the ""captain"" approaches a father and son... Trust me and look away as the father/son (can't remember), gets his nose bashed in by the captain and it's a bit too realistic for me. (39 yrs old and am getting sick of realistic gore).

This film is a fairy tale, of a sort, but it is too dark, stark, harrowing and haunting for young children.  For adults with a taste for imaginative story telling it is compelling.A young girl coming to live with a new step father is drawn into a fantasy world.  Is the fantasy real or just her imagination.  It doesn't matter; it is real to her and to us.  The time is the Spanish Civil War, and the new step father is a ruthless comander of government forces.  Against the backdrop of a savage civil war--aren't all civil wars savage?--this young girl slips away from the horrid reality and into another scary one.  There are brutal, violent scenes and scenes of great beauty.As one reviewer said, this is an unusual film, quite unlike anything you've seen before.Highly recommended.	5.0	Compelling	2007-06-11	4	1	3

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2X7VSYWZ0TFIU	"Dunv_i ""Dunvi"""	Pan's Labyrinth had something movies are missing these days; insight, and creativity. It is a harsh and terrible story, but beautifully done, and it really makes its point. I loved the way the reality and the imaginary started out so separate - but by the end, they led into each other, and there really was no border at all. It made me cringe in fear and cry, both of which I have never in my recollection done (beyond that one scene in the Village, when the man behind me coughed during the flee scene).In terms of general violence, this movie is perfectly suitable for mature children, but it really isn't. It's not even truly suitable for less mature teenagers. The way the violence occurs isn't the typical fare of the day; good guys whacking bad guys who fall without sound and are just gone, and the good guys come out unscathed, and every one loves the good guys and hates the bad guys and whoever heard of betrayal? In here, there are no distinctions. The bad guy has a story of his own that makes you sympathize with him anyway. Obviously good guys are killed because they annoyed the bad, and there is no honor or beauty in their death, they're just dead. And finally, children die. In wishy-washy Disney movies, if anyone dies, it's a bad guy (so who cares), or it's the parents (whom we didn't know, but still creates pity and sadness for the main character). The kid does not die.This movie is wonderful, and should become a classic.	5.0	Long Awaited	2007-04-05	7	6	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ADKHI1TUGAX4	E. Anderson	"I'm not really a big fan of the fantasy genre but every now and then there will be fantasy film that will piqued my curiousity. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of those films.""Pan's Labyrinth"" takes place during WWII in 1944 in a rural section in Spain. Ivana Baquero plays the precocious Ofelia who is traveling with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Ofelia is a big fan of fairy tales. She hides behind her fairy tales to escape the ugliness of reality which is her stepfather is a cruel and ruthless dictator.After moving into her new home, Ofelia is befriended by the kind housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), but more importantly meets Pan (Doug Jones), a faun who lures her into his world. The next thing she knows she is trapped in her own fairy tale. Pan gives Ofelia 3 tasks to perform before the full moon. All three tasks involves a certain level of danger to them and if she doesn't fulfill these tasks there are dire consequences. The sub-plot of the film involves Mercedes and a group of rebels out to bring down the dictatorship of Capitan Vidal and his men. I thought there was a bit too much focus on this aspect of the film but I guess the point is to show how cruel and vicious Capitain Vidal is.I enjoyed this film very much. I really enjoyed the scenes that involved Ofelia performing the three tasks Pan assigns her to do. The second task was my favorite. It was quite hideous. Doug Jones' Pale Man in this particular segment of the film was unforgettable to say the very least because his eyes were in his hands, not on his face. What Pale Man does to children who eats his food is even more gruesome.This film is dark, violent, and occasionally gory but whatcha expect from Guillermo del Toro? A Disney film? I think not. Violence aside, the writing was fantastic. I was quickly engaged in the story right from the get go. The first 20-30 minutes of the film moved a bit too slow for my personal tastes. Eventually the film did pick up pace and the characters quickly became more than one dimensional. The cast gave excellent performances. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a real gem of a film. What a great way to start off the new year."	4.0	A fairy tale for adults	2007-01-20	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") is a sequel of sorts to ""The Devil's Backbone,"" a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes ""Pan's Labyrinth"" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the ""real world"" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere ""safe."" Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.Half ""Mirrormask"" and half gritty war story, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie."	5.0	Into the labyrinth	2008-05-08	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"The remnants of the bloody, three-year Spanish Civil War were still deeply felt in the throes of WWII, and Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro captures the virulence of the country's relentlessly oppressive state in no uncertain terms in his beautifully realized 2006 film, a powerful combination of vivid history and fantastical allegory. Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen onscreen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.Set around D-Day in 1944 as the Allies are turning the tide of the war, the film takes place in a remote area of northern Spain where ten-year old Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen come to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal, the deceptive and sadistic commander of the local outpost. Steeped in her fantasy books, Ofelia is a child often lost in her imagination, and she is drawn to a mysterious stone labyrinth on the property. It is here that she meets the Pale Man, a pedantic faun who assigns three onerous tasks which she must complete by the next full moon in order for her to realize her throne as a princess of the underworld. While this sounds like the trappings of an optimistic fairy tale in ""The Wizard of Oz"" mode, it turns out to be far from it, as del Toro creates a purely gothic world of eye-wincing creatures and actions not far removed from those found in mainstream American sci-fi horror movies. The genuine power of the film comes from the way he juxtaposes this fanciful, scarifying world with the persecution of the resistance fighters and the absolutist, ego-driven domain Vidal has established at the outpost. Each distinctive piece of the movie brings resonance to the other, all the way to the climactic point where they collide in an inevitable way at the end.Looking a bit like the pre-adolescent Natalie Portman, Ivana Baquero brings a plaintive, yearning quality to Ofelia that is thankfully free of precociousness. As Vidal, Sergi L&oacute;pez effectively brings steely resolve to his role while hinting at the paternal approval his character never received. Maribel Verd&uacute;, memorable as the older woman in Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's ""Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n"", brings coiled power to the pivotal role of Vidal's house servant Mercedes. Also solid are Ariadna Gil as the frail Carmen who acquiesced to Vidal's need for a son, &Aacute;lex Angulo as a kindly doctor, and Doug Jones as the special effects-laden Pale Man. Special kudos need to go to Guillermo Navarro's striking, moody cinematography; Eugenio Caballero's imaginative set designs; and the special visual and sound effects crucial in creating such an otherworldly mood. Unafraid to show scenes of unrelenting horror, Del Toro has created what ultimately is a magical film so audacious in execution that it defies description. Along with Cuar&oacute;n's ""Children of Men"" and Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's ""Babel"", this film shows a true renaissance among Mexican filmmakers on a global landscape."	5.0	An Audacious, Magical and Eye-Wincing Epic of Emotional Power	2007-01-25	11	7	4

The warning came up that it might not play on all technologies.  I didn't do much research because I assumed PC/internet would be the first and foremost form in which I could watch HD movies.  There was no specific warning about how Amazon doesn't allow ANY PC PLAY OF HD MOVIES AT ALL.  Just that you can watch them on Kindle Fire, XBOX, PS, etc.  Why in the Earth would they not allow PC streaming of HD??  This movie NEEDS to be watched in HD--no SD for this movie.  I eventually got to watch it in HD from a different internet source.  I really wish I could get the money back I paid Amazon, but I have not found a way to get the money back yet.If Amazon is not going to allow HD streaming on PC via the internet, which should be the first way they should have made HD available, then they definitely should have included that in the little synopsis warning--as the first sentence.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PLMMVM7J0128	Ehkzu	"Critics loved ""Pan's Labyrinth""--if you look it up on Rottentomatoes.com their favored critics averaged 100% in loving it--and that's rare. It's well acted, beautifully directed, perfectly cast, evocative, deep...and I didn't like it.For one thing, it includes graphic scenes of torture and harm to children. You could say the same thing about Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, both of which I thought were fine films. But in those films all that pain was FOR something. Here, less so. A lot less so.Euros seem to believe a movie is unrealistic unless it's ultimately bleak, hopeless. But consider a plane crash in which most passengers are killed, some survive by dumb luck, and a few survive by their wits. Who would you want to see a movie about? What's the purpose in seeing vicarious suffering without there being some point to it. Like being one of those looky-lou's who slow down while going by terrible car accident scenes.American films probably do suffer from excessive optimism. Cops always get their man. Bad guys' bullets always miss. Heroines are always plucky (except in slasher movies). Yada yada. But there's a middle ground that focuses on those who survive/succeed believably, and Pan's Labyrinth isn't there.I'm not trying to get anyone to not see it. It's a good movie...except philosophically. It does make me feel for the Spanish people, who suffered under fascism for long decades after the rest of Europe had been freed. I can understand how such a movie might reflect their nightmares, given the way that awful regimes cast a long shadow over successive generations. But I don't want such nightmares lodged in my head--not without a redeeming quality I didn't find here.Spoilers follow--stop reading here if you haven't seen it.Ofelia is clever and plucky enough to slip the Captain a mickey. Yet in the end she just stands there and lets him plug her. That doesn't seem true to the character. She knew he was doped. She could have weaved and dodged. But the plot arc demanded that she violate her own character so she could die symbolically. Well, I hate it when character is sacrificed for symbolism, or to set up a big f/x sequence, or for any other reason. The Captain could have winged her and she could have imagined the fairyland apotheosis, for that matter, complete with the bleeding. Even more simply, the similarly resourceful Mercedes could have killed the Captain earlier instead of just maiming him. Someone hysterical wouldn't have slashed his carotid artery. But she wasn't presented as hysterical. Again, it seemed like plot was given precedence over character.Plus the moral seemed to be that Ofelia's working out of her desire to resist fascism through fantasy was all for naught. So is the moral ""Give up"" ??All in all, the symbolism comes across as heavy handed. The bad guys are bad-isimo, the good guys extra good. That's more simplistic than I care for. The Spanish civil war needs Clint Eastwood to do a more nuanced film about it, as he did for the Western with Unforgiven, which is grim to put it mildly but also has a redemptive quality this film lacked. And just as ""Juno"" in current release, is a more nuanced film about teen pregnancy. See that instead. Or get Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the TV series of course). See the denouement of the 5th season, where Buffy sacrifices herself to save her sister and to save everyone else. That's a good death.I'm still a little flummoxed at being in such a tiny minority about Pan's Labyrinth. I see what those who liked it saw in it, to be sure. But I don't get why they didn't have my objections as well.But even if you do see it and love it, perhaps my contrary view will be thought provoking."	3.0	One of the best films I didn't like	2008-01-06	40	28	12
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1TOH8S8I1VT9R	"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real"""	"Let me start by offering my motivation for writing this review.  I recently purchased this movie on my brother's recommendation.  I like fantasy movies.  I heard this was ""not for kids"" (a very dark film).  As an artist, I can appreciate the artistic density of this movie (I'm thinking).  None of this posed a problem for me. I was sold.  I read the synopsis.  I'm still good with buying this film.  No problems.  Then I watched it.D@MN YOU BOB!!!  I should have known better.  You see, I also purchased ""Brazil"" on my brother's recommendation.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again either.  Not surprisingly, though very different in context, these two films are very much the same in political leaning and emotional slather.  In fact, both films have nearly identical endings.Since I am exceedingly lazy and have limited time, I will resort to my habit of using bullet statements to convey to you why I don't like this kind of movie.  I will also avoid trying to write the names of people involved in making this film because I don't care (it's the film that matters);( I'll try to point out spoilers with these ***)-This film, like ""Brazil"" leans hard left.  Personally, I don't care how it leans.  It does have a clear agenda outside of entertaining us with a ""fantasy"" story and that gives it a deceptive smell.  I wanted the fantasy, not the political statement.-Unlike Brazil, this film actually has historical precedence.  This is probably the only movie about 1944 Franco Spain that I have ever seen.  In retrospect, I really don't care what happened in 1944 Franco Spain.  I think bigger world changing events occurred at that time (or is it just me?).  Even though I have plenty of war movies and if this were not sold as a fantasy movie, I still would not have seen a film about life in Franco's Spain.-Like Brazil, this movie takes sides.  It's so easy to get the viewer to side with the poor downtrodden ""rebels"" especially here in the U.S...  But when I step back, I ask myself ""What are the rebels rebelling against?""  In both films it's the established and accepted government.  Though imperfect or highly flawed, these governments provide infrastructure, economic stability and security (for a price).  The rebels usually kill perfectly happy innocent people too.  Making the rebels seam noble is a very cheap trick and I am not impressed.  Did you ever here of the ETA. They are the same people we are talking about here and they are considred terrorists in Spain today.  WHERE'S MY FANTASY?-In the commentary, the Director claims the fantasy is real.  I watched the movie and I have to disagree.  I know this is completely irrational, after all; he's the Director. However, other than a scene with mandrake root, everything points to the fantasy being an escape into one persons mind.  Escaping Franco's Spain.  Therefore this is not a fantasy movie, but a historical war movie.  What one person uses to escape the ugly horrors of Franco's Spain matters little to me since in my mind it is just a diversion.-Both films are undeniably artistic achievements.  If ""Pan's Labyrinth"" had no fantasy elements at all, it would be a very powerful film about life in the mountains of Franco's Spain (I really am tired of writing that).  Again, I did not really want to see a movie about ""Franco's Spain"".  I was deceived into watching a movie about you-know-where.-***Unlike Brazil, PL was very realistic.  In fact, this film was so realistic I could almost feel the blood splattering on my face as bullets whistle through men's bodies.  I could almost feel the bottle smashing my face in.  I could almost feel the knife ripping my cheek.  This begs the question.  What is this movie about?-***Oh yea, the fantasy.  If you separate the fantasy elements from the historical drama, you get a very short, scary, horrifying fantasy film.  Let's see, we get clawed baby eating monster with eyes in his hands.  We get said monster graphically chewing pixies in half. We get giant frogs that regurgitate themselves out of their skins.  We get a very creepy pan with a very irritating and creepy voice.  We get mandrake roots (very much like the ""Harry Potter"" mandrake roots) that require the little girl to bite herself to bleeding on it.  Wait, I just described a HORROR MOVIE!!!-I know many people just love to watch subtitles to preserve the integrity of the film.  What a load of tripe that is.  I had to watch one scene three times to catch all the overlapping dialogue.  Give me dubbing any day.  Done right, you can actually see the movie undistracted by words on the picture.-The villain in this film is such an evil SOB hating him becomes easy.  This begs the question; why did the mother remarry to such a jerk?  Of course, this just adds to the emotional slather I previously eluded too.  Why don't we ever get to meet the rebels torture meister?  I'm sure they would have had one.What's the point of all this?  What exactly am I getting at?  Pan's Labyrinth is sold as a fantasy film when it clearly is not.  You do get images from a fantasy world, true.  You even get grotesque fantasy creatures.  However, it's all rendered moot when the film is actually about the horrors of life during 1944 Franco Spain being so disturbing as to cause a little girl to take refuge in the fantasies of her mind (I don't believe the director for one second).  This is not what I wanted to see.  So I've written this review to give ample warning to those who DO NOT WANT TO SEE A FILM ABOUT LIFE DURING 1944 FRANCO SPAIN, artistic masterpiece or otherwise.  If you want to believe this is a fantasy film with Franco Spain as a backdrop, go for it.  That's not how I see it."	3.0	"Keep those ""No"" votes coming!!

Why can't we get that??? It stinks having to read when you want to instead HEAR and be able to SEE what's going on!  2) The movie is much nastier and darker than the ads lead you to believe, they make it look like it's a great uplifting high spirited fairy tale (misleading).  3) The special effects were disappointing. Even though some of them were quite good, I think they'd showed every one of them in the ads, there was no complete and beautiful world filled with cool special effects like I expected from the ads.  4) The amount of uplifting time actually spent in Pan's Labrynth was minimal. Most of our time was wasted in the depressing ""reality"" of 1940's Spain.  5)  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because it did have a good moral to the story, although to make the real point of ""the moral to the story was"" they should have rewarded the viewer, and the girl with MUCH MORE time spent in a blissful ""afterlife"" in Pan's Labrynth, not just had a token one minute or less.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AA7W0CFRXF46L	elfdart	this movie is a masterpiece! quite honestly i don't know how anyone could watch it and not get sucked in. this movie was told with the air of a classic fairy tale, the real ones, not the watered down versions we give our children today. there is an atmosphere of danger and suspense that constantly surrounds the girl, and in response to that there is a persistent arousal of hope, or fantasy. the girl's environment is not the best, to say the least. she is in some camp under the jurisdiction of some heartless man who has married her mother, and who only cares about producing an heir. everything around her is militaristic and hard and cold, and yet she continuously bumps into this other world of wonder and mystery, of fairies and fauns and the like. it's like the metaphor of the flower that grows out of concrete. finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.it's debatable whether she is actually interacting with this other world and that it exists, or if she's creating this world to escape her less than ideal reality. i suppose your answer would come from what kind of person you are and how you perceive the world. i enjoy the experience of believing it is real with a constant skeptic in the back of my mind nay saying everything the believer says, so i guess my view would change depending on what day you chanced upon asking me. the bottom line is that story is very well put together and whether or not you believe the world the girl is interacting with to be real, you'll enjoy it either way.a common criticism i hear circling this movie is that it isn't for children. to these people, i don't really know what to say. i'm not sure how it was advertised to you, but from the advertisements i saw i was well aware that the movie was rated R and was a 'fairy tale for grown ups', so to speak. i did still take my younger sibling, but that's something else. if a parent or guardian is not willing to take the time to research a movie or heed the ratings, they shouldn't be allowed to complain about what their children see, as this unwanted event could have been prevented with a little effort on their part.this movie is wonderful. i tear up at the end every time. for me it really stands out as a work of art against the back drop of the standard of movies we have come to expect will be playing in theaters every friday night. i'd even go so far as to say that it's a classic in it's own time, or is at least something to be aware of. but it's definitely awesome.	5.0	amazing!!	2008-04-30	1	1	0

I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been able to do so. Being able to see the movie without having to read the subtitles puts the film on a different level because there are words that when translated, changes certain thoughts or the flow of a conversation (in my opinion). I mean this problem will always occur when subtitles are involved, but knowing the language makes the film abundantly more magical in many ways.*I don't want to give a lot away, so I'll just summarize some major parts. (not all)In the movie, Ofelia, who is the young girl shown on the cover, is forced to face reality when her mother remarries and they have to live in the country side where the step father is a captain in charger of fighting off the group of Resistance. There, she encounters a faun who tells her she is the reincarnation of a princess from another world/realm. He offers her a chance to complete three tasks and in return she will be allowed to go back to her kingdom.The film is set around the 40's.	5.0	A must see!!!	2014-05-01	1	1	0

It was obvious from the beginning he was bad news. But the girl keeps seeing ""fairies"" that look rather like insects, and one of them leads her into the heart of a labyrinth where a faun gives her the classic fantasy quest information -- she's the daughter of a king and has to pass 3 tests. With these (weird) tests she will be able to make everything right.This movie was very dark and disturbing in an ""artsy"" way, which a lot of viewers, including myself, enjoy.  But do not think because it mentions fairy tales and fairies and magic that it is appropriate for younger children.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3S1YIQQW7AZO	EMAN NEP	"On the front of the DVD it says, ""On the same altar of High Fantasy as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" Hopefully by now, everyone knows that J.R.R. Tolkien is the writer that penned that famous trilogy and with the help of Peter Jackson, made fantasy popular again.Unfortunately, that little sentence on the cover of the DVD is EXTREMELY misleading. By simply mentioning ""Lord of the Rings"" the average consumer is going to think, ""Oh, Orcs, Hobbits, Wizards, Magic and huge battles with looming castles.""Not quite.Pan's Labyrinth is as good as Lord of the Rings, but it is not the same. It is like comparing apples and oranges. If you really wanted to compare Pan's Labyrinth, it is more comparable to the works of the ""Argentine Tolkien"" JORGE LUIS BORGES. And the director himself even cited him as an influence.""Wait"", you say. Who is this Borges guy you're talking about? And right there that explains why they had to compare this to Lord of the Rings. The average person is not going to know who Borges is, even thought that would have been a better comparison.Borges was fluent in many languages, did lots of reading and wrote many short stories and poems. One recurring topic of his (among many): Labyrinths. If you ever read some of his stories, there is some fantasy, but it's mixed in with literature. Just like Pan's Labyrinth has some fantasy, but is mixed with reality.Also of note, Borges has influenced writers such as Umberto Eco, who wrote ""The Name of the Rose"", and even features a character in his honor, Jorge.Hopefully after reading that, you will now understand what type of fantasy this is. It is not like Tolkien, but is as masterfully done as Tolkien.As for the movie itself:STORYLINE: The storyline is part reality and part fantasy. It is very similar to something Jorge Luis Borges would have written--thought-provoking and intelligent.MUSIC: The simple lullaby fits in so perfectly with this movie--especially towards the end. It's a little ironic, because a lullaby gives you that warm and fuzzy ""everything is safe"" feeling, but then there's the harsh reality.ACTING: All the characters did an excellent job at their roles. I was especially impressed with Mercedes.COSTUMES/SPECIAL EFFECTS: I tire of the big-budget, special effects laden movies that are flooding the market. There are some fantasy creatures (some of which look like they came right out of Jorge Luis Borges' bestiary, the ""Book of Imaginary Beings""), but they have a nice puppety '80's look to them. Most impressive was the monster that had his eyes in his hands--that was very original and reminded me of the oubliette with hands in ""Labyrinth"". Simple, but effective.Overall, this is a great Great GREAT movie. I saw it in the theater twice and out of all the fantasy books/movies I've encountered from Robert E. Howard to Tolkien to Borges to George RR Martin, this is easily some of the best fantasy I've ever experienced."	5.0	AS GOOD AS LORD OF THE RINGS, BUT NOT THE SAME	2007-06-12	19	16	3

I love this movie, even though--as some reviews have pointed out--it is a violent film at times. But, that is life. You want sanitized? Go to Disney. You want honest? This is your movie.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A146D2LYLICNLS	eric_f	"I saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" knowing very little about the plot, only that there was a magic/fantasy element to it. Although it wasn't exactly what I had anticipated, I found it intriguing. 1940's post-war Spain as a backdrop for a fairly tale...interesting concept indeed. Overall I think del Toro handled the story quite well, using various atmospheric techniques such as having the ""real world"" parts of the movie take place at dusk or night, creating a parallel between the fantasy world that Ofelia discovers (also dark and gloomy at all times). However, the transitions from this fantasy world to the real world and vice versa were awkward and didn't quite ""fit"" in my opinion. Also, I wish the movie spent more time in this fantasy world, as these scenes were simply brilliant in their own surreal way. I do think that del Toro could have exchanged some of the violence for more of the fantasy element.Also impressive are the performances by the entire cast, but especially Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia. I found myself rooting for her, and genuinely heartbroken at the end (won't spoil the ending). There is definitely a lot going on underneath the surface of this film, which makes it demand repeated viewings.Although I see that other reviewers have already mentioned this, I'll repeat that this is NOT a children's movie. There is quite a lot of aforementioned violence, a scene of implicit torture, and the f-word a few times. Any parent expecting to see a ""Harry Potter""-like film is in for a rude awakening, as will any child who sees this. Then again, the ""R"" rating should already raise a red flag for any parent in the first place.But all in all, definitely recommended."	4.0	Highly original and imaginative adult fairy tale	2007-01-16	6	4	2

There are too many tie-ins between those and ""real-world"" events to make this entirely clear but I do find the ambiguity itself to be a bit of a cliche.Regardless, I enjoyed every beautiful minute of it.I'm sure I'm not the first reviewer to add this caveat for parents who don't bother to check the ratings but this is definitely NOT for kids.

Chilling and wonderful all in one story.  Since the other reviews already offered a recap (warning they contain way too many spoilers) I'll just say that one of the main characters, the Faun, is an amazing creature that if he were real I would desperately want to meet him.  As a fantasy lover myself, I have to say that the depiction of this legendary creature was very well done to the point I truly believed it was something that could be real, and it made the movie all the more special.The fairies were done very well too, I like how they hid their true forms using a tranformation into an insect.  (Looked like a type of walking stick bug to me.)Ofelia is a sweet and charming little girl, but sadly lost in a very sad world she doesn't want to be in. I like how she was very blatant about the Captain NOT being her father, good for her.  That man could not even be considered human, and you will see why by some of the horrific things he does in this movie.  And when I say horrific, I don't mean cheesy gore, I mean truly HORRIFIC acts of cruelty.(I kind of saw the Faun as her surrogate father, strange as that sounds.)  Ofelia also deals with a sick mother whose pregnant, but I won't go into any more details than that for those who haven't seen the movie.  (But watch for an adorable little plant that must be put in fresh milk...)So many great things about the movie I could go on for way too long.

I wouldn't call it a fairytale for grownups... A fairytale has a connotation of something magical and childlike. This film is neither. The fantasy world that the main character seeks refuge in, is no lighter or kinder than the dark, brutal reality that surrounds her. Apart from the final somewhat-uplifting finale, the movie is incredibly dark and depressing. And yet, there's a unique sort of beauty to it that will leave your heart aching. There's little that can be said about it without giving much away, so just go ahead and rent it... It's unique, insanely creative, poignant, haunting, fantastically acted and stunningly directed.

Like most people I was enthralled by previews of the fantasy world. I actually didn't realize it was a foreign (Spanish) film until it began.I was not disappointed in it, but I was surprised. What could have been a truly magical movie was less so because of the excessive violence in the ""real"" world. So much screen time was given to the unnecessary brutality of the fascist Captain and his soldiers it began to feel tiresome. Rather than illuminating the terror that Ofelia (our heroine) needed to escape, it felt like a plot device that exceeded its necessity: ineffective and superfluous.Regardless, I view this as a must-own/see. Ivana Buquero was exquisite - I'd have preferred more scenes with her character Ofelia in lieu of the Captain's scenes - and an actress to watch. The CGI was used modestly and tastefully, creating a dream world you genuinely wanted to visit. Unfortunately you don't get to spend nearly enough time there. The score was well done but, like the lead and the dream world, could have been given more responsibility.

He intrudes into the movie (at least into the DVD) seeking sympathy for himself and his efforts: ""This movie almost destroyed me, almost killed me"" he says, adding that he had lost 45 pounds in the process. Please!There are two films here: one purporting to depict a corner of Spain 5 years after its civil war, the other a child's fairy tale. If you like cheap and vulgar violence, you will love the first movie; the characters (the brutal military man, the gentle, sick, pregnant wife, the good doctor, the maid with a secret, the innocent little girl) are straight out of the cliche cupboard; together they have all the subtlety of Punch and Judy personages. Their lack of verisimilitude is more than amply made up by the cruel, gory and pointless special effects that attend the cruel, gory and pointless violence.The second film is surely one of the most baroque and ornate productions ever seen, and its resultant effects are nothing less than gorgeous. The only problem is that there is no underlying story capable of supporting the paraphernalia. And that is a shame. It simply does not do to copy others (Grimm, Alice in Wonderland, the later Goya), to thrown in willy-nilly as many symbols as possible, and call that a children's story. It does not work that way.The two films are juxtaposed in the hope (one suspects) that one strand will feed?, support?, illuminate?, illustrate?, the other. It does not.

Audio options include ES and EX (New Line is one of the few remaining DVD makers to pony up for these high-end audio formats.) Del Toro does his usual thoughtful and detailed work in the commentary. The director also anchors a featurette in which he expounds on his theories about monsters, the power in the number 3 and how Hollywood ruined every fairy tale it touched.Another solid extra features Doug Jones -- the skinny actor costumed up to become the Faun and the Pale Man -- as he goes about his rubbery routines. Then there's an interactive look inside del Toro's sketch books for the project, dating back a decade -- fascinating to see how much of this came straight from the Mexican director's imagination.Another classy DVD from New Line, which nonetheless needs to get the lead out and bring the high-definition versions to market."	4.0	Dark and delightful on DVD	2007-05-16	8	8	0

This is very different from the Judeo-Christian tradition which has worked for two thousand years sharpening our conscience to a much more acute awareness of evil and trying to establish absolute rules of behavior."" Del Toro sharpens good and evil and enlarges it so much in the Judeo-Christian tradition that the Fairy Tale part of the film seems so out of context because as Marie-Louise von Franz says: ""But fairy tales only seem to be innocent stories. They are so profound that one cannot explain them superficially; they require that one dive into deep waters."" But at the end of this film I wanted to dive into the popcorn I had finished long time ago. I had gotten hypnotized by the beautiful visual effects.

Look somewhere else.I am far from squeamish when it comes to movie violence. But this film was so disturbingly violent that I nearly turned it off a couple times. Want some examples?A man gets his face bashed in with a wine bottle, and the viewer is treated to about twenty nose-crunching blows, blood spouting, the man twitching in agony, his father screaming.On another occasion, we are shown a scene where the Spanish nationalist captain is nonchalantly shooting wounded enemy combatants in the head. He finds one fellow who is still sitting up, alive and conscious, and aims his gun at his face. The man pushes the gun away. The captain moves it back. He pushes it away again. This happens a couple more times before the captain simply shoots the man in the face through his hand.And then there are the torture scenes. And the scene where one of the characters gets a knife stuck in his mouth and half of his cheek sliced open.Nice night at the movies, right?The trouble with this film is that it is billed as a fantasy, not a horror movie gore-fest.And of course, there are the political/religious overtones. If you know nothing about the Spanish Civil War, you won't pick them up. Let it suffice to say that the communists are the good guys, and the Catholics and nationalists are hideously brutal thug-like criminals. There is even a scene where a priest encourages the sadistic nationalist commander to basically kill them all and let God sort them out. Nice.I give this movie two stars because the fantasy element is interesting and well done. It is also slightly horrifying, but whimsically so. The movie has something of a good message at the end, too. The heroine, the little girl Ofelia, sacrifices herself to save an innocent. Unfortunately, the fantasy element only makes up about 25% of the movie and the good message is too easily lost amid the hideously brutal violence that permeates this film.Not recommended for human consumption.If you actually liked this movie, you will almost certainly likeKereboswhich is a novel with equally graphic violence.	2.0	Hideously violent propaganda film	2010-03-04	25	4	21
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A8V74RZY8TIRJ	"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher"""	"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is amazing to look at on the screen!  Being a Spanish film, I used the English subtitles to read the character's dialogue, and didn't find this inconvenient at all. I'm a huge fan of foreign films and am used to using ""subtitles"" from time to time.  The movie's plot is well constructed and the actors all give fine performances.  I really enjoyed young actress Ivana Baquero in the lead as Ofelia, who has many challenges set before her by the Pan creature, who promises her an escape from the human's world of war and violence to a Kingdom of riches and beauty.  Ofelia finds an ally in Mercedes, a servant of Ofelia's cruel stepfather, which is played by Maribel Verdu, (who gives a heartfelt performance) and the two share a battle in the ""real"" world, as the cruelty's of the Spanish military, especially from Ofelia's Military Commanding stepfather, cumulates into an ending of both triumph and despair.I was expecting more of a child friendly film in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I also went into it knowing that there would be some imagery that would be somewhat frightening to a child.  I did not expect there would be so much foul language in the film and the brutality of torture, up close pistol shots to the head, and the crashing of a man's nose into his face with the butt of a gun, wasn't only completely out of character for a ""fairy tale"" type movie, but was also very shocking, to say the least.  I feared the military's soldiers more than I did the creepy troll with the eyeballs in its hands!The 2 disc Special Edition is an enjoyable DVD experience and is loaded with interesting and fun extras.  Foreign film fans will treasure this clever and creative Spanish offering, and Fantasy movie buffs will delight in the wonderful adventures of ""the tree toad,"" ""the potato root-like creature that longs to be human,"" the Pan creature and scenes where Ofelia can draw an imaginary door on a surface with a piece of chalk and create a door into ""the other world.""  Each of these scenes is expertly done using CGI effects and is totally amazing to behold.  I enjoyed the fantasy scenes (as I knew I probably would) of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, I felt the violence was too extreme and the evil of the cruel stepfather, the military, and the human world in general, could have been emphasized without resembling something from Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List."""	4.0	Extraordinary Fairy Tale Fantasy!!	2007-09-10	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A36A6EWSZILTOL	Gale Casto	I bought this movie because I have seen it before and wanted it in my permanant library. This is not a film for the faint of heart. It is quite graphic about the civil war during Franco's take-over in Spain. It is mixed with a fanciful legend of a 12 year girl. It is in Spanish, of course, with Spanish actors and actresses, subtitled and I thought the acting as well as the story was excellent. The special effects are not up to our standards, but I think this movie is great. I know it was nominated and won an Oscar for best foreign film, though I don't remember which year. Don't make the same mistake I did the first time I watched this. It is definitely not a movie for kids. I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 16 and a mature 16 at that.	5.0	My Favorite foreign film	2013-09-14	1	1	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"".One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"".I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"".I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to."	3.0	Entartaining but not one of the very best movies from last year	2007-05-26	11	5	6

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1IKNL4MZ8NBBH	GDB	I had heard so many rave reviews about this movie I thought there was no chance I wouldn't love it. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed and angered.  The movie takes place in Spain circa 1944. It focuses on a young girl and her pregnant and ailing mother who is married to the evil captain Vidal.  The fantasy portions of the movie are captivating and are not overly gruesome unlike scenes I have seen in Harry Potter movies.  The problem is the storyline is so thin I feel insulted that the director would actually think an intelligent audience would fall for it.  Not to give away specific scenes in the movie, but there are too many instances where the characters act not according to normal human instincts or behavior.  For instance if you are told not to do something as your life depends on it, a rational human would not do it, this is just one of many occasions where I felt the story was forcing the plot to go a certain way it normally wouldn't if the situation be played out was actually occurring. In other words I felt manipulated and it was a distraction. The movie earns three stars simply because the acting was excellent and it was truly an original story not a rip-off of dozens of movies before it.	3.0	A beautiful dissapointment	2007-07-26	13	6	7
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1U6XPYATU9OPG	G. Denick	"This is one of those movies that just ""sticks"" with you. The imagery is so unique and powerful, I just can't seem to forget it (not that I want to). At random moments, I will think of scenes from this movie, seemingly out of the blue, and be prompted to reflect upon Del Toro's unique masterpiece. Another interesting thing about this movie is the foreign language aspect and the subtitles. The acting is marvelously realized, but the foreign language part adds a bizarre sort of realism that I can't describe- realism, despite the fact that this movie is filled with fantastic, extraordinary monsters and imaginary beings. It's just a weird, indescribable side effect, I guess, but well worth mentioning- I can't think of any other movie where I've observed this phenomenon. The monsters and creature effects are reminiscent of the awesome Hellboy installments, and they are simultaneously bone-chilling and awe-inspiring (this movie will give your kids nightmares- DON'T let them watch this, it's and adult movie!). The story line itself is heartfelt and executed with the utmost passion... these actors went to the wall for their director, and the results are indisputable. This is a rare piece of cinematography, to be sure, and one that deserves multiple viewings. Highly recommended- five stars, and not an ounce less!"	5.0	A feast for the eyes AND the imagination!	2013-09-21	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ATZ1LTONGHOP6	Genevieve Hayes	"I will start by saying that, technically, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. Set during the Spanish Civil War, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tells two stories, one of the fight between the Fascists and the rebels at the end of the war, and a fairy tale centred around the painfully lonely step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. The production values of this film are very high, evidently much effort has been put into making the historical elements of this story as realistic as possible, and I was very impressed by the way in which the director interwove the fantasy elements with historical facts. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the swag of awards that it won. However, after marvelling at the technical brilliance of this film, I did find myself wondering about the message that it was trying to send.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a very dark movie, both with respect to lighting and plot. Although the main character, Ofelia, is a child, this film is very violent and probably shouldn't be shown to young children. Captain Vidal, Ofelia's step-father, is a sadistic man who is shown torturing his enemies on several occasions. That aside, however, I found the whole film to be lacking in hope. As a child, Ofelia has no choice in where she lives and throughout the film, Ofelia is shown on numerous occasions to have little choice in what she does. All of the adults around her either want to harm her or use her. No one really seems to care about her well-being at all in either this world or Ofelia's fantasy world. Even the historical fact that the Fascists did win the Spanish Civil War, adds to the general hopelessness of this film. I just don't understand why the writer/director decided to make a film that is this bleak. In a way, I see this film as being ""Don Juan DeMarco""'s dark counterpart. Both films deal with people moving in to a fantasy world to escape an unpleasant reality (or are these fantasy world's real?), but whereas ""Don Juan DeMarco"" uplifts the audience, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't.Nevertheless, I am glad I have seen this film. As an aspiring writer, I feel that there is much that can be learnt from this film, with regard to how to write a very good story, and up until the end, I did enjoy the film. I just wouldn't recommend this film to someone who needed cheering up."	4.0	Technically brilliant, but I wonder about the message	2008-04-08	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A30JNG3N5NI4YE	George Coffee	"I tend to give good movies extra points for being original; especially in an industry where some claim there are no more original ideas.  Director Guillmero Del Toro has made a masterful film that should be seen only by serious film buffs.  And please folks with children; this aint for kids.  That ""R"" rating is there for a reason.The film: beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is first-rate, so much so that the CGI elements are blended into the film to the extent that you can not discern the real from the fake.The acting: top notch with everyone delivering excellent performances which is saying a lot because I don't speak Spanish.  The standout's are the Captain and his nemesis and the central character, Ofelia.The story: (slight SPOILER ALERT) as I mentioned before is an original tale that manifests its reality by borrowing many elements and themes from other genres.  I won't quibble with whether this is a fairy-tale or not.  That's up to the egg-heads in film school to sort out (or it's whatever Del Toro says it is).I will say that while the fantasty elements are prevail, they do so within the confines of a tragedy.  It is here the film really succeeds most effectively.  Del Toro does as good a job as has ever been done of weaving together reality and the surreal elements.As Ofelia goes on her various quests, meeting the new creatures and monsters along the way, I was reminded of the Wizard of Oz and Dorothy's travails to get home.  Indeed, Ofelia is trying to get home too, though where in fact is that home is the ambiguity that Del Toro leaves the viewer to sort out; though he leaves a heck of a big hint in the film (think of the scene preceding Ofelia's abduction of her infant brother from the Captain).And the Captain...that's the Bridge Over the River Kwai reference.  It's what happens when you drop a sadist soldier accustomed to brutalizing those beneath him into a situation where innocents are within his reach.I think this film will age well with time.  Hopefully the industry sees fit to keep it in rotation on cable and it finds a larger audience on DVD.  It's that good, and that's something I haven't been able to say about a film in a long time."	5.0	Brilliant!  Like the Wizard of Oz and Bridge on the River Kwai collided.	2007-10-09	0	0	0

This is great film-making that will creep back into your thoughts long after you've seen it - and it will make you embarrassed about that last piece of Hollywood bilge you saw. At it's core is an uncanny performance by a young lady named Ivana Baquero as Ofelia that is so honest and brave that it will break your heart AND lift you up.

I'm a movie fanatic, and I've seen and own a LOT of movies.When I bought this one, I didn't realize the dialog was in Spanish. I first thought, ""Oh, no,"" when I realized I was going to have to watch it with English subtitles. I'm not very tolerant of subtitled movies, but I was hooked within fifteen minutes. I forgot that I was reading the dialog while hearing it in Spanish.The acting was excellent, the cinematograpy was excellent, and the story itself was compelling and seductive. No, there aren't a lot of what most horror/sci-fi fans would consider ""special effects,"" but fans of fantasy tend to be different, able to create their own world during a good fantasy movie. I'm a fan of all three.This movie touched on so many subjects--the belief of children in the ""impossible,"" the lack of caring and the cruelty in the world, the rewards after working toward a goal and achieving it, and the value of self-sacrifice. I could go on and on.That being said, this is NOT a movie for children even though a child is the protagonist. Although it's not a horror movie, it could be very frightening to children younger than ~13. There are a lot of horrifying aspects that could be disturbing to young children, and most younger children won't understand the psychological undertones of the film.Absolutely brilliant!

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PR6NXG0PA3KY	Giordano Bruno	"Everybody's seen it. There are 650 reviews already. I don't need to recount the plot, do I?My take on this film is colored by my years of visiting and living in Spain, from the first time in 1965 until spring of 2007. The content of a film is what the viewer thinks when she/he watches it. I thought of Franco and of Franco's special church-haunted fascism. Does Franco rhyme with macho? Close enough. Franquismo was about masculine honor, including the very masculine honor of God the Father as conceived by the Franquistas. I carry a fairly passionate hatred for Franquismo in my conscience, as passionate as that of most Spaniards today. That emotion certainly colored my experience of Pan's Labyrinth.It's a film about the cost of heroism in terms of humanism. The two women characters are heroic in their loyalties and in their acceptance of suffering. The Communist guerillas are heroic in their stubborn and futile resistance to tyranny and brutality, but they are mere stock figures, scarcely individuals, scarcely at risk of self-doubt, mor eprops than characters. The doctor is a reluctant but unwavering hero, but he's a minor character. That leaves the girl Ofelia and the sadistic beast of fascist officer, Captain Vidal. The girl fantasizes heroism, and her fantasy is a story of its own. But the Captain is a flesh-and-blood human, the very worst exemplar of humanity at its most inhumane. Sergi Lopez is the star of this film, in my eyes, the masterfully acted embodiment of fascism in all its hatefulness. His concept of heroic honor, of the ""real man's"" heroic death, is the backdrop for every other character's actions, including the girl's fantasies. You out there in the audience? You want to understand fascism? Study Captain Vidal."	5.0	Heroism or Humanism?	2008-07-28	35	31	4
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3BXOADDSC4BJU	Glovely	where to start? (spoilers)-the pacing was mind-numbingly slow--I was desperate for the film to be over five minutes in-the characters are SO flat--I was only too glad that the Captain shot Ofelia in the end.  Not something I feel good about, but as a character Ofelia is depthless and excruciatingly daft.  Why she loves her mother, who is also depthless and daft, is a mystery.  (Thankfully, she dies in childbirth.  Again, not something I feel good about.)  Why she imagines herself an important princess of an imaginary kingdom (for in the end, the faun and the fantasy are proved to be entirely a figment of Ofelia's victimized psyche) when she is so intolerably stupid is another mystery.  For someone who is such an avid reader, Ofelia lacks any sense.For instance, if a Faun sends you to a place to complete a task, a place which he says is laden with rich foods which you MUST NOT EAT lest you disrupt a sleeping creature, you do what he says.  When you arrive to this place where the creature slumbers at the table covered with rich food, and there is a plate before the creature with two EYES set on it, you do as the Faun says.  Moreover, if the ceiling above the table showcases a series of paintings depicting this creature DEVOURING CHILDREN in gruesome ways, and if there is a pile of child-sized shoes beside the table, oughn't you not eat the food?None of these details clue Ofelia in, and she picks a couple of grapes at the same time that her fairy helpers are telling her not to.  The stupid girl very rudely swats them away.  The grotesque creature wakes up and fits the two eyes on the plate in the sockets IN ITS HANDS, and then proceeds to attack Ofelia (but not before gobbling up two of her poor fairy helpers), who is ENTIRELY surprised.-the real villain of the piece is the mindlessly murderous fascist, known only as the Captain--is it redundant to complain of a fascist murderer being one dimensional?-the fantasy element was a big letdown - the makeup and special effects of the Faun and the other magical creatures Ofelia encounters are fantastic, but they comprise only a fraction of the movie, the rest of it being the brutal actions of the Captain.-I wouldn't have minded the violence if the film had justified it.Ultimately the fantasy elements clashed with the real world elements.  The film was really a Grimmed-up interpretation of Alice in Wonderland, without the intelligence or wit of the Alice books and without anything consequential or moral coming at the end of a Grimm tale.Very boring.Worth watching once, but be warned:  you'll be clutching for something to bludgeon yourself with less than halfway through.It's so tedious.	1.0	so unbearably dull	2007-09-29	99	27	72

But after the first few minutes, I was so rapt in the story that I no longer noticed them.  Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale in the true meaning of the phrase--a story filled with all the ugliness and beauty of growing up and not made for children or the faint hearted.  It will linger in your mind afterwards.  And that perhaps is the trademark of a really good movie.	4.0	A Fairy Tale that Preys On You	2008-01-15	3	2	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3Q1BUKIKECJDZ	G. Morgan	I wasted my money on this movie and will probably just throw it in the trash where it belongs.  I found it to be extremely sick and warped, showing the most hideous and ugly sides of humanity and cruelty.  First, it's in Spanish and nowhere on the DVD case did it show the movie was in Spanish with English subtitles.  Second, it's very warped and the product of a very sick mind.  I'm capable of enjoying complex and deep plots and can recognize quality acting, direction, and cinematography.  A lot of fine production talent was wasted on this piece of trash.  Unless you really get a thrill out of sick movies like this, recommend you avoid it.	1.0	Sick and Very Warped	2007-10-12	61	13	48

My issue with this movie was the the horrific torture and sadism of the captain. Had this been toned down I could have dealt with it, and I admit I understand that in real wars folks do awful things to each other but I don't have to reward the filming of this behavior with my hard earned cash. You can horrify the audience without resorting to on screen horror. It seems that some of us have become numb to mans inhumanity and this movie is another example of it.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults. It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape: one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy.  Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting, mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged.Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen (Adriana Gil) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband, Falangist Capit&aacute;n Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;). Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth.  Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground, a world run by the Faun (Doug Jones) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place. Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth: the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy.Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors, extraordinary visual effects technicians, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale. The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting. It is bound to become a classic.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A259F4J3QOBIUH	"Graham D. Lincoln ""The Truth is Absolutely No..."	I had to purchase this.  I did not bother renting it, first.  After an interview with the director (on NPR), I was hooked, already.  I study Spanish and History (and many other subjects), so the premise of the film sparked my interest on collegiate levels as well as peaking my Fantasy interests.The author discussed his childhood, Mexico, studies of Spanish history during the Fascist era, then he explained how he infused all of this into the film.  When I purchased the movie, I was not disappointed!Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)lives up to the previews, interviews, and expectations created before its release.This film is a Dark fantasy, and I doubt that some children could handle the content but this is a wonderful tale.  The movie is very intense, and deals with Real World issues; death, female subservience, war, poverty, fascism, and a host of negative human emotions and actions.  Simultaneously, the Fantasy aspects of this great film give us a window into Other Worlds, and give the little girl an escape from harsh reality.Though I would not recommend this movie for most children (below the age of 11-13, depending upon their maturity), I certainly recommend this film for everyone else (especially adults).  Few people remember or care about history, therfore history is repeating itself.  This film could be set in the near future, just as easily as it seems to be set in the past.  This film will be eternal: a classic.	5.0	Not for young children?  Intense, Wonderful Fantasy.	2008-03-24	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3A4WQL80WOTMH	Green Manalishi	Stunning visuals like stepping into the 'virtual world' of Hieronymus Bosch!  That the tale is told in Spanish only adds to the mystique.  Seriously trippy - and violent too.  Watch a large preying mantis-like wood bug change into a fairy and lead you into the dark woods and 'the labyrinth'.  Yes, it could almost be a fairy tale - in the modern sense of the word - but for the violence, which is quite severe in places.  In that regard, it is more like the original faery tales long before they were Disnified, and which could also be somewhat gruesome. Set in Franco's Spain at the end of world war II, the story follows a young girl's entrance into a magical world as a cruel dictator, her would-be step-father, wages war against rebels in the forest outside.  Not for the kiddies.  There is a heavy kind of menace and violence that helps convince and adds weight to the story in the right places.  Bloody yet swift-moving, it is a tale cloaked in layers of art, symbolism, spirituality and * magic *.  What a rich tone this movie has - so full of dark and light, a masterpiece of color.  The fact that it is in Spanish (English subtitles) really does enhance its mystique and somehow gives greater authenticity to its magic.  A very potent movie.	5.0	Wow.	2010-03-05	2	2	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A242IFN64X6R4E	Grumple Dumple	I had not heard of this movie until I saw it here at Amazon. It is rare for me to not know what the new movies are that either are playing at theaters or are due to be released, but somehow this one got by me.Anyway, I enjoyed the story very much. As has already been indicated in many other reviews, it is a fairy-tale for adults. It is for adults because of the language. Personally, I can imagine that the movie would have been every bit as good if all the foul language (all of it spoken almost exclusively by the Captain) had been left out. Other than the gratuitous language there is the violence (again -- most of it attributed to the captain). A couple of the scenes were particularly disturbing -- but I will say that the language and violence overall tended more toward the moderate and not the excessive -- they were not so much over the top.Personally, (and this would be a subjective appraisal) I was just a little disappointed with the ending of the movie in that it seemed rushed at the very end. It was satisfying story-wise but the director seems to have compressed it to a quick few minutes when intuitively I felt it should have been explored further. I would give the particular details but I know that often people are irritated by others spoiling a movie by revealing those particular details before they have seen the movie.Conclusion:While it is not a perfect movie, I think that the average adult person very likely 'will' enjoy watching it (even 'with' having to read the english subtitles to follow it).This is one of the better fantasy movies to come along in a long time.In a few months I will watch it again with the audio commentary playing to find out how the director brought it all together. (By the way, there's a short prologue in the menu on the disk (lasting only a minute or so) in which the director makes a reference to this movie very nearly killing him. Perhaps listening to the commentary will provide more details about that.)I am very happy that I bought it.I recommend it enthusiastically!(Just a side note):I bought the Single-Disc Edition of this movie.My product arrived damaged. (The plastic center piece that keeps the dvd from sliding around in its case was broken and rattling around inside.) I decided to keep it though as opposed to sending it back figuring that the dvd was no worse for its violent journey. Indeed, the dvd 'did' play just fine from beginning to end without incident.	4.0	Not Perfect -- But No Denying It Is Very Good!	2007-05-19	5	4	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3R92UIGQC2KUT	habibaK	This is a really wonderful movie, sometimes in the US when we think about WWII we get so caught up with what is going on in Britain, France, Germany, Austria, and Poland and the pacific, that we overlook Spain... this movie is a nice gentle reminder that they had alot going on over there too. However, that was only the backdrop of the movie really. It is fantastic, yet down to earth and relatable. The characters are believable and the story line is great. The only problem is there seems to be some background information missing about the more fantastic characters of the movie like i guess, Pan, and the child-eater or whoever. I actually went back to look through myths and director interviews and things to see if i could dig into where this stuff is coming from, because it does give the impression that it is rooted in myth, particularly from the name Pan. However, i didnt find anything at all. Either way, a really really lovely story with a realistic message at the end, to reach your personal destiny in this life, no matter the hardships and distractions, so that you can attain paradise after death, whatever that is for you personally. NOT FOR KIDS, kinda scary.. I'd say Labyrinth and even Dark Crystal are kid friendly, but not this one... i'd say older teens (17/18) and adults.	5.0	really wonderful	2012-02-02	1	1	0

The message I got out of it was that this is a very cruel and unforgiving world.  The main character in the film, Ofelia invented her own reality in order to escape from the cruel world around us.

I purchased it because I like to see what is being done around the world with CG artwork. And this movie doesn't disappoint. It's literally a visual feast for the eyes, the subtle use of colour filters, the CG work, the sets, the costuming, the creature work is wonderful and refreshing.The story itself is well written combining fairy tale, magic and reality. And, as the previous reviewer pointed out, it isn't disney-fied, which is always a bonus. The use of the mandrake root as a sympathetic simulacrum to absorb the mother's illness with her pregnancy is a glimpse into the insight of folk-medicine/magic of the past, and I find it marvelous to see some of these things being worked into stories written today. Too often, the 'witches' of the old days are portrayed as hags. In reality, they would have been the healers of their day, using herbs and 'magic' to heal people, or curse them. I didn't say they were nice.Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful story in it's own right, and perhaps, not for small children of today's world, they're too used to Disney's version of everything by now. I purchased it because I wanted to see the CG work and was very pleased with it overall.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in good stories, good production work all around, and good cg.	5.0	Fairy Tales as they should be...

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	The myth and fable shake hands in this bloody and horrid chapter of a recent story at the front of war where rebel troops and military forces try to establish its hegemony.An innocent and sensitive child, who loves the fairy tales, open her senses to unconsciousness and so, to build a link between myth and reality, as a visible attempt of lyrical evasion and visceral commitment: She ignores it, but she is the chosen, the materialization of an old fable about a princess who never returned her kingdom.Once you visit the Archeological Museum of Mexico city you will aware why the myth and the legend literally floats and hover all that country.  And if you think it carefully, it just could not be other way: Mexico, the land which was witness of years of legends and ancestral myths, of first rate poets and outstanding thinkers, the same nation from whose entrails emerged Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz; who gave shelter to several exiled personalities Trotsky, Eisentein and Bu&ntilde;uel).Pan's Labyrinth is the embodiment of a long expected project that nestled under the mythical imagination of countless generations; an epic fable against the intolerance; a powerful warning about what's right and what's wrong.Like the primordial seeds of the mythical essence, a generation must die and that baby will represent, the seed of hope and the final outcome of so many shred blood, but enrooted and narrated with such conviction and expressive force that literally will capture our senses and unconsciousness with all the possible vigor.A real triumph of what cinema can do; and an additional evidence about Jean Epstein's statement: the core of all movie has a basic psychic nature.Don' t let this movie pass in front of you; leave your rational world and drive yourself in this hallucinating and superb visual spectacle.	5.0	"The so long expected ""magic realism"" carried to screen!"	2007-12-13	1	0	1

It is part coming of age, part war, part fantasy and part Shakespearean-like tragedy.The story is based on a young girl that finds herself in a war-torn place no young girl belongs, so her active imagination takes her away from it all and delves deeply into a fairy tale world of princesses, evil creatures, and extraordinary quests with a modern day, dark Cinderella type quality. Her hateful stepfather excels at playing his character, especially after I heard the actor, in real life, is a sort of Spanish Robin Williams comic. But you can't picture it when watching this movie because he so incredibly convincing as a hateful, angry, selfish character and gives new meaning to the term ""hijo de punta"". And Mercedes is nothing short of inspiring and one of my favorite strong women characters.That said, this is NOT a movie for children. Many people judged too quickly from ads and a story about a young girl and were rather unhappy when they expected to see a family movie for all ages. It has a few violent scenes that would easily upset young children and the general story line is adult content, even without a lot of harsh language, nudity or the usual things that make most movies ""R"" rated. Most younger kids would scarcely understand the deeper plot and you'll end up waking up to screams of nightmares for days, so do yourself and your kids a favor and if you're considering letting them watch it, view it without them first and decide for yourself. Maturer children could probably handle it, but I wouldn't recommend it without parents seeing it first. Consider that a strong disclaimer.It is in spanish, with english subtitles, but it is so well acted and edited that you won't be lost if you miss a sentence here or there, so don't let this sway you. It is hardly a typical foreign film with a winding plot that could leave you in the dust if you aren't a fast reader, or have you reading so much you miss all the imagery. It often almost seems like a good opera, that though you may not understand every individual word, the meaning is always well conveyed to the audience.The story itself is absolutely beautiful, and I could easily see it adapted as a new age stage play or opera that I would be happy to see. The gorgeous soundtrack is also a can't miss, easily competing with the likes of Oscar winning John Barry (Somewhere in Time, Out of Africa, Chaplin, Playing by Heart, Dances with Wolves...).This is such an excellent movie, I'll never tire of watching it time and again. It is brilliant in its simplicity, but doesn't drag, or spoon-feed the audience or have a forced happy-go-lucky ending to please the masses. I'd tell you more, but its definitely better with some surprises that are sure to take your breath away."	5.0	Beautiful and Breathtaking	2010-03-19	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A121660P9WJSER	"Hose Nose ""B-film buff"""	This is a great little Aesop's Fable-type movie. Set in Spain during World War II, it tells the story of Ofelia, a young girl who feels disconnected from life and seeks to find her way. She frequently escapes the daily boredom of her life and the terrors of the war by losing herself in the world of fantasy books & stories, but soon comes to realize that fantasy & reality may in fact be one and the same. She is mostly ignored by her sickly mother, who softly scolds the girl for stubbornly clinging to her childish &#34;fairy tales.&#34; Ofelia & her mother have come to live in a small villa deep in the woods in order to be with her mother's new husband, an officer in the Spanish army. Ofelia's only friend is a female caregiver working in the mountain villa. Ofelia is loathed by her step father, a brutal, sadistic man who delights in torturing his prisoners. To him, Ofelia is nothing more than unwanted baggage from his wife's previous marriage, another mouth to feed and, more importantly to him, direct competition for he & his bride's newborn son.One afternoon while out exploring, Ofelia stumbles upon the entrance to an underground labrynth hidden in the nearby woods. This dark, subterranean world is lorded over by a strong-willed faun, (&#34;Pan&#34;), who informs Ofelia that she has a great destiny ahead of her - IF she can successfully perform three simple tasks. I won't spoil it by going further, but suffice it to say that I think that this is a really terrific movie, with plenty of heart to go along with the enchanting (and often haunting) visuals. The faun is a delight to behold; totally convincing as a character thanks to some fantastic make up, a touch of CGI, and a truly amazing physical performance by the incredible Doug Jones. Hey, Academy Awards people! Someone give this man an Oscar quick!  Pan is at once forward, charming, mysterious, devious and at times frightfully ferocious. You never quite know what his game is, if he's a force for good or evil, and whether he can be trusted or not. Just a great, great movie. Some have complained that it is too slowly paced, but I think that's part of it's charm. Del Toro slowly lures you into the world he's trying to create, rather than jumping right in and throwing all of the best stuff in your face within the first few minutes. You have to be patient. If you do, you will be rewarded!The Blu-ray presentation of this film looks gorgeous. The colors pop and the scenes are sharply focused and the sound fills the room. Unfortunately for non-Spanish speaking viewers, this movie is only available with English subtitles. No English dub track was created for it. I cannot fathom why the distributor (and Del Toro) didn't oversee the creation of a quality English language dub for the film. Still, it isn't too complicated to follow from a visual standpoint, and the film isn't too dialogue-heavy, making the subtitles pretty easy to follow. My wife has a hard time with subtitles, but was so enchanted by the film that she watched it several times; once in the original Spanish language and then a couple more times with the English subtitles on. She loved it and highly recommended it to her family & friends. I do too, but want to again stress that if you hate subtitles you may not enjoy it quite as much. But for everyone else, this a great little film that has a high replay value. Another wonderful film from Guillermo Del Toro.	5.0	a masterful fantasy film from the always interesting Guillermo Del Toro	2014-01-18	0	0	0

It was dark, a little violent when it needed to be, and ornate.I personally love Del Toro; he is such a great movie maker. His imagination is truly awe-inspiring and this movie really captures the masterful approach to visualization and story telling that he is capable of.Now this movie was kind of hard to watch as it was all in subtitles; this isn't a problem, but it was a bit distracting to have to read everything that the actors/actresses where saying, but in this, it gave the movie character.Other than the distracting subtitles, this movie is virtually seamless.

If you have a problem with it being over-rated by critics, boy do I feel sorry for you. It is a film with ""down in the trenches"" politics, magical realism and an old school fairy tale with a credible mythology. The director himself explains that most of the material for the movie came out of his own imagination, and apparently, he is a decent comic-artist as well. This is a great 4 star movie, never mind the Academy awards it should have won.Regarding the English dubbing issue and the DVD, obviously the producers felt that the movie's artistic value would be comprimised with a dubbed English soundtrack. I don't think that they tried to fool anyone into beleiving that there such a thing on the case. If there is, then the viewer should take the movie back and demand their money back. If one judges the quality of a film in DVD format becase the addition or lack of a dubbed audio track, then more power to you."	5.0	Extras make it 5 stars	2007-05-31	4	3	1

It is an achievement that should not be missed by any serious film goer.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3JD07VHDLT5FF	"isala ""Isabel and Lars"""	"Mexican director Del Toro has made a film about rebellion against oppression.  It is not political or materialistic rebellion, but a rebellion of the spirit. The film does not have any of the Hollywood divisions of ""Good"" and ""Bad"", or adhere to any political ideology (""Fascist oppressors vs. Communist freedom fighters""). Del Toro goes deeper than that, and therefore makes the film more general, but also more uncomfortable: he makes a film about the eternal struggle between Realists and Romantics.Captain Vidal is a very unpleasant fellow, yet, he is a more many faceted character than the traditional villain: he lacks dreams. It is hinted at in the film that the death of his father traumatized him. Vidal now desperately clings to form. His society is a society of law, but without justice, a society of bread, but without caring, a society of either/or, but no neither/both, and, finally, a society of answers, but without questions. It falls down upon the man of science, Dr. Perreiro, to tell him that it is more than strict logic that makes a human. It is this weakness that finally destroys Vidal, he can kill, but he cannot conquer.In contrast to Captain Vidal stands his step-daughter, Ofelia. She is also traumatized by her own father's death, but she has created an imaginary world filled with fairies, wonders, quests, and dangers, but also with ultimate hope.It is fairly clear that Ofelia's experiences take place only in her head, but Del Toro leaves enough doubt to show the viewers that he does not want to provide any ready made answers. He might also want to show that even in the spiritual and intellectual blight that was Franco's Spain there existed magic and beauty."	5.0	Rebllion against oppression	2007-09-23	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AF0G67MITCN65	"I. Sidhu ""Cylon God."""	A young girl named Ofelia (Baquero) living in Spain in 1944 during the Franco regime is taken by her pregnant mother (Gil) to live with her Fascist Franco loyalist and commander stepfather (L&oacute;pez) in a remote part of central Spain. Her life becomes more interesting when upon she encounters a faun (Doug Jones) who tells her she may be more important to the realm of another world.My Review:Director Guillermo Del Toro gives his final film of the trilogy that really mixes and mingles fantasy and brute horror to unconventional ways. With 'Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone' now in the bag, his focus shifts from Mexican vampires and ghost children in orphanages to mythical fantasy and brutal war time horror.With the recent success of European directors conjuring up landmark films director Del Toro has come back and delivered a sophisticated piece to his earlier Spanish film, it really is his finest hour.We get to focus on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is nothing short of well played introverted child who' life is change at the sudden appearance of a faun. Del Toro proves his direction with child actors is yet again undiminished, his continous efforts to weave great performances through younger generation actors that seem to have refined talent.We need a baddy, and who is better than that of demented and paranoid dictator/stepfather Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). His personality equally matched in his commitment of a neurotic approach to ending the rebellion/resistance, as if he were Darth Vader in 1940's Spain. But being the stepfather of Ofelia suggests that with his current regime he'd rather care about passing on his lineage to an unborn son and half-brother to Ofelia. And you though step-mothers were bad.Supporting Ofelia and the tyranny of Vidal is maid Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;) whom is really known well enough for her impressive number of films in Spain. She supports Ofelia and her mother after a few distraught ordeals, however, never underestimate a lion is sheep's clothing, when given a chance so see what Mercedes can do with a knife.The stunning taste of fate playing into effect as this seemingly young girl, who was assumed ordinary is now drawn into a bemused revelation of that she is to be a princess of a supernatural world. Del Toro plays with the actual and imaginary aspects of a child in a sense that they become blurred, is this actually real, or is it that her imaginings runaway with her? It's hard to guess, you'd rather not go for the latter even when she arrives at an old mill in cutoff Spanish woodland, clutching a parcel of books filled with fairy tales.CGI delivers, it definitely delivers with magical sequences and real cringe-maker scenes. An adult tale dealing with the stuff of fantasy that is rooted in children.Verdict:You can never be too old for any fairytale. This one deserved the rare score: 10/10.	5.0	Dark, Twisted and Beautiful...	2008-02-23	0	0	0

Even with no prior knowledge, it quickly becomes clear to the viewer that this is a film largely about brutality and war, and about dealing with harsh reality.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is set in the fascist Spain of Francisco Franco, and revolves around the experience of Ofelia, a young girl who moves with her mother to live with the brutal Capitan Vidal, whom her mother has just recently married.Ofelia's mother views her marriage to Vidal as a necessary accommodation to  harsh reality. Ofelia finds ways to cope with her increasingly brutish world by retreating into fantasy.This could have been one of those films where the ""reality"" of Ofelia's fantasy world is ambiguous. I do not believe that is the case here, and I do not think the viewer is supposed to wonder about what exactly is going on in that respect.There is a theme in this film having to do with following orders, and how refusal to do so is the mark of humanity, but I found that theme to be a little muddled. Even so, the vision of the film makes it worth watching, and there are some particularly captivating scenes, especially an eye-less monster that apparently eats children."	3.0	An Interesting Vision, Perhaps a Bit Uneven	2007-07-11	7	4	3

Visually when it comes to the fantasy its amazing the monsters the atmosphere, everything great but then its lead by a war story that can barley hold a grain of salt.Generally the characters where flat, which I must say fantasy usually thrives on this fact I though found this to be annoying when the film worked so much on the real world rules.  The bad guy in this film the General is an amazing sadist but that's all he is, they're nothing else to him.  And the maid that cry that she can't do anything that she works for this bad man but does nothing.  And when she has a chance to kill him, to actually do something she leaves him with a knife in his back, know fully well that he would torture the little girl.  And all this was done so the director could have his ending that left me not surprised and disillusioned.Not only did the flat characters annoy me but also the battle scene make no sense.  So after the rebels rob from the storage rooms they have a battle out in the hill.  So here the rebels are on the top of the hill while the fascist are on the bottom.  The rebels have tactical advantage by being above them; they can easily hide behind rock and simply duck to get out of firing range.  But no they stand on the rocks completely exposed so that the general can have an epic scene when he runs up the hill killing all of them. With CGI blood squirting out of them.Further more this film is an escapist film, which after I got over the fact that it wouldn't really explore the fantasy elements I was ok.  So the girl escapes into her dream awesome but the dreams have nothing to do with her what's happening around her.  Its like she has dreams that are dark and the real world is dark so that makes them related not because the have repeating themes.And honestly I feel like this movie did better because it's a foreign movie.  If it was done by an American company it would have done well, but the movie consumers or people that claim them as educated people wouldn't have seen it.  Because its simply just a great visual fantasy with some dumb plot.All in all I felt like most of the plot devises in this film were so that the director could have his ending when the ending wasn't really that good.  But by making every thing work do that ending it ended up with some stupid plot devices.I want to give it 2 and a half, for the acting, and the visual elements.  But for the plot I give it 1 and for the planning I give it 1.If you want to see a good film see Spirit Of The Beehive, which is what this film is based on.  Way better, slow, but amazing.	2.0	its's pretty, but man it not there	2007-08-29	22	7	15

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AWA62LEJO0ZOV	"Jay Victor B. Santarina ""nssajv1976"""	"This is a story of a princess. She came from a kingdom where death and sickness does not exist. Against the forboding of her father, the princess ventured into the world of Men. When she got there, she lost all memory of who she was and her noble beginning. Being in the company of mortals, she suffered their fate and did eventually die. Her father awaits her return, even if she comes back in a different body.Jump straight forward through mythical timeline, into the time of Revolution in Spain, a girl named Ofelia was born. She was the daughter of a tailor and an ordinary maiden.Ofelia's father died.Her mother decided to re-marry. Her mother married a Captain of the spanish army who was stationed in an area that has a lot rebellious sentiment. Ofelia's mom got pregnant and was supposed to be carrying a baby boy. On her last month of being pregnant, Ofelia's mom had to leave the city and join the captain in a garrison located in the midst of a forrest. The journey from the city to the garrison put strain on the already difficult pregnancy of Ofelia's Mom. The captain knew that the long travel from the city to the garrison could put his wife's life in perril, but he has a selfish need to be there when his son is born.The garrison is located in the midst of an ancient forrest with ruins that date back to mythical antiquity. In one of these ruins, Ofelia met a Faun who has decided that she was indeed the lost daughter of his King.Ofelia, living a life full of uncertainty (no father to claim her own, her mother's life dangling in the brink of mortality, and the option of being raised by an egoistic, self-righteous, intolerant, and cold supremacist-The Captain), decided to swallow her fears and buy into the Faun's story. There were 3 test that Ofelia had to undergo to find out if her true noble self was left intact after having so many incarnations. She did pass all test and lived happily ever after.Yeah right!I wish it was that simple to summarize the story that is ""Pan's Labrynth"". In essence it is, but so much more. The 3 test that Ofelia has to undergo indeed prove that she is noble, and then some. She is pure, innocent, care-free and truly royal.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3PY6F86916D1O	J. Belano	I gave this 3 stars because I was totally misled by the advertising...  Firstly, this movie is all in Spanish, a fact that is NOT made clear in the packaging or the advertising.  However, I did overcome this very slight inconvenience, and the subtitles became nearly transparent.  Secondly, this movie is touted  as a fantasy movie, which may imply the same genre as Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter, but from the very beginning, it was made clear that this movie was going to be graphic and violent.  So again, I was caught off guard.Switching gears, the storyline itself was hopeful - about a little girl who escapes the oppression of her reality through a fantasy world she created, or did she?  The movie keeps you guessing.  I enjoyed the juxtapositioning of a dark and hopeless reality with the visually stunning world of Ofelia's fantasy, yet it bothers me that the fantasy world, at times, was just as graphically violent as her reality.Maybe I need to watch Disk 2 to get a better understanding and gain more appreciation for the movie...So, I've watched Disk 2, and I've watched the movie again, and I've developed a deeper appreciation for the movie in its entirety.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"For an intense experience that is beyond easy categorization, there are few films that equal the extraordinary experience that is ""Pan's Labyrinth.""Set in post-civil war Spain, in 1944, the film focuses on a small outpost of Franco's army stalking remnants of rebel groups operating in the hills. The leader of the government force is Captain Vidal, and the film begins with the arrival in camp of his pregnant wife. His wife is accompanied by Ofelia, her daughter by another man, now deceased, by what manner is not told. The girl is a bookworm and fond of fairy stories. After finding an odd stone in the road, she activates a magical process that awakens the interest of a curious, clicking insect, which she regards as a fairy and follows her to camp. The camp itself is a cauldron of intrigue, with suspicious soldiers rounding up and intimidating peasants and locals seemingly in cahoots with the rebels. Ofelia's mother is soon sidelined with complications of the pregnancy, and Ofelia becomes more and more entangled  in a mysterious and fantastic underground world. She meets a faun, a sort of goat-horned semi-deity, who takes Ofelia for the daughter of a king. The faun gives Ofelia a book and a series of tasks that she must perform to demonstrate her royal credentials.Pan's Labyrinth is frightening and violent -- on both sides of the magical divide. The major question running through the film is the relation of the realms to one another. Is the fairy realm real? Or is it a figment of Ofelia's fragile imagination? It's not giving much away to suggest that this question will not bee resolved by the end of the film. Arguing against the idea that Ofelia seeks refuge in fairyland is that the creatures she meets there are as ugly, murderous and demanding as the ones in her real life. If anything, the creatures offer nightmarish parallels to the characters above ground. What differentiates the two realms is that ultimately, the fairy world, though subject to harsh and uncompromising laws, is ultimately benign and intends only good on those who abide by its rules. The world above is harsh too, but wishes only to dominate and terrorize its subjects, not to rule them justly.The film is a luscious feast of images from beginning to end. The Captain, a malevolent and dictatorial man, is seen gently oiling a watch that may have been his father's. The faun, wise and kind in the moonlight, gently brushes Ofelia's face with his long, twiglike fingers. An underground ogre, with eyes in the palms of his hands, holds his eyes up to his face, fingers spread into a frightening fringe. The films' effects are mostly well-handled, with fairies flitting noisily about and graphic violence and torture convincingly portrayed.Pan's Labyrinth does not offer up an easy solution for the problems it poses. It offers up a complex and many-layered ending that is hard to comprehend as a clear-cut victory for any side. If anything, it parallels the world wee all live in, in which victory is a distant goal, even an illusion, that empowers and propels action, and in which the events of any single day cannot always be seen as trending to our good or our ill. Pan's Labyrinth is about one girl's determined desire to respond with openness to her world, with all of its ugliness and beauty, come what may.Despite its fairytale subject matter, the movie is not for kids. It well ddesserves its R rating for graphic violence, including an amputation, executions and field surgery."	5.0	A beautiful and scary alternate world	2007-09-20	3	1	2

She is able to complete these tasks but after both she ends up disappointing someone. This may represent the struggle between personality and conformity. Whatever Ofelia does she is unable to feel accepted, she is unable to accept herself without her imagination but she is forced to believe he imagination is a bad thing. The trials are just part of the pieces, while she finishes them she is always reprimanded because she has done something wrong making her unable to be proud of her accomplishments.	5.0	An All Around Great Film	2014-05-29	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AQ38OU6SRFGU5	"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid"""	"Pan's Labyrinth is a true masterwork of fantasy storytelling.  This has the same sprit of ""Tideland"" and what the film ""Mirror mask"" should have been. Pan's Labyrinth, like other for-mentioned films, relies on the imagination of a young girl and the innocence of youth and how that innocence can overcome great strife, chaos and misery.  Pan's Labyrinth is brutal without being overly graphic and creepy with making you too uncomfortable.  The creepiest parts are not with the fantasy characters but the scene with the Tyrant Stepfather.This movie is not ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy and really does a lot with very little.  It's a great mesh of a reality period piece set in the 1940's and a fantasy epic with strange creatures. This is the best foreign language film of 2006 and one of the best films you'll see from the last year.  Del Toro created a masterpiece in a heartfelt story about a young girl trying to make since of her world and do what's right for her ailing mother.The fact that this movie almost didn't get made is amazing in it's self.  Due to productions costs and financial problems that required the director /producer to not only cut out his own salary but invest his own money on top of that to get this project off the ground.  You can see why the director felt so passionately about this film and wanted to see his vision come to fruition.I loved this film and highly recommend it to anyone"	5.0	Fantastic fable for an older audience	2007-08-04	2	2	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1LQLQUJJZUBTC	Jeff  Farrow	"The beauty & depth of meaning in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was an inspiring revelation that gave my flagging sense of  hope a real boost. It's a like a leftwing fairy tale: Rosa Luxemburg meets insurgent Alice in Wonderland having tea with Trotsky battling fascist reactionaries in The Secret Garden guarded by The Magus reading books by Marx--while thumbing through Madame Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled.I loved it.The fascist antagonists are allowed to speak for themselves.The subtitles are well done & that's important because the film is like an incantation, the sound of the language (Spanish) is a vital element. The music is original & beautiful, and the acting & direction as good as it gets.The girl who plays an almost reluctant heroine, becomes a Saviour/Redeemer figure, and like Christ, she sheds her blood in order to install a higher level of physical existence through the completion of an spiritual quest. Another, almost Jungian image, is discovered near the end of the film when the girl is carrying her baby half-brother wrapped up in swaddling cloth through the labyrinth; I immediately thought of The Changling motif in which the Little People would take a beautiful human baby and replace it with a troll (doesn't turn out this way in the movie.)The message?

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1EJS4X0KJ9MZH	"Jeffrey A. Friedberg ""Expert On All Things"""	"This is neither about Pan, nor his labyrinth. Beautifully done, brilliantly acted and scripted, this is a dark drama of two tales.An evil Captain wants to wipe out the commie partisans in his sector, but obstacles are placed before him by the altruistic housekeeper and physician of his compound, sited somewhere in a wooded area of Spain, in 1944. He also wants his male child to be born there with him, at all costs, including that of the mother's life, if necessary, he tells the doctor.A little girl, his stepdaughter, wants to see her mother's pregnancy-gone-bad come to a happy end, as well as find her own bliss, but crosses an exceedingly thin line between fantasy and reality, or psychosis and the brutality of living.The Captain ruthlessly murders any partisans--or even suspects whom he finds, and mistreats virtually everyone else not wearing the same uniform he does. He makes ordinary ""evil"" look like a Girl Scout cookie sale.The little girl becomes involved with a Faun, of dubious character--bad--good--what is it--who lives in a subterranean labyrinth, which we don't see much of, faeries, a magic book, a very scary monstrosity who forever dines at an untouchable banquet, and a horrible enchanted toad who deadens the roots of a great and mystic tree.So, we have two story lines, several Heroines/Heroes, and one very bad Nemesis, all working toward a final and central denouement which is handled with a startling lack of sentimentality, and a twist that left me wondering.The two plots merge for the denouement, via the newborn baby, whom everyone wants for their own end: the little girl, the evil Captain, the housekeeper, and even the Faun.The director never shows us for certain whether the little girl imagines everything that is magical, or it is all somehow real. I would like to think that by leaving out the True of it, as such an obviously open question, it was all real.However, in the same manner, the question's white-hot and glaring lack of resolution seems a cop-out. I think the ending needed a tad more development to make the central question more tastily nebulous.This movie is a dark, brilliant, and stunning little success. It is NOT for children at all."	5.0	Man's Labyrinth	2007-07-04	6	6	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2BC978GQQEA2A	Jeffrey Pidgeon	"""Pan's Labyrinth"", written and directed by Guillermo del Toro.The story of a child's journey through a fantasy world has a long tradition, both in literature and film. There's dozens of variations - ""The Wizard Of Oz"", ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", the ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Neverending Story"", ""Labyrinth"", ""The Phantom Tollbooth"", ""Tideland"", and many more. It's a difficult genre, as many of these stories are episodic, and wind up a treat for the eyes, but a disappointment for the mind and heart. ""Pan's Labyrinth"", from the look of its early trailers, promised to apply a unique perspective.Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) accompanies her stepfather Capit&aacute;n Vidal and mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a remote outpost in Spain. Carmen is pregnant, but in the tradition of evil step-parents, he cares little for his wife or step-daughter, focusing completely upon his military manuvers and his soon-to-be-born son.As you might imagine, Ofelia is a bookish dreamer, and it isn't long before she encounters fairies (disguised as large, chattering mantises) who lead her to the titular maze. There she learns from an ancient satyr that she may be the princess of an underground kingdom. In order to prover her worth, she needs to complete three tasks, each of which are hidden in a mysterious tome.The civil war in Spain is over (for the most part), and for the time being the fascists have the upper hand. There's a band of insurgents sequestered in the woods, though, and the Capit&aacute;n has taken it upon himself to stay until all of them are exterminated. In fact, he seems to see little value in human life in general, callously torturing and murdering anyone whom he suspects may be a rebel. The insurgents seem to know quite a bit about the outpost, so one of the main objectives is to discover where their information is coming from.It's an interesting concept to intertwine these two ideas, but the execution is something else again. The film seems lopsided, heavily favoring the military informant plot over Ofelia's quest. It's a grim, gory exercise; Mr. Del Toro subjects the audience to a high degree of violence - several on-screen shootings (in the face), cheeks are slit open and later sewn shut, noses are battered to a pulp. Carmen's pregnancy is perilous, perpetually teetering on the brink of a bloody miscarriage; and if there's anything pretty in the film, you can be sure it'll be filthy and ruined soon enough. To be sure, this is in the tradition of many original fairy tales, which are far darker than their modern incarnations. While I'm all for grit in my storytelling, the filmmakers go so far here that it feels inappropriate and gratuitous.This might have worked if the fantasy sequences functioned as an escape for Ofelia and the audience, as they do in its spiritual counterpart, ""Brazil"". But they don't - they're more imaginative, but just as unnerving and disgusting. There's no real contrast in tone between the stories - in spite of the richness of visual invention, neither world seems inviting or attractive. None of the fantasy characters have much in the way of personality - they seem to exist primarily as thresholds to be encountered. There's not much to be gained by performing their tasks, either - Ofelia's experiences have little impact on her 'real' life, and any consequences of navigating the maze seem disconnected from the rest of the story.Mr. Del Toro can have trouble with pacing, and it's a big problem here as well. The tone and intensity of the film are difficult enough, but it's also a two-and-a-half hour story that feels like three. Like many films these days, I think it'd be better told in two.Ultimately, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" seems to be reaching for religious parable - a bludgeoning life of tears, with the promise of eternal reward. But it's not at all subtle with that goal, but rather a grueling journey with little to delight along the way.Cynical Appraisal: Should do gangbusters with ther Hot Topic crowd."	2.0	Life Sucks, And So Do Your Dreams	2006-12-21	54	29	25
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1RSXP7MB772E3	"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji"""	Pan's LabyrinthBy Guillermo Del ToroPan's Labyrinth, or El Labyrinth del Fauno, is so calm in the beginning that it draws you into thinking that perhaps you have awoken to some chimera, some angelic mistep into a dream. But only in reality is there the aweful possiblity that even this child can be slaughtered. The misery unfolds as the blood creeping from a little girls nose, that it's artistic, and you think how beautiful it is, serves as a dose of reality, cold reality.There is aweful violence in Pan's Labyrinth, and you should be aware of that. Seeing that beautiful girls face is not a sign of things to come, it serves as a counter to deaths disgusting face. And never before have I seen death walk hand in hand with fantasy. We have had bed time stories told to us when we were little. Little red riding hood was close to being killed, but she got away. There was always some danger to those tales. And other tales, such as the ginger bread man, hint at something more brutal, lying on that border of childhood and adulthood.This film follows the Gestalt principle that the sum of its parts is greater than its whole. You analyze the acting down to the maids, and it is all working. Ivanka Baquero is a child that expresses sorrow and a yearning for life. She feels the weight of a world at war, yet the child nature in her blooms before us as she follows her instincts to solve questions that may be of her own sanity.This movie draws you into it, and you want to discover the details, and you pray that they don't let you down. And Guillermo Del Toro does not. The phases of the moon, can play behind the gripping story, yet it has its own part of the story to tell as well. It is incredible to me, that after owning this movie for so long, that the beauty of the film and wonder has not been lost to me. Pan's Labyrinth is as cherished as those old stories my parents use to read to me before sleep.Del Toro, trust me, you'll hear more about him in the future, also gave some shockingly brutal kills that were down right frightening to watch. I felt mystefied. I was confused by the styles of the film. They were deliberately fairy tale like, yet, meshed with gritty war and horrendous violence. It's subtitles pulled you away from creatures that were dreamlike so unrealy fascinating that I must have had the captured look of an astonished child while in my seat. Nothing compares to this film that comes to mind. It's original and compelling: I'm so glad to be saying so about a film. It's been a depressing year for me. I'm nearly numb to the effects of cliche movie making.	5.0	I would say foreign movie of the year.	2007-01-18	5	2	3

I really like this movie because it is about a girl from Spain who has to move in with her pregnant mother to her step fathers home. He is a soldier or sargent I think and he is very evil. It is a violent movie but its good. The way this movie is filmed is just breath taking you get really into the movie that you feel like you are in it.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1DYMH30TSRONY	"Jennifer Cameron-Smith ""Expect the Unexpected"""	It has been some weeks since I viewed Pan's Labyrinth, and the movie is still 'in my mind'.  Quite simply, this movie is awesome.  The dark fantasy elements mesh seamlessly (to me at least) with the elements of reality.The 'real world' setting is post Civil War Spain (1944) where a small group of rebels fights on rural Spain. Ofelia and her mother Carmen, move to the mill where her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (whose mission is to crush the rebels), has his headquarters.Ofelia, who is fascinated by fairy tales, discovers an overgrown, tumbledown labyrinth. In the heart of the labyrinth she meets Pan, an ancient satyr who claims to know her true identity and her secret destiny. First, she must complete three tasks before the moon grows full.  Time is running out, for Ofelia and for the rebels, and both need to battle hardship and cruelty in order to gain their freedom.But, who can be trusted in such dangerous times? Is Pan telling the truth...? And if not, who is?The English subtitles (the  dialogue is in Spanish) actually enhance the experience of being involved in what could be termed a gothic fairy tale for adults.  The cinematography is very good and this is most assuredly not a movie for children.  In Australia, the DVD is rated as 'MA - Not suitable for people under 15.  Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian'.Highly recommended, but not for the squeamish.Jennifer Cameron-Smith	5.0	Pan's Labyrinth: a gothic fairytale for adults	2007-07-27	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"This movie is not at all for children or those who dislike major violence. Of all the movies that Guillermo del Toro has made I'm guessing this is the personal one for him. I heard him saying on TV that when he was a kid he'd imagine the floor to his bedroom opening up and a creature coming out and having a conversation with him. That's pretty much what Ofelia goes through in this movie as she resorts to a fantasy world where strange creatures send her on a magical journey to regain her royal title. A very simple fairy tale told by one of our greatest filmmakers.While the movie closely follows Ofelia's tasks, spoken to her by a magic book from Pan, it is mostly about the war, double agents (Maribel Verd&uacute; and &Aacute;lex Angulo), and the Captain's near-obsession with his expected son. The battles are extremely brutal and made me queazy a couple of times. So brutal are these deaths, in fact, that you'll be relieved to see a simple shot to the head or back.The acting is top-notch, and I like to say that young Ivana Baquero has a huge and brilliant future ahead of her. Plus one of the greatest aspects to this movie is how much scarier the people in the real world are than any strange creature from another fantasy world and none do it better than Sergi Lopez who plays the evil Capitan. He does a great job of playing in a suave sophisticated way that rivals that great job that Ralph Fiennes did with his character in ""Schindler's List"". He's pure evil packaged in clean cut way and doesn't have the slightest hesitation to killing anyone. It's really interesting that in a movie filled with strange creatures like a giant toad and a pale man with no eyes, the most frightening person would be a regular man with no conscious. The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just takes all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. The ""pale man"" (also played by Doug Jones), is by far the most terrifying creature in the movie, most-likely to give even the most mature and grown-up adults shivers. Faun (Doug Jones) who is the creature that gives Ofelia all her assignments is also great with his goat looking self. I really wish there were more scenes with him in the movie but I guess the budget wouldn't allow for that.Yes, this movie does have sub-titles, but it's hardly noticeable at first, so much so that you forget about them by the end of the movie. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is frightening and sad to the extreme, but it also gives you a sense of hope that magic does, in fact, exist. This is one of the most astonishing adult fairy tales I've seen in a long time."	4.0	A stunning reminder of the harshness of childhood	2007-06-25	5	3	2

If you read the complaints from people giving this 1 star, the main problem seems to be with the violence.  THERE WILL BE VIOLENCE IN THIS MOVIE.  With that being said, the cinematic techniques used are masterful. The movie reminds me of the TRUE fairytales which I have both heard and read over the years. Not watered down, and smothered with love, but filled with pain, beauty, brutality and innocence.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AVGX4BYF7J559	"Jer ""kingjer151"""	Pan's Labyrinth was directed by Guillermo del Toro. The movie is about a girl (ofelia) who has moved to the country because her mother got remarried. Her step-father is a sadistic army officer. She uses her imagination to escape from the stresses of coping with a new family and war.Plot RatingThe plot has a lot going for it. There is the idea of dealing with a new family, the stresses of war, betrayal, and oppression. I found the fantasy part really appealing and would love to have someone tell me I'm of a different origin and have to do things to get back into that world. The family or lack there of is really good and does a great job at explaining why ofelia has to escape. The war is everywhere in this movie and is another great way to show why she has to escape. The betrayal part is due to one of the workers in the officers house. It is shown superbly and its great what happens when she is confronted. I added the oppression because its in the movie but not a lot is shown. It doesn't take away from the movie though. They added just enough for you to see what the army is doing to the people and how corrupt they are. I give the plot a 8 out of 10Actors/ActressesIvana Baquero does a good job at playing the day dreaming little girl who is curious about her past. Ivana is the star of the movie and she holds her own for a  young actress. It must be difficult to have to basically carry the movie and keep the audience involved but she does this with ease.  You will really start to care for her and root for her to find out about her past. Even if she makes some mistakes along the way.Sergi Lopez does a great job at playing the tough army officer that will stop at nothing to catch the rebels. His feelings for his new daughter are very negative and it shows in the movie. It's as if she only cares about himself and his baby that her mother is carrying.Maribel Verdu does a great job at playing the army officers lead house servant and sister to one of the rebels. She has a lot of emotion in this role and it's great when she is confronted about who she really is.  You need to watch out for this character because you end up really caring about her and seeing what she is going to do next and how she is going to get out of certain situations.Doug Jones plays the faun and he could have been played by anyone. The makeup is amazing though. I wish I could dress like that on Halloween.I give the actors and actresses and 9 out of 10.DVD qualityThe quality is superb. I only wish I had this on Blue Ray(and a blue ray player to go with it). The scenes are crisp and clear and you can see every detail that is in this movie. The shots are beautiful with the blue and red hues.I give the quality 10 out of 10.Personal ThoughtsI thought this movie was great and should be watch by all even if you don't like subtitles. The idea of whether or not she is imaging all of this is greatly played but I gear towards it being real. The movie comes to us from New Line Home Video and the extras are sparse. There is only a audio commentary and a trailer. It would have been great to see a behind the scenes to do all that make-up like they did with X-men. Although I haven't watched a lot of Spanish movies I am a bigger fan than I was.Overall the movie gets a 27 out of 30.	4.0	Pan's Labyrinth Review	2011-05-30	1	0	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A232A4K13XTE7J	"jewessjen ""yeah, it's me"""	This movie will only appeal to slightly psychologically damaged, clever individuals capable of viewing, feeling and experiencing darkness without running for cover or pressing the stop button on the remote. Tony Soprano would love this film.Visually sumptuous and exceedingly violent, this is a film which assumes the viewer has some knowledge of authentic fairy tales and ancient myths of the distant past where there are no generic and formulaic happy endings featuring (thank God), where Snow White dies as a result of eating the poisoned apple and where Sleeping Beauty never does awaken from her coma.The extras on Disc 2 will help you understand the film on a deeper level  so if you are ignorant about such things, go ahead and watch Disc 2 first. That way you'll have a far greater appreciation for the film.Regarding the horrific violence; it's not gratuitous and I loved it.  The aggression and sadism only added o the R-rated appeal of a fairy tale film, like Anne Rice's Beauty Series. Once again, this isn't a movie for dim witted artistically conservative viewers.Reading the previous reviews, I noticed tons of idiots complaining about the subtitles...are you freaking kidding me? What's the matter with these idiots, can't they read English?

I knew going in it was a foreign film and that it was best received with ""an open mind"". That being said I feel this movie was a letdown. The movie's most riveting moments came when events took place in the ""real world"" (Spain during the 1940s). I expected a stronger focus on the underworld setting in the movie.Now the film did have some very good performance from the actors. Even though I was reading English subtitles the diction and dialog in Spanish was excellent. The special effects are also fantastic and may be the strongest asset of the movie. Some of the creatures are a sight to see and the environment throughout the movie is eerily real. All in all I would recommend this as a rent.

There were such excruciatingly violent parts that I had to look away. In general, I don't need to see the violence to get the big picture. I don't appreciate films that beat it over your head to show you how bad a character is. I kinda like the movies of the old days where you *knew* something awful was happening but there was no need or desire to shove it in the audience's face. Worst of all is when it is gratuitous, which I felt it was, in this film. The wine bottle bashing on the nose repeatedly, for example. I don't need to see that in order to realize that the Captain was a sadistic sicko. I've seen plenty of films with violent moments, but at least those moments were justified. They served a purpose in the fullness of the story. When that monster bit the heads off the fairies, i was like, ""oh come on!"" Give me a break. I mean, really!The pacing was so slow I could barely stand it. I also didn't feel the story came together very well. The acting was good, that wasn't the problem. Too long, gratuitous violence (in a film that looks like its for kids), and just not a great story. For all the darkness and violence, you'd expect a big, happy, bright reward at the end for the good guys. Not really.I guess I'm in the minority.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2IIN38LNXNZDG	J.

The story takes place in the mind of an young girl caught up in the Spanish Civil War of Francisco Franco during World War 2.  Although this film is in Spanish with English subtitles, it does not detract from its impact.  There isn't a single gratuitous or unnecessary scene in this masterpiece.  I'd have given it 6 stars but 5 is all that is allowed.  I am disappointed that this film only received 3 academy awards.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2B0DPQK20LYYJ	J. Michael	"This movie is as stupid as they come. Even though young children and shallow adults will be seduced by its special effects, there is really nothing more to it than that. It has absolutely none of the charm, depth or intelligence of the fantasy classics- like Lord of the Rings or Narnia- with which it has been outrageously compared.  This is cheap, formulaic, plastic fantasy. Where traditional fairy tales often symbolically explored and confronted universal life passages and difficult psychological conflicts, this is merely a politically correct mishmash of every hackneyed motif of modernist fantasy, representing nothing coherent and being nothing more than one cynical man's (successful) attempt to dazzle the easily-impressed masses with exotic monsters and magical FX creatures. If Del Toro admitted he was only making a video game, that would be fine. Instead, he bloviated this movie into a ""parable"", an ""allegory"", a fairy tale that would take its place among the works of Tolkien and Lewis. Please. This mess is to fantasy as Ratatouille is to quality children's animation.In the first place, its mythology is superficial and nauseatingly modernist. Its protagonist will be familiar to anyone who has seen any of Disney's feminist propaganda made since the late 80s's. She's a preternaturally gifted and sensitive young girl with an oppressive, conservative father figure who cramps her style. Whether in ""reality"" or imagination it is unknown, but our heroine is discovered to be an otherworldly princess and is assigned by the fairies to perform a set of utterly senseless magical errands which- appropriately enough for a little girl's fantasy world- take place in and about her own home and involve no inherent risk. No traditional heroic quest in this story. (Isn't it creepy that a 40-something year old man wrote this story?) Her tasks reminded me of those video role-playing games for 10 year olds which tell you step-by-step how to win the game. The usual fairy tale symbols are here: a key, a door, a toad, a faun, a labyrinth, etc. but they don't seem to actually be included for any reason except their ""mystical"" associations. All of these objects and creatures were included for nothing more than to decorate a DVD case or populate a marketing campaign. There is no deeper meaning behind anything here.The only really comprehensible message in the movie is its despicable left-wing propaganda. It demonizes the Spanish nationalists who won the Civil War and obsequiously romanticizes their Anarchist and Communist enemies as the apotheosis of nobility. Since this movie is supposed to be a fantasy, I guess we're supposed to overlook the fact that our heroes' actual historical activities usually consisted of raping nuns and slaughtering anyone with a bank account or a crucifix. Actually, the majority of the movie seemed to focus on the political situation, with very gory mutilations, torture, executions and amputations liberally depicted. I guess del Toro had to add some fairies and sci-fi to his slanderous, left-wing agitprop to make it palatable to an international audience. Just make no mistake that this movie is primarily a fairy tale or is suitable for young children. It's just Communist propaganda wrapped in a confused and ugly imitation of a fairy tale."	1.0	Ugly and stupid ersatz fairy tale	2008-04-11	67	15	52

And you should not rent this movie if you want a smiley little magical Disney movie.  This is something different.  Yes, it has magic and imagination, but real magic and imagination.  This magic is used in the face of life's tragedies, and every real life knows these tragedies.The tale is about a 12 year old girl whose mother is in love with a ruthless Captain from fascist Spain.  This captain is the prototype of the macho-fascist Spanish warrior from the 1940's.  His soldiers, with their dark uniforms and mustaches look somewhat monstrous as they ride their horses through rural Spain in search of the last rebels who dared stand up to the fascist state of Espana.The vicious step father is not girl's only problem.  Her mother is on the verge of death from a difficult pregnancy, her father is already dead, and everything else seems to be going wrong with her as well.She learns that she is really a princess who is immortal, if she believes in the magic of her ancestors and completes a series of tasks.  The magic underworld that she finds is strange, and the viewer wonders if she would be better off avoiding it altogether.  It is among some ruins in a forest near the town where the military and her cruel stepfather are staying.  She hears from the faun that her father is a king of this magical world and she is offered the hope of meeting him and joining a universe of infinite wonder.But this is not a feel good story.  Tragedy strikes all, from the most ruthless to the most innocent.  The faun's tasks are difficult and frightening, both the Spanish army and the rebels suffer devastating losses, and there is enough treachery, deceipt and disillusionment to crush any innocent's heart.The ending leaves the viewer questioning to what extent the girl reached her immortality and reached the world of wonder.  She made a great sacrifice and is evidently rewarded.  Or is she?  Find out for yourself, but I doubt you'll walk away from this movie with a smile on your face.	4.0	For the weak hearted, go watch Disney instead	2007-06-06	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2BZ9E4VDA29MD	Joel	"The box gushes ""on par with Lord of the Rings!"" and shows artwork that implies a multi-layer fantasy. What we got was a war film about the cruel treatment of the resistance, with 2 dimensional comic book character ""the captain"" that simply shoots or tortures anyone to make him seem bad.Oh yeah, a small part of this film (don't be deceived, this is not a fantasy film, it is a war film) is about a young girl who has to do some simple missions for a faun. She goes into a tree and gets a toad to eat three stones, and it barfs up a key for her. She uses the key later to get a dagger that she gives to the faun (although why we have no idea). She eats two grapes and runs from an eyeless creature that has eyes on its hands. She puts a mandrake root under her  mother's bed. In the end she returns ""home"" to some fairy land that hasn't been part of the film to this point. That's it folks. That's the fantasy segments of this film. The rest is about our cartoon bad guy trying to kill the resistance in Spain and torturing people.Not graphic? My wife walked out early in the film when comic-book-bad-guy bashed a guys nose in for no reason with a bottle, ultimately shooting him in the head to kill him. For what? For saying that his father was telling the truth. Oooh scary!I'm stunned at the rating of this film. It was a bad war film with poor characters that added some fantasy elements to gain more attention. It worked I guess (as evidence by the other reviews), but not for me.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3KUUII2GSHN7T	"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon"""	"If you have seen any Guillermo del Toro film before (that he wrote and directed), you know three things are likely to happen.#1. Anyone, including main protagonists, are a possible death candidates by the time the film ends.#2. At least half the characters will die by the time the film ends.#3. The story will be so remarkable that it will linger with you for days.In Pan's Labyrinth, we see del Toro using the same conventional (for him, not for others) format that he used in The Devil's Backbone. Great isolated ambience; plenty of violence; and a plot so delightful (with cinematography that makes you feel like you're in another realm) that it borders on genius.As for plot, we meet a very dreamy Spanish girl named Ofelia who, along with her pregnant mother, travel to a remote mill where Spanish troops (then working with the Axis powers to make a ""clean Spain"" in 1944) are under the command of Ofelia's new stepfather, Captain Vidal. Vidal is, as it turns out, like del Toro's other infamous villain, Jacinto from The Devil's Backbone, in that he possesses neither the ability to feel or deliver compassion. Vidal's two main aspirations are #1. to rid the surrounding woodlands of the rebels who are working with the allied powers and #2. to make sure his son is born safely, even at the expense of his wife, Ofelia's mother.And then there is the Labyrinth. Much has been said about the lack of time spent within the Labyrinth but let me admit one truth: enough time is spent there for the viewer to imagine what else might lurk there, and that is what makes this story truly unique. In other fantasy films, it seems that too much time is spent in the alternate world (David Bowie's Labyrinth and The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe both come to mind) and the viewer sometimes can become numb to any scenic trickery or imagination the director might try to instill. In del Toro's vision, we get just enough to know this is a new place, distant from any that we'd read about before. We get a few glimpses of the beauty of horror that reside in the ""Kingdom beneath the ground"", like a horrifying creature who enjoys sucking the brains from small infants, and believe me, it's enough to leave you talking with friends after the final scene concludes.A very worthwhile film that I highly recommend. It should come without warning that the film possesses much gore, considering it's R-Rated label. Most of the violence, however, is within the world of men (some very World War 2 scenes that you might come to expect in a film like Saving Private Ryan)."	5.0	Alice in Wonderland meets Saving Private Ryan.	2007-01-27	13	6	7
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2791CO09SYVHE	Joel Priest	I've heard this movie compared to J. R. R. Tolkien. I wish reviewers would stop doing that. I had really high hopes for this movie and, sadly, I was pretty let down as a result of that.Oh, it's good enough, it has wonderful visuals, an engaging storyline, a fascinating snippet of historical data, it's beautifully done and definitely worth watching. It's not worth $30 though. It's definitely worth $8.50 or $2.99 or whatever your local theater or video store charge. And it's definitely a movie to take a girl who likes fairy tales to. But, frankly, if you want good fantasy, you can pick up The Dark Crystal, or Labrinth or the other one in that vein for cheaper.And that, really, was my fundamental complaint with the movie. The plotline seemed more deep than it turned out to be. The historical details were mostly irrelevant to the central fairy tale, this could have been done the exact same way, in just about any country in the world, at just about any time in the last 200 years. And perhaps would have been more interesting if it had. The historical sub-plot mostly just distracted from the, unfortunately, more interesting fairy tale, rather than complimenting it by contrasting it, as I presume the director/writer intended.And as a result of the historical sub-plot, I felt like the fairy tale itself was stolen from and thus, ended up being far less of the magical experience it could have been, had it not had to vie for screen time with a pretty boring (unless you're a big history geek) sub-plot. I would compare it to Stargate, the movie. Where they introduce all these cool characters and creatures and devices and then run out of time to do anything truly cool with them. So by the end of the movie, you find yourself feeling...unfulfilled.This is not to say I didn't like the movie. The visuals are spectacular, the graphics, landscapes and creatures are stunning and fantastic, the acting is top notch, the cinematography is magnificent, there's a golden glow to bright sunny days and a grey chill to darkness or incliment weather, the directing is perfect. The overall tone of the fairy tale is far more like Grimm's than Disney's. This movie is truly worth watching. It's just that you feel like you only got 80-90% of what you should have gotten, at the end. There's so much promise here, another 10 or 20 million dollars and 45 minutes could have made this one of the finest movies made in the last 10 years, easily.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AJBFQP2JXBX6Q	John Bonavia	"This is a truly amazing movie. It elicits an extreme range of responses, because it violates  many conventions and expectations - seems to combine opposites. Let's see: it has the most brutal and realistic violence, but also the tenderest insight into the mind of a child. It shows a magical, fantasy realm along with a historical political struggle. It gives us wonderful, bizarre fantasy creatures but uses minimal computer effects. It invites us to to spend an evening with it but denies us any kind of Hollywood happy ending: unlike almost all of today's entertainment, it is a true tragedy, which some cannot accept. (We accept Shakespearean tragedy today because it is placed so safely in a distant world. When the pain and deaths come too close to home, not everyone wants to be at the dreadful display: And perhaps this is reasonable, a form of self-protection from trauma, not wanting to be de-sensitized, to have our reactions numbed. But then, Aristotle thought that tragedy should purify our emotions - ""catharsis."" More opposites, more open questions!)It gets marketed as a ""fairytale,"" but has - rightly! - an R rating and may have flirted with an NC-17. And anyway, should we think of ""fairytale"" as something Disney-ish and cute, or remember the original grim tales of the brothers Grimm?  (Whatever the label, DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN to this movie. It isn't just ""scary-monster""-ish, it is truly gut-wrenching, above all in the reality of cold-blooded gunshot executions of innocents).It leaves an open question whether the ""fairy"" realm is shown as real, or a series of sometimes terrifying hallucinations: should it have been ""psychological thriller"" instead?I'll just look at that particular opposition/contradiction. Is the story about a little girl who enters a magical realm that exists in parallel with our mundane universe? Or is it about a tormented child whose imagination creates the most amazing and sometimes terrifying scenes to escape from her almost unendurable life?Comparing the ""it does exist"" and the ""it's all imagination "" ways to take the fantasy world: The magic chalk that the Faun gives her is seen by the Captain in the everyday world: BUT: The chalk might just have been around anyway. The mandrake root does seem to really help her mother get better. The root twists and screams when it is put in the fire. BUT: her mother does not seem to hear the mandrake's screams. The bumping and banging under the floor as the horrible child-eating creature is foiled of its prey. BUT: no-one but Ofelia notices it (I think).At the end where Ofelia is talking to the Faun, the Captain does not see him: to some, this ends the debate (BUT: magical creatures are not necessarily visible to everyone).The majority assumption, going by responses here, is that all the magical realm is imaginary...but perhaps del Toro has not been absolute about the answer.What a movie, what an experience."	5.0	Wonderful, defies every convention and category	2007-01-29	3	2	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A9TG2NFA614S9	John F. Rooney	This Mexican movie in Spanish with English subtitles operates on two levels. One is about a detachment of Civil Guards in Franco's Spain in 1944 at a campsite fighting the remnants of rebels from the Civil War. The cruel and nasty Captain Vidal heading the detachment is well played by Sergei Lopez. He has married and impregnated a woman who brings her ten-year old daughter to meet the wicked step father.The picture's other level involves magic, fantasy, sprites and the labyrinth of a faun (called Pan in the English title). The girl, Ofelia, finds the labyrinth where she becomes entranced, and it may well be a dream world that she has conjured up. She is counseled by the faun-satyr.The rebels versus the Civil Guards is standard stuff, but it was the fantasy element that gave the picture its three Oscars. Director Guillermo del Toro's blending of the realistic and fantasy worlds makes the film arresting.The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect this to all to end like a fairy tale. The movie has a sad and downbeat conclusion to a brilliantly conceived project.  From the beginning with the stick that becomes like Tinkerbell, you get drawn into this labyrinth and become engrossed in the film's dual level structure.

Story is predominently built on the extreme contrast between how innocent a child can be versus how incredibly evil a man can be: Good versus Evil set in the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War and in the imagination of a little girl (and how the little girl tries to use that imagination to escape the cold realities of the world).  Excellent performances by actors in all featured roles.  It's the kind of movie you'll want to see at least twice...and this even though it's subtitled (though the story is so strong that the subtitles don't distract that badly).Having said that, I do wish that there was a dubbed version of the film.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	"I was really expecting to love this move.The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)is my favorite film, so when everyone started calling this the ""best film since the Lord of the Rings"" I had to see it. It didn't air in the local theaters so I had to wait until it came out on video. There isn't nearly enough fantasy in a movie advertised to be a fantasy book. This is NOT a fantasy, it's a drama.this movie is was a HUGE let down. I mean, the movie was okay I guess, but to compare it to the LOTR is just wrong. These two movies have almost nothing in common, LOTR beats Pans Labyrinth in every movie category there is. The only category that Labyrinth comes even remotely close to the LOTR is in emotional impact, but even then everything was done so matter of fact in this movie I could only feel really bad at the very end. Normally if you throw a suffering little girl into a movie you automatically have me depressed (Grave of the Fireflies,Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set),All Dogs Go to Heaven) but here it didn't. Why is easy to see. The girl in this movie is so amazedly stupid, which is made clear when she eats from a feast after being warned that doing so would result in her death. Even with fairies buzzing around her head and trying to take the good away from her, even which a creepy monster thing at the end of the table, even with pictures of that same monster thing killing hundreds of little babies, SHE STILL EATS THE STUPID FOOD!!! And its not just her, the house maid is such a bad spy that I'm surprised she lasted this long, and the doctor is extremely careless. They just don't act like real people would act, and in a movie that's character driven that's not a good thing.Then there's the meany step dad. Although he is one bad dude, and deserves to be hated, I've seen too many villains who are MUCH worse than him. Sure this guy is bad, but he could have been a lot worse. Until the end (when he was drugged up) the worse thing he did was torture a stutterer with his little hammer and pliers. Don't get me wrong now, he's a really bad guy, but he pretty much leaves people alone who don't do anything to him. It's not like he's going out murdering random people. By everything I was hearing, I expected him to be the worst thing since Hitler, but this guy is no where NEAR that bad. Come on now.just one question before I stop writing a review that I know won't get many helpful votes, do all Spanish people fight this bad? I know this isn't a war movie, but the fighting was so unrealistic it was laughable. The soldiers run around in the open missing each other at point blank range, and yet the main villain is able to pick people off at fifty yards with his pistol.Maybe I could have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't been expecting another LOTR, but that's the way it was advertised. Don't blame me for that. The acting was good, the special effects were good (but once again I was comparing them to the LOTR, in which case they came up short) and the script was great. Don't watch this movie expecting fantasy, because that's not what you'll get. if you read this review (whether you agree with me or not) please leave a comment.Replay value; moderate."	3.0	Not Impressed	2007-05-31	25	10	15
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"In the opening scene of the film (that is, after the initial explanation of the fairy tale we are about to be involved in) we see Ofelia with her mother, heading toward the camp of her mother's new husband, the Captain. Ofelia is carrying some books close to her chest, bundled in twine. Her mother inquires as to what they are, and upon seeing that the books are fairy tales, admonishes Ofelia, telling her that she is too old for such fancies.My immediate reaction was: nobody is too old for fairy tales. That this is true is inescapable. The writers of fairy tales are largely adults.Ofelia's life at the Captain's camp is a terrible one. The Captain cares nothing for anyone but himself, and has passion only for defending Spain against rebel forces (Star Wars anyone? - j/k). Only one thing separates him from being the embodiment of evil: his love for the son (so he believes with certainty) his wife is carrying. One could question the validity of that love, and say it is more pride than anything, but I'll leave that alone.He certainly does not love his new wife, nor his step-daughter. Upon Carmen's arrival (Ofelia's mother), she is put in a wheelchair and confined to bed, in a room the Captain enters only if there is an emergency.Without a mother (for the pregnancy is a difficult one), without a father, and without any friends, Ofelia begins to have adventures. She is told by a mysterious (and quite evil looking) faun that she is a princess, heir to a great kingdom where sickness and death will never visit her. For a girl so alone, and so in love with or enamored by fairies, she is easily led into the faun's ""game"". He has assignments for her, things she must complete before the next full moon, when the portal will be open and she will return to the kingdom forever.For her second assignment, she visits what is surely one of the most horrid creatures - a killer, and eater, of children. The creature itself is stunningly original and terrifying.The faun offers Ofelia a mandrake root for her assistance (she is rooting out evil, in a sense), and the mandrake root is to be placed in a bowl of milk under her mother's bed, fed with two drops of blood a day. Ofelia receives the mandrake, follows the instructions, and her mother immediately improves. It is revealing (I won't say why) that when the mandrake is thrown into the fire he/it screams. If you haven't seen it, think on that scene when you do. If you already have - reconsider it, and its placement. I believe that scene alone holds the most important truth in the film.It's difficult, to say the least, to tell a ""two-pronged"" story, one set firmly in realism, the other in a questionable fantasy. These could not be more different. But Guillermo del Toro manages it with seamless finesse. I never felt manipulated or jolted moving from one realm to the other. That is testimony to a great film - and a great filmmaker."	5.0	A promise of life everlasting	2007-01-09	12	7	5

This film has some very graphic and intense scenes in it,certainly too much for most children and possibly a plot a little too sophistocated for most kids as well. Pan's Labyrinth follows our main character Ofilia who endulges in books of fairy tales and fantsy set against a historical background of civil war in Spain of 1944.Her expecting mother and her step father ""El Capitan"" as she refers to him and one of the servants Mercedes.Ofilia's mother is having a difficult pregnency and is driven out to the coutry to have her child in the presence and insistnce of her new husband.Ofilia discovers a Labyrinth on the property,and is later visited by a fairy that night who leads her through the Labyrinth where she meets Pan,or more commonly known as ""the faun"".There she learns(as told by Pan) that she is the living soul of a princess from a far away land that thrived long ago in an alternate universe.They have been waiting for her return since her leaving for earth and passing so long ago.There,Pan gives Ofilia three tasks to proove her returning and that she has not been corrupted, each task more dangerous and risky than the next. Her first is to retreive a special key, the next...an artifact guarded by a slumbering demon which she just barely escapes with her life from and the last is the sacrifice of an innocent,all to be done before the approaching full moon.Through all the twisits and turns of Pan's world intermingling with the struggles of reality,is Ofilia really the decendent of royality from a far away land,is Pan real or imaginary?If so...is what he is asking her to do for good or evil intentions?Ofilia's world clashes with the very real world of war and a very cruel and sadistic step father.Pan's Labryinth is a fairy tale as told in stories long ago from authors like ""The Brother's Grimm"". Three tasks, causes and consequences for being defiant, it all comes full circle. This is a fantastic film, excellent art and design,beautifully photograhed,told and directed to perfection by director Guliermo Del Torro.True this film is subtitled in Spanish, but it is done well. I struggle with subtitiles myself, but I could understand a good portion of this film even when I wasn't focussing on reading subtitiles so much.A dubbed version of this film would be horrifically insulting and really ""take away"" the magic of this film.So ""suck it up"" and deal with the Spanish subtitles.Good fantasy films are hard to come by, and there are really only an elite few out there that pass as good ones.Pan's Labyrinth however will go down as a classic in my opinion.Multiple nominations were given and awarded to this film,and for good reason and adding it to a DVD collection will only enrich it."	5.0	Enter the world of darkness and light in Pan's Labryinth	2007-05-23	3	3	0

The Blu edition of this movie has perfect color and amazing smootness - very nice indeep , blacks were nice - details in the shadows were easy to make out , and the source of this film must be amazing since I seen pretty much no dirt at all . This movie has its own form of grittiness which I enjoyed , but after all this I still have one complaint - I hardly noticed on the standard def copy of this title , but alot of the original filming of this movie was a little soft , almost as if the lens on the camera needed to be calibrated , I would assume the focus was a little soft due to the low light the entire movie revolves around , but it still would have been nice to have perfectly sharp images on my Blu-ray copy .All in all very nice though - and would deffinatly recomend it !!!	5.0	Thoughts of Pans on Blu	2008-02-07	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2VGJDYD7SUR7Z	Joseph S. Davicsin Jr.	"Alright, let's get a few things straight here: while this is a well crafted, ""dark"" (because folks love using that term interchangeably with ""deep"")better than average take on fantasy, this film by no means is the ""astounding"" piece of work people claim it to be.Let's start with the historical inaccuracies. While I don't need dogmatic details, the films paints fantasy about Spain in more ways than one, namely that the rebels gain the upper-hand against the Fascists, when in reality the young girl ascending the throne of her underground kingdom might be a far more accurate account of the times. If Del Toro wanted to tell a story of hope and skew the details a bit, fine. But this is indicative of most films, especially Hollywood, where the facts are excessively sweetened so as to make the crap more edible for the average movie goer. Of course the sugar far exceeds the quality of the candy itself.Secondly, the use of fairytale to parallel a real world situation has been done to death countless times. Likewise allegory, which is what this film is. So heavy-handed is the symbolism in this film, that, were it not for the more violent elements, I could see a 10-year-old calling this simplistic.Lastly, I'm surprised few viewers or critics failed to see parallels between this and ""Spirit of the Beehive."" Only difference is ""Spirit of the Beehive"" works on an infinitely more subtle way and opens more interpretations than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with its chalk could never to do; partly because ""Spirit of the Beehive"" was made in Spain while Franco was still in power. It's easy to make an allegory years after the fact; it's quite another to make a similar statement while under the gun.And on a side note, especially for readers of mythology: this is not even Pan, but rather a faun, a member of Pan's race. The translation of the film should be ""Labyrinth of the Faun"", but of course Hollywood sees fit to make it more dynamic by invoking the celebrity faun. (Commentors: Please keep mind that I know Hollywood didn't produce this film, but certainly mistranslated and hyped it all to hell.)And before you reply, yes I'm a film snob. No, I don't believe the halycon days of cinema have past. Yes, I do like contemporary and even mainstream cinema. It's just this mindless obeisance to what everyone thinks are the best films irks me to no end. You are entitled to your own opinion, just as I am. I would only hope more people make an effort to truly think critically about what they're watching before they hop on the band wagon."	2.0	Debunking the myth	2008-02-09	8	0	8

In my 40 years of movie-going, few films have ever managed to dig themselves deep into my subconscious, let alone stay there for months.  This is one of those inspired movies that will be acclaimed a classic by generations to come.  Unlike last year's uber-movies (The Departed, Dreamgirls) or sweet-n-sappy-love-fests (Little Miss Sunshine), Pan's Labyrinth is a mystical tour-de-force that combines pure escapism with raw emotional intensity to create an indelible story of loss and redemption.  Ivana Baquero deserved an Academy Award nomination for her amazing and inspired performance, and the film certainly deserved the Oscar as Foreign Language Film - it was do good, I dare say even Scorcese should have lost the award to the non-nominee Del Toro, and it stands heads and shoulders above ""The Departed"" as a pure movie experience you will never forget.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1U74I9FWDMGEW	Joshua	"Pan's Labyrinth (El laberinto del fauno) finds Guillermo del Toro coming into some of his biggest commercial success immediately following his big screen adaptation of Mike Mignola'sHellboy.  While Pany's Labyrinth retains much of the surreal fantasy elements that we've seen in Hellboy, fans of the giant red devil may be put off by a marked lack of humor.  If you are not a fan of ""foreign"" films, you not be interested in spending almost an hour and a half reading the dialog.  For everyone else, Pan's Labyrinth is dark, violent, and a fantastic work of art.For those of you who are familiar with del Torro's Chronos,Cronos, you will probably find somewhat familiar territory in Pan's Labyrinth.  In previous works like Chronos, del Torro has demonstrated a flair for the dramatic, an eye for aesthetic beauty, and a love for the elements of classic horror.  In Pan's Labyrinth we see all of these filtered through a story that is inspired by fairy tales and fantasy.Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of Ofelia, the stepdaughter of the brutal Captain Vidal.  Ofelia's mother grows increasingly ill while pregnant with her younger brother.  Starting with Pan, a faun, Ofelia meets a series of fantastic creatures and attempts to pass a series of tests to demonstrate that she is actually the reincarnated spirit of the underworld Princess Moanna.Elements of fantasy interact both directly and indirectly with a dark and gritty reality.  The backdrop of the film is set in post-Civil War Spain around 1944, and young Ofelia is not spared from seeing the horrors and atrocities that war brings.  The elements of dark realism set a particularly violent tone for the entire movie.  If you are not familiar with Spanish history I wouldn't worry.  The setting creates a particular atmosphere for the movie without penalizing the viewer for being unfamiliar with the specifics.Those who follow del Torro's work know that he loves to reuse talented actors (Ron Perlman, anyone?).  Doug Jones stars in Pan's Labyrinth as the titular faun between his roles as Abe Sapien in Hellboy and the 2008 sequelHellboy II: The Golden Army.  I try not to do too much study prior to seeing a movie, but having loved Jones' body work since his role as the lead Gentleman in the episode ""Hush"" fromBuffy the Vampire SlayerI could instantly identify him as both Pan and the ""Pale Man.""  Not surprisingly, you won't get to hear Jones' voice, but his talents for acrobatics and contortion are uniquely suited for the role.  In addition, Jones (who admittedly knows no Spanish), took the time to learn all of the lines for the film making his mouth and movements match perfectly when dubbed by a voice-over actor.Jones' costume is a beautiful and different take on the notion of a faun.  Pan is half man, half goat, and his form is inspired by the exterior of a tree.  In the dark setting of the movie he blends into his surroundings as a creature of the nighttime woods.  Pan's Labyrinth is ideally suited to fans of dark fantasy pictures.  By sticking so closely to what Guillermo del Torro loves we get a Spanish language film that is fresh, beautiful, and inspiring.The sound and video quality of the blu ray transfer are crystal clear.  In addition, del Torro knows how to put together a blu ray without skimping on the special features.  This version contains a number of featureless examining the mythology that the story creates and the making of the film."	5.0	Stunning, violent, and surreal.	2012-09-09	1	1	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AT3B676YRV78G	Joshua Kelly	This was definitely a very good movie; it's good to see that films can still be made where every single aspect does not have to be explained.  The fact that directors do that now can be very annoying and cut into the movie.  Since when did anything in a fairy tale make sense?  A detailed explanation of the ending would have killed it.  It boils down to the director wanting to make a fairy tale, so he stuck to his guns and made one.  No explanation required; you either like it or you don't.Despite other reviews about the brutality and gruesomeness of this movie, I still think it's a good children's story.  Go to a library or a grandparent's house and find an old book that has children's fairy tales in it.  Most of them are disturbing, and it is very rare that someone doesn't die or get badly injured in some way; the only difference is that books don't have ratings.My only disappointment with this movie is that it was all in Spanish.  It's fine for me, but since the fairy tale style is more for children, (like it should be) any kid watching this movie might have problems keeping up with the quick paced subtitles.	4.0	Overall good movie	2007-05-16	3	1	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2X2VGYB5TAPQQ	Joshua R. Look	Pan's Labyrinth is a very hard film to recommend.  This may come as a shock to some, both those who have seen it and loved it, and those who haven't but have heard that it's a great picture.  But it's the truth.  Since I saw it, I've encountered those who I thought would like it but didn't and vise versa.  And of course, there were those who I immediately knew would hate it, and they did.  I love this film and I adamantly defend it, but it is by no means for everyone.  The marketing doesn't help either.  This is not even close to The Lord of the Rings.  Nor is it strictly a fantasy film.  Although it does have a certain fairy tale quality, it refuses to be confined to any one genre, and ultimately, the lines between the fantastic and the realistic are left for the viewer to decide where they are drawn.The film takes place during the 1940s in fascist Spain.  An imaginative young girl, Ofelia, is being forced to live with her stepfather, a cruel man known as the Captain.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant and sick.  So one night, Ofelia wanders into a nearby labyrinth where she meets a faun.  The faun tells Ofelia that she can help her mother and escape the terrible place she's in if she completes three quests for him.The biggest complaint I hear about the film is the amount of violence.  There is an unfortunate amount of people who dismiss the film as being nothing more than an experiment in cruelty.  For those who haven't seen it, yes, this is a violent picture.  There are scenes that may make you feel uncomfortable.  If they do, then the film is working.  With the exception of one scene, all the violence is centered on the Captain.  The director uses violence so that every time the character is on screen, the viewer is filled with a sense of dread.  You are meant to fear this man and be disgusted by him, and the director wants to make sure that you are.  It is not violence for the sake of violence.  It is used as a legitimate film making tool.  Some may argue that the film would have been more effective if you didn't see the violence, but I don't think that's the case in Pan's Labyrinth.  It's the harsh reality of the world that Ofelia lives in, and del Toro wants you to understand and share her desire to get out of it.  It works brilliantly.If you can get past the violence, you'll find a truly amazing film.  The visuals are stunning and deserve every bit of praise they've achieved.  It's good to see a film that relies on makeup and costumes more than computer effects.  The cast is good enough to make you forget that you are even reading subtitles.  As unlikable as the Captain is, the actor does a truly phenomenal job.  The cinematography is quite remarkable as well (Oscar worthy, I'm not sure...Children of Men may have had it beat).  Two different styles were needed, and they were both pulled off very well.For me, the greatest achievement that Pan's Labyrinth makes it the things that it leaves you with and none of them are made too obvious.  Some have called the picture deeply depressing, but I disagree.  There are a number of positive and hopeful things to be taken here.  It all depends on your interpretation and what you choose to believe.  For a film that walks a fine line between fantasy and reality and between the innocence and cruelty that the human heart has the capacity for, it's appropriate that it leaves you with the questions that it does.  It's a film that has something to say, and wants you to think about it and to feel something.  That may not sit well with an audience who'd rather see lovable ogres and talking donkeys.  If you think you can handle the violence and don't mind reading, I urge you to watch Pan's Labyrinth.  Find someone who can watch it with you.  When it's over, talk about it, and discover things you may not have noticed about it on your own.  You'll find your appreciation growing the more you think about it.	5.0	My favorite film of 2006	2007-05-22	4	4	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2Y3CWITEF9JGY	"JP Salazar ""Web Developer"""	"*no spoilers*The Oscar buzz is all over the new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and we were there to find out the hype. It is basically a dark fantasy tale--a la ""Never Ending Story""--where director Guillermo Del Toro combines two things; a fairy tale daydream of a preteen girl and the crude reality of the world she lived in. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an interesting, creepy and dramatic film that shows us why many children want to escape their sad realities by creating new ones of their own.Story:""Pan's Labyrinth"" takes place in Northern Spain after the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1944. Things are not going well for the 12-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) whose father died. She has to move in along with her ill pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a new home in the countryside--she brings her fairy tales books with her. Carmen is pregnant from her new husband, the brutal Capitan Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez) who waits for them. He was sent to that remote area to destroy the remaining militia group who hides in the mountains and wants to take control of the village. The Capitan also wants Carmen to give birth where he is. The day of their trip, Ofelia discovers a hidden magical world. She encounters a goat-like faun who tells her that she is a princess, but in order to regain her kingdom, she must complete three tasks. She accepts and the adventure begins.Review:""Pan's labyrinth"" was written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro ('Blade II', 'Hellboy') who combined civil war, political instability and a fantastic fairy tale world. In her adventure, Ofelia is the princess, the one that matters and savior of her future brother and dying mother from the dangerous ""adult world"" they're stuck in. Is this a pipe dream? Unfortunately nobody sees this magical world but her. This situation keeps us guessing about what she is really seeing. Back in the real world, Del Toro doesn't waste any time of letting us know who the bad guys are. He show us extreme moments of how Capital Vidal--along with his soldiers--kills the ""enemies"" of Spain, which is very tough to look at. This creates realism and sensitivity for the audience who see the atrocities committed during the Spanish Civil War.The fairy tale world she sees is full of strange, creepy and symbolic oddities. We see creatures--some look extremely hideous in a cool way--that she has to face in order to make all her problems go away. We like the way the story jumps from fantasy to reality without compromising the rhythm of the movie. In other words, the editing is excellent and it doesn't drag, all these elements displayed with eye candy cinematography.The movie is well acted; especially Sergi L&oacute;pez who is probably the best actor in this film. He gives us an excellent performance as the ruthless, mean and arrogant Capitan Vidal--we love to hate this character.The Verdict:Although the ending is unsatisfying and open to interpretation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a respectable movie that tells the fantasy of a child who didn't want to grow up and wanted to be a fairy tale princess forever. All mixed with political themes and war. We recommend this film and we won't be surprised if this movie shows up at the Oscars. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles and not recommended for small children."	5.0	The dark fantasy tale  of  2006	2007-04-16	10	10	0

The extremes of storytelling are all presented here - the madness of war, abusive relationships, violence on children.  And yet all of these components are very deftly woven to tell this story without scaring off the audience.  You genuinely want to see a fruitful ending to this nightmare.

The only 'faerie' movie I can think of that's even slightly similar (because of the dark edge) would be 'Photographing Fairies'.  But this is much darker even than that.It's a return, perhaps, to the antique days when fairy tales were SCARY and not for the kiddies.In fact, the movie is quite harrowing at times.  I found one particular scene amost impossible to watch - something that hasn't happened to me since the days when I used to watch daleks and cybermen from behind the sofa!But all in all, I think it's a beautiful, surprising, and thought-provoking movie, and almost certain to join 'Photographing Fairies' and 'Blade Runner' as one of my all time favourites.Oh, and it has nothing to do with Pan, the Greek God.

If you like, you can listen to the Director's prologue in English during the film, but that's not what this listing is selling or stipulating. I'm disappointed with the derelict description and returning it.  Don't assume everything you read on Amazon is correct.  Obviously they're in the business to sell you.  And in this case, they lose!	3.0	AMAZING MOVIE. DISHONEST DVD INFORMATION. NO ENGLISH DUBBED AT ALL. IT'S SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES	2013-08-29	3	1	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A27VHQKG5UR8FA	J. Sun	This is not a fairy tale and definitely not for kids. In addition to graphic violence, it's a dangerous indoctrination to kids and even to adults. The story clearly hints at the end that what's been going on with the little girl is fantasy - all adults warned her about it thru the movie. And she gets shot for what she did by blindly following the tree-man's tale and still fantasizes that she goes to heaven.If the film makers truly want to make the point of sacrificing self for others, make the reward in this reality. Or kids would do foolish things.	1.0	black humor?	2014-05-30	7	2	5
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2SNUORW55MZWO	J-Train	"Beautiful, violent, suspenseful and sometimes slow. I knew this was going to be a rough film when I saw how graphic the first murder was. This is a fairy tale and a brutal war film rolled into one. I wasn't ready for the violence factor at all, but ultimately I was glad to see that this isn't some fluffy film about dreams coming true. While the dreams do come true, it is by death that they are realized. The special effects are amazing. The monsters were freaky, especially this one dude who has eyes in his hands. This film exceeds expectations in the fairy tale department and that part of the story is simply amazing. However, the ""war"" part of the story is just above par and while it is very good, it doesn't feel great because it is up against the fairy tale part of the movie that is just impossible to compete with. The acting is outstanding from the main characters to the bit parts. There were parts of this movie that did feel a little slow and I kept wishing they would get back to the monsters. But the movie on a whole really does capture your attention and imagination. It is different than anything I have ever seen. Not for kids... I repeat, NOT FOR KIDS! Go into this film expecting to shut your eyes from time to time if on screen violence and gore bothers you. I loved this movie, but I can only give it 4 stars because it felt unbalanced and slow at times. Otherwise, you really should see this movie and worth buying because it demands repeated viewings.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2ZPEM21NNQNW1	Juan Oliver Colom	When conditions are such that reality is unbearable, human imagination can summon escape routes that can approach reality.  This movie is a brilliant attempt to relive a child's escape route from a harsh, traumatic reality to a world of her own -not paradisiacal, fraught with its own perils and threats- but mentally redeeming. Framed against one of the most brutal place and period; Spain just after its civil war, it depicts violence at its most extreme, and redemption through mental gymnastics.  Brilliantly directed, written, acted and filmed, it succeeds in depicting a fairy tale among unbearable conditions.	5.0	Excellent Portrait of Escapist Imagination	2007-07-08	3	1	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AMNG8QOL5LIP8	Juan Valenzuela	This is the most recent example of a film maker going all out and staying true to his pure vision. During the Spanish Civil War a young girl is taken with her pregnant mother to a compound at the foothills of mountains where rebel forces are hiding out and trying to penetrate Franco's army. The girl's new stepfather is the sadistic general at the helm of this military base and he is more than eager to hunt and destroy the rebels. The girl is aware that this new world she had no choice in inhabiting is filled with violence and inhumanity. Consequently she finds herself in a alternate world with fairies, a giant toad, and a faun who is either a trustful guide or maybe a villian. Not for young children, this movie is an emotional powerhouse about what lengths a child will go through to hold on to innocence. The perfomances are great. A standout is Sergi Lopez as the oppressive general. Even with a child eating orge with eyeballs in his palms, Lopez is the most frightening creature in the movie. The DVD features some great extras like storyboards and behind the scenes stuff and an interview from Charlie Rose with the three current heroes of Mexican cinema. Guillermo Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro Inarritu seem to share a touching brotherhood of support and encouragement. My favorite movie of this decade.	5.0	Masterpiece	2008-04-14	4	2	2

Looking at it now, as an 18 year old, I can see why I liked it so much back then. The score is so beautiful, even if most of it is based on one lullaby; a beautiful one at that. I hum it to my niece and she usually falls asleep to it. The violence in this movie always made me flinch, but that's war. It's not a pretty sight. The story for this is so brilliantly put together, and easy to follow. I've watched this movie plenty of times that I don't need those bloody English captions anymore and I can see the beauty of the movie I missed with them on. This movie can be terrifying at times. The Pale Man always frightened me and still gives me the chills when I see him eat the faeries.

Think back to the original dark Grimm fairytales that give children nightmares (NOT the prettied up Disney versions), and you will be getting close.This movie is an adult fantasy, and absolutely not recommended for children under 18.  It is extremely intense, quite violent, and deals with very mature topics: death, war, poverty, fascism, and human brutality.  Conversely, this film also takes us into a fantasy world that helps a small child escape from her horrific reality.  This bizarre combination ignites the viewer's imagination. It is emotionally gripping; we become wholly invested in this young girl's tragic life.This unusual story is filled with some remarkable acting.  The cinematography is graphic and stunning.  The film has an almost dream-like quality to it, which serves to enhance the brutality of the ""real world"" scenes.  We ache to see this girl escape - to be safe - yet, we know that she cannot.  At least not in the real world.  But, just perhaps we hope, the fantasy world can help her.Although very disturbing, Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing and unexpected triumph.

The scenes are amazing and intricate of tone, texture and props without many special effects. This is not a smoke and mirrors presentation, rather  down to earth,and beneath it.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	MOVIE: Pan's Labyrinth is the most beautiful and exquisite film I have seen in the last few years. Guillermo Del Toro has crafted a masterpiece of cinema that slowly bends reality into fantasy. The film is about a young girl named Ofelia who is living in post-war Spain. Her father has died and now she and her pregnant mother are traveling into the country to live with the prestigious Captain Vidal, whom her mother has now remarried with. Captain Vidal is introduced in an early scene as a barbaric murderer who is only interested in Ofelia's mother to bear his child so that his son can grow up with his name. Ofelia escapes into a world of fantasy and horror that is equally as disturbing as the real life events going on around her with the war. There are two parallel storylines in the film. The one that deals with Ofelia in the world of the labyrinth and the storyline with Vidal dealing with revolutionaries who live in the mountains.The brilliant part of the film is that Del Toro juxtaposes Ofelia's world with the real world. For example, in one part of the film Ofelia must encounter a creature who has eyes in his hands, and even though he sits in front of long table of food he still craves innocent children and innocent creatures. Directly before this scene we see Captain Vidal hosting a giant dinner party where he sits at the head of the table. It's symbolism at its finest. Credit also has to go the superb art direction, make up and visual effects that transport the audience into Ofelia's world. The make up on the faun that instructs Ofelia to complete the tasks is unbelievable. The film takes us deep into the darkest part of the human realm and sends us on an unforgettable journey. Javier Naverette's beautiful score plays a huge role in creating the world of Pan's Labyrinth. I honestly believe it would be a crime if he does not win at the Oscars. He is the only composer nominated worthy of the statue.ACTING: Ivana Baquero is absolutely stunning in this film as Ofelia. She plays the character beautifully and makes the audience care for her every step of the way. The supporting cast is just as good. Sergi Lopez makes a very convincing and evil Captain Vidal. I think Vidal should be considered as one of the better screen villains in last decade. Credit also should be given to Doug Jones who plays the faun also known as Pan. Jones is one of the better known costume actors in Hollywood and previously worked with Del Toro on Hellboy. He even learned a little Spanish for the role.BOTTOM LINE: The film medium was created specifically for films like this. Pan's Labyrinth is a rare masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Nothing about the film is unoriginal, it stands on its own as one of the most original pieces of filmmaking in recent memory. I know the film isn't playing at every theater, but every effort should be made to go out of your way to see it. A film that will stay with you long after you see it, it truly must be experienced.	5.0	A Masterpiece Of Filmmaking, Guillermo Del Toro Takes Us On An Amazing Ride	2007-01-31	9	5	4
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2U0D8SCZ1PQXX	K. Black	"Pan's Labyrinth was definitely one of the best, if not the best movie of the year. It's a foreign film, so it might be difficult for slow readers to understand and follow the dialogue/story if you don't speak Spanish. I have a Spanish friend who saw it and said that the translations on the captions were very accurate. I can speak a little Spanish and could actually understand parts of it.The story is a simple one when explained, yet rich with detail and complex when you get into it. It's about a young girl (Ofelia) who's mother is married to and pregnant with the baby of a general in the Spanish army after the Spanish civil war. They move to an outpost in the woods and Ofelia discovers the labyrinth and the faun that guards it. Since she's always liked fairy tales, she becomes engrossed with completing her quests into a bizarre parellel world, while still having to deal with her mother's illness, the skepticism of others, and the cruelty of her stepfather. The peaceful fairy world is in sharp contrast to the civil war that is going on all around it. Since it is a coming of age story, the 'imaginary' world symbolizes the innocence and beauty of childhood, while the war that everyone else is caught up in shows how turbulent and difficult it is to be an adult.It's considered a ""fairy tale"" although in this one the fairies get their heads bitten off, monsters kill and eat little children, and people get tortured and shot. All unlike a Disney movie. It is a 'dark' fairy tale, and probably not suited for small children since there is blood, detailed violence, and cursing (in Spanish). If I had seen this when I was 6, I would have been horrified.The end is bittersweet (no spoilers here!) and leaves you with the question of whether of not the fantasy world of Ofelia was real, and I always find myself smiling with tearing running down my face. It's a movie you'll probably want to watch over and over because it's so good and there will be things you didn't catch the first time around.I also highly recommend the soundtrack if you liked the movie! It has beautiful music that really captures the essence of the story."	5.0	Great Movie, deserved more Awards than it got....	2007-08-03	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A34D4KCP94ACJZ	K. Driscoll	Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing film directed by Guillermo Del Toro.  It manages to capture the essence of being a child appropriately enough to serve as nostalgia for its adult audience.  In other words, you really don't have to be a fantasy geek to appreciate this.  It is smaller than many of the larger epic fantasies we have grown accustomed to seeing on the big screen over the last few years (i.e. Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter movies) but in many ways it is more lucid, and it is certainly less diluted by oceans of CGI. There are great effects though; puppets, CGI, makeup, set design and costumes.  However, I would say that more effort than money was put into these elements and creating a pure vision was certainly the priority, as opposed to creating a large box-office draw. Del Toro also has the advantage of placing the fantasy into the eyes of a child, while the rest of story is told in the miserable reality of 1944 post civil war Spain.  That dichotomy alone makes the film both remarkably authentic and the fantasy elements that much more rewarding.  What child wouldn't want to escape that existence?As the film opens we are introduced to a fairy tale about Princess Moanna from the underworld.  The Princess decides to see the world above her and when she does she forgets about her royal existence and eventually becomes mortal and dies.  Her father, the king, believes her spirit will return.  After this we go to 1944 Spain after the Francoists have taken power.  We are introduced to Ofelia (Ivan Baquero), a young girl whose pregnant mother has brought Ofelia to meet her new stepfather (Sergi L&oacute;pez), a fascist captain assigned to control and destroy the Spanish Maquis in that region.  He is also the father to Ofelia's unborn brother.  Ofelia meets an insect who she feels represents a fairy.  The insect leads Ofelia to the labyrinth.  This spirals into Ofelia's eventual interaction with a faun who declares that Ofelia is Princess Moanna and in order to ensure that her essence as princess of the underworld is intact, she must accomplish three specific tasks.  The story goes from there with astounding visuals and sequences that range from shocking and suspenseful, to beautiful and beaming with hope.In a year of mediocre cinema, Pan's Labyrinth was one of the few stand-out productions for me.  Obviously it was heavily acclaimed and rewarded for its visuals, but the writing and direction deserve accolades as well.  This is one of best original screenplays to come along in the last few years.The acting was also great. Ivana Baquero is a wonderful new find and Maribel Verd&uacute; (Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n) was also fantastic as one of the captain's maids and a rebel mole.  I also believe that Captain Vidal was probably the best villain of the year.  Part of it was Sergi L&oacute;pez's performance but it was also the way his actions shocked us.  Without his violent outbursts and constant cutthroat disposition I think this would've been a lesser movie, but it also may have received a more profitable PG-13 rating.  In other words, it took some courage and sacrifice in making this villain as brutal as he was and I salute Del Toro for not even giving that perspective consideration.  Again, it's artistic substance as the priority.Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is the kind of effort that reminds me of why I love cinema, and I have no doubt that Del Toro and his crew feel that a story like this is the very reason they make movies in the first place.  Obviously, I highly recommend this.	5.0	Enlivens the Adult Imagination	2007-08-10	9	9	0

No. This is the way fairy tales are meant to be. Not only is it magical and a product of a seemingly limitless imagination of Guillermo del Toro.... it is deep, dark, sad, and dramatic. Mind you I used to be an international film skeptic, but lately Hollywood has been a grave disappointment so I thought I should try films made by people that aren't afraid of being attacked by criticism from parents that have this morbid fear of their wholesome family being devastated by ....'SCARY SCENES'! I think I can describe it best by saying it's like watching a very dark Jim Henson movie; it has that same atmosphere and the characters, puppets and CGI, are very believable.And no matter how many times I watch it I still cry. It's just very powerful and very moving.It's a very unusual and nice change to have a film that is both a fantasy and somewhat of a documentary about the Spanish Civil War.	5.0	This is a real fairy tale	2011-10-04	1	1	0

The difference here is that while Chihiro, the main character in &#34;Spirited Away,&#34; wishes to escape the spirit world and return to &#34;our&#34; world, Ofelia, the main character in &#34;Pan's Labyrinth,&#34; wishes to escape &#34;our&#34; world, for she lives in post-civil war Spain, where her stepfather, a ruthless captain, is fighting a group of guerrillas. Ofelia and her mother are both with him because Ofelia's mother is pregnant with the captain's child, and the captain wishes for the child to be born near him.Ofelia takes an immediate disliking to the captain, who her mother wants her to address as &#34;Father.&#34; Rather than become accustomed to her new home, she decides to explore the grounds, carrying one of several books of fairy tales she brought with her (her mother thinks she is too old for fairy tales), and discovers a large labyrinth, which Mercedes, a cook whom Ofelia befriends, says is old with an unknown purpose. Some time later, a mysterious insect Ofelia calls a &#34;fairy&#34; leads her through the labyrinth to a spiral staircase which descends into the ground. At the bottom is an altar...and a faun, who emerges from the shadows and changes Ofelia's perception of the world and her place in it forever. To reclaim that place, the faun says, she must complete three tasks before the full moon lights the night sky, tasks which test her courage, her determination, and her will to live.Unlike &#34;Spirited Away,&#34; &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34; balances the two worlds it features, so while viewers may prefer one over the other, and while one is seen more than the other, neither is more important than the other. Both have issues which must be addressed by the characters and provide insight into each character's behavior and personality, which in turn helps the viewer identify with them (or distance himself or herself from them), and brilliant use of CGI and animatronics helps make the creatures of the underworld seem as real as the film's human beings. With them, del Toro, and by extension, Ofelia, is able to explore the ideas of doing what one is told versus doing what one believes is right, innocence and its place in the world, and whether what we perceive as reality is, in fact, reality.This is a film I thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely watch again, and I recommend it to anyone who's intrigued by the idea of  &#34;a fairy tale for adults,&#34; to anyone with an open mind, and/or to anyone who has the slightest urge to find out what all the fuss with this film is about.	5.0	"del Toro's ""Spirited Away"""	2013-09-09	2	2	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3FJLU735BHT9I	"Kenneth R. Shumaker ""TIMEBOMBER"""	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Everything about this movie is just incredibly breath-taking. Honestly, I can't really even express with words how much I freaking love this film. When it first came out in America, I wanted to see it so bad I had to drive two hours to find a theatre that played it. I was blown away by every aspect of this film, the direction, the acting, the story, the creature effects, the editing, the musical score. I loved the music so much, that I instantly searched ever single store, trying to get a hold of the soundtrack. The score to this movie is epic and beautiful. Every time I watch it the end nearly brings me to tears. Thank You, Guillermo Del Toro for such a great film, you are an inspiration to me, and I look eagerly forward to everything that will have your name on it. In fact, I just saw Hellboy 2 last night, and was blown away by that as well, I went home and watched all the special features on my Pan's Labyrinth DVD, rewatched the movie again, and now I am writing this review. When I am done with this, I am going to get back to writing my screenplay I have been working on, because I feel so inspired by his work.	5.0	Incredible!!!	2008-07-12	0	0	0

Where to start....I was well aware of the subject matter of PAN'S LABYRINTH and the R rating( graphic violence) when a group of us saw it last night.What the oft-seen trailers and critics in the major city papers DID NOT tell me,though,was just HOW violent/gory/gruesome AND graphic this film was going to be.I truly have no problem with depiction of violence when it furthers the plot to clarify the points in the story,but I truly felt that much of the violence was gratuitous and unnecessary.We already had so many scenes of Captain Vidal's violent nature.How much is necessary to make a point and how much is TOO much?We artists are always balancing that one!!!Writer/Director Del Toro chose IMO the ""over-the-top"" route much like what many folks remarked vociferously about Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.Some may feel that ALL of the horror that is dealt to us in this film is necessary and essential.I do not.Sometimes what is NOT shown to us can be MORE LASTING than what is laid bare (REPEATEDLY) all the time.After so much gore, I actually ""numbed out"" and just wanted to get to the end of the film.NOW ON THE LIGHTER SIDE:(1) Javier Navarrete's soundtrack score is sublime and captures every moment of Ofelia's adventure without bringing attention to itself.This is the hallmark of a great soundtrack very much along the lines of Alexandre Desplats or Hans Zimmer where the viewer is AWARE of music,but overwhelmed by it.(2) Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a marvel to behold.I was so atuned to her rapid breathing that it put me in mind of Poe's TELLTALE HEART.This child will hopefully grow into a great actress.(3) Maribel Verdu playing the Resistance-informer Mercedes was able to control so much of the horror she saw and yet remain cool enough to think ahead and not crumble under pressure.A GREAT ROLE and A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE.(4) Two of guys that were in our group noticed several shot/continuity problems ( because that is what they are PAID to do!)

I have been recently getting in Guillermo Del Toro's movies and I have to say that, so far, this is the best one I have seen.One thing that saddens me though is that there are some reviewers of this film who are giving it a low grade because they didn't know that it was a Spanish film with English subtitles.  It's really a shame that the people who went into this film uninformed are bringing down the rating of a spectacular film.  After a while, I honestly didn't even realize I was watching a subtitled film.  The story and acting are very strong and the effects are simply stunning.

But this movie has WAY too much gratuitous violence. Did we need to see the Captain sew his mouth up or gruesomely kill so many people? It's violence like this that plant seeds of grotesque fascination in the subconscious and manifest in the atrocities of modern life (terrorism, school shootings, etc.)...the beauty of this film was tragically overshadowed by its lack of control and grace in portraying the evil side of the story.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A27H9DOUGY9FOS	"K. Harris ""Film aficionado"""	"I remember my reaction upon seeing ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in its initial release as if it were yesterday, and I've viewed it many times since.  As I was wrapping up 2006, I looked back on the films that I had seen and proclaimed ""United 93"" as my personal choice for best film of the year.  When, however, I saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" at the end of the year, I had to split the honor! Capitalizing on its technical merits and combining them with politics and a heartrending story, this is a film that impressed me on every level.  It involved me intellectually AND moved me emotionally in surprising and unexpected ways. So I had to revise. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" now stands side by side with ""United 93"" as my personal favorite for 2006.The beauty of Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" can be defined in many ways. First and foremost, though, I'd have to single out the complexity of the storytelling. This Spanish film can be appreciated as a child's fantasy, or a look at fascism and rebellion, or an intense and harrowing family drama, or a horror movie, or a study of the nature of violence. Interweaving different components that should not work together, del Toro has crafted a singularly unique film that takes risks. This adult fable expertly combines vicious and graphic brutality with the wonderment and fantasy of childhood. Like nothing you've seen before, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an artistic marvel. The narrative is enhanced by a beautiful score, tremendous effects, wonderful art direction and cinematography.The plot of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" follows 12 year old Ofelia, who relocates with her pregnant mother to the home of her new stepfather in the Spanish countryside. A Fascist officer near the end of World War II, the stepfather is on assignment to oust the rebels from the hills surrounding the estate. Ofelia, obsessed with fairy tales, becomes caught up in a fantastical underground world where she is a princess and must undertake various missions to help reclaim the kingdom. The story of the Officer's indifference and contempt for Ofelia while her mother endures a difficult pregnancy provides strong domestic drama, scenes of the Officer's confrontations and torture of the rebels provides harrowing intrigue and action, and Ofelia's underground caverns provides horror and wonder and one of the most expertly crafted ""fantasy"" worlds depicted on film.All of the actors are wonderful, and their contributions should not be overlooked. The actress who portrays Ofelia, in particular, carries a heavy burden but pulls off the complexity of the varying storylines. Amazingly, any of the individual story threads would make a great film on its own.  Each is developed and has real emotional consequence. But by putting them together with such effectiveness, del Toro has created his masterpiece--bold, unconventional, and thrillingly different. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was nominated for six Oscars and winning for cinematography, make-up and art direction.  ""Pan's"" was also the National Society Of Film Critics choice for Best Picture of the Year for 2006.I was thrilled by ""Pan's"" filmmaking, but more importantly I was moved by its story and performances. My highest recommendation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a film I cherish and remember.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A32K4BV5DFG3KP	Killerwokz	This movie is visually stunning and it has a heart wrenching familiar story. A little bit in feel of, I'm sorry but I have to say it, Alice in Wonderland. Those are a few of the feelings that I felt while watching this film. I was so drawn into the duality of the story of this film, that it really didn't bother me that it was in Spanish. The story was just so fantastic that I got lost in it. I am torn on the dubbing idea, on one side I hope to be able to enjoy the more visual aspect of the film sets and the characters expressions, etc, instead of reading subtitles; on the other hand there was a certain mystique in that the film was in Spanish. Perhaps to dub it would be like ruining a masterpiece. This movie is not for kids and a lot of reviews have blasted the film for the violence in it. I can accept that there is a story that needs to be told here, and that we can't reduce the horrors of war, or the monstrosities of evil people, just to make ourselves feel safe. I highly recommend this film; it is a story of a fight for freedom in the mind and the fight for freedom in the world.	5.0	A Beautiful magical masterpiece, hauntingly familar, incredible.	2007-05-20	0	0	0

Sorry to those who complain it's too violent.  It's not gratuitous action violence like most movies these days.  It's brutal war violence that is necessary to help set the mood of the story.  One person complained because there's no English dub.  I'm GLAD there's no dub.  This needs to be in Spanish w/ subtitles.  Dubbing would ruin some of the emotion.  Overall, both my wife and I enjoyed this film.  It really sucked us in to its story.  (In some ways, this reminded me of Life Is Beautiful.  Perhaps it was the foreign language aspect, or even the period of the film, but I think it it was probably the central theme that admidst a terrible ordeal, there's this underlying story of hope and love.

There, Ofelia discovers an old stone maze that leads to an underground world of fairies and adventures while above ground, the captain is closing in on a rag-tag band of insurgents.This remarkable movie is alternately beautiful and grotesque, cruel and fantastic.  Ofelia's fairyland is not a cute Disney version of make-believe, but a dark and scary place and this movie is definitely not for children.

It's not about good or evil, it's about how people react to possibly harmful experiences. Some people like 'a' little girl hide in their fantasy world. The fantasy world in the film is mainly created for the viewer, an adult person. It's of little use to the little girl although she certainly seems to enjoy it. Although better then her reality it's certainly not for the squeamish either, more like a horror than a fairy tale, because even its fairies are a bit scary.The ending is brilliant and interesting in that the viewer usually makes a choice here between fantasy and reality. What does it mean when we choose either one? Does it mean that we're firmly grounded in reality or weak? With out imagination or with too much imagination? Insensitive or oversensitive? Intelligent or silly?It's like some elaborate experiment on the viewer. Art meets psychology...I certainly made my choice there, too.	5.0	a rare gem	2007-08-29	3	2	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3KPXMHQYDZX30	Krok	"Even if you're not into foreign films, this is a must-own if you enjoy films in the fantasy genre.  It takes place during the immediate aftermath of the Spanish civil war in the latter stages of WWII.  The protagonist, Ofelia, and her mother travel to the mountains to be with her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a brutal commander charged with fighting Spanish rebel forces hiding out in the mountains.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant with Vidal's child and has joined Vidal at his post to finish the remainder of her pregnancy.Soon thereafter, Ofelia encounters a fairy in the woods who takes her to see the Faun (i.e., Pan).  Faun believes Ofelia is the long-lost Princess Moanna of the underworld, who left the underworld centuries ago to become mortal.  The Faun then sends Ofelia off to perform certain tasks to prove she is, in fact, the princess, so that she can return to the underworld which can only be done through the Faun's portal.All of this is set against the backdrop of the harsh conditions of post-civil war Spain (headed by the Franco regime) and, more particularly, Capt. Vidal's dictatorial leadership of his men and the village in which they now reside.  Vidal is the perfect villain, the kind you love to hate, whereas Ofelia is very easy to root for.  Ofelia and Vidal have an uneasy relationship from the start, and the director will make you wonder whether Ofelia's encounters with the fantasy world are ""real"" or just her imaginary world - her way of coping with the pain of living with Vidal.  Simulaneously, there is the subplot of whether the rebels will be able to avoid being caught by Vidal and his men.When I first saw this in the theaters, I was blown away by it and now own the DVD.  I've seen it several times since and it doesn't get old.  The cast is excellent, and both Ofelia's quest and the realistic subplot are captivating.  The film explores a number of themes here - freedom, independence, the desire to feel special - and ultimately is a very touching story.  It doesn't drag at all and will be over before the you know it, and that's even while watching subtitles!  Highly recommended!"	5.0	Amazing Fantasy Set In the Backdrop of Reality	2009-01-28	1	1	0

The tyranny that can occur by egomanical little men given an iota of power. The tragedy for Ofelia, which began at her fathers death, and continued through the auspices of her weak-willed, purposefully blind mother. Her mother refuses to acknowledge what she knows to be true: that she married for her own comfort, to allay her own fears, at her daughters expense. There is no going back and it cannot end well for Ofelia. Children are nearly voiceless in our modern society, let alone back in post-war Spain. The step-father, captain, whatever, is an emotional and moral monster. He is war. This story could have been told in any age, during any war. Children will always be the most vulnerable casualty of any war. I am sorry that some reviewers didn't seem to get it.

I jumped at the chance to see it on the big screen and when it was all over I decided I needed to own this movie. A few months later I hear about the DVD and I pre-ordered the 2-disc special edition.The first thing anyone needs to know is that Pan's Labyrinth is completely is Spanish. If you don't like reading subtitles, I recommend that you look past that and try this movie out anyway. I, for one, really love the story and believe me when I say that this movie would not have been nearly as good had it been dubbed.So, that being said, there are some definite dark points in the story and some scenes that are a little bit...gory, for lack of a better word. Beneath all this is a sense of mystique and wonder.From early on you begin to develop your feelings for the characters, and as every moment passes you can't wait to find out what will happen next.The original score fits absolutely perfectly and really grasps the mood of the scene; it really lends to the emotions you're intended to feel. The lullaby that seems to be the main theme is simple and memorable, really beautiful in its simplicity.Character designs are really well done. The fairy-tale characters look awesome, as though they were brought right out of some forgotten mythology.The set designs were, in my opinion, very well done. All the detail that was needed was included, as well as the extra detail that adds to the realism and believability of the scene.I personally really liked the extras. Each one in its own way helps you better understand the movie and the individual characters. You also get a really good explanation of where the director was coming from. For those reasons I would say the extras make it worth getting the 2-disc platinum above the regular release.Overall I give this two thumbs up with a few extras thrown in!	5.0	Review of PL	2007-06-10	3	3	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AZ78HT7H9DVJG	LARRY	"I truly enjoyed *Pan's Labyrinth* as a dark fairytale.  But, dagnabit, it left me wanting more.  Ofelia, the girl in this story, journeys only to the border of this ""other land"".  I thought that this movie would delve deeper into this strange land and its inhabitants.Ofelia and her widowed pregnant mother move to an abandoned mill to be with the new stepfather/husband.  The stepfather is a military captain who is fighting against guerilla army that seems to be invisible.  However, the captain is a cruel man.  He is just harsh to everyone.Upon arrival at the mill, Ofelia discovers a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her to a world underground.  From there, she meets an ancient faun.  The faun tells her that she of a royal lineage.  But, before she can return to the royal lineage, she must do 3 tasks that comes with explicit instructions.I just love the everything about this movie.  However, it just left me wishing for more of this other world.  It was such a big tease to get a ""taste"" of this world.  My favorite was this episode where Ofelia was given a magic chalk to retrieve an object.  In this room was a creature who use its hand to see.  You just got to see the movie to see what I'm talking about.  I thought that was such an original idea.I love how this fairy tale wasn't always so gleefully bright.  I love how suspense were used.  I loved how it left you uncertain if the faun was ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"" with its own agenda.  *Pan's Labyrinth* was a refreshing break from these predictable films.I certainly hope that del Toro will direct something like thing very soon."	5.0	gimme more!	2007-05-29	4	2	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fantay for adults featuring the character of Greek mythology -- Pan -- that appears under its other name, Faunus, and its relationship with a young girl to whom it promises eternity if she fulfills certain fantiastic and difficult requirements. The film was made in Spain and is in Spanish with English subtitles.Set in fascist Spain during late World War II, a girl goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather, a ruthless and vile Army captain. She meets a fairy -- a Peter Pan butterfly type fluttering around on wings of gossamer -- that takes her to the labyrinth where she meets Pan, whom the film calls faun. Pan explains to the girl the terms of her involvement and, should she fulfill these duties, she will become a princess for life. Or something like that.She takes steps to fulfill her duty, only to regularly run into problems with hobgoblins, bizarre creatures without eyes, lots more fairies floating around, and other distractions. Fortunately, Pan provides her with magic chalk with which she can create her own door whenever she needs to escape one of these moments.In the denouement she must take her new baby brother to the labyrinth and do something really bad with him. When she refues, the story peaks. In the meantime, bad guy stepdad and his army buddies have pretty much worn her down, offed her mom, and sent everyone she knows packing. It wasn't clear at the end of the film whether or not she had fulfilled her duty and achieved her salvation.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is, in my opinion, a high class chick flick. It is full of magic, fantastic scenes and creatures, events that transcend reality, and its heroes are all women and the young girl that stars. The men are almost all bad guys and stepdad is the second coming of Darth Vadar.This movie will interest a lot of people because of its fantastic and lyrical storyline and its marvelous effects. Parents of minor children should be warned there is a lot of violence in the film, much that is graphic in nature, making this far more an adult fairy tale than one for kids."	4.0	A lyric fantasy and adult fairy tale	2007-08-19	11	8	3

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AY2MPFJ8TXC1	Laura	Previews led me to believe this movie was a dark albeit fantastical fairy tale.  I was thinking along the lines of Narnia or Spiderwick with an adult edge.  I was very wrong.  I am still disturbed by this movie, which creeps up in my nightmares - and it's been over a year since I've seen it.  I wish with all my heart that I had never watched it - and my husband (who loves horror films!) feels the same way.  Being parents may be part of this - dead children aren't my favorite things.  This movie of course was very artistic, but please bear in mind - it's a hard-hitting, graphic, realistic, and nightmarish tale.  I would've rated it NC-17.  Just one example - there is a terrifying monster that dines on children.  I don't think the story was that fantasy-based - more of it was about real-life horrors, which made it all the more depressing.  If you enjoy depressing tales that make you wish you had never been born, you might like this movie.  If you like watching movies for entertainment, have/like kids, dislike graphic horror violence, enjoy watching the sun rise in the morning, etc. - pass on this harrowing film.	1.0	Wish I'd Never Watched It	2009-09-15	49	9	40

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"""El Laberinto del Fauno"" (""Pan's Labyrinth"") is most decidedly not a children's film.  My wife chose it for our viewing pleasure this afternoon thinking it was some sort of special effects spectacular, comparable to ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" or ""La cite des enfants perdus"" (""The City of Lost Children""), but this film from writer-director Guillermo del Toro (""El Espinazo del Diablo,"" ""Hellboy"") is not for children, even if at its heart it is a story about a young girl.  The time is 1944 and the setting is Franco's Spain, where 10-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is traveling with her very pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the forest to a camp where her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is hunting down resistance fighters and passing out Franco's daily bread.  Vidal is an authoritarian sadist more in keeping with our ideas about Nazi thugs than what little we know about Fascist Spain beyond the toxic effects of machismo, so it is little wonder that Ofelia is so willing to embrace the fantasy world that opens up to her.On the road to her new life, Ofelia discovers a strangely carved rock and sees an odd insect that she thinks if a fairy.  This turns out to be the case and leads her to the decaying labyrinth and an ancient faun (Doug Jones), who reveals to the young girl both her past and her possible destiny (the faun never says his name is Pan or is called Pan in the film, but a literal translation of the film's title as ""The Labyrinth of the Faun"" would clearly have confused too many potential viewers).  Meanwhile, Vidal is continuing his pursuit of the resistance fighters, oblivious to the fact that he has an informer in his camp, setting up a fatal confrontation between the young girl and the man she keeps insisting is not her father.It is astounding to me that del Toro is able to entwine the fantasy and fascist plotlines like this, and the biggest compliment I can pay to his efforts is that each thread is capable of standing on its own.  I never found myself wanting to get back to the other half of the story and I was so engrossed in the film (and not just because I had to read the subtitles) that I completely forgot about the opening shot of the film when we came back around to it at the end.  My one complaint with the film is with regards to the character of Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), because I thought it was way too obvious what she was really doing and because she was a couple of minutes late coming up with the idea of using a knife to cut somebody's throat.  But there actually was an explanation as to why she would get away with it (""Pride"" would be something of an understatement), and del Toro comes up with a totally fitting final punishment for the villain just as the heroine finds her own grace note.It is because of the graphic violence associated with Vidal's killing and torturing of resistance fighters that movie theaters in Mexico were putting up signs warning parents who were taking their small children to watch what they assumed was a fantasy film.  My wife says it is the worse stuff she has ever seen, but she has not seen the end of ""Odishon"" (""Audition""), and I can understand how people would show up to see this film without ever notice it was rated R, but now that I have seen it I can only repeat the warning that ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is not for the kidlets.  This 2006 film is up for a half-dozen Oscars for Art Direction (Eugenio Caballero and Pilar Revuelta), Cinematography (Guillermo Navarro), Makeup (David Marti and Montse Ribe), Original Score (Javier Navarrete), and Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Guillermo del Toro), which is why it has to be the favorite to win Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.  I am surprised it actually came to the Zenith City, but even without seeing the competition I have to believe that all of those Academy Award nominations make this another category where the winner is a foregone conclusion."	5.0	"Do not think for a moment that ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a children's film"	2007-01-27	13	8	5

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2IP7N99N3S9T0	"Leah ""Leah"""	"This was just an incredible movie.  It was hard for me to imagine that the same Guillermo del Toro who directed ""Hellboy"" was the same guy who made this movie.  Not since the late 80's when I watched Jim Henson's ""Dark Crystal"" have I ever been so horrified, moved and engrossed by what some would classify as a fantasy movie.  Called  a ""grown-up's fairy tale,""  Pan's Labyrinth is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to take the journey it is definitely worth it.The story is set in the 1930's, during the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl who moves with her pregnant mother to a rural military outpost to be with her new stepfather, the ruthless Captain Vidal.  The captain is in charge of taking on resistance fighters in the mountains nearby.Beside the outpost is an old garden with a labyrinth, and this is where Ofelia meets the Faun.  He tells her that she could be the princess that their kingdom had lost long ago, and to prove that she was worthy of regaining her throne he gave her a magical book outlining 3 tasks she must complete before the full moon arrives.Two characters stood out for me in this movie, both of them women.  The first of course was Ofelia, played by the amazing Ivana Baquero.  The intensity in which she was able to convey Ofelia's innocence and strength literally grabbed me by the collar throughout the whole movie.  The other character was the housekeeper Mercedes played by Maribel Verdu. (I was surprised at her transformation from the seductress she had played in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"").  Mercedes was the other heroine of this story, and I could clearly see the depth of her courage strengthening with her resolve.  With the same mouth she once used to say ""I am a coward"" also came the chilling words ""you are not the first pig I've ever gutted"" as she held a knife against a tormentor, rage burning in her eyes.The movie is completely in Spanish with subtitles, and it worked perfectly.  The fluidity of the Spanish language made me feel like I was listening to music instead of spoken words.  The score also played a great part, the movie's main theme is a sad lullaby, hummed because the words have long been forgotten.  The cinematography was also a work of art in itself, almost a gray monotone throughout the film except in the Faun's fantasy world.There were a lot of themes in this movie:  The depth of a child's love, fearless in its simplicity.  The courageous choices that ordinary people make, even in the face of great danger or even death, to stand up for those they love and what they believe in.  The savage, cold-blooded brutality that the powerful can inflict over the weak.  The truth that our external battles can only be faced and fought when we've conquered our battles and fears from within.As I was exiting the theater after the movie ended, I happened to glance down at a couple that was in one of the lower seats.  A man was holding his wife, who was sobbing openly (and quite audibly, I might add) in his arms.  Sheepishly I wondered if anyone would notice that my eyes were puffy too (since I had been crying myself).  It was hard to deny the strong emotions that all of us felt, even after the end credits rolled by.  For me, it was a bittersweet feeling - of  grief at the depth of Ofelia's choice, and then sharing in her triumph in spite of  her great sacrifice."	5.0	A work of art!	2007-03-23	5	3	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A349M9NF9PW7UK	Leicester Dedlock	"First I must say that the previews were a bit misleading.  The film contains fantasy elements but it is mostly a film about war, treachery, and rebellion in 1940's Spain.  The two ""halves"" of the movie are well-done and I would say that this gives the movie wide appeal.  Since the film combines two very different elements and the scenes rarely overlap these elements, I'll review them separately.Fantasy - When we hear the word ""fantasy"", we thing ""kid's stuff"".  This, however, I would not recommend for children.  The fantasy elements revolve around a young girl who is a reincarnation of the Princess of the Underground Realm.  The Princess had escaped from the Underground Realm only to have her memory erased by the sun.  She eventually fell victim to the illnesses of the surface world and died.  The reincarnation of the Princess stumbles upon a labyrinth and meets a faun who gives her three tasks to prove that she has not turned into a mortal.  Each of the tasks are interesting and the first two are quite visually appealing.  They might not be appropriate for children since the first is disgusting, the second is scary, and the third is implicitly violent.  However, these scenes are a joy to watch for adults.Rebellion - This is what the movie mostly focuses on.  It's a rather violent narration of rebellion and treachery in Spain.  The Princess' stepfather is an extremely cruel military officer whose followers are not always the most loyal.  The scenes of treachery will make your heart jump because there is always a constant feeling of dread and the traitors are so close to the stepfather that they are bound to be caught.  Also, the stepfather is an intelligent man who catches onto things quickly.  This part of the story also follows the Princess' earthly mother who is sick with baby and the daughter's attempts to heal her suffering.  This part also ties into the fantasy elements.  Overall, the rebellion story is even better done than the fantasy part.  Any filmgoer will surely feel nothing but hatred for the stepfather and nothing but sympathy for the girl and her mother.  The plotline is a bit simplistic, but the dialogue is good and the plot is played out well and at a reasonable pace.  However, do note that this part of the film is very graphic and is not appropriate for children.Overall, I would say there is something here for just about everyone.  I wouldn't say it's the masterpiece that many make it out to be, but it's still a very enjoyable film."	4.0	Mildly overrated but definitely worth picking up	2007-06-24	3	1	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3MLO4GAD2O9DL	"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy"""	Starting with 1992's Cronos, a unique take on the vampire film, Mexican Guillermo del Toro has made some of the most compelling dark fantasy films for adults seen today. Along with Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth should be ranked as one of his best.As is true of a recent prior film, The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth is set in Franco's Spain, and, more so than was true of the previous film, openly blasts the fascist regime for its brutal cruelty, personified in a star turn by Sergi Lopez as Capitan Vidal, the new husband of a woman who has come to Vidal's HQ with her 12-year old daughter Ofelia.Ofelia, as it happens, has a vivid imagination and in short order, enters fantasy worlds of her own creation, populated by a huge leering Faun, small flying fairies, a monstrous man with eyes on his hands, and a gigantic slob of a toad, buried under a mountain. Certainly this film was inspired by the great 1973 Spanish fantasy film Spirit of the Beehive, directed by Victor Erice, in which the young girl protagonist imagines herself in the world of the original Frankenstein film. As well, Jorge Luis Borges is clearly another inspiration, with the labyrinth--a fovorite Borges motif--figuring prominently in this del Toro film.Brutality destroys life, this film says, and will not stop doing so until its source is stopped. In the face of that brutality we construct our own realities--and/or fantasies--to cope with what we must confront. Ofelia builds her fantasy world while outside her, others have established a real world of rebel opposition to the fascist Franco regime. Del Toro juxtaposes these--the fantastic and the real--with great skill; we are constantly shuttling back and forth between them, but the movement is supple and fluid, and most of all, makes perfect sense as the story progresses.A fairy tale for adults (as this film is billed), this is really a romance in the traditional sense of the word--meaning an adventure that takes the protagonist from a beginning of innocence through a series of exploits and encounters to an ending of maturity gained from experience, the opposite of innocence. The other vital element of romance is tragedy and that is here as well. Del Toro has, in fact, here fashioned a classic romance with meticulous care.Very highly recommended.	4.0	One of del Toro's best	2007-01-07	3	1	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3PUVLBMBHDNWT	Lissa	"This movie starts off well, and it's obviously very well-filmed. The imagery of the Spanish countryside in the beginning is striking and magical. The journey of Ofelia and her mother to the mill is interesting. The dialogue and acting seems solid. But soon the graphic violence of Captain Vidal takes precedence over any other element of the movie. At first this violence filled me with hatred towards Vidal alone, which was good, and made me appreciate the effectiveness of the direction to inspire these feelings, but then the graphic violence continued over and over, scene after scene, apparently supposed to build your anger and suspense, but the thing is that you already hated Vidal to the utmost at the beginning; the audience gets that Vidal is an evil monster from his first act of cruelty, when he has an innocent teenage boy grotesquely beaten to death in front of his father, and then has his father shot. But this film continues to shove so much torture down the audience's throat that it made my disgust spill over to the writer, the director and everyone involved in the concept of this movie. It was utterly pointless to rehash the horrific acts over and over, and did absolutely nothing for the film.In defense of this movie, some people have said that fairy tales are supposed to be dark. Of course they are. But this was not merely a ""dark fairy tale."" It ceased to be a dark fairy tale somewhere around a quarter of the way through and turned into a sadistic torture film. If there had been only a couple of scenes of it, that could have been good, but the scenes of graphic horror far outweighed the fantastical ones (which I might add were not very fantastical to begin with, but more filled with a brooding anxiety, while the satyr Faun was simply creepy.. not giving the audience a good antidote/contrast to the darkness of the real world). In this day and age, many people seem to think abundant violence in movies can be complex and intelligent, which is a travesty. You don't need a horde of torture scenes for a complex movie. Quite the opposite. They could have filmed the expressions and the reactions of the characters, rather than all of the graphic horror acts themselves, and that would have been much deeper and complex.I also have to say that there were a lot of weak characters in this story, like Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She was a weak mother, and that was such a shame to see. In many fairy tales, the mother is either dead or a nonentity, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to portray a strong mother for a change. Nope. She seems purposely oblivious to her husband's brutality at times, scared at others, and overall too weak emotionally and mentally to protect herself, her daughter or her coming son. In fact, Ofelia and the maidservant Mercedes are the only strong and admirable female characters, but Ofelia is only a girl.The ending does not compensate for the disturbing flaws of this movie. It's not satisfying at all, and you don't feel like Vidal gets his due, or that Ofelia truly triumphs after she tried so hard to fight. And after all of the darkness of the movie, you really need that feeling of triumph and purpose, but you don't get it. Overall, there was very little to appreciate and nothing to learn from this movie. It was not only a disappointment, but a distasteful experience."	1.0	Far too disturbing	2009-02-17	159	58	101
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A10YU4ON5LJ6SM	L. MacDonald	Pans Labyrinth is an interesting film which gives the viewer an amazing insight to the way that the 1944 Spanish civil war could affect an innocent child. Directed by Guilleme Del Toro, the film is enjoyable for the audience to watch, but also makes them think about the deeper meaning of the plot and how a childish escape from the real world can be taken too far.Being only fourteen, and under the reccomended age for the film to be viewed at, you would be surpirised at how much i understood of this film, and also how interesting it was to me. Although, to be honest if i had viewed this at age any younger than mine, i would not have understood the film and i would have had nightmares for a few days as it does have some disturbing scenes. I would rate this film a 5 simply because of the entertainment factor as it is a very good movie as a whole, but also because, like very few movies i have seen, it really makes you think.On the outside, Ofelia is a young girl with a vivid imagination who, along with her heavily pregnant mother, has to move to the base of her new-step father, the captain. When she discovers a labyrinth and meets a faun, Ofelia finds herself being swept into the world of fairytales like the ones she reads about. She is given three life-threatning tasks which will prove she is Princess Moanna of the underworld. Although she breaks the rules in the second task, when she is shot dead at the end by the captain, in her imagination she returns to fufil her place as a princess.Altough this is infact the story, there also seem to be much deeper meanings to the film, for example the way that at certain points in the movie, things seem to represent different things, such as in the scene where Ofelia has to face the toad. In a way, it could possibly be seen that the fig tree and toad represent the facists, and Ofeila represents the resistence. After watching the film it should be easier to see why i think this, but it is only a suggestion and was probably never delibrate. It can also be seen at several occasions in this film, whilst in the 'fairytale world' Ofelia seems to take up most of camera and be prioritised in the shot, whereas in the 'real world' she is very small in comparision to the adults and the background, although again, this could just be me reading further into this than i need to.Overall, Pans Labyrinth is oone of the best films i have seen in a long time, and although i usually stick to horrors, this one will always be on my top 5 favourite list of movies. It is definatly worth a watch, but for younger children it is not something i would recommend, as i know i would not have liked to watch it much younger than this.	5.0	absolutely incredible.	2010-03-24	3	1	2

In respect to story content, I have to give a very tiny bit of credit to the writer, who at the end, i guess, tryed to express that good ultimately triumphs over evil.

I bought this movie the day it came out and watched it. That was the only time I ever watched the movie. Because right after I forced myself to finish watching the movie, I threw it in the garbage. I loved the concept of the movie but there was too much gore for me. If you have a weak stomach or you're easily queasy, then stay far away from this movie. I had nightmares for months after watching this movie. Not because of the mythical creatures or how weird they looked but because of the killing in the movie. The step-father is brutal and evil. The way he and his army were killing people and torturing them was utterly repulsive. There was one scene where 2 farmers, father and son, were caught because they were thought to have been stealing in the field. And the way the son was killed, by having his face bashed in with the [...] of a hammer or flashlight, then shot, was just horrible. That scene played over and over in my mind and nightmares. I wouldn't recommned this movie to anyone who's queasy.But besides from that, the movie was good. The storyline and the visual were all excellent.	1.0	Good movie that gave me horrible nightmares	2008-06-13	49	10	39

A true work of art. I can't imagine how many hours of time and effort were put into designing these costumes, to perfecting these characters' personalities, the set design, the script, the plot, the story, the result, etc.,This is the story of a young girl named Ofelia who is faced with two worlds; the land of reality, where the consequences of the Spanish Civil War still take a violent toll on the lives of the innocent, and the land of fantasy, where she is sent on a quest by El Fauno (Pan) to recover her immortality and her right to the throne as Princess Moanna. In her reality she faces a mother who is pregnant and very sick because of it and her evil stepfather, who may or may not be their undoing.It should also be noted however, that this movie can be extremely(!!) graphic & violent in some parts, and certain images may scare younger children.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2UEDF0J96M9WN	Luthian	I watched this movie shortly after it was released on DVD.  I had heard mixed opinions from friends of mine, as well as reviews online.  I have to say, I was prepared for something completely different.For one, this is NOT a family friendly movie - especially if you have young children.  It is dark and can be quite violent.  I have no idea why this movie was marketed the way it was; as a family fantasy movie.  Despite some of the comments on Amazon, it is creative and imaginative, though it is not comparable to films like Lord of the Rings... nor does it try to be.  Therefore I am confused by the comparison.  I'd only assume that some people think that - in order to be a fantasy movie - it must be filled to the brim with elves and swordplay.Again, it is dark.  If you are a parent and feel uneasy due to the reviews on this website, I suggest that you rent it first.Overall, I did enjoy this movie. It is interesting, imaginative, beautiful, and tragic.  Do not go into it thinking that this is a typical fantasy movie or you will be disappointed, though I'd still consider it a fantasy film.I gave the movie 4 stars because I felt the ending was a bit anticlimactic.  As an aside, please try and avoid the reviews that put an emphasis on political leanings.  This is not a political film.  It is a film that revolves around the life of a little girl and her family during the Spanish civil war.  Then again, if you really wish to find a specific hidden meaning in any form of media, you will find a way to rationalize said meaning into existence.	4.0	Well, I liked it.	2008-06-16	0	0	0

Unfortunately, the fantasy was sadly lacking. I don't want to put in a spoiler, but I will say that I definitely hated the ending. I was ok with the rest of the movie and would have given it 3 stars except that the ending knocked it down to 2 stars.Also, the DVD quality is lacking - the English subtitles stopped appearing around scene 18 and it took a bit of button pressing to get them to show again.  And the directors commentary cut out around scene 19 and I again had to do a bit of button pressing to get it back.And am I the only one that was annoyed with the amount of scene transitions that the director put in?

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3JX5C8CIOJ5L5	macdougallgreen6	Guillermo del Toro has become one of cinema's true film magicians throughout his career, which started with a steampunk-sprinkled vampire yarn titled Cronos, and has seen films made about ghost stories, super heroes, and giant freaking cockroaches. It is with Pan's Labyrinth, however, that del Toro makes his name known to all. Simply put, this film is perfection, and a true dark fairy tale. It is a film that represents the innocence of a young child, a theme del Toro visited earlier in his 2001 ghost story The Devil's BackboneThe Devil's Backbone (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]. This film is at times ultra-violent and appealing to the child in even the most cynical adult, yet also one of the most visually stimulating films ever made. It's basically Guillermo del Toro's mind poured out into a film canister.I own the single-disc DVD version of the film, which contains a video prologue by the director as well as del Toro's feature-length audio commentary. It's in the original aspect ratio (1.85.1) and a very good and easy to understand English subtitle translation of the Spanish-language film.

Before they got Disney-fied. Sure, there's violence here, some of it shocking, but none of it gratuitous. Could it give a kid nightmares? Maybe. But given today's pablum stories, maybe it's about time.Pan's Labyrinth takes us directly into the subconscious, and into the storyforms that infuse all of the great myths, fairy tales, and religions. It's a rich and satisfying stew of symbolism, mystery, and redemption. Multilayered and inspiring, it's a film you'll want to see again. It's hard not to gush, but it's been so long since a movie this good has made it into the quasi-mainstream.What makes Pan's Labyrinth most effective is it's juxtaposition of harsh ""reality"" and the mysterious world that lives side by side with it. The heroine, a young girl who may carry a magical seed of immortality (the soul of god's only child who once ventured into the world of men, suffered, and died long ago), is contacted by shapeshifting fairies who lead her to a faun (much like the mythological Pan) who says she may reclaim her throne and escape the mortal world by performing three tasks. The faun in Pan's Labyrinth is every bit as complex as the mythological Pan, a creature perhaps older than the gods themselves. There's something sly, and perhaps even sexual about this elegant and almost alien faun, as he represents the forces at play inside this sensitive young girl. In fact, like every good fairy tale, all of the strange, wondrous, and chilling creatures represent facets of the subconscious, including baby-eating ghouls, flitting fairies, and gluttonous toads.Pan's Labyrinth is a commentary on the resiliency and power of the human imagination, and takes us to the place where dreams are spun and the great heroic tale of overcoming (of the self and the world) takes root. That spark of the divine in all of us -- or at least the hope of it -- powers the great story of our lives, and we need tales like this to remind of us of the magic and transformative power of story telling. In the flickering light of the theater, like some great hearth around which we've gathered, Pan's Labyrinth took me back to my childhood, and made me think of so many of the great stories I'd read over the years -- of demonic dogs with saucer-sized eyes, of child-stealing trolls, and evil stepmothers. And, finally, of the champions who venture down into those great cracks in the Earth, where the roots of mythic trees twist and wind and the greatest treasure of all can be found: the noble, heroic, and undying spirit that lies within us."	5.0	Astounding.	2007-01-27	871	789	82

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	"There are 2 films within this movie :1. Reality through a young girls' eyes - Set in war-torn Europe, the young girl from a dysfunctional family is distracted by an alternative universe of magical beings, where she is told she is a princess of an Underworld Kingdom, and has to perform certain tasks to attain the title. These `magical tasks' (which are the centerpiece of the movie) are by far the most visually arresting I've seen in a while - it reminded me a lot of Tarsem's ""The Cell"" (the underrated masterpiece starring Jennifer Lopez) both visually and metaphorically.2. Reality as it is - The film also parallelly follows the reality of the girls' family and how the world views her - which means there is nothing magical going on, just a lot of violence and sadness, as to be expected from the dreariness of the era. Throw in an abusive father, a spineless mother, and inhospitable living conditions, and you can imagine why the girl is so desperate to block this reality out.The interesting thing is, the viewer is not told which reality is true. In the end, when realities converge, it is left very vague as to whose world is real. On one hand, it is suggested that the girls' elaborate fantasy (and in fact the entire film, thereby) is just an illusion. On the other hand, it is suggested that all the story was is one girls' attempt to escape the harshness of the world by creating an imaginary world that only she could see and understand. I prefer to think it's the former, but either way, this is a beautiful film that makes you think. The cinematography is brilliant, and the special effects are truly exemplary.However, even though I do adore this film, I can see why some people would find it pretentious and meaningless. I mean, those are cruel words for a film of this beauty, but the end of the film can leave you very cold and un-moved, even if you did enjoy everything that came before it. I saw this with someone who felt the same way but was left down by the end, which was more of an anti-climax, in the worst sort of way.The highlight of the film is definitely the young actress. She is not very talented as an `actress' per se, and if you know a little about film-making you can see that the performance she gave is definitely because of the efforts of her director to make her `look better' as an actress.That said, this is a glorious film that you should watch with someone who appreciates foreign film as much as you do. It is by no means a perfect movie, but as films of 2006 go, this was pretty much the cream of the crop."	3.0	Reality Bites : A Young Minds' Escapist Fantasies	2007-04-30	21	6	15

For those who hate this movie or have nothing positive to say...you should have done the responsible thing BEFORE watching this film and done some READING on the material contained.  I am a mother and I read about every movie before I watch it because I know that nowadays you have to be careful of what you turn on.  With that said...I am glad this movie was not a 'happy ending' kind of a movie...whether it was potically correct or not...the truth is, it could have been any war...any time...that WAS the reality of war and war is not pretty.  I honestly think people who rented this movie with expectations of it being some fantasy feel good movie should have done the reading beforehand....  I interpreted this movie and the fantasy element as lifelines to Ofelia...missed opportunities to make it out of alive, but the sad reality is that MANY children DON'T make it out alive in war situations.  I cried in the end...but, I really loved how even in her small mind...she was reunited with her parents in the end.  I simply love movies like this...it is not 1,2,3...here is the story line...enjoy and have a fuzzy warm feeling afterwards...it is a movie that makes you think...and leaves you wondering...'what would I have if I were in that situation'?  What we would do to escape the reality we live in?  Could any of us have been as brave as Ofelia?  As Mercedes?  I think movies that leave you wondering and questioning your own lifelihood are the ones that are the most profound.  This movie did that for me.	5.0	Moving...	2008-04-09	2	2	0

Just the way the director captures the beauty of fairy tale creatures is enough to give this movie 5 stars. Not only is the movie a feast for the eyes, but it has a great soundtrack that keeps it rolling along.The whole time you will be kept on the edge of your seats waiting for more and you will not be dissapointed.The movie starts off with a little girl named Ofelia who likes to read fairy tales, and throughout the movie she discovers that she herself is part of a fairy tale. The movie is set in Spain after World War II, and Ofelia finds herself in the middle of a civil war. Ofelia is also facing troubles of her own, her mother is having problems with her pregnancy, and her father-in-law does not like her. Ofelia then stumbles upon a Labyrinth and there she discovers that she is part of a magical kingdom who is waiting for her return. But in order to return home she must complete three tasks before the next full moon, or else the portal will close forever.Even though every task is more difficult then the one before, Ofelia presses on. She finds herself facing life threatening tasks and manages to overcome her first two tasks with the help of her fairy friends. I don't want to give away the ending, but trusts me everyone gets what they deserve.The acting is incredible, each and every character is brought to life, human and creature alike. You might also wonder, Why is a movie this beautiful rated R? Well because it is not for kids. It is a very gory film with very explicit torture scenes, and other very violent scenes ( Some with children in peril). But if you can look passed all that this is a beautiful Masterpiece.	5.0	Finally...A Real Life Fairy Tale	2007-05-23	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2D37EP9KT2E3D	"Mark bennett ""Mark"""	"This film is a shallow political melodrama full of stock one-dimensional characters dressed up with special effects and lots of pointless violence carried out by evil ""men"" against women and children. I get the impression that the director wanted to make an expensive heavy-handed ""message"" picture on the spanish civil war and figured out that the way to get it made was to repackage it as a ""fantasy"" picture.As a fantasy picture, it fails for two important reasons. The first is that it is loaded up with postmodernist contempt for the whole idea of fantasy: its for the stupid, the mad or for small children. All the fantasy elements in the film are dismissed in the end as the mad self-destructive delusions of a doomed child. The second reason is that when the fantasy genre is mixed with heavy-handed real-world politics, it never works.The film's view of the spanish civil war is overtly political and childish. Its less sophisticated and more melodramatic than star wars. Darth General and his faceless stormtroopers face off against the brave rebel alliance which though it is weak always wins. The richness of the spanish civil war in a dramatic sense is its ambiguity as reflected in author's like Orwell. There is none of that here. Nobody among the brave rebels questions why they are continuing to fight a war that was lost six years previous. Nobody ever considers the effect of the war on civlians caught in the middle. The army is full of ""evil"" man-monsters who kill the ""good"" women and children. The rebels outnumber the army, beat it at every turn, have sophisticated base complexes and are supported by everyone. The question left unanswered is why the all-powerful rebellion is on the losing side.The violence is totally over the top. There are amputations, bloody pregnancies, death in childbirth, images of child sacrifice, torture, mutiliation, knifings and execution-style shootings.I watched this film because of all the talk, awards and recommendations. But there is nothing about it that really recommends it.Postscript:The hostile feedback votes associated with this review are obviously faked. Its easy to spot fake feedback because it is generally completely out of proportion to the feedback given to other reviews created about the same time.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A34J1A69HIJ83D	Mark Birk	Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic film that is thought provoking throughout.  The film is set in 1940's Spain and fluently switches between reality and fantasy in a way that makes the viewer's imagination run wild.  The viewer's imagination is stimulated in the first scene where Ofelia's blood draws back into her nose.  Is this the future of Ofelia or is this just her fantasy of what she imagined? It is not a children's movie, but it is a fasinating movie about many aspects of life. A must see for all!	5.0	Outstanding	2012-11-03	1	0	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A139ZF7CJVVTJU	"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only"""	"A lush and viciously visceral film, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" twists together the brutal realities of post-war Spain with a vibrant and equally frightening fairy tale land, filled with dangerous quests, helpful faeries, and one questionable, bark-skinned faun.  The end result is as visually decadent as it is emotionally compelling, a harsh but gorgeous and richly-filmed fable.Most of Guillermo del Toro's (Hellboy) story centers around the young Ofelia, a tender-spirited girl who spends much of her time with her nose in a book.  Her mother -- who has recently wed (and carries the unborn child of) the heartless Capitan Vidal -- remarks that it isn't healthy for a girl to read so many fairy tales.  It doesn't seem to occur to her that it is far more unhealthy to move that child to a sawmill-cum-Fascist military compound, especially when that compound is filled with spies, surrounded by rebels, and commanded by a cold, paranoid power-monger.The tension between the light of childish innonce and the dark dredge of men at war is what the movie balances on, like a colorfully creepy Cirque de Soleil performer executing gorgeous cartwheels on a tightrope of razor wire.  Ofelia's fantasy world (real or not, who's to say?) offers some kind of escape, but it's not necessarily the comforting kind.  Perhaps she is reacting to a normal child's helplessness (her pregnant mother grows sicker as the Capitan's struggle with the rebels grows more out of control), perhaps she is just embracing a world with contours that are easier to read, where good and evil are not so hazy or hard to confront.Whatever the case, it makes for entrancing viewing.  The parallel stories turn around each other, unfolding against the drama of righteous resistance, unflagging faith, and hope in the tenuous strength of truth.  A soldier on the verge of death has a gun thrust in his face, and he weakly but defiantly slaps the barrel away several times, knowing that his is a largely symbolic act.  Death isn't the point.  The freedom to fight is.Ofelia fights with equal measure, and to many viewers, it may be hard to watch.  Like the old fairy tales of yore (before Disney cut out the spiny parts and added childish treacle), this is a story that is as creative, imaginative, and weird as it is horrifying and gut-wrenching.  At one point, Ofelia tells a story to her unborn brother about a special flower that, if it is plucked, will give eternal life.  The catch?  Its thorns contain a poison that will kill you instantly.  Because of this risk, the flower remains forever untaken and unused, its potential eternally lost.Ofelia takes risks and so does this movie.  Some may find it hard to stomach, but others, wading through its crisp, uncompromising imagery and its tragic but redemptive telling, might find something to hold onto and remember.  This movie is a gorgeous flower, one worth plucking and saving, but just like Ofelia's fairy tale rose, this is one blossom with bite.(Note: this is a Spanish film with English subtitles.)"	5.0	A Beautiful Maze	2007-01-22	15	12	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A210ECQIZRT7T7	Mark Jegi	"Viewers and reviewers of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" have either blessed or cursed the entwining of its two different worlds.  The arguments on both sides seem based on the expectations brought to the film.My own childhood's difficult search for personal significance recognizes a taste of the familiar in Ofelia's entry into her mythical world.  The film's bittersweet aftertaste, a persistent sensation the day after seeing the film, calls up this perspective.The film's violence provides context in showing that a powerful sense of significance can overcome even the fear of death.  Both the hidden Revolutionaries and Franco's soldiers view the danger they face as the price paid for their own significance, as defined by their separate causes.Captain Vidal reaches back for the significance he failed to achieve from his strict father, and forward to the lasting significance that his unborn child would carry into the future.  In the end, his own actions of repairing his father's stopped timepiece and the final results of his brutality - which deny him even the memory of his name - leave his quest unfulfilled.The myth of the Lost Princess shows Ofelia the path to her own significance.  As a child in war time, she will not find that path in the brutal world around her.  Only in a separate world, where her virtues of courage, ingenuity and resolve have consequence, can she achieve her quest.And in the last moments of the film, we are assured that she does."	5.0	A comment on the role of personal significance	2007-01-27	9	7	2
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language ""Hellboy"". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is ""boring"" and they had to ""read for two hours"". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to ""read"" for two hours, keep on moving.In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in ""Labyrinth"" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name ""Labyrinth"" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a ""quest"" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her ""real world"" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to ""work out"" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in ""American Beauty"" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible ""Pale Man"" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language."	5.0	A Wondrous Fairy Tale that earn's its R-rating	2007-02-14	12	8	4
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A36T27CSCLLVBK	Martinez	"Let me start this review by giving some details about the genre of story telling we know as ""Fairy Tales"". This genre of known as ""Fairy Tales"" was never originally intended for children. In fact there is a lot of historical evidence which points to the fact that most of these old stories were written by adults and meant only for adults.The original nature of ""Fairy Tales"" was not meant to make you feel all good inside and nor were they to always end with ""And they all lived happily ever after...The End"". As others have pointed out we can all blame Disney for ""dumbing"" down this type of genre of story telling. Neither was this form of story telling meant to always include ""High Fantasy"". A lot of ""Fairy Tales"" actually have only bits and pieces of fantasy in them to help further a story along and to draw in the listener/viewer/reader further into the plot.I wont go to deep into the plot of this film but the director Guillermo Del Toro seems to go back to the roots of the original and lost art form of ""Fairy Tales"". Guillermo Del Toro in my honest opinion does an outstanding job of interweaving fantasy with reality. Yet he does not allow the fantasy portions of this film to overwhelm the reality based portions or the viewer. The fantasy portions are meant to force you to make that extra emotional leap. To engage you further into a main story which is all so cruelly based in reality. The reality being the post-Spanish Civil War era in Spain and a little girl with a cruel and self-absorbed step-father who is an officer in the Franco's fascists military. Guillermo Del Toro then wraps it up with a great group of actors and a hard hitting ending.My only complaint is that as others have noted the fantasy portion at the end might have been added to appease American audiences. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie and get to that part. The reality portion of the ending stood strong without the need to include a semi-happy ending if you can call it one. The movie does hit the viewer very hard emotionally. Frankly speaking I'll be honest and admit that as a man I did cry at end.I couldn't help it because maybe I just have a heart and a soft spot for kids. I feel that any movie, book, song, poem, etc that can draw out a strong emotional reaction has reached the apex of its art form in its given genre. Oh and yes there are portions of this film that are extremely violent and should not be viewed by younger children. As others have noted this move has an ""R"" rating for a very good reason as it's meant for adults only. Besides I'll doubt that many young children could keep up with a foreign film done entirely in Spanish let alone understand the slight and subtle plot twists of this movie including the ending.P.S. This is a master piece of a film. To dub this film into English would be like dubbing Karl Orff's vocal portions of  ""Carmina Burana"" into English. For those who are angry that this movie is done entirely in Spanish well all I can say is that you should learn to speak a second language for goodness sake! Or just learn to deal with subtitles in foreign films and try to follow along with the story as best you can.Our society is going to become increasingly more globally oriented as technology and time march onward toward the future. The very nature of our increasingly global economy will demand that you if not your children learn at least a second language. This will grow increasingly true for every other generation hence afterwards when you, I and your children's generation are no more.If you had no idea that this movie was a foreign film then I can understand and forgive the confusion but at least try to give this film a chance."	5.0	Outstanding Film.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who arrives in the Spanish countryside with her pregnant, sick mother (Ariadna Gil); they intend to live with the girl's profoundly evil and cruel stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez) who is in the Spanish army. Despite the fact that the Spanish Civil War is over, rebels still fight in the countryside against the Fascists and Captain Vidal runs a military outpost to eliminate his enemies.The stress of this remarkably brutal and hostile world proves too much for young Ofelia; and she eventually escapes into a world of fantasy. In this world, based partly on a real live labyrinth near the military camp, Ofelia pretends (or believes) that a faun (Doug Jones) will give her three increasingly dangerous tasks to perform. If she succeeds, she will be rewarded by the faun: She will return to her rightful place as a princess in an underground world where she will be loved by her people and life is much more pleasant, to say the least.The plot progresses at a good pace. As real life becomes more and more challenging and stressful, so do the imaginary tasks Ofelia must perform in order to become worthy of entering the world of paradise where she will live forever as a princess.There won't be any plot spoilers here; but I must warn you of this: Pan's Labyrinth is no movie for squeamish people. The events and scenes are quite candid and the spoken lines are as honest and direct as people would have spoken them at the time these real life events occurred. We see many murders and there are several particularly grisly scenes with more blood in them than my community hospital keeps in storage! I briefly closed my eyes once or twice, admittedly, but I kept watching because the film proves itself to be nothing less than a masterful tour de force by all involved and a true work of fine art. The actors portray their characters very convincingly; and the choreography shines in the battle scenes in particular. Look also for a fine performance by Ofelia's only friend besides her mother, the sweet housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;).The DVD comes with a few extras including a commentary with the director (Guillermo del Toro) and an interactive feature that sheds extra light on the making of this fine motion picture.In short, Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent work of fine art that we should watch and watch again for the pleasure of seeing a film that is truly top quality art. I highly recommend Pans Labyrinth for adults--and the children within us--who want to experience a film of grand proportions. Pans Labyrinth takes a serious subject and does it justice with painstaking work on the part of all who worked on it. Don't pass by this superlative motion picture--Pan's Labyrinth is more than worth its weight in gold.	5.0	fine work of art for adults--and the child in all of us	2007-08-18	2	1	1

I've been a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, since he blew my mind with Blade II.  But that film nor his flawed but good follow-up, Hellboy, did not prepare me for the sheer excellence of this film.  Visually stunning and emotionally devastating, del Toro has set a new high-water mark for himself and fairy-tale films here.  The performances also transcend the language-barrier, especially the brutal and chilling Captain.  The film is too intense for young viewers, but I think a new generation will grow into this film and continue to find new layers of it as they grow older.

In as few words as possible, it's about a young girl creating her own fantasyworld to escape her extremely harsh reality. And of course, what happens in the real world effects what happens in her ""fairytale"". People who would compare this to, for instance, The Lord of the Rings (a movie with no line between fantasy and reality), haven't really looked underneath the surface of this film. Because everything that ""really happens"" here is completely straight forward and realistic. I have never seen a more intelligently made movie. As if this wasn't enough, it has the most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard. Sometimes it really hurts to watch this film, but in the only way that you'll probably want more of it. I don't think anything will make you cry if the ending of this movie doesn't, and not just because it's sad but the thought of how well it's done. Do yourself a favor and watch it.

I really dont see what the big hoopla is about this movie. Yes it did have some good parts in it, but damn it seemed like there was so much senseless c**p in it also. I was expecting to watch some fantasy movie, but instead I get some crap about a girl who imagines way to much. The setting with the military guys against some geurilla warfare dudes set back in some old time was annoying. I could care less about it. Everything since the beginning of the movie was just emotionally sad. I thought their would be an uplifting in the movie, something to hold on to, something to make you have hope, but there really wasnt any of that.Artistically, the movie was very pretty in the special effects category. The 'faun' the little girl talks to was VERY well done and looked like a cross between CG and cosmetics (I'm not watching the specials, so I dont know for sure). The monster with eyeballs on its hands, was wickedly freaky.The acting wasnt to bad, but most of it was just annoying. The only good actors was the Captain (who sometimes was a little to annoying with his evilness) and the little girl.Seriously though...did I miss something in this movie? Why is it getting so much praise when it was mediocre at best? 'The Little Princess' is a much better movie when it comes to a girl who is in a rut pretending about fairy tales to make her life better. 'Bridge to Taribithia' was also a better movie about a kid(s) having a make believe area to better their lives... and I didnt even care for that movie that much.Sorry, but this just did not do it for me.	3.0	What?

A grim, desolate Spain where hope lies in the imagination of a little girl and the unflinching bravery of a small group of rebels. Though the two never meet in person, their intertwining storylines lead the viewer on an unforgettable journey. The actor who portrays the villain, Captain Vidal, is absolutely riveting... and easy to loathe. A colleague of mine used it in a film as lit. unit when it first came out and I have since stolen it to use in my own English classes. A word of caution: it is in Spanish with English subtitles.

It combines an almost perfect mix of fantasy and reality and thus succeeds on levels that many sci- fi/fantasy stories don't. Few films even outside this genre contain so much meaning.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	You know you just have to watch a movie when you're absolutely enthralled by the cover. Don't judge a DVD by its cover? This is one of those covers that makes you wonder what the film is about. Not one of those photoshopped romantic comedies. *cough* I don't own any of those of course.Set in 1944 Spain, Ofelia (what a gorgeous name) and her mother are moving to be with her new stepfather, a man who is no care in the world whatsoever, he wants a son to carry on the family name, and doesn't care for his new stepdaughter. He shows it as soon as his new family arrives. His new wife is heavily pregnant and suffering, and Ofelia instantly spots what she calls a fairy and chases after it.She comes across the Labyrinth of Fauno, where the fairy leads her, turning into a green goblin creature, which speaks like Tinkerbell. She meets Fauno inside, who's hiding from the rest of the world, and is a mix of so many different animals, it's hard to describe. She then discovers she's actually a princess, and the princess's soul has been brought back through her. But she has to complete three challenges, in order to see if she belongs with the mortals or not.Outside the labyrinth, the rebels are attacking, and Ofelia's stepfather is trying to discover who the link to the rebels is in his house. The mother is still suffering with the baby boy inside her. Ofelia is desperate to stay and help her mother, but also desperate discover the whole new world that is awaiting her.She meets a new interesting characters along the way, including Pale Man, a strange looking creature, with no eyes in his (its?) face, but in the palms of his hands instead. You've seen the stills from the movie, the mad creature who puts his hands up to his face in order to see. Nightmares, hello! He appears in an almost Adam & Eve-esque scenario. Very interesting, and chases Ofelia.From the same director who did Hellboy, the magic is here, which was touched upon in Hellboy. The scenes are well done, and really stunning, all the little faun symbols you can't help but notice throughout the film. It at times reminded me of my own childhood fairytales, Narnia and Alice for example, but so much more darker. Actually Guillermo Del Toro needs to direct a Narnia movie, that would be amazing!!! He could make the films so good. He shows what he can do in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy. At times, the movie can be almost dreamlike, and the 118 minute running time flies by, and I was shocked when it was finished.The score is amazing, particularly the lullaby theme, which appears frequently throughout the movie, and has been going through my head on and off since watching it.If you've seen this DVD in a shop, and wondered what it was about, buy it. It's one of those magical movies that are one of a kind, and there will never be anything like it ever again. I have recommended it to a couple of people since seeing it, and will keep recommending it. It's more than words can say.	4.0	An adult's fairytale	2008-02-26	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1AYN3IIUNQCIA	"Melanie Edwards ""book worm"""	for some time, i have been looking for the next fantasy film that will move me and astonish me like the LOTR's trilogy did. sure, Narnia and HP are good films to but they still didn't hit that cord with me. then, that all changed with Pan's Labyrinth. in this film, we are transported into the mountains of Spain were young Ofelia and her pregnant mother are sent to live with the cold and mercelous Cpatain Vidal in the midst of WW2. it is here that Ofelia stumbles upon a wonderous Labyrinth presided over a strange faun. belived to be the long lost princess of the faun's Underworld, she is set with three tasks that she must complete before the full moon to take her place as queen. what follows is a mind bending and wonderous adventure into the mind. what Del Torro does is he takes us back to the original roots of fairy tales were things never always got there happily ever after and that fantasy can be used to buffer the harsh reality our heroine faces. first of, i have to say the effects are simply astounding and the acting at its finest with Sergi Lopez giving a chilling performance as the mercilous captian. now don't be fooled kiddies, this ain't some PG rated fantasy film, there are some pretty violent scenes in this film but luckily at least they aren't so in your face and frequent. it still baffels me how this film lost the Forigen Picture award but then again i ain't a member of the academy. so if you all are pretty tired of all the regular fantasy's out there and just want to enjoy a back to basics fairy tale then Pan's Labyrinth is the one for you. it will fry your imagination and leave you in its grasps long after it ends.	5.0	one of the best fantasy films since LOTR	2007-05-18	6	6	0

I knew it would be amazing but still I wasn't quite ready for the intensity and sheer beauty of this film. This is by no means an escapist faerytale, but the power of Pan's to  capture the imagination is no less profound. Doug Jones as the pan is simply astonishing, I really can't say enough about his performance. This is not just a must own for fantasy fans, but a film for those who enjoy truly memorable movie experiences. Don't let the fact the the film is in Spanish with English Subtitles deter you from seeing it. You really will miss out. Pan's Labyrinth takes us back to the roots of the true Faerytale, those in the Grimm tradition, and while no one could compare it to the fairydust covered fluff that we've grown acustomed to, Pan's is dark to say the least. I as a viewer was left at the end with a breathtakingly lovely sense of magic in the mundain.

The score is reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands, the story similarly dark, but it is far more violent and cruel.  It is very difficult to watch in between the fantastical elements.The story centers around Ofelia, who accompanies her sickly mother to the outpost of her Fascist stepfather, Captain Vidal.  This man has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  He brutalizes his wife, and only cares at all for her because she is pregnant with his son.  He instructs her doctor to let her die should the child be in danger.  He also takes great pleasure in torturing, most graphically, rebel prisoners.  One of the bleakest views of Fascist Spain ever filmed.There is superb acting, especially from the indominable Maribel Verdu as the servant who also is a very effective and brave rebel collaborater.A strange viewing experience, almost unbearably violent and hateful when Captain Vidal gets going, with an ending when only partially mitigates the harshness which prevails throughout.	3.0	fantastical and excruciatingly harsh	2007-09-23	14	9	5

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"It's difficult to juxtapose two different stories filmed in different styles peopled by different actors into a cohesive whole. Guillermo Del Toro (""Devil's Backbone,"" ""Cronos"") attempts to do just that with his concurrent stories of Franco Spain, 1944 and a child's dream world, fable mirroring the realistic part of the film in the fairy tale form though Del Toro never makes it explicitly clear if Ofelia's world is only in her mind or if her world has a place alongside the real.Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a bookish young 10 year old. Her vibrant eyes are full of wonder as she accompanies her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the Pyrenees to meet her Mother's new husband (the multi-lingual Sergi Lopez as a nasty, despotic Captain Vidal in Franco's army) and to wait for the birth of her mother and Vidal's child.Vidal has been sent to this remote place to put an end to a small army of freedom fighters/rebels who oppose Franco. Lopez's Vidal is so vile and cruel that we are made to wonder how beautiful, kind, loving Carmen would have married him much less deigned to have his child but this is never explained. When Carmen goes into labor, Vidal tells the doctor that if a life or death choice is to be made, the doctor is to choose the child over Carmen. Vidal also proves to be the only one who goes over to the other fairy tale side of this film. And as such he arrogantly stains and mutilates Ofelia's world of Fauns and Fairies.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is very dark, both production-wise and thematically. When Ofelia descends into the Labyrinth she is not going to a better, kinder, light-filled place but a place fraught with mystery and reeking of the dark. In essence then she goes from the darkness into a darker place which turns the mood of the film topsy turvy particularly if you think about other similarly themed films: ""The Wizard of Oz'"" going from black and white Kansas to full Technicolor Oz and Alice's descent into the wonder of ""Wonderland."" And this is key as you try to unlock some of the mysteries of this dazzling film: in order to know the light you must know the dark is how ""it"" usually goes...but not here.Though seemingly simple on the surface, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is anything but."	5.0	Without the Light	2007-01-08	4	3	1

He loves to torture and brutally murder anybody he catches, whether they are rebels or not (warning: some of the scenes are so graphic that they are difficult to watch if you have a weak stomach).

Suddenly those fairy tales seem to come to life as the girl meets a fairy that takes her to see Faun in the area near the house called the Labyrinth (it is like a large maze).  The Faun tells her that she is a princess from another land and the only way for her to open the portal to get back is to perform three brave tasks.

I cannot repeat this enough: it is a fairy tale, it features children, it features children overcoming grotesque challenges to emerge triumphant, but it is NOT. FOR. CHILDREN.And that's a shame, because the fairy tales in Pan's Labyrinth once were told to children.  Beware the Poisonous Toad, whose selfish gluttony killed off a magical tree.  Beware the Pale Man, who consumed children that succumbed to their own hunger.  And most importantly, beware Fauns who give orders, for they are tricksters never to be fully trusted.Poor Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is caught in a power struggle between her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) pregnant with ruthless captain Vidal's (Sergi Lopez) child.  It's clear that Vidal could care less for Ofelia, who is not of his blood.  His only concern is that Carmen bear him a son; the birth of her brother will most certainly send Ofelia to her doom. Caught between these two worlds of war and magic, Ofelia's salvation lies in the rebellious servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and an ancient faun (Doug Jones).In the end, Ofelia has no choice.  There are monsters everywhere: lurking in her home, in the forest, and in the labyrinth. Caught between faerie and famine, she can only choose her final home.

Her mother (Gil) has been forced to marry Captain Vidal (Lopez), an evil man who fights the rebels around his home with a singleminded viciousness.  Her mom is pregnant, and the pregnancy is killing her.  On the grounds of Vidal's estate is a labyrinth, and upon entering it, Ofelia meets many creatures including fairies and fauns.  She learns that she is the long-lost princess and daughter of the King of the Underworld.  To show herself worthy of this title, the faun Pan (Jones) lays out three tasks for her to perform.  Completion before the next full moon will mean she can enter the kingdom and escape the war torn world around her.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a movie like no other.  Director Guillermo del Toro has crafted a modern fairy tale.  The two stories entertwine perfectly and complement each other.  The special effects are hi quality, and the direction is excellent.  Young Adriana Gil is excellent as poor Ofelia, a girl fleeing the horrors of the world around her.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an excellent movie that is just different enough to make it fresh.  I highly recommend this adult fairy tale.  NOTE: This is a foreign film with subtitles."	5.0	El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth	2007-01-30	10	5	5

I don't think I have ever felt the emotions I did during this movie then anything I have ever watched before. Especially for a film not in English.I'm sure the plot has been explaining in most of the other 600 reviews for it here.Never had I felt so much hate for a fictional character before. Sergi L&oacute;pez playing the Captain had me begging for someone to put an end to his monstrous cold-heartedness. To try and explain such a movie to someone as being something like Alice In Wonderland in Nazi Germany can easily be dismissed as a brain dead idea, but I am glad to have seen the movie now and seen one of the best movies of the new millennium.Never have I felt absolute hate; and wanting a character to get it in the end so badly, then I did with Sergi L&oacute;pez character.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"Guillermo del Toro has made an unusual adult film about a child's fantasy world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which juxtaposes magic and violence in World War II-era Spain. In 1944, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her mother (Adriadna Gil) from a war-torn city to the mountains to meet her new stepfather. Ofelia is an imaginative girl often engrossed in her fairy tale books. Her mother is expecting a child, and her new husband, the fastidious fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), has insisted that she join him. Ofelia and Vidal take an immediate dislike to one another, but the country fires Ofelia's imagination. She is led to an ancient portal guarded by a faun named Pan (Doug Jones). Pan assumes Ofelia is the Princess Moanna, who left the underworld long ago to live among humans, but who is prophesied to return. Ofelia must complete 3 tasks in order to be readmitted to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Captain Vidal ruthlessly and indiscriminately battles Republican rebels, who find sympathy among the locals.""Pan's Labyrinth"" alludes to various other works of fantasy, and its symbolism isn't slight. But Ofelia is engaging and her fantasies so vivid that the film never seems to be going over old territory. This may be due to the story's immersion in the real, intensely violent and unjust world of civil conflict in Spain. A child's fantasies take on greater meaning in contrast to and as commentary on the turbulent and dangerous world around her. The fantasy world is not safe or forthright but presents the kind of choices that the adults around her make. Perhaps it's unusual to make a fantasy film exclusively for older viewers, but the real-world violence in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is too graphic and sadistic for young children and may unsettle some adults. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film that engrosses the viewer in the fight to determine Spain's future and a child's conception of a fantastic world in which she too battles for what she holds dear -enabled in no small part by Guillermo Navarro continually gliding camera. In Spanish with English subtitles.The DVD (New Line 2007 single disc): There is an unnecessary ""Director's Prologue"" (24 sec) in which the director introduces the film. Under ""Marketing Campaign"", there is Poster Art (7), a teaser trailer (1 min), a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and 7 short TV spots (4 min). There is a good audio commentary in English by director Guillermo del Toro. He discusses this film as a companion piece to ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the themes of choice and disobedience, magic and violence, the role of violence in the film, symbolism, staging the real vs fantasy worlds, sources for some of the material, camera work, color palette, and blending reality and fantasy.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"It is not very often that one gets to see a filmmaker blossom into greatness.  Scorsese has his ""Taxi Driver,"" Spielberg has his ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of Third Kind,"" Coppala has ""The Godfather"" and Nolan has ""Memento.""  Now director Guillermo Del Toro, who before was one of the most promising talents in the world, has his ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" an achingly and grimly beautiful film.  This is one of those stories where every detail, from the slightest glance, facial twitch and camera move, feels right.  Nothing is forced and setting, character and themes are fully, richly realized.  Set amid the communist insurgency that irritated Franco's fascist government in the aftermath of his victory in the Spanish Civil War, ""Pan's"" opens in 1944 with young Ofelia (a luminous Ivana Baquero) and her sickened mother (Ariadna Gil, whose eyes haunt with ease) traveling to a Fascist outpost in the Spanish woods, where the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, quietly and unforgettably menacing) labors to expunge the last of the rebels from the countryside.  Ofelia's mother is very weak from carrying the Captain's baby boy, a burden she takes on to give her daughter and her unborn son the protection that the Captain can offer, although she is not blind to the Captain's special brand of vicious and inhuman violence against opposing communist guerillas.To escape from her new and frightful place alongside the Captain and her emaciated mother, Ofelia retreats into her fairy tales, places of innocence and peace.  But one night, a fairy visits her in her room, leading her to a labyrinth in the woods where an old Faun (Doug Jones) resides and waits.  Jones is a revelation, breathing enormous life into his costumed characters, especially his brief but terrifying turn as the Pale Man, a child-devouring monster who pursues Ofelia in the film's most harrowing scene.  The Faun announces to Ofelia that she is a long lost princess of the underground realm, a place that revels in the magic and power of an earlier age when nature and the spirit were one.  But, to prove that Ofelia still possesses the immortal princess' essence, the Faun lays out three tasks for her that, if completed, will earn her a place beside her ancient father in the underworld.  But the tasks are dangerous and, as they escalate, so does the battle between Vidal and the guerillas and the deterioration of Ofelia's mother.  Fantasy, once Ofelia's refuge, is now as uncertain as the world that surrounds her.At first glance, a film that combines earthy fairy tales a la the Brothers Grimm and period war piece might seem jarring, but Del Toro makes the combination feel effortless.  The two parallel each other perfectly, complementing each other on themes such as Fascist thought and the universal struggle between good and evil.  The rest is just gravy, absolutely, jaw-droppingly gorgeous gravy.  Guillermo Navarro's vivid and fluid cinematography methodically hovers and swirls around searing battle scenes and otherworldly locales with smooth confidence; also, the production design exudes a worn, lived in feel.  But the greatest triumph of the film (other than the stellar writing, acting and directing) is the downright stunning creature designs.  The Faun and the Pale Man are unlike anything that has been seen before, completely original and organic figures seemingly plucked from the realm of dreams and nightmares.  One step on his spindly legs and one flick of his wrist and the Faun has become helplessly endearing.  One frightening upward move of his palms, and the Pale Man becomes one of the most nightmarish figures in cinema history.Put simply, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a masterpiece.  Del Toro has done something that very few filmmakers before him have done, and it demands to be seen and cherished as an example of the best cinema has to offer."	5.0	Del Toro Blossoms Into a Cinematic Artist	2007-02-05	3	1	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1XN4GCNV16DF0	M. Neal	Pan's Labyrinth is not a typical fantasy movie. It's not a war movie either, as some have suggested. Instead, the film is more like an old-style fairy tale, with a deep moral core and layers of allegory, some obvious, others more subtle. Watching Pan's Labyrinth is almost like becoming a child again; it transported me to a place that allowed me to suspend belief for a few hours, and for that alone, it's brilliant. One of the film's best qualities is the strange, dark, and beautiful world it immerses us in. Even the reality-based portions of the movie have an otherwordly feel to them, and the cinematography is gorgeous; the colors seemed more rich and vivid than any other film I've watched in recent memory.

It's hard to believe it was made for around 20 million dollars. All the fantastic sets and CGI are top notch, as are all the actors. The Captain in this film is the meanest dude put on film in years. He is in my opinion the scariest monster in the movie (sorry Pale Man). This film is very dark, gruesome, and even hard to watch at times, but if you are in the mood for a fairy tale told like the old Grimm stories your in for a treat.This is truly one of the best films I have seen in some time. Oh, by the way, this film is in spanish and you will have to read. Some people in my theater didn't know this and complained for the first five minutes of the movie. This film could have been in english because all the actors speak it very good (I watched the HBO special).

It is intended to be an adult fairytale with a young girl as its protagonist. Everyone I know who have viewed this film has loved it, including my 75 year old father, who is not really into foreign films or art films.The is not suitable for children for a few scenes of torture and violence. While difficult to watch, it serves to create a sense of real peril, ugliness, cruelty and evil that propels our protagonist to seek comfort in another world of grotesque beauty. She is a young girl in the midst of a brutal civil war where both sides reside under her roof, and the only reason she is safe is because her mother is pregnant by a fascist general. There is a sense that this safety is precarious and could evaporate quickly due to circumstances beyond her control.The protagonists other world is sparked by a discovery of an old labyrinth by the old house where the general holds his position and has a doctor see to the pregnant mother's ailing health.This other world that is created is amazingly done and is beautiful in its grotesquely Gothic way. The original score is perfect for the film with its haunting humming lullaby. The young girl is perfect young heroine that is flawed but lovable. You want her to fulfill her destiny and escape to her throne in a magical place. The rest of the cast are amazing showing the full range of humanity in a time of war from immense cruelty to amazing courage and compassion. The film itself has a great sense of pacing, almost poetic writing, and is able to keep up the feeling of suspense.The movie is sad, beautiful, cruel, agonizing, and has kept haunting me. The film made me cry and at times took my breath away. It made me feel great to see such a well-made movie in the era of over hyped corporate films.

Riley ""mo rollo"""	"Pan's Labyrinth is a movie that brings to life images and stories that are best described from the books of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung.First there are no spoiler alerts since this is a type of movie you want to see  again and again. Not wanting to know what happened would be like saying, ""don't tell me the plot of The Passion of the Christ because I haven't read the book yet"".There are different ways of viewing this movie but it would be unbearable to only see it from the point of view of reality. The unrelenting violence and the cruel fate of Ofelia would make the movie too dark to watch. Instead, this is a movie about a young girl's personal mythology which brings her redemption and salvation on a mythic level.Note that there seems to be an intentional absence of reference to institutional religion,  in the real world. Western religion, science and modern secular thinking prevent most people  from ""getting"" this movie. But if it gets you, it will haunt you deeply.The story opens as it will end, with Ofelia lay dying from a gunshot wound from her stepfather, the evil Captain Vidal. In her dying moment, she dreams the story of a princess  who escaped from the Underworld in order to see what  life is. As the story is told,  the princess forgets she is an immortal deity  and dies as a mortal in the real world. Her father-king vows to wait for his daughter's return to the Underworld until the earth stops spinning .The real world is revealed in scenes of violence and torture that are too painful to watch. Captain Vidal is the leader of a group of Facist soldiers who are fighting a group of rebel fighters in a dark and dreary land deep in the woods. Ofelia and her mother have traveled from a city to be with Captain Vidal at his post so that he can witness the birth of his son.While at this post one night, Ofelia is led by a fairy to meet a deity named Pan in a labyrinth which  is beside the house she is staying at. Pan is an earth faun who has been searching for the spirit of the princess in the real world and thinks Ofelia might be her incarnation. Ofelia must perform three tasks before the next full moon in order to prove this is true.Her first task is to defeat a toad like monster that lives in the roots of an old tree. This she does and is rewarded with a key. It is also a scene that suggests a start of the rebirth that will transform her mortal identity into a deity.Her next task is to defeat another monster who sits at the head of a dinner table. She is warned by Pan not to eat any food during this time. And she goes and eats two grapes at the dinner table of the monster. She has failed in her tasks and will now be cut off from the Underworld forever.Meanwhile in the real world, things are looking even grimmer. Ofelia's only friend, the housekeeper, has been captured as a rebel spy,  and her mother is sick and in pain from her pregnancy. Captain Vidal has discovered Ofelia had put a magic plant-root under her mother's bed in order to cure her mother's sickness. Her mother throws the root into a fireplace and tells Ofelia to stop dreaming and live in the real world. Her mother then goes into labor and dies giving birth to her son. Ofelia has  been cast down into the basement by Captain Vidal. The rebels begin there attack on the post.Pan gives Ofelia a second chance. She is to bring her new born brother to Pan in order to make a small blood offering. Ofelia goes and gets the baby and brings the baby but she is followed by her evil stepfather into the labyrinth. She refuses Pan's order to hand him the baby so that a blood offering can be made so that she can return to the Underworld. The stepfather shoots Ofelia and takes the baby.The movie ends as it began, with Ofelia bleeding and dying. The houskeeper weeps over her as we hear Ofelia's song. Ofelia dreams she is re-united with her real father-king and her mother as a princess of the Underworld.In order to give Ofelia's life meaning you want to believe,... there is a moment at the labyrinth's alter when the pain and suffering of the real world and the rapture of theUnderworld intersect, and Ofelia is right in the center of it all, transformed from a living incarnation of the spirit of a princess back into a deity for all eternity ...It is a story that goes round and round in a circle and it is a work of great cinematic art."	5.0	A mythic journey	2007-07-20	2	2	0

I know, I know, I'm lazy, but it's really not that I'm lazy, it's that I find it a bit distracting. Fortunately this film is well worth reading subtitles for. For those of you not aware of this*** THIS FILM IS IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!***This is a very well made film and beautifully told story. It has a nightmarish quality that will stick with you long after watching it. The film is nothing like I thought It would be and that is one of the reasons I put off watching this for so long. It's really a fantastic film and should not be missed by movie lovers.The film is definitely not for children as it has some graphic violence and it can be scary at times.	5.0	A MAGICAL AND HAUNTING FAIRY TALE FOR ADULTS!	2009-05-11	2	2	0

This is one of those movies where you go into the theater thinking it's about one thing and it winds up suprising you totally.  Definitely not for the kiddies although I would show i to my 16-year old daughter.  I think she'll get a kick out of it.  Great moviemaking!

I know, I live in a cave.So on to the movie, I wasn't really sure what it was about by the previews, but it seemed to be some kind of dark, almost horror movie. The effects weren't your typical CGI, they had a very dark fairy tell look to them. It also looked more natural than say, LOTR or King Kong.The story was interesting if not violent and disturbing. Yet it wasn't something that was intended to be as dark and punishing as possible. It was all created to flow and create a seamless reality, as if this was to have really happened. Which made me love it all the more.The movies characters were fun, and memorable. Many of the scenes stuck with me, which isn't something that every movie manages. It resonated a little deeper and kept me watching.A great movie that definitely made me a fan of Del Toros.	5.0	Excellent movie from a dierector I hadn't heard much about	2009-01-25	1	1	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3A90CELVLOUP6	"Nanciejeanne ""Enjay"""	I really enjoyed this movie, however, I felt the violence went a little too far. I really don't need to be beat over the head to feel anger toward an antogonist.  I understand the story had violent elements and that indeed the violence was inherent to the story, but some parts seemed to be in there for the effects/shock value, edging on torture porn.Remember being scared by things offered in shadow or around corners? Our own imaginations are often much more exciting/frightening than what is on screen. This is sort of the whole point of the movie. The director, though, must feel his imaginination is better than ours and we get his version.Also, while it was a little heavy handed with the development of some characters, other characters didn't have enough background.  I really feel if I have identified with characters when I can remember their names the next day.  I can only remember 2 of the ones in this movie.  And the scenes that remain in my mind are generally the shockingly violent ones.It is a pity because this was so close to being a great movie.  The story is basically good, the actors are well cast, and the progression was not predictable.  The visuals are stunning.  To me the characters needed a little more motivation/development.  It doesn't have to be some grand scene (violent or otherwise).  All good characters have a little bad in them and vice versa, that makes them real.Sometime a single sentence spoken by a character can really make a viewer understand them.  That kind of writing isn't here, it is dependent on the visuals.  An as example, I don't understand why the girl went so far to carry out tasks, but then simply disobeyed an order by Faun.  It really was a key point that was poorly stuck in the movie.  If you have seen it you will know exactly the scene I mean.  Like a snag in a sweater.Overall, I think that you will enjoy watching it. Many movies don't even entice a viewer to think or to even write a review.  This one will. Watch it...an argue about it...write a review about how great or bad it was...tell me how wrong I am.

But I liked this one.  I read about it, heard about it, saw the previews... and the movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be.  For starters, the effects were beautiful.  For another, the script was incredibly well-written.  There was great acting in this play.  Great, beautiful acting.  The characters were realistic and the story-line was compelling.  Was there anything wrong with this movie?  Any fault at all?  Well, I thought there was going to be when I assumed they killed Pedro and then were going to kill Mercedes.  My fears were, thankfully, unfounded.  I was a bit upset when they killed Ofelia, but when they showed her being reunited with her real mother and father (or was she?), I understood and was no longer disappointed.  So, basically, no, there were no faults I could find with it.Another thing I really liked about this movie was how they made you wonder if it was all in the little girl's mind.  Was she really a princess?  Did that place really exist?  Both yes and no could be argued quite well with how this movie was done, and I loved that.There is one thing I want to address.  One commenter here continues to stress something about this being a children's movie.  I didn't know that rated Children's movies R, now.  I didn't know that language, violence, and gore were appropriate for children.  When did that happen?All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Brilliant.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	There are some films that film makers are born to make.  For Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is that film.  Taking place in 1944 Spain, Pan's Labyrinth revolves around young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who seeks to escape the horrifying world she lives in.  Her tender mother (Ariadna Gil) is newly married and carrying the son of the cruel and blood thirsty Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who enjoyes torturing the prisoners he captures.  Ofelia however gets a surprise upon discovering the labyrinth in the woods, which is populated by the Faun (Doug Jones, better known as the guy in the Ape Sapien suit in Del Toro's adaptation of Hellboy) who informs her that she is the re-incarnated daughter of the King of the underworld.  She is given three tasks to perform, each the more dire, until the film reaches it's startling and heart wrenching conclusion.  Despite some of the film's incredibly bloody and violent scenes, Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifuly realized film.  Del Toro's inventive direction combined with the gloomy atmosphere and brilliant make up effects are a sight to behold, and that's saying it lightly.  Be warned though that Pan's Labyrinth is not a film for all tastes, and those who don't like fairy tale elements that aren't kid tested and Disney approved will certainly not enjoy this film to say the least.  That being said though, films like Pan's Labyrinth come along all so rarely, which makes it all the more enjoyable.  The New Line Platinum Series DVD edition features a host of extras as well, and is definitely the version of the film to get.	5.0	A masterpiece	2007-05-22	3	2	1

I saw the advertisments about this movie on TV.. not one thing was mentioned about this being a Spanish spoken movie.  The title is on english, all of the text written on the packaging for this movie is in English.  So exactly how was I supposed to know that this movie is entirely spoken in Spanish until I put it in my DVD player.  Oh yeah - the microscopic print at the very bottom of the packaging says Spanish.  Which I found AFTER putting the DVD in my player and realized it was all in Spanish with only English subtitles.  I didn't even bother getting past the opening credits.  I love Anime, but I do not enjoy READING my movies.  I just wish to relax and be entertained, not schooled in another language.  When they came out with other movies in the past that were all in Spanish - it CLEARLY STATED that it was all in Spanish!!  So now I have a movie that looks great, but I can not enjoy because I have to spend most of my attention to the darn subtitles instead of the surroundings and details of the movie which certainly looks very well made.  So how about an ENGLISH dubbed version for us Americans who do not speak Spanish as a first or second language???  Or put the title of the movie in Spanish so it becomes very obvious that this is a Spanish spoken movie.  I looked it up and there is a Spanish word for ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it's ""Laberinto de cacerola"".  Or was this all just a marketing ploy to get people to buy it since you can't return an opened movie???

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	"Pan's Labyrinth is a combination of fantasy, drama, and tragedy.  Young Ofelia is a daughter of a widow, Carmen, who has remarried to a brutal Franco supporter in WWII Spain, Captain Vidal.  Daughter and mother go to live in the countryside headquarters of the captain, who with his soldiers, is fighting local rebels.  Unknown to them, the local villagers working at the soldier's camp contains a doctor and a servant loyal to the rebels.  Ofelia is unwittingly placed into this cat-and-mouse game of ruthless personal violence.  She escapes into a fantasy world, a stone labyrinth situated behind the soldier's camp with origins unknown to all.  There, Ofelia meets Pan, a faun, who tells her that she is a princess disguised in human form.  Pan sets her to three duties in order for her to re-enter the world below as the princess of old.Produced with a Spanish cast and spoken entirely in Spanish, this movie explores many themes unknown to many American viewers.  First of, the movie is set in Spain during the reign of the fascists, an event in history unknown to pop culture since the book ""For Whom the Bells Toll"".  The resulting interpersonal violence and cruelty is frankly portrayed without any cutaway shots, hence giving the movie a deserved R rating.  Second, the dangers of pregnancy childbirth is also explored, as Carmen dies in the middle of the movie.  As a corollary, we see how Vidal values his unborn child over that of his wife; a trait barely mentioned but still common in some places.  Third, the contrast between Ofelia and Vidal is probably the heart of the movie.  The girl is young and innocent, unable to spare a drop of blood of an innocent to save her own life.  Vidal is all to willing to kill and maim others, and risk his own life in order to attain whatever end he chooses.  Every other character in the movie lies in the spectrum between them.  The servant Mercedes, the village doctor, and the rebels lie closer to Ofelia.  Carmen lies in the middle between Ofelia and Vidal, and the other soldiers are noticeably less reluctant in their cruelty than Vidal.The parallel story of Pan is quite good, original by Western standards.  This fairy tale side of the movie rings true to fairy tales from old; horrific and full of dangerous creatures, with tasks to accomplish and a context of a different world.  The final scene of Ofelia rejoining her true parents is probably the most beautiful in the movie.As a movie, it did OK at the US box office but quite well at various awards ceremonies.  The former was due in part to the Spanish language, and more importantly, the amount of graphic violence.  A reduction in the graphicness of the violence would have brought this movie a PG-13 rating, and probably much larger audiences.  On technical terms, the music was slow, haunting but not great.  The special effects were quite believable.  Overall, a good movie to watch, though adults only."	4.0	A study in contrasts	2007-06-28	3	1	2

Set in 1944 Spain (the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War) 12-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her frail and pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a remote village to meet her new stepfather, a sadistic Fascist captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who is bent on extirminating the last Republican resistance to Franco scattered in the nearby hills. Clutching her books of myths and fantasy, which her mother suggests she cast aside to face the real world, Ofelia refuses to call Vidal ""Father."" From the start, she pegs him rightly as a ruthless monster, and her unruly behaviour only invites wrath from this psychopath who tortures and kills innocent victims without remorse. Ofelia retreats into the dark labyrinth and down a William Blake-like spiral staircase where she encounters an untrustworthy faun (Doug Jones). This encounter sparks a braided narrative that seamlessly weaves from tragic reality to magical mystery as Ofelia struggles to keep them apart. Alas, collision is iminent. The faun tells Ofelia that she is really a princess, but to prove it and gain entrance into the underworld kingdom of immortality, she must complete three dangerous tasks. Each task is progressively more daunting, from scolding a giant toad in a bug-infested cave to fleeing a Goya-like child-devouring 'Satan' with eyes in his hands. And each adventure draws her closer on a terrifying collision with the real world.""The horrors of both the realistic and surrealistic worlds are woven into the beautifully aligned narrative structure of del Toro's story,"" said Gene Seymour of Newsday. Glenn Whipp of U-Entertainment, calls Pan's Labyrinth ""dark poetry set to startling images, a one-of-a-kind nightmare that has a soaring, spiritual center."" Gene Seymour further suggests that ""as hard as it may be to watch Guillermo del Toro's dark fairy tale unravel, one comes awy from this magical-realist masterwork oddly invigorated by the way the movie and its principal character triumph over the banality of evil through the autonomy of imagination. The movie may give you nightmares, but it may also give you a few more good reasons to get out of bed the next morning.""""Pan's Labyrinth"" can be interpreted on many levels from literal to metaphorical allegory to psychological and mythic journey. Every aspect of the film, from tiny visual to people's names (think of Ofelia's name, for instance) has metaphoric meaning. Several excellent reviews by Harry Tuttle (Screenville) and Julian Walker (Julian's Blog) tease out both mythic and Jungian elements of this dark poetic fantasy and I urge you to check these sites for their excellent commentary. From describing the classic Hero's Journey (described by Joseph Campbell) to making references to the mythic Psyche, these two reviewers insightfully unveil the nuance and filigree that weave the complicated tapestry of ""Pan's Labyrinth"".For me, the allegorical symbol represented by Ofelia's last task brought out the metaphor that struck me the most: the death of innocence required to protect the birth of freedom. Ofelia is the embodyment of the nation's innocence. Refusing to obediently accept the deviant orders of the didactic father figure of Fascism (embodied by both Vidal and the faun), Ofelia (innocence) defies authority and sacrifices her life to ""die"" to protect her baby brother (freedom). Her sacrifice is rewarded by her immortal 're-birth' (hope and faith)."	5.0	Innocence Has a Power Evil cannot Resist	2008-01-07	2	2	0

To reclaim her place, he assigns her three tasks.Most of the film focuses on the ""real world"", leaving the existence of Ofelia's fantasy world up to the viewer. This reality involves an exceedingly brutal step-father, an ill mother, and the cruelty of war. The Faun's, or Pan's, world mirrors the terror Ofelia senses, though rarely sees. We, however, do see the depravity of Captain Vidal, who tortures and mercilessly murders, all in a day's work. Mercedes' courage in the face of the captain reflects Ofelia's bravery while encountering a spine-chilling monster in one task. For once, this movie monster is terrifying in its hideousness. Almost as frightening as the war itself.Ofelia is played by the wide-eyed Baquero, who reacts sometimes minimally but always honestly. Mercedes is ridiculously likable in her quiet heroism. Vidal is so obviously a monster, especially because he views himself as a noble soldier who does his job. At one point he notes that others must think he is a monster. It is a strange thing to realize that he does not see himself as a brute. Pan himself (Doug Jones) is an ambiguous creature. To both Ofelia and the audience, he is threatening and comforting.The creatures and sets are gorgeous and twisted creations. It is a rare fantasy/war movie that succeeds in distressing, emotionally engaging, and uplifting the viewer. Some have said that the conclusion is bleak, while others find it transcendent. This film is not perfect, and be warned that it can be difficult to take. However, I highly recommend it, as Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful and powerful movies I have seen."	5.0	Both Hopeful and Haunting	2007-03-06	8	8	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3RBNLTA0UUFEZ	"Nolene-Patricia Dougan ""Dougs"""	Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful allegorical tale filled with monsters of all kinds.A young girl, Ofelia, travels with her pregnant mother to meet her Stepfather. Her Stepfather is a General in Franco's army and Ofelia soon learns that he is a violent and uncaring man. To escape the horror of her life, she steps into another world in which she is a Princess and monsters can be defeated.There has been a lot of hype about Pan's Labyrinth (it was nominated for six Oscars and won three - practically unheard of for a foreign language film). Usually, when a film is getting this much good press, it's a letdown when you finally get round to watching it. This is not the case with Pan's Labyrinth. It is a bewitching tale that will keep you enthralled throughout.Pan's Labyrinth is not a fantasy adventure filled with bright colours and cute and cuddly mythical creatures (it is more Jim Henson than Disney). The world of Pan's Labyrinth is dark and cruel, and at times the violence is relentless and startling. Despite this, it is a film filled with beauty, the kind of beauty that can only be seen in gothic art or on a stormy winter's night.Whether you believe that Ofelia has created a world from her imagination or whether the visions she experiences are reality, you will be fascinated by her world and all that she encounters.	5.0	A long time ago, in the underground realm, where there are no lies or pain, there lived a Princess who dreamed of the human worl	2007-08-10	2	2	0

I WILL SAY THAT IT IS REALLY NOT FOR CHILDREN, DESPITE THE ADVERTISEMENTS AND THE HEROINE BEING AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL. IT IS HOWEVER AN ADULT FANTASY THAT, SOMEHOW DESPITE THE MANY GRUESOME SHOCKS, I FOUND NECESSARY TO BE PLAYED OUT THIS WAY. ADULTS ARE TOO BURIED IN REALITY TO EVER IMAGINE SUCH A FANTASTICAL ADVENTURE, EVEN IN TIMES OF PURE EVIL, WHEN WE NEED THE ESCAPE THE MOST.THE STORY BEGINS WITH A DISPLACED SPANISH GIRL NAMED OFELIA MOVING, WITH HER PREGNANT NEWLYWED MOTHER, TO THE COMPOUND OF HER TRULY SADISTIC WARLORD STEPFATHER. THIS PLACE BREATHES NOTHING BUT SORROW AND PAIN, AND HER DESPAIR AND LONELINESS IS SURPRISINGLY BROKEN BY MAGICAL CREATURES WHO SHARE WITH HER, HER TRUE DESTINY.THIS IS WHERE THE FILM ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AND INVENTIVE. OFELIA DOESNT GET WHISKED AWAY ON HER ADVENTURE. INSTEAD HER ADVENTURE IS TIED TO THE MISERY WHICH IS HER REAL LIFE. HER NEW ESCAPE, GIVES HER NO ESCAPE AT ALL. NOT UNTIL THE SURREAL END. HER STEPFATHER IS TRULY AS VILE A VILLAIN AS I'VE SEEN RECENTLY, BUT HE IS BALANCED BY AN EQUALLY ASTUTE MAID, WHOM I CAN BEST DEFINE AS THE GOOD AND THE EVIL IN OFELIA'S WORLD, EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T REALLY DRAWN WITH THAT BLACK AND WHITE A COLOR.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AITI12BBKCYG9	"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend"""	"I'd been warned before viewing this film that it was extremely dark and did not possess a typical ""Hollywood happy ending"".  That being said, I was prepared to truly enjoy it.  Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed, as the film focuses far more on the revolution in Franco's Spain than the delightfully creepy Underworld that is gained through the Labyrinth.  The bloody, gratuitous violence and sadism were things I wish I hadn't seen (and ended up fast-forwarding through, particularly the torture scenes...)Young Ofelia is a remarkable character whose sensitivity is brutally ravaged by her cruel stepfather.  The best parts of the film involve Ofelia's interaction with the creepy Faun, whose demonesque appearance makes an interesting antithesis to Mr. Tumnus, a creature of the same family from C.S. Lewis's The LION, The WITCH, and The WARDROBE, who was a gentlemanly forest dweller.  Ofelia's two ""quests"" were even more enjoyable:  the enormous toad under the tree and the very disturbing Cannibal with the vermilion eyeballs in his hands...I was disgruntled because so little of the plot involved Ofelia (who is the displaced Princess Moanna of the Underworld) and the magical creatures who had sustained her imagination as she contended with the harsh realities of losing her father and enduring her mother's second marriage.That being said, I did appreciate the story on the whole, particularly Ofelia's bloody end, which certainly hearkens back to the original Grimm Brothers' tales.  ""Happily ever after"" just wasn't a part of those cautionary stories -- and they were the better for it!"	3.0	Gory war film	2007-05-31	12	5	7
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	APHX2A37KDRAH	N. Trachta	Pan's Labyrinth takes place in post Civil War Spain (actually in 1944) where a young girl and her mother are moving to live with her mother's new husband (he's a captain in the Spanish military, suppressing Communist Guerilla's in the country side).  As they near the place where they're to live, the young girl see's what she believes is a fairy.  I say that because a constant theme in the movie is the reality she lives in (The Captain is a brutal man) and the world of fairy she interacts with.  The drivers for her world of fairy the books she reads and the old ruins, including a labyrinth made of stone (the depictions on the stones reminded me of the Celts).Review wise this is a solid 4.5 star movie!  The cinematography is great!  Pan and the fairy's are excellent, the lighting superb, and the people do an excellent job of capturing the era.  The tie between the real world and the fairy world is nicely done.  Her first task was good but a little hard to believe with the size of the toad.  The second one was interesting to say the least.  While the dialog is in Spanish, the captioning in English was simple, direct, but unfortunately a little quick at times.  Since I have to decide between 4 and 5 stars, I'll give this one 4 because while I enjoyed the movie very much in every way possible, there was something slightly missing to make this a 5 star movie.Btw, for those with small children, be cautious with showing this to children under 10 years old.  There are several pieces dealing with torture and bloodshed (necessary for the story in my opinion) that might be to complex for young minds (or those not familiar with the Spanish Civil War).	4.0	Reality and fairy in Franco's Spain	2007-09-09	3	1	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1XTWXIMUCDGQE	Oddsfish	Pan's Labyrinth, in my opinion, is the most remarkable movie of the year, at least among those I've seen so far (and I've seen a couple of pretty good ones). I can't stop thinking about it's beautiful and disturbing images, and I'm trying to build up the courage to go and see it again. I recommend it highly.But with strong reservations. I'll likely buy it once it appears on DVD, but once I own it, I'll likely not be able to watch it. Certainly, not very often. My recommendation comes with a warning. It's really difficult viewing. Really, really tough. And I'm usually not all that squeemish at movies.It's not that there's a whole lot of violence. There's only four or five such scenes in the movie, but they are intense and graphic, the sort that'll stick with you for a long time. Given the themes of the movie, I didn't think the violence was gratuitous, but if you don't have a really strong stomach, I'd not advise going to see this.But it's a heck of a show. It's sort of a difficult plot to describe. The setting, as far as I could tell, was occupied Spain during WWII at a small army outpost in the mountains. The post is led by a sadistic, fascist captain who is trying to quell the last of the resistance. The protagonist is an imaginative little girl, Ofelia, whose pregnant mother has married the captain. Some members of the resistance are followed as well. The story is in the mode of magical realism, and so parts of it draw heavily on Norse mythology and (to a little lesser degree) on Christian theology. Ofelia ends up being visited by Pan, who informs her that she is a princess and gives her some tasks to accomplish so that she can save her magical realm and escape into it. So the movie then begins to follow parallel storylines, that of the resistance versus the captain and that of Ofelia's performing her quest. Of course, there's plenty of interplay between the stories, as they comment on one another, and in a pretty astonishing manner, converge.That's a ridiculously simplified presentation of the plot, but hopefully enough to interest you. The story is grim, but rewarding. It explores, among other themes, the nature of fascism (and its disturbingly close proximity to our lives) and what it means and what it takes to resist. It gives you much to think about.But definitely be warned.	5.0	Grim but Rewarding	2007-01-28	18	12	6
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2C6905NL8G2JS	"OddStatistic ""OS"""	"Fairy tales are violent.  Labyrinths are always dangerous places.  Many fairy tales have been toned down for kids, but in their original forms, Violent.  Getting to the movie, the violence has to be there.  Basically, I think it rips the viewer back and forth between the ""I'm really a princess!"" fantasy world the little girl dreams of and the harsh world the little girl lives in just as the little girl is throw back and forth between that fantasy world and the world in which the country is at war, her father beloved father is dead, her mother is sick, her baby brother is in jeopardy, she's being told to call some other man father, her stepfather is a murderous jerk, and her new best friend (as she has had to leave all of her old friends in the city to move to the country) is a spy who could be discovered and killed at any moment.  While viewers feel sympathy for the little girl's situation given all of that, the violence on screen creates a situation for the viewer.  More empathy.  The viewer (at least those with weaker stomachs) wants to get away from it as much as the little girl and hopes she, at least, succeeds, becomes the princess, finds her ""real"" father (alive and well), her mother (alive and well), etc etc.  Why the ending?  As multiple characters in the film say, there is no magic.  Fairy tales aren't real.  Not for you, me, or anybody else.  No other ending would work.  For what appears to be it's purpose, the movie had to be dark and could have been darker without fault.  In passing, would like to comment on the fact that Captain seems to believe in his own version of a fairy tale, the great man's death.  In fact most characters seem to have some ""fairy tale"" in mind.  Final note: those complaining because they thought this was a kid's movie, check the rating on the DVD, the movie posters, the internet, the theater marquee,....  That's not, and never was, a G.  Don't blame anyone buy yourself for your choice not to take the time to read one letter prominently placed on the advertising materials before tossing your kids in front of the television and going off to do the laundry or whatever.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Pan's Labyrinth is quite different from what the trailer makes it out to be. Most of the film is occupied by a war theme while the fantasy remains somewhat back-story. It is also incredibly more violent than one might have expected.The story revolves around a young girl who is living on a farm with her mother and stepfather in law from hell who commands a squadron that is under siege by a small band of rebel militia. The girl, torn between the domineering male parent and the war, discovers a world where a fawn asks her to complete a set of tasks so that she can inherit a magical kingdom.While the film probably contains the most memorable bad guy of all time, it still comes across as deficient in its promise of beyond the imagination worlds. However they are done above par. Viewers can expect a war drama more than anything else. The film's underlying morals about questioning authority are worth learning; however they do conflict somewhat with its Christian underpinnings.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AXHWQ834G3IUV	Paul D. Sandor	Pan's Labyrinth was the best film of 2006 (and I'm a big Scorsese fan). By combining good and evil, beauty and horror in both the real world and a fantasy world the viewer is transported into a stunning cinematic experience. Ofelia is a lonely young girl who must confront her fears in  worn torn Spain (cicra 1944). She does this by entering a fantasy world. It is unclear if this is a real experience or imagined. That's the beauty of the film: it can be taken on many levels with a depth that's seemingly bottomless. Her stepfather is more vicious than any monster in a fairy tale. The tasks the characters (including Ofelia) must accomplish in the real world are comparable to a quest by a hero in a fantasy world. These world's are bridged flawlessly. To tell any more would spoil the adventure. This film is a moving experience that will stay with you. If you're a fan of fantasy (Lord of the Rings), war films (Saving Private Ryan) and fine foreign films (yes, it combines all three!) this DVD should be your next purchase.

It's a sordid tale about a sordid person getting away with sordid deeds and in the end, just about everyone has died a cruel, heartless, unredeemed death after living an unfulfilling life.  While some fans of this movie may claim that Disney movies are pure tripe and failures at art, this movie goes too far the other direction, delivering a horrible story with some fantastic artwork.I say, go watch Lord of the Rings again.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"Unlike many people here, I knew this would be an adult fantasy movie. I was not expecting LOTR or Harry Potter here, I know there were more dramatic elements involved. But still, this movie did astound me on various levels. Is it a good movie? Absolutely. Is it great, Oscar-worthy material? I certainly don't think so.Ophelia travels to the countryside of somewhere in Spain with her mother, to join her stepfather, a foul man called Captain Vidal. Her mother is pregnant with Vidal's son, so naturally Vidal is very protective of the mother, or more aptly his baby son. There are some rebel militants in the countryside that threatens Vidal's military power. So, every so often we are treated to some gory albeit graphic scenes showcasing Vidal's evil/narcissistic behavior. Ophelia, a great fan of fantasy novels starts dreaming, meeting a faun (whose name is unknown but we assume it's Pan), he then tells her that she is the Princess reborn of the Underground Realm. To rightfully claim the title, she needs to complete 3 tasks. Upon completion, she will join the King and Queen, and live happily ever after. She enthusiastically accepts the challenges and her journey begins. Is it a dream, or is it real? I mean, this is after all a movie from the director of Hellboy, so nothing is far-fetched.To be honest, I was really absorbed in the story. No doubt, it's a very sad movie. The uniqueness of the movie is that it is told from the eyes of a little girl. Everything that happens, more or less revolves around her and her ideas or perception. This girl is living in a terrible place, she fears her stepfather, her mother is ill carrying her baby brother and she has no friends. She conjures this fantasy world to get away from all these. Her fantasy co-exists with reality. We, the audience at times never know where the fantasy ends and where reality begins. The storytelling is superb in that sense. Other than that, the cinematography is exceptionally good. There are traces of what we saw in Hellboy, but it seems more polished now. The acting is decent, but I was especially impressed with Ivana Baquero, who played Ophelia really well. Definitely a young actress to watch out for in the future. Another thing I loved about the movie was its haunting score, from Javier Navarrete. It really set the dark and bleak tone for the movie.As you can see, there are many things to like about the movie, but why I feel it is over-rated is because, it is not groundbreaking. The evil stepfather, the kind-hearted but ill-fated mother, the abused child are all quite clich&eacute;. Done quite well here, but still has a sense of repetition when watching the movie. Furthermore, the idea of escaping the harsh reality of war has been done before. Just watch Life Is Beautiful, where the father goes through so much to convince the young son that everything is just peachy although they are held prisoners in a freakin' military camp. Even Harry Potter toys with this idea, Harry is living in what seems like Hell with his Uncle and Aunty, until he found out he was a powerful wizard. I am sure there are many more examples.Also, there are some minor plot holes that didn't sit well with me. Unlike some people here, the graphic scenes did not disturb me but something I was eager to know, is what drives Captain Vidal to act the way he does? Does someone just wake up one day, and say ""Hey, I'm gonna be an evil son of b*tch today""? Why does Ophelia just follow the faun's instructions without thinking twice about it? I mean, to be honest that dude who looks like a rejected character from Hellboy, doesn't exactly seem like the most trustworthy guy around. Has Ophelia seen the Underground Realm? I really think if the faun had offered Ophelia a glimpse of this mysterious realm, of how beautiful it is, that would make more sense. She would seem like she wants something better than what she is currently experiencing. Unfortunately, without knowing anything about the realm and the kingdom, she jumps at every command. Being the smart, grounded girl she is portrayed to be, I found this to be a little weird. The story was also not as emotionally charged as I hoped for, and this plays a big part in pushing a movie from good to great. Yes, there is a very heavy sorrow/sadness throughout the movie but it lacks moments of emotional brilliance that some classic movies have, where usually at a singular, pivotal point, it provokes certain feelings from audiences.I know those are minor gripes, which I usually don't even highlight when I am reviewing movies. But I just felt I had to mention those things because I really believe this movie is over hyped. It is good, especially for a foreign movie with a team of Mexican/Spanish people behind it, but to say that this is THE best movie of 2006, that it should win a Best Picture Oscar is something I strongly disagree. Buy this DVD for its storytelling and cinematography; I just hope you don't go in expecting one of the best movies of all time."	3.0	3.5 stars...not as Pan-tastic as one hoped it would be	2007-03-27	16	5	11
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1YRQ8XC9DVPLN	"Peter Holzer ""Anime Addict"""	"Visually stunning. However, this film suffers from an identity crisis. It is a fairy tale. A real Grimm's Brother's tale--not some Disneyfied feel good animated adventure. Like the Grimm's original tales, it is full of darkness, shadows and things that go bump in the night. But also, it is a film full of the wonder of being a child.Unlike most fairy tales, it lacks a moral or lesson; and the film is so full of graphic violence and blood shed, no adult in their right mind would take their kid to see it. And there you have this film's real failing. It doesn't know who its audience is. If the blood and violence had been toned down a bit and it's message more clearly defined it could have easily been one of the greatest children's fairy tales of all time.Perhaps Del Toro feels people wouldn't take his work seriously if he made a children's film. And so he brings in the Nazi's and politics and all sorts of adult rubbish, splashes them all over his film and says ""hey, it's ok for you to watch it. It's an adult fairy tale now."" And, in this he almost succeeds.Underneath the muck and filth of the adult world that surrounds her, the innocent and fantastic imaginings of a young girl remind us once again what it is like to be a child again. But these moments are few and fleeting, flashes of something greater in a film soiled by the ordinary. It comes so close at times, it makes me wonder whether it is just a fluke, or if Del Toro just failed miserably at bringing his latest work out of the fog of budgets, deadlines, and Hollywood profiteering.However you look at it, this film is less then the sum of its parts. However, some parts are worth watching just for themselves. The Fawn for instance is simply . . . well, amazing. In an industry drowning in a sea of computer graphics, this simple earthy and real looking creation is just breathtaking. When I saw the trailer for the film, this was what drew me to it. Also, the fairy tale itself, following the classical framework of tales hundreds of years old is also, ironically, refreshing.For the eyes, a thumbs up. For the collection, a thumbs down."	4.0	A fairy tale for adults or children?	2009-01-02	4	2	2

It is essentially 2 stories hauntingly intertwined into one. The real world story centers around Spain's civil war and the freedom fighters who oppose the military's force. The fairy tale aspects revolves around Ofelia, her pregnant mother and her new "" evil step father."" The new life that she has been thrusted upon her lacks love and is filled with only harsh commands from her step father. Ofelia turns to the magical stories from her treasured books and surrounds herself in a world of mystical creatures who challenges her to complete 3 tasks before she can reclaim her throne. Her escape into this fanatsy world is dark and sometimes gruesome but in comparison,the real worlds brutal violence is shown to be more horrific and extreme.The story,visuals, and acting are all superb and will capture your heart.

Kenneth TuranGuillermo Del Toro's , Pan's Labyrinth, is about young Ofelia, Ivana Baquero, who finds a gateway to a  world of gods and monsters, pain and pleasure. Ofelia  is her mother's best friend, and loves her very much.  Her mother has married a man who isn't just wicked, he is the personification of evil. He is  a Captain in Franco's army after the right-wing has seized Spain, The best fantasy takes place in a world between good and evil, desire and sacrifice, cruelty and mercy, freedom and slavery. This fantasy resembles the real world, and is an adult fantasy film. When Ofelia finds a  kingdom in the labyrinth  near her new home, it's a  place full of unreal creatures and a smiling-scary satyr , protrayed disarmingly by Doug Jones.  Ofelia's stepfather is dedicated to wiping out the republican holdouts and local partisans by any means necessary. The satyr explains to Ophelia that she is a lost princess, and she can return to where she belongs if she carries out the three tasks he gives her, without fail and without question.Ariadna Gil is Ofelia's pregnant mother  and Maribel Verd&uacute; , Mercedes is a woman on the side of the resistance, and are the two women in the film who bring love to life and who portray the loving side of life.The  fantasy sequences mix practical effects and computer animation have a terrible, beautiful quality to them. The scenes in the real world contrast the peace and beauty of nature with the brutality of war. Pan's Labyrinth is  bloody and disturbing, but adult fantasy fans will find it a glorious, gripping feast for the eyes.""Del Toro never coddles the audience. He means for us to leave Pan's Labyrinth shaken to our souls. He succeeds triumphantly. "" Peter TraversThis is a tale within a tale, a creation in which the actual and the symbolic are so intertwined that we are happy to rid ourselves of logic.

The movie is a masterpiece, and I had to sit and ponder for awhile before I was brought back to reality.

That clip left with the impression that this was a fantasy film largely oriented to a youthful audience.  I saw it on the IFC Channel's schedule and made a point to watch it since I knew it was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.I was immediately impressed with the movie when I understood that it focussed on Spain in the aftermath of its' Civil War.  I have been a student of that conflict over the years and it helped me appreciate the film.  I was very much aware of the extreme passions that emerged during that war.  As the evil persona of the Captain unfolded, I found it to be quite credible.  My next impression was, What happened to the fantasy film I thought I was going to see?  Well, it also emerged but while it was an intregal part of the film, it was far more understated that I had thought it would be.  That was OK by me (I was particularly concerned that this movie might be a cartoon).""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a movie that becomes increasingly tense and that, to me, is the key to its' success.  I was engrossed in the movie throughout and I liked the mixture of reality and fantasy.

In this harsh and worrying life, Ofelia wanders into the ruins behind her new home and finds Pan, a horned creature who informs her that she is a lost princess and has to complete three tasks in order to find her way home.It sounds like a children's fantasy yet it isn't, there are many brutal and dark sequences in the movie which make it totally unsuitable for younger audiences. You are asked to wonder whether Ofelia is imaging the world she finds herself in, in order to escape her brutal reality or whether she is really finding her way to another world. Either interpretation is acceptable yet I feel that the film makers would like you to fall into the second camp, that she is leaving her world behind.Guillermo Del Torro is a wonderful storyteller and it is a tightly written, gripping film.

Far from it. This film shows the horrific reality of war, and of monomaniacal, psychopathic people who torture and kill for their ""just"" causes.From the opening scene to the closing, I was captivated and horrified by the story told. From the larger arc of the story, to every tiny detail, this film is gorgeously rendered. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, something totally unexpected took place instead.

This is how fairy tales are supposed to be told.  They teach us many lessons, on many different levels, and unlike Disney movies they do not always have a happy ending.  Perhaps that is the reason why many critics have labeled this film as ""fairy tale for adults"" - I guess those same critics assume that children are to be sheltered from tales of loss and death.  Well - I disagree with that but then again, I grew up reading brother Grimms' fairy tales too.  Beautiful movie with beautiful special effects and story about hope lost in search of eternal (parental) love.  Set in Franco's Spain film also addresses the horror of fasicm and inability of a yound girl to supress the misery that comes with it.  Film shows us that evil affects all of us, but children have a special way of dealing with it - their imagination transcends the harsh reality and guides them to the world of magic full with most astonishing secrets only child can embrace with no reservations.

The storyline is thought provoking, the direction flawless, the visual effects unbelieveable and Oscar=worthy.  I totally forgot the fact that this movie is dubbed.  The story wraps you up and as it unwinds, you become more and more involved in the little girl's life (or is it just her imagination?)  You will find yourself becoming invested in the characters and their development, hoping against hope that all will end happily-ever-after.  While at times dark and light, sad and happy, this movie truly embodies the old Hollywood type of movies that make you forget your own life and troubles and become totally immersed in the story unfolding on the screen in front of you.

This stepfather is an evil military general who treats Ofelia and her pregnant mother with disgust. Ofelia finds an escape from this forced life through a faun in a labrynth on the General's property. The mysterious creature tells Ofelia she is the princess of a mystical kingdom, and gives her three tasks to complete in order to gain entry to her palace. The three tasks are frightening, and test Ofelia's inner courage and motivation.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a Spanish film with English subtitles,and is half war film, half dark fantasy. The two go hand-in-hand however because Ofelia USES the Labyrinth as an escape from the horrors of the war. The film works so well because the viewer never knows if the creatures are real or part of Ofelia's imagination. The film sets up the faun, the  kingdom, and the tasks as secondary plot elements to the evil that is her stepfather. This makes the audience want to believe that Ofelia can escape through to another life.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is full of so many memorable creatures, imagery, suspense, and mystery that you forget about the theatre you are in. Having opened in wide release, I recommend this to any adult looking to forget about the harsh realities of the real world... in return for a fantastical adventure come the weekend."	5.0	"""Pan's Labyrinth""; a TRUE ADULT FAIRY TALE"	2007-01-22	11	9	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1XZJ32DJS8YV2	"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader"""	It's a dark movie, both for the times it portrays (the early years of Franco's fascist reign as he is destroying his enemies, the precursor of WW2).and for the topic, the human propensity for cruelty and a child's attempt to escape from it into a world populated by her imagination.It twists both of these themes-it's historical time and her imagination together to weave a somewhat dark, foreboding, mysterious yet ultimately hopeful world in the midst of both societal and personal tragedy.The movie is about two kinds of people, both considered disposable by power: a wife married more for her uterus than for anything else with her young daughter and the losers in the Spanish UnCivil War. Both groups dispute this judgement of their worth by those in power but fighting the forces of those that rule over them. The wife does it quietly and eventually dies in childbirth giving the driving force of local power-her husband, the Fascist Captain, his only desire-a son. Whom he desires to raise up into his own image. The daughter does it actively with a flight of childhood imagination that creates most of the film, creating an alternative world where good and evil are as confused as they are in the real world. Where she can embark on a 3-part quest for her life and that of her new born brother. And the poor inhabitants of the mountains fighting for a lost cause, fighting a rear guard action against the rising and recently victorious Franco forces with a bit of cunning but mostly with a self sacrificial spirit and given the situation pointlessly dying (and killing).Really everyone loses in this movie, nothing is particularly positive but hope hides in the negative, cruelty dies yet he kills imagination just moments before his own ignominious death. Out of the pain, long-suffering, blood and finally the death associated with childbirth (for both the mother and her doctor) comes a son, but the only good thing is that he will never hear the name of his father. The recently vanquished win this skirmish but you know they have to flee over the mountains to France leaving their country until the that new born boy is a middle aged man(the age at which both his grandfather and father died in war) who can return to a Post-Franco new Spain. The young daughter dies, her blood dripping uselessly but dramatically into Pan's Labyrinth, yet her last moments are happy as she sees her parent's as King and Queen of her imaginary world, beyond the death, cruelty and evil of this sad world.it's worth seeing. but it really isn't for young children. much of the movie uses images which will be familiar to them but uses them in disturbing ways.	5.0	dark, forboding imaginary world mirrors a sad, cruel fate	2007-06-11	4	3	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AUX9KZUUB3YCE	R. Nicholson	A movie of exceptional quality!I'm a great fantasy fan and after seeing the trailers I decided to go see  this movie, not really expecting anything special; to say I was stunned by the unique story, the acting and the cinematography would be a gross understatement.The story take place in a rural, mountainous area of Spain during the Spanish Civil war in the 1930's or 40's. Part of the tale is about the civil war but there is another more 'magical' conflict going on at the same time, hidden deep beneath the earth's surface; as you might imagine the two tales become intertwined as the story progresses.Be forewarned, this is not a movie for children or the faint of heart. There are some scenes containing unspeakable cruelty and this will, without doubt, be a major turnoff to some. However, I found the violence within the context of the story and the era involved. (unlike some other movies where the violence seems to be gratuitous and is often there only for shock effect.Pan's Labyrinth is a foreign film with subtitles; I remember people complaining about this before and after the show. To me the subtitles enhanced the special effects of this movie; it added to the realism of the geographic area where the story took place. After 5 minutes, the subtitles went virtually unnoticed because the story was so enthralling and the acting so good.Conclusion;One of my favorite movies; a true gem.However, not all movie buffs will like this movie because of the fantasy component and the graphic scenes. But in my opinion it easily rates 5 Stars...more if I could.R.Nicholson	5.0	Pan's Labyrinth...a cinematic gem	2008-06-29	2	1	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"El Laberinto del Fauno (Gullermo del Toro, 2006)The last time I openly wept in a movie theater before last night was during the last half hour of Julian Schabel's awe-inspiring Before Night Falls (2000), a movie I still consider to be the best ever made. Guillermo del Toro has done it to me for the first time in six years (almost to the day) with the final ten minutes of El Laberinto del Fauno.Del Toro is the epitome of the Curse of Hollywood; when he is imported and works under the Hollywood machine, he makes execrable movies like Mimic and Blade II (though I have to admit I did enjoy Hellboy). When left to his native country, however, he makes movies like Cronos and El Espinazo del Diablo. Now he goes back to Espinazo's alternate-reality Spanish Civil War for what looks to be the second in what will inevitably come to be called a trilogy of Spanish Civil War ghost stories (3663, the third, is tentatively slated for release in 2009 as I write this). And once again: if you bring him to Hollywood, he makes Blade II. If you leave him in Mexico, he makes a movie nominated for six Academy Awards. Can you name the last film whose dialogue was entirely in another language to be nominated for six Academy Awards? (Let me give you a hint: the answer is ""none."" The record, which was held jointly by Fanny and Alexander (1983) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), was four.)El Laberinto del Fauno is the story of Ofelia (Rottweiler's Ivana Baquero), a young girl in Spain at the tail end of the Spanish Civil War. Her mother Carmen (Welcome Home's Ariadna Gil) has been recently wed to the Captain (Some Kind of Blue's Sergi Lopez, doing his best Ralph Fiennes impersonation) of a detachment in a remote area, hunting down an enclave of rebels. Carmen is pregnant and the baby has made her quite ill. Ofelia, who has no liking for the captain, withdraws into the twin defenses of her only friend, Mercedes (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Maribel Verdu) and her own fantasies, in which she is the unknowing princess of an underground kingdom; she can only be restored to her place on the throne by performing three tasks for Pan (Hellboy's Doug Jones), a faun who lives in the buried heart of a labyrinth that's been behind the mill where they live since, Mercedes tells Ofelia, long before the mill itself was built. As the real world gets more and more unimaginably brutal, with the Captain, already a vicious sadist, slowly losing his grip on reality himself, Ofelia retreats farther and farther into the dream-world she's created. The question that serves as the film's constant undercurrent is whether Pan is, truly, the product of Ofelia's fantasies, and by extension which of the two worlds is the real one.There is a great deal to be written about fantastic archetypes here, and how well del Toro conforms to them (and the ways in which he plays with them to suit his own ends); I am certainly not the person to write it, as my days of studying mythology were long ago and, at best, incomplete. Those with a more comprehensive understanding of myth would be better qualified to do so; all I can say is that Ofelia's fantasies (assuming that's what they are) are almost universal; ruling over a kingdom, the quest, the heroic sacrifice, it's all there. (I'm sure someone could put out a dissertation comparing Ofelia to Beowulf, or maybe even Gilgamesh.) I'm more interested in the idea that, perhaps, it's the ""real world"" that's the fantasy here, and the way the Captain's character plays into that interpretation over time. It's easy to imagine the Captain as ""the bad guy"" from the very beginning here (and there is also a good deal to be written comparing the Captain and the creature known in the credits as The Pale Man, seen in almost every publicity still for the film), and to be sure he's never exactly a good guy. But he is certainly not the monster at the beginning of the film that he is by its end. While whatever it is that drives his degeneration is never fully revealed to us-- one is tempted to say it is the impending birth of his child, for lack of a more explicit mechanism-- that he degenerates is obvious. The Captain's increasing agitation runs in parallel to the escalation of danger in Ofelia's world, but which one drives the other? There are a lot of layers to be peeled back here to get at the heart of this story-- assuming it has a heart, and is not just an infinite number of layers of interpretation.Nonetheless, the movie is not without its flaws, however minor they may be. None of these flaws is technical, as the movie is gorgeous in every capacity (and of its six Academy Award nominations, three are technical-- Cinematography, Art Direction, and Makeup, all of which it should be a shoo-in to take). Nor are there any flaws in the acting; all of the principals do a fine job with their roles. Ivana Baquero will not be playing minor roles in low-budget Brian Yuzna horror films any more after this, I'd warrant. I'm almost willing to go out on a limb and tentatively blame an editor for this, as del Toro seems, especially in light of meditation on this film, to have wanted to spend equal amounts of time exploring the ""real world"" and Ofelia's fantasy world; the finished product spends a lot more time in the real world, something for which, given the reviews, trailers, etc., I was entirely unprepared. I'm guessing there's a lot of fantasy-world material that for some reason ended up on the cutting room floor. More's the pity. Couldn't the extraneous mill-mole subplot have been axed instead?Still, the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or (and got a twenty-two minute standing ovation at Cannes on its first screening), seems a no-brainer to net Mexico it's first Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award, sits at #88 on IMDB's Top 250 Films as I write this, and has so much about it to recommend that any flaw in its makeup seems minor in comparison. It is far too early to proclaim El Laberinto del Fauno one of the world's finest movies, but I can say with great authority that, love it or hate it, this is a movie from which you cannot emerge unaffected. That is his job as a filmmaker, and he has performed it better than he has in his estimable career to date. See this movie and be amazed. **** (Oh, and since I didn't mention them: the film's other two nominations are for Best Original Score and Best Original Screenplay.)"	5.0	Perhaps the best movie of the past half-decade.	2007-01-25	2	1	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A277MYG7MQTKYW	Robert Blenheim	"The third great film given us by a young Mexican director in 2006 (along with ""Babel"" and ""Children of Men""), and probably the one most inclined to future classic status, is Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (""El Laberinto del Fauno"").This is a beautiful and horrific adult fantasy about a little girl named Ofelia in Franco's fascist Spain of the 1940's, and it cleverly layers the little girl's fantasy world of insect-fairies, fauns and monsters within a stone labyrinth onto the brutal real-life post-Spanish Civil War world where cruelty and willful violence make life intolerable.These two worlds (presented equally as real) are used by the filmmaker to convey the trauma of war through the inner and outer eyes of the little girl. The story, telling of the heroine's missing (murdered) father and ineffectual mother marrying again to an evil Capitan Vidal (a stepfather threatening to replace the girl's father-image), is a treasure-trove of Freudian symbolism utilizing true Grimm Brothers' stark violence to convey the rite-of-passage ritual through adolescence and the death of innocence. This is truly filmmaking at its highest level, a sort of amalgamation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" with a David Cronenberg horror film as if filtered through Andrei Tarkovsky, including pitch-perfect performances from the famous Sergei Lopez as the arch-fascist Capitan Vidal to the wonderful Ivana Banquero as the lonely and sad Ofelia.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a follow-up to del Toro's 2001 film, ""The Devil's Backbone"", which also placed a young child and a fantasy element into the world of post-civil war Spain, but this time del Toro did it with perfection, making both a quintessential end-of-childhood elegy and a fairy tale about salvation.  Achingly sad and heartbreakingly beautiful, this is easily the richest and darkest fantasy film ever made."	5.0	ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FANTASY FILMS EVER MADE	2008-09-09	2	2	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3SHQXNOPZBJH	Robert Byrd	I won't waste your time outling the plot of this film, since so many reviewers before me have done that so well.  What I will say is this is a truly remarkable film that effortlessly fuses a beautiful fairy tale with the harsh and foreboding realities of Franco-era fascism in Spain.  The hope of humanity is pinned on the discipline and curiosity of a young girl as she discovers her magical past as a luminous princess, and earns her way back into the immortal life from which she came.  The parallels to Christianity and the resurrection of Christ are pretty obvious, but do not impair the magic of this wonderful tale.  A highly recommended film, but probably not suitable for young children.	5.0	Wonderful in Nearly Every Way!!	2007-08-06	4	3	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	Robert J. Crawford	This is one of those films that you either love or hate:  its themes and vision are so strong that if you can't identify with the story or don't want a brutal journey, it will not be your bag.  This is not Disney fare, but a look into horror and the power of a child's imagination to cope with it.  The details contain such naked pain and the stark reality of human depravity, yet juxtaposed against an imaginative child's world that runs from, yet is coming to understand, it all.The child is taken to the home - besieged in the hills of Franquist Spain during WWII - of her step father.  He is a fascist and sociopath, with no love to give, and on a mission to crush the local resistance by any means necessary - and I mean any means.  She sees him for what he is, and as yet is as uncorrupted as her very sick mother is co-opted.  They are brought into this environment in order for the step father to witness the birth of his son, in spite of all the dangers.  The child translates this reality into a parallel fairy tale, but it is less an escape than a recognition of the full situation.As the plot unfolds, she is called to accomplish a number of tasks to reclaim her place in a magical world.  As reviewers have noted, the juxtaposition is brilliantly executed.  Indeed, the characters from both worlds are so vivid that this may be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen.The story is moving in its realism, with unbearable glimpses of physical and emotional pain, graphically displayed and extremely sad, with all the wonder that lovers of history and human potential can feel.  I was stunned and riveted  to the point of weeping.This is not for children, but a truly dark exploration of who we are and what we are capable of.  Recommended - it is the most vivid fantasy, anchored in an utterly un-hollywood reality.	5.0	reality delivered through fantasy:  a wonderful and sad masterpiece	2007-11-05	4	4	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ALPYOWQ4UZUYL	Robert Larson	"Somewhere between Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Washington Irving's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is ""Pan's Labyrinth""; a movie with more imaginative visuals than anything I've seen in years.Taking place in postwar Spain, ""Pan"" focuses on Ofelia, a young girl who loses herself in books and fantasy. The story begins when Ofelia moves with her pregnant mother, to live with her mother's new husband; a tyrannical military captain.With her mother bedridden, Ofelia explores the grounds of their new home and stumbles upon a massive stone labyrinth, which she is told to stay clear of, for fear of getting lost. It is here that we depart into a story of fairies, fauns, giant toads, and other creatures, and other fantastical things too great to spoil.Like any story with an alternate universe or fantasy creatures, it may seem inevitable to ask: is Ofelia imagining everything she sees? However, to my great pleasure, this film is too true to it's spirit to allow the viewer to have time to ask such questions.Even as it introduces creatures that carry their eyeballs on a tray, or giants living in a tree, each new character is treated with the same respect and interest as our human heroine. As fantastical visuals of the labyrinth become, each is interwoven into the struggle against the last of the Franco regime without skipping a beat.With parallels to characters and stories from children's fairy tales found in both the grisly cruelty of war realty, and the fantastical labyrinth, the movie feels steady, while still treading wildly new territory.It is dark, fantastic, and at times grisly, like most dreams; and it is one of the most dream-like experiences I have ever had at the movies. Highly recommended, certainly one of the best films of the year."	5.0	Dream-like experience is not to be missed	2006-12-22	8	5	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"A few reviewers previous to mine have stated that this isn't as good as many have insisted that it is.  On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capit&aacute;n Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capit&aacute;n Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capit&aacute;n Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi L&oacute;pez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd&uacute; plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled ""Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is ""boring.""  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.  I will state in no qualified terms that I can't imagine any sophisticated film viewer not being completely astonished by this film.  I can state in complete honesty that this is the finest film of any kind that I have seen in many years."	5.0	One of the two or three finest fantasy films ever made - an utter masterpiece	2007-02-11	16	12	4

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3LFD407YH422M	"Robert Ragona ""Customizer, Horror/Fantasy/Sci..."	"I watched this last night on DVD, after hearing considerable praise about it and good ratings, and I fail to understand either.  I suspect however, that much of the praise goes because it was a Del Toro film, the man who gave us the far better ""Hellboy"" flicks and is a name as well known as that of Quentin Tarentino (most of whose films I can't stand--with two notable exceptions--yet he has legions of admiring fans who hype his works and will pretty much rip you apart if you don't.)My biggest issue is this is a film that is clearly unsure of what it wants to be:  is it a fairy tale, in which case the actual fairy tale elements manage to comprise all of about 15 minutes a two hour movie and largely consist of talking and a few ""magic"" moments, and the appearance of a few Fey creatures; or is it a historical narrative of sorts, of the Spanish Civil War?  In which respect it also fails, except to exemplify the cruelty of a single Fascist, something we've seen time and again.In short, it fails on both counts, and outside of the main character, Ophelia, being there in both stories, the two elements don't tie together at all.  The characters are dull:  Ophelia's mother is weak, and seemingly cares more for herself than her daughter when she actually gets to act; the rest of the time she spends bedridden and unconscious.  Ophelia herself reminded me of a less obnoxious Lyra from ""Golden Compass"", too strong-willed for her own good but frankly not warm enough to be likable.  The Fascist captain, her stepfather, whose name I didn't even bother to remember, is the stereotype of every ""big military baddie"" ever seen--be they Nazis, Soviets, etc.--and stops being interesting very quickly.  The only other character of note, Mercedes, gets one scene that shows some real depth; the rest of the time she is a fringe character, there, noticed, but not really doing much.The ending could be called ""happy"" only by stretching the definition.  Another element that drove me nuts is when one of the prominent characters is shot--which happens four times--they stand and stare into space before falling over.  Nobody else does; just those four prominent.  This might work once in a film, but four times?  C'mon...there's drama, and then there's melodrama.  The film is also quite bloody and includes some gory scenes unsuitable for weak stomachs or children.In the end I'd say if you want to see this film, rent it, don't buy it; also if you hate subtitles, skip it, because unless you speak Spanish you'll need them to follow the story."	2.0	Weak, unsure of what it wants to be as a story	2010-12-09	14	2	12
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1GZ49W13STTFG	"Robert S. Gartner ""I am the Grungeman"""	"It has been a long time since I was completely blown away by a film, but this one does it. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fairy tale wrapped around a modern horror story, the aftermath of Franco's Spanish Civil War. A young girl travels with her pregnant mother to live with her mother's new husband, a sadistic captain of a garrison in a rural area of Spain in 1944, where anti-Fascist forces are still heavily active. She meets a fairy who takes her to a faun who tells her she is really a princess, but must prove her royalty by surviving three tasks. On one level, it is the story of the soul of a princess trapped in human form trying to get back to its magical world while living in the midst of human horror. On another level, it is the story of a young girl who is so horrified by the world around her that she escapes into fantasy. Although the film is in Spanish with English subtitles, it is a mesmerizing film that will leave you stunned. Ivana Baquero as the young girl and Sergi Lopez as the sadistic captain give bravura performances. The music, photography and production design are hauntingly beautiful.

Logue ""Shawn Logue, CPC"""	After reading the rave reviews this film received, I was eager to see this fantasy film. What a waste of two hours. Instead of watching an inspired fable, I was subjected to scenes of graphic beatings, tortures, and shootings. This was not a dark fantasy with realistic war elements; it was a brutal story of inhumanity with small doses of fantasy thrown into the mix.I'm no prude - I can stomach violence and gore if it serves the overall story. In this case, I could find little to redeem the explicit violence and bleak storyline.Not recommended.	1.0	Bleak Horror Story Masquerading As Fairy Tale	2007-08-04	134	41	93

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1OBPHRXHZF8P6	"Robin Orlowski ""political activist"""	Despite not exactly being what a friend of mine and me had hoped on our girl's night out, we still enjoyed this screenplay. It has powerful messages about courage and ethics.Ofelia (Ivana Baquero)'s world is really glum in 1944 Spain. Her pregnant mother is sickly and she doesn't really get along with her new stepfather either. Naturally then, when she discovers an alternate world, she finds solace in escaping to it--despite it also being filled with danger.She retreats even further when this family mocks her for believing in fairy tales. Anybody who's ever lived in a dysfunctional family of any kind can strongly identify with this theme of the film despite the subtitling--being the family outsider (i.e. black sheep) is not a fun position for a person to be in.Ofelia intentionally is supposed to be the character audiences identify with throughout the story, she is an outcast but is constantly on a mission to do the right thing for herself and others.  She attempts to help her mother through a diffcult pregnancy and then rescues her brother.This screenplay is one of the most realistic I have ever seen--not because of the violence (which admittedly there is lots) but because she is a multi-dimensional character.She is young and innocent, but also disobeys both her family and the magical creatures in her alternate universe. She deliberately samples fruit off of a table despite previously having been told not to eat anything and then has the nerve to beg (whine?) that she deserves another chance to receive her gift.People expecting the prototypical happy ending which is usually featured in fare featuring children as a lead need to be advised that like the rest of this screen play, this one is interesting but dark and quirky.	4.0	A unique coming of age story	2007-03-15	9	5	4

It keeps you hooked from the very first few minutes till the end that has a conclusion that left at least I very satisfied; the story was solid and very entertaining because the cast carried it out very well. The scenes are beautiful especially and at times quite chilling for different reasons at different times of the film. For a good portion of the time this movie is a fascinating adult fantasy, and the rest of the time it is a bleak world set in Spain following the civil war and they mixed both parts so well together- I am amazed honestly.Because honestly if not done right this movie could have been a complete mess- it instead though is a great success.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A29WH1GZNC4APF	roika	"This is a maudlin tale that could have been so much better.  If you're entering the theater to leave behind a violent, distressing world for a couple of hours (for the same reasons that the character Ofelia does), you will be disappointed, for the relief here from reality's horrors is brief for both the viewer and the film's young heroine.If you're not prepared to see a bit of in-your-face violence, or seeing humans being QUITE inhumane, you should avoid this film.  I myself had some trepidation about seeing such situations.  Now I know why.Still, viewers are given an interesting plot that had much potential, with unusual special effects, great acting, and Oscar-worthy cinematography.  What remains, however, is a nightmarish tale only for those who have lost all faith in the real world, and whose only hope of escape is deep within one's fantasies.How unfortunate.===========ASIDE:  It's a shame that the Spanish title (""El Laberinto del Fauno"") was not retained or literally translated for the English release of this film, for it will be apparent to any student of classical Greek mythology that the faun here is NOT the Greek god Pan.  Pan's name is never referenced in the actual script (although the faun says he has been known by many names), and this faun does not share Pan's qualities of being lord of hill and dale, the patron god of shepherds, the inventor of the musical pipes that carry his name, the lover of both men and women, and the source of much frivolity and chaos.  It is said that when Pan was born, he was so ugly that his mom abandoned him and fled, never to be seen again -- and this faun is quite hideous.  But I've never heard of any Greek legend saying that Pan was a courtier in anyone's kingdom.  So, a faun's labyrinth it is.  But this faun is clearly NOT Pan."	3.0	Not Pan.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.There's no denying that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of ""Das Boot.""Yet, for all its good points, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or ""The Wizard of Oz."" We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.Thus, although the parts in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable."	3.0	somewhat less than the sum of its parts	2007-02-24	44	30	14

I'm sure the point still would've come through.  It was just gratuitous violence.  Plus, I found the characters to be one dimensional, especially ""mean"" Capt. Lopez (Ofelia's stepfather), ""obedient"" Carmen (Ofelia's mother), and even ""defiant"" Ofelia herself.  The only character who had some depth was the housekeeper.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3572FTYUQQW3P	Royce Callaway	This is a beautifully photographed film with outstanding technical support, but this is not a film for the young or sensitive adults for that matter.  There are other films that are more violent than this one but the violence here stands out, because like the film Psycho, the violence is extreme and unexpected, which lends major shock value to it. I cannot emphasize this enough, because the violence is both shocking and difficult to watch.The film is two parallel story lines that intersect only at the end of the film. Captain Vidal reflects the legendary pride of the upper class Spaniard.  He views all others as essentially inhuman and acts accordingly.  Even he acknowledges his weakness is pride but that pride has poisoned him leaving him devoid of humanity.  Ofelia (a good symbolic name), the young girl is offered as a counterpoint to the Captain.  While the Captain lives in a brutal world of reality Ofelia lives in a world of escapism.  However, her fantasy world is not a pleasant place but is more like the original Grimm Fairy Tales, filled with violence and threatening characters.  The faun (Pan) she encounters in the labyrinth (of her mind) is very complex and whose motives are never overly clear.  Ofelia doesn't like the Captain and fears him but she doesn't trust the Faun and is uncertain if he is acting in her best interest or not.  She disobeys her mother and the Captain, just as she disobeys the Faun, which illustrates the parallelism.  Ultimately she defies the Captain and the Faun, which leads to the ultimate destruction of them all.  But the actual instrument of that destruction is the Captains pride.  He neglects his duty through his drive for a son, he destroys his wife through his pride, he destroys everything through his pride.  The Gods raise up those whom they wish to destroy.Did I enjoy this film?  I'm not sure. It is a riveting film and compels your interest even at it's most violent.  It certainly is a film that requires some thought once you have seen it.  It is beautifully photographed with an excellent albeit somewhat flawed screen play. It is filled with symbolisms and we know almost from the outset (the Captains watch) that time is running out for the Captain.  The acting is superb, but did I enjoy it?  I really don't know - - yet.  I do know that I only saw Psycho once and never saw it again -- even though it was an excellent movie.  I suspect this film will be like that as well.  If you like films and see them as an art form, this is one to see, if you think of films simply as entertainment, you may want to skip this one because it requires thought and reflection to fully understand.	5.0	Pride Goeth Before The Fall	2007-01-28	13	10	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2XFBNK054ZSO9	Roy Munson	"(4.5 stars)For those who seek a lavish fairy tale replete with childish concepts and lessons yet full of fantastical creatures and excitement, I would not recommend this movie. For those looking for a movie with real substance in the guise of a beautifully rendered piece of art incorporating fantasy in it's symbolism, look no further. In fact, despite the fact that this movie would seemingly appeal only to a younger audience- the underlying concepts it contains and emphasizes are really quite profound-now mind you, even if you aren't looking as deep as I did at this film, it is still a wonderful movie.In the early 1960's, a Yale University psychologist named Stanley Milgram conducted a series of experiments measuring the degree to which participants would be willing to be blindly obedient to authority, even when it conflicted with their own morals and conscience.  These participants, acting as 'teachers' were told to administer shocks to another person (not visible to them) deemed the 'learner,' for every wrong answer given.  They were also told to increase the voltage of the shocks issued as the experiment proceeded; if they refused, they were asked to continue, if they refused still they were told the information was essential and that they would not be held responsible, if they still refused- they were told they had no choice.  The results, according to Stanley Milgram in his 1974 article, ""The Perils of Obedience"", was that "" The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.""When it really comes down to it, the majority of people are in fact capable of allowing and, even worse, being complicit in such acts, no matter how much the acts themselves conflict with their own personal values or morals.  It simply is much more difficult for the majority of people to resist or question authority  than it is to disobey authority.  Those who have the capacity to question what they are told and the commands they are given are exquisite.  After just watching Guillermo Del Toro's movie, Pan's Labyrinth, one thing is certain: Ofelia provides the quintessential representation of these select few.It is 1944, and in the aftermath of the Civil War, Spain is a Fascist regime under Franco.  The main character, a young girl name Ofelia, is highly symbolic of the struggle that the resistance fighters, hiding in the woods, possess in questioning blind obedience and a rule forced upon them- they seek freedom at any and all costs.  In a microcosm of Spain's internal struggles, Ofelia must deal with Pan- a faun like creature who requires that she complete three separate tasks before she can be liberated herself and retain her kingdom as Princess of the Underworld.  At first, Ofelia is happy to comply and knowing what awaits her, however, slowly she begins to grow suspicious of the faun's intent.  As this occurs, Pan's responses mirror almost exactly the responses used in Milgram's experiment when a participant refused to take part- first she is asked nicely to continue, next she is told how important it is that she continue, and so forth.  What we find, curiously enough, is that within this little girl is an uncommon courage to resist all fears and remain true to herself and her own values.  Her desire for a kingdom and power is not strong enough for her to lose sight of her own values and inner light, regardless of the price.  The rebels know that the odds are not in their favor yet they have the courage to resist- to seek something higher that is worth dying for.  In the end, it is the ability to question, the ability to remain true to the ideals that burn within us that transcend all misery, pain, suffering, and even death itself. You can kill a man but you cannot kill his ideas nor the message he brings- all of which live on and continue to inspire generations of people to come.  Socrates was poisoned with hemlock for his ideas, Martin Luther King Jr. was assasinated for his ideas, the list goes on and on throughout the world and history- people who are willing to die so that the message remains.  This movie may take some more time for me to absorb and digest.  Obviously, it's a work of fiction yet, unlike many movies today, it actually contains a very important and powerful notion-people are intrinsically free, there is not enough authority, enough power, enough punishment or suffering in the world that can destroy that message.I understand that this is a drawn out review, however, this was my own interpretation of the film, and it was refreshing to see ideas like these incorporated into such a creative context, and I can honestly say this was one of the better movies I have seen in a long time."	4.0	The Courage to Question, the Strength to Resist.	2007-01-27	8	5	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2RJ4O4BMAGJVS	R P	"This was advertised as a ""fairy tale"" or having aspects of one.  But maybe 10% of it has to do with the imaginative fairytale aspect of the story.  90% of it is a super violent recounting of a sick sadist's experience of the Spanish Civil War.  So expect lots of blood and violence (bashing someone's face in, slicing someone's cheek open, breaking all the bones in someone's hand in a torture session, shooting a child, etc.).I don't necessarily mind this per se but I do think it is a case of false advertising.  If they had been honest about what the film was theywould have made less money.

It's like attending a lively filmmaker's master class. Even if you aren't interested in the art of projecting story and emotion on a screen, you'll still undoubtedly find the talk-over interesting.I had missed so many cinematic nuances the first time through. Del Toro says he conceived the movie as a sort of poem, full of visual rhymes, reflections, and symbols. As he points out his interplay of imagery, the viewer sees deeper into the method and meaning of every scene. While the movie itself involves a fantastical labyrinth, the Director's commentary is a lucid look to the bottom of an enchanted pool.	4.0	A Visual Poem	2008-01-15	0	0	0

As I was reading the reviews on the movie, I was quite surprised to see the negative feedback. While it is true that not everyone will like the movie, I think that misunderstanding the movie is not a reason to write a poor review, because understanding the movie deals with the viewer and not the movie quality.As for the movie, it is quite excellent. The best I have seen in a while. It is about war, more specifically, the fascist regime that ruled Spain and the backlash from its citizens. As a war movie, it does get very violent. As a dark fantasy film, it also gets very disturbing. However, the juxtaposition of the two is not a marketing ploy to hide a war theme under a fantasy category. As matter of fact, the movie gets its brilliance from both storylines blending together to reveal the hidden truths in our world. If it had only been a war movie or just a fantasy movie, it would have fallen flat...as most movies that only execute in one category. But with Pan's Labyrinth, you get an utterly poignant experience, provoking u to feel and to think on a far deeper level than your average movie.To sum it up: watch the movie.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3B6D3A01L2AAD	"Sal Magnum ""refugee from Babylon"""	"What a beautiful vision. I am in awe of such wonderfully executed filmmaking. I got to see this in the waning months of 06 and was easily the best film I had gone to since ""V for Vendetta"", and is quite easily in my top 100 maybe top ten films of all time. That is lofty praise from a calloused cynic such as I. ""Children of Men"" is another recent film that moved me along similar lines. I would highly recommend ""The Devil's Backbone"" also directed by Guillermo del Toro, if you are a big fan of Pan's Labyrinth. Not quite as good perhaps, but still riveting.The Captain in this movie is played with such cold, cruel, barbaric realism, that one cannot help but to rejoice in his abrupt, less-than-heroic demise at the climax of this film.Those who take issue with the brief moments of extremely graphic violence, must first understand that del Toro simply wishes to be openly realistic in his films about what has, and still goes on in every corner of this planet, where the beast rules and exercises authority.You may take the PG13 road America so desperately clings to when it comes to viewing the physical manifestations of the politics of hate, espoused by fascists and tyrants since man ""civilized"" himself, or we can be upfront and show the true horrors of the beast, that are generally censored from our re-telling of history by the victors and conquerors. Kudos Guillermo, for having the nuts. Nosce Te Ipsum.Ivana Baquero puts forth one of the trully inspired ""child-actor"" performances known to film. (Compare to the pretencious preenings of a Haley Joel Osmet, or your typical, spoiled, Hollywood snot and you are even more greatful.)The supporting actors and actresses are equally convincing in their roles, altho, the brilliance of their performances will most likely be lost on the English-speaking, immigrant-abusing, narrow-minded, American masses. (One person I know, absolutely hated this film on the simple-minded basis that he had to read subtitles! Yeah! Salutations to a nation of unenlightened swine.)I found the ""Pale Man"" to be a riveting character. The film was definitely bettered by the a**-clenching angst inspired by this beast.Doug Jones definitely outdid himself in this film, between his double personas as both the ""Pale Man"" and Pan. I became fond of the myriad of sounds issuing from this man-goat as he conversed. And both characters had the beautifully grotesque fingers of the damned.Not much more can be safely rendered to print, without playing the role of the cursed spoiler, so I will put the wraps to it here."	5.0	The Grisly Beast Rules This Earth From Deep Within the Hearts of Evil Men	2007-10-13	3	2	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3BRVQ5J0LAUU2	Sarah	"Simply put, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the way fairy tales were meant to be told, especially on the big screen. If you've ever read any of the original fairy tales, you would know that there was often blood, death, and other dark elements not presented in their Disney counterparts, but they still retained that element of wonder and fantasy.Take heed to all the other reviews about this not being for the very young or squeamish. I am a bit of a baby when it comes to cinematic brutal violence, I had to hold my hands over my face during a scene towards the beginning of the movie, when we get to see just how cruel Captain Vidal is. And I would have loved to see a few more scenes in the fantasy worlds; as one reviewer put it, the film was more like 70% real world/30% fantasy world.Aside from that, Guillermo Navarro's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the performances are excellent, the production design and special effects are awe-inspiring (I have a very high regard for effects that are done on the set), and fabulous writing and direction round it all off to make this beautiful, heart-breaking, wondrous film one of my best movie-going experiences."	5.0	The way fairy tales should be.	2007-01-14	15	11	4

Schweitzer ""Alan Schweitzer"""	"Of the many fantasy oriented films produced during thr past two years or so, ""El laberinto del fauno"" is my favorite to date in terms of the genre. Del Toro creates a marvelous fusion of reality and fantasy.  Although the Spanish Civil War had ended, there remained elements of protest, denial and struggle on the part of partisans who were loyal to the previous government; and, there were those elements of extreme  brutality reminiscent of a conflict that was intensely bloody and violent. The pervasion of fantasy assuages the horrofic reality of a fascist regime relentless in pursuing and destroying any and all remaining loyalists to the previous democratic regime in Spain.  There are many mythical adumbrations in the film, such as a central quest theme, archetypal imagery, and redemptive forces.  Although Del Toro is Mexican, he is creating a film whose central theme is, in my opinion, that of an underlying concept that remained central to Spanish literature in the past, specifically that of reality versus illusion, the summit of which was realized in Calderon de la Barca's theatrical masterpiece, ""Life is a Dream.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PN7Z2VTHICL8	"Schtinky ""Schtinky"""	In war torn Spain there lived a young girl named Ofelia, who loved to read fairy tales.  She moves to the country with her pregnant mother, to live with her stepfather Captain Vidal.  The Captain is not a nice man, in fact he is evil, spending his time torturing captives and waiting for his son to be born.Ofelia has a secret world, a world of fairies and fauns.  When a faun appears to her inside the labyrinth, which is part of the grounds of the mill she has come to live in, he informs her that she is a lost princess, and must perform three tasks to prove she is not a mere mortal.  Ofelia readily accepts the tasks, and the Book Of The Crossroads that the faun gives her.  From the book she learns her tasks to be filled before the next full moon.'Pans Labyrinth' is a dark fairy tale, not one for the kiddies.  I finished the movie and immediately watched it again.  The faun FX was extremely well done.  The thing at the banquet table was sumptuously disgusting, creepy as all get-up.  I think I'm in love with it.The war story and the bad captain left me feeling shades of 'Shindler's List' inside the story, and I remembered the warm-up of David Bowie's 'Labyrinth', now all grown up into a big-boy movie.  It brought to mind the McFarlane Twisted Fairy Tales figures that sit on my shelf watching me as I write this.  It also smelled faintly of 'City Of Lost Children' but perhaps that's simply because it was twisted and subtitled.The acting is excellent, the photography stunning, and the dream breathes the fetid breath of imagination.  Del Toro leaves it up to the viewer whether or not Ofelia's world was real or in her head.  And what was that thing that came out of the toad's mouth?My only complaint with the movie would be that it needed more Labyrinth and less war.  This is a superb movie for the horror or dark fantasy lover, worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!	5.0	Is it Live or is it Memorex?	2007-07-12	34	23	11
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Some day, the sad day will come when Guillermo Del Toro will stop making movies.  No matter what happens between today and that date with destiny, he will be able to look back to ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and say with confidence that he made one of the Great Movies.""PL"" tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a twelve-year old girl condemned to live during the final years of the Spanish civil war.  Her father is dead, and her mother is pregnant by the dastardly Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  Vidal commands that Ofelia and her mother come to live with him at his Fascist outpost in the Navarre mountains as he attempts to wipe out the local rebels.Ofelia has retreated from the horrors of the world to become lost in the world of fairy tales, and so she is better equipped than most when a fairy visits her one night.  The fairy leads her to a labyrinth in the garden behind the country house, where Ofelia learns that she is the daughter of the king of the Underworld.  In order to reclaim her immortality, she must perform three specific tasks, each of which will test her courage to the utmost.All the while, Vidal carries out a brutal campaign against the rebels.  Guillermo stresses the barbarity of the war without overdoing it . . . almost.  Further straining the nerves of the audience, there are more than a few spies working within the walls of Vidal's outpost, including the gorgeous kitchen maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" fame) and the noble Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo).Del Toro has created a movie of visual splendor, even though much of the movie shows the horrors of war.  You have all seen the spectacular monster with eyeballs in his hands, but there are plenty of other visual delights.  I had thought that I would never see as beautiful a movie about war as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""A Very Long Engagement,"" but ""PL"" gives that movie a run for its money.But more than visual delights, ""PL"" is a serious movie about courage in the face of the darkest adversity.  Even though this is fantasy, Ofelia faces perils in both the real world and the fantastic that far exceed anything Harry Potter ever faces.  Indeed, the risks Ofelia runs in real life make the fantastic threats to her life that much more dire.  Do not be misled by the youthful leading lady to think that just any child can watch ""PL"" and not have nightmares.  Children should see this movie, but only when they are mature enough - I strongly recommend watching this before you let your kids see it.Congratulations to the entire team for making such a wonderful movie.  It's rare that the fantasy genre gets such mature treatment - if more stories like ""PL"" saw the light of day (and fewer Tolkien clones), the fantasy genre would not be shunted off to one side and would be considered serious fare.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	Every once in a while, we get the opportunity to watch a film that shows what can be done when artistry is used in the way it is intended to be used. In this uncompromising movie, Guillermo del Toro goes all out to deliver a fairy tale that grabs the viewer's emotions and takes them on a rollercoaster ride. The R rating already indicates that this is not your typical fairy tale, but instead it is more in line with the more classic fairy tales of the past, like the uncensored tales by the Brothers Grimm.Our main character, Ofelia, is a girl in her early teens who loves to read fairy tales and has a most vivid imagination. At the beginning of the story, she is traveling with her pregnant mother, Carmen, to meet with Captain Vidal in an encampment in the Spanish countryside. The Civil War has ended, but there are still guerrillas fighting for the Republic, and Vidal's task is to help annihilate them. He has forced Carmen to come join him because he is the father of the unborn child and wants the birth to occur in his presence; he completely disregards the dangers of the journey for Carmen in such a late stage of her pregnancy. This is just a glimpse into the Captain's personality, which will be revealed as the movie progresses.Ofelia lost her father in the Civil War, and now uses her fantasy world to endure the situation in which she is in, a mother debilitated by the pregnancy, and a stepfather that is an ogre. She creates an imaginary world based on a book she read and on a stone labyrinth by the military camp. In her fantasy, she meets a faun, who gives her three tasks to carry before the full moon. By completing these, she will become a princess. During these tasks, Ofelia faces monsters that she does not dare face in the real world, and we are exposed to a plot full of cleverly created metaphors.As the fantasy progresses, the clear line between good and bad in the real versus the fantasy world, starts to blur. The story gets darker and there is a fair amount of violence involved. I do not think that the use of this violence is excessive though, since it helps communicate the full extent of the evil behind some of the characters.Besides the great story and masterful direction, this film presents us with enchanting music and neat make-up and wardrobe displays. On top of that, the actors perform their roles convincingly, especially in the cases of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Baquero's performance is on par with some other great performances by kids in the past, such as Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood. Lopez is so good in his role that you feel like grabbing him out of the screen and beating him senseless. I highly recommend this movie, it is a masterpiece!	5.0	"""Do you believe in fairies?"""	2007-08-07	5	4	1

Spain - 1944. The Civil War is ended but the fascist government is still fighting the remnants of the Republican Army out in the forests and hinterlands where Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) must go at the request of Carmen's new husband: an insane army Captain (El Capit&aacute;n Vidal played by Sergi L&oacute;pez). Carmen is pregnant with the Captain's son and soon to give birth. Carmen is suffering complications and spends her time forcibly bound to either a wheel chair or bed rest. Ofelia lives in constant fear that the birth will kill her mother. El Capitan cares nothing for Carmen, only for the safe delivery of his son as we see him wrestle with the legacy of his father (a great General and immortalized fallen war hero) and intense self-loathing. The house and countryside is full of spies and sympathizers for the Republican Rebels that Captain Vidal is obsessed with killing. Against this backdrop and within it, is woven the fantasy world of Ofelia's grim fairy tale.It is revealed early in the film that Ofelia is actually the reincarnated lost soul of a Princess who belongs to a vast Underworld Kingdom and that the Underworld King has been searching far and wide to retrieve his daughter from the land of the mortal human race. Befriended by a magical Faun, Ofelia is given a book and a charge to fulfill 3 noble tasks that will prove her to be the lost princess.For starters, this is film could be classified by some as a ""World War II Picture"", on par with films such as ""The Piano"" and"" Schindler's List."" There are many moments where the fear of the psychotic, murderous, fascist military officer is reminiscent of those other films but with Pan's Labyrinth there is an added element of Hope that I've never experienced in the face of such overwhelming Evil. This is not a Good vs. Evil story. This is Overwhelming Evil vs. Hope. You know, kinda like life on Planet Earth.Evil. This movie is shadowed by it in such a way that the entire audience (a sold out show by the way) sat hunched over with it's weight. Evil is enfleshed most effectively by Sergi L&oacute;pez the Captain of the Spanish Army outpost where the story takes place.Hope. Ofelia is Hope. Her knowledge that she is - in one world - a nobody, less than human in the eyes of the world of men and guns and uniforms and war, and in the other world - the Real World - she is ROYALTY. She is a Sovereign, born of Noble Blood, lost in the world of mortals, soon to return home where all will be made right and justice will be done.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3GXT4U5X26CMV	Sheila Haines	"Pan's Labyrinth has to be one of the greatest films of 2006. The enchanting cinematics produce some of the most beautiful screenshots you will see. The mix of fantasy from a child's perspective when confronted with the brutal realities of facist Spain retrace the roots of fairy tales.The viscaral horror can be a bit hard to swallow, but the ingenuity of some ""scary"" scenes portray a masterpiece of story telling. ""Pale man"" is one of the scariest monsters in any fairytale I've ever encountered.The best way to describe the movie is fairy tales for adults, fairy tales as the Brother's Grimm originally wrote (if you haven't ever read the Complete Works of the Brothers Grimm - buy it, loan it, borrow it - just read it!) - but perhaps even more terrifying as the nightmares are brought to life before your eyes.If you can't stand foreign films or reading subtitles, this is not the movie for you. Unfortunately you are missing out on a wonderful market just beyond the grasp of Hollywood. I believe, however, that this film can be appreciated on it's own past the language barrier because of the cinematics - the mixture of colors at the end when Ofelia is in her kingdom with the bright red contrasted with the other brilliant golds.... so captivating.This film is certainly worth watching. Even my boyfriend who hates subtitles loved the movie and we went to see it in cinema twice. :)Some critiques are the inconsistencies within Ofelia's character. She is both strong and yet vulnerable. That is true of any person, but her mistake while in the dining room with the Pale Man does not seem to fit her character. Perhaps this is because she is a child, but I before this scene had thought we were supposed to believe Ofelia was more brave and cunning than other children.Still, this movie is one of my favorites of all time."	5.0	Spellbinding, Hypnotizing, an Artistic Masterpiece	2007-06-01	9	9	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2KZFOWIDE4QOU	Shran	"I've come close to walking out of the theater during a few bad movies, but I never did it. At home, I've almost bailed on a few DVDs, but I always ended up sticking with them. So this is the first time I can remember giving up on a movie before it was done.I really don't get all the gushing admiration for this movie. The bad guy is cartoonishly bad, and any chance of getting drawn in to the fantasy is undercut at every turn by the nauseatingly graphic and brutal violence. I don't generally shy away from intense movies. I enjoy ""Saving Private Ryan,"" even with all of its blood and gore in the opening Normandy Beach scene. The intensity there serves a purpose. It drives home the brutality of war, the courage of the soliders, and the amazing sacrifices those soldiers made. In ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" the cartoon bad guy beats a man's face in -- and you get to see every blow, in detail -- apparently to remind you that he's a really, really Bad Man. I didn't need shockingly gratuitous violence to know that. I felt like the director was beating me over the head to prove a point, just as much as our cartoon Bad Man was beating the innocent man's face in.My wife and I barely made it through the scene of the toad vomiting itself to death. We finally made it as far as the girl's second task. But when the eyeless creature bites the heads off two of the fairies, we couldn't stomach it anymore.This is not a ""fairy tale for adults."" This is a gory horror movie masquerading as a fairy tale. Don't ever let a child watch this. It's sickeningly disturbing."	1.0	Shockingly violent	2008-04-21	122	40	82

I know it is already over-stated in the many positive reviews here, but I just have to add my praise for this movie.  It is one of the most creative, intense and visually stunning movie.  Not a moment in this movie lose my attention.  The two parallel (and intertwined) stories of fantasy and reality are both captivating.  Switching from one to the other does not lose a beat and kept me on the edge of my seat and at the peak of my anticipation for both stories.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and it hands down beat all other movies that were nominated and won the oscars this year.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7	Siklootd	&#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34;, by now most people are aware of this film and have developed their own judgement as to whether or not they find it enjoyable.  However, the general consensus is that &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34; is not just a remarkable film that is engaging and entertaining, but it is also a tale of sadness and hope, a tale that will captivate and move viewers as the story progresses.The film follows the life of a young girl named Ofelia.  Ofelia's mother is pregnant with the son of one of the captains of the Spanish armed forces during the World War II era.  The time period alone is enough to make the life of a small child such as Ofelia difficult, however, Ofelia's life is much more complicated than that.  Her step-father, Captain Vidal, is a power hungry man who lacks basic emotions such as sympathy and empathy.  The man makes the lives of everyone around him much more difficult and his actions displayed throughout the film depict a cruel and irrational man.Ofelia's mother and her live-in housekeper, Mercedes, are the only two people whom Ofelia feels comfortable around.  However, with her mother's health getting worse as a result of her pregnancy, Ofelia is left to deal with a lot of the struggles she's facing on her own.....that is until she discovers the labyrinth.After following a fairy guide to the center of the labyrinth, Ofelia discovers a faun who explains to her that she comes from a royal bloodline and is actually a princess.  He explains to her that in order to gain her birthrights to her kingdom she must complete a series of tasks.  The faun continues to give Ofelia tasks and &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34; dives deeper into the new world that Ofelia has discovered, a world where she feels happy and safe, a world where she can forget about her real-world problems that she must face every day.The film uses great artwork and design to mix and blend the worlds of fantasy and reality perfectly.  The characters are well designed, the world is believable in an unbelievable way, meaning that despite the fiction behind the fantasy world it is still believable to the viewers and it does an excellent job of drawing them in, as if the viewer is Ofelia experiencing it first-hand.  Overall, the film tells an engaging story that is bound to keep the viewers' attention, and it does so with great cinematography and special effects that add to the storyline perfectly.	5.0	Fascinating Story About a Fascinating World	2014-04-28	0	0	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	This is a superb film from director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1944 when a last band of rebels are still holding out after the Spanish Civil war has long since finished. Ofelia is a young girl who brought by her mother to see her stepfather a Captain in the army with a sadistic streak. He is leading the fight against the rebels.All this is interesting and mapped out from the start. However within a short space of time the film takes a huge turn into the world of fantasy. Ofelia is taken by a fairy to a fantasy world under the maze of the films title. On a simple level this is just a young girls escape from the nightmare happening around her, and if you just accept it as that you will still see a great movie.However Toro uses the fantasy world as a chance to make a movie that works on another level. There are clear references to the holocaust in the film (piles of shoes for one) and the Captain/Stepfather is remarkably similiar to the camp commandant in Schindlers List, both because of his brutal actions, and even visually Toro has picked an actor who looks like Ralph Fiennes. This may be pure coincidence...This isn't a film I could recommend for small children. Firstly it has some quite unpleasant violence, which in context is completly justified. Secondly some of the imagery is a little too disturbing for youngsters in my view. But at the right age (and I wouldn't like to say what age that should be) its a film for everyone.Unlike many Hollywood films this resolved without the need for tons of overt sentimentality, people cheering etc. Indeed I thought the ending got the balance just about right. Its a film I shall be watching again. Hopefully next time in HiDef as I imagine this would be a stunning film to see in that format.	4.0	Spanish Fairytales	2008-07-20	0	0	0

There are fairies and magic, etc, but make no mistake though, this takes place during wartime, and it has some extreme violence and some gore, so it's not a kid's movie!I'd also like to make special note of the costuming work done on the Faun: amazing!	5.0	A fantastic, sobering, saddening, happy, magical masterpiece (but definitely not a kid's film)	2013-11-29	0	0	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1VABWDOUQLULZ	S. K. Harrell	Apart from the fact that this film was gorgeous, the plot and acting were very well done.  Ofelia, much as her mythical namesake,  was a tragic figure from her first appearance.  Difficult as they are to watch and process, films that deal with the brutal reality of children's lives captivate me, and this one is very honest.  What makes this one so heartfelt is that even in Ofelia's BorderLand her tribulations never abate.  The need to pick and probe what was occurring in her psyche against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain is not necessary for me, though a thorough presentation of the fascist regime serves plenty of opportunity for those who need that tactile thread.  The faerietale overtones of this film could be misleading for some.  The violence in it is not obscured on any level.  For that it deserved its heavy R rating.  Though it doesn't cater to the genre of horror or thriller, the tension it creates is no less creepy and disturbing.	5.0	BorderLand	2007-11-07	3	3	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"The Labyrinth of the Faun--Pan's Labyrinth--surprised me on a few fronts: It was R-rated; it was in Spanish; and it was a very very good movie...one of the best that I've seen this year.But then my expectations were set to excellence knowing that Pan's Labyrinth is a Guillermo del Toro film. Del Toro first caught my attention back in 1997 with MimicMimic, a fair attempt at Sci-fi/Horror. After Del Toro did the second installationBlade II (New Line Platinum Series)of The Blade SeriesThe Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)in 2002, he went right onto my watch list of directors whose next movie that I don't want to miss (and he has not disappointed).Other than seeing the trailer and identifying Pan's Labyrinth as a Del Toro film, I'm glad that I didn't bother to read anything else about the movie prior to seeing it (which I always avoid as much as possible in order to keep the element of surprise in play), because I might have been discouraged by a lot of the ""Spanish fairy tale with English subtitles"" comments.Forget fairy tale, folks. Did I mention R-rating? Very rarely do you see any movie described as a fairy tale with an R-rating. And the R-rating is really too bad here, because it definitely cost Del Toro some box office bucks. But you have to hand it to the guy for keeping the integrity of the film intact. There's one scene (okay...maybe two) that sealed the R-rating and could easily have been lightened up involving a local farmer and his son confronting the fascist Capit&aacute;n Vidal assigned search out and crush anti-fascist rebels in post Civil War Spain.The star of this movie is young Ivana Baquero in the role of Ofelia. While the idea of this tween venturing so bravely into such a dark fantasy is a bit stretched, Baquero really makes you believe that she believes it. The movie starts with Ofelia and her Mom en route to their new accommodations at the camp of Capit&aacute;n Vidal and his troops circa 1944.Upon arrival at the camp, Ofilia is shown a Labyrinth where she meets one UMF (ugly male faun) named Pan who gives Ofelia a Book of Crossroads, which explains tasks that she must complete in order to escape her new living arrangement and take her place as Princess of the Underworld.Doug Jones is Pan and also the eerie Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth, and this guy plays a great monster. Del Toro used him in 2004's HellBoyHellboy (Two-Disc Special Edition)as the aquatic Abe Sapien, and you can see him as The Silver Surfer Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer out in theaters this month.I'm pretty liberal when it comes to what I'll let my kids watch, but Pan's Labyrinth is out of reach (mainly due to the brutalities of Capit&aacute;n Vidal as opposed to the nightmarish images). For adults...fans of Horror/Sci-fi/Fantasy shouldn't miss this genre gem.P.S.--There's often an aversion by some to watch a movie with subtitles, but I'd highly suggest resisting the English audio track and going with the natural Spanish audio track with English subtitles to add that extra element of reality to this well done fantasy."	4.0	El Laberinto del Fauno	2007-06-18	2	2	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1O8TLZLO5EUV6	"SnoopDopeyDogg ""Mike R."""	Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece depicting yet another episodic take on the seemingly never-ending conflict between Good and Evil...Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.A great and timely movie that deserves all the attention it has received.	5.0	When pure of heart meets pure evil	2011-11-27	1	1	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A32HDPMPQQT6T6	Solocoyote	I bought this DVD sight unseen. I love good story telling, specifically when there is some imagination involved. Sadly this movie is just ok.The fantastical storyline is dissapointing and unfulfilled in my opinion. The real life story is repetitive and pedestrian. The large part of the real life story is simply one man executing others with a pistol. I think that happened like 10 times through the movie. It just got boring and almost laughable. You could almost create a drinking game from it. Everytime someone gets executed with a pistol DRINK!That being said the acting was good. The visuals were well done too.This movie definately suffers from too much hype. There is no comparison between this movie and The Lord of the Rings.	3.0	Good Production...

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2V93GD69YMZ9F	Some Devil	I enjoy this movie immensely and on many levels.  The story, acting, setting and special effects (both computer generated and traditional) are spectacular.My complaint, then, is purely technical in nature.The product description lists the languages on the disc as both Spanish and English, with a separate entry listed for subtitles, also in Spanish and English.  This led me to believe that there was an English audio track included on the blu-ray version of Pan's Labyrinth that is not present in the DVD release.  This, however, is not the case.In most cases, I prefer to watch a movie in its original language, as the filmmakers intended, and I am generally not bothered by subtitles.  I would make an exception, though, in the case of this film, or any movie that is as visually dynamic and engaging.  For those of us who are not fluent in Spanish, the use of subtitles can detract from the viewing experience.  I would prefer an English language dub for Pan's Labyrinth for this reason.I know some people may think that I am lazy or a language snob, or even suffer from xenophobia or something akin to ethnocentrism.  Film fans will continue to argue the merits of subtitle versus dubbed audio for years to come, I am sure.  I would just prefer an English audio track for the sake of convenience, and the product details incorrectly imply that there is such a thing where none exists.	1.0	Misleading and disappointing product description	2012-04-10	36	14	22
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2C5VCR3DYDPR2	Some Guy	"This is an edited review.  My original was a short rant about the lack of an English track on the DVD.  Having been bashed as a racist and/or American snob in the comments, and now having seen the movie at a friend's house, I'd like to offer an update.I can't see a way to change the stars on this, so please assume 3 now.Why only 3 stars when so many rate it 5?  Truth is, it's a fantasic movie.  I think the other 1-star reviews were expecting a more linear fairy tale, not a fairy tail within a war story, which this is.The brutality of wartime Spain is graphically depicted with a cold-hearted soldier at it's center.  It's a shame he's so one-dimensional.  It would have been more human to give his charactore some depth, a bit of conflict, but he's always dismissive, always cruely violent, and always stone cold about it.  Yes, WW2 was a horror, but a central character like this should have more range (not to discredit the actor, rather the script).  The protagonist, an innocent little girl, is of course exactly the opposite with nothing to balance it.  Little girls aren't perfectly sweet, either.The fantasy elements are simply incredible.  Pan is a masterpiece.  The child eater is creepy, and the storyline that our protagonist is ""the one"" is interesting.  The ending is great, too, leaving the viewer to decide if it was all a little girl's fantasy to escape the harsh reality around her, or if it really did happen.So, that's one star down for thin characters and one to go - and I'm not backing down on the English language track.  Having now seen/read it, my original frustrations remain.  Too much of the excellent atmosphere and nuance of this movie was missed while I read dialogue.The rest is mildly-tweaked from the original review:With such a movie, I don't want my eyes constantly off the screen reading what's going on.  That's why I buy books.  I have Mexican inlaws and have spent many a Chrismas vacation watching American movies with Spanish voice-overs.  No excuse for the lack of an English dub on DVD.  They need to re-release this with some good English voice acting ASAP.  Until then, still no sell."	1.0	I want to soooo bad, but......	2007-05-15	98	10	88

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A33GLALSW7B7XZ	"Sparrow R. Jones ""author of No You Don't: Ess..."	Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno, 2006) is a Spanish film, through and through. The copy I rented from Netflix is only available in Spanish with subtitles, but it is more than the language that makes this movie Spanish. The film is a period piece, set in Franco's Spain in 1944 but it is more than the location that makes this movie Spanish.The actors, with the exception of Doug Jones who plays the Faun (del Toro did not intend the character to be the very sexual Pan because he felt it would be inappropriate to pair Pan and a small child), are all from Spain and speak beautifully accented Spanish (Jones learned archaic Spanish for his role and performs it with a gorgeous, rich accent that is not quite castillian Spanish but not quite belonging to any variety of Latino Spanish either) but it is not the actors or their lovely accents that make this movie Spanish.Pan's Labyrinth is a Spanish film all the way to the bones. The harsh beauty of the magical realism fairy tale beats at the heart of Guillermo del Toro's story. The movie is simultaneously fresh yet reminiscent of the great novels of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez and Laura Esquivel.The cinematography is understated and elegant, evoking a distant time through use of silvery faded color. The soundtrack is haunting and the subtitles are clear (I was impressed with the translation and later learned that the director no longer trusts translators and thus did the subtitles himself) and readable yet largely unobtrusive. There is violence in the movie, but only one scene that shocked me. (I regularly watch movies like Saw and Hostel while eating dinner for reference on my shockability.) The atmosphere is mysterious and sad. The movie left me painfully satisfied.If you are a lover of things dark and mysterious, of changeling children and a long-lost home far away, of frightening beauty in a war-torn world, of the majesty of fairy tales . . . if you love these things you will likely love Pan's Labyrinth as well.	5.0	A thoroughly Spanish film	2007-08-16	3	2	1
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3KHKW2CQWHDSE	"S. Peliska ""student musician"""	"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a masterfully executed fairy tale in the old-fashioned tradition: dark and atmospheric, full of stunning imagery, both beautiful and terrifying. With this film, Guillermo del Toro has proved himself a master not only of the visual elements of filmmaking, but also of credible storytelling. The way that certain thematic elements were developed throughout the movie was fascinating, and the film's ultimate emotional resonance is undeniable. One of the most brilliant things about this movie is that the line between the grotesque and fantastic world of the labyrinth and the stark, brutal world of post-Civil War Spain is deliberately blurred. This ambiguity is what ultimately gives the narrative its urgency and the film its deep sense of mystery.The violence in this film disturbed me quite a bit; on the one hand the depiction of such brutality makes sense in the context of the story, yet I can't help but feel that it was gratuitous at times. I also think that the black-and-white delineation of fascists=bad and socialists=good fails to do justice to the moral and political complexity of the Spanish Civil War. On the whole, though, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a beautifully realized work of great imagination, and definitely worth your time."	5.0	Enter the Labyrinth	2008-09-27	0	0	0

The film is set in wartime Spain and is in Spanish with subtitles. The direction is superb and the story kept me gripped the whole time, I didn't check my watch once. It is based around a Spanish regiment fighting the guerrillas and follows the step-daughter of the captain and how she cares for her pregnant mother and immerses herself in fairy tales and magic. It is wonderfully fantastical and just surreal enough to lend it an edge. All the actors play their roles brilliantly and the effects are out of this world. I guess you can tell from my already gushing review that I loved this film. It is different from the usual films churned out these days and I loved every minute. Some scenes are quite graphic in places and the violence can make you wince, but none of it is particularly gratuitous and it all plays a part in the overall story.

I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the ""Charlie Rose"" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!"	5.0	A Plunge into Darkness and Light	2007-05-30	6	5	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A17USE0KGSW3VN	Stephan D.  Mahler	I heard about this and have seen the trailers.  I'd figure I would pick up the DVD because of the trailers.  I just finished watching it and I will say that it isn't good....it's GREAT!!!  It does pay a slight homage to some of the fairy tales of the past (including Wizard of Oz) but it does take a slight twist.  Del Toro's vision is truely unique on this project and I can see why it has gotten the the good reviews it has gotten.From beginning to end, I found myself entranced with the story.  A tad violent here and there (the Captain smashing in the one guy's nose with a bottle was a tad over the top) and aside from it being done in Spanish with subtitles (again....a minor oversight),....it is worth the watch.  It was a bit of a sad ending,....but also somewhat happy when you watch it.  It's good to know that a person of any age can have one foot in reality and one foot in fantasy.  It's just a pain to figure out which foot goes where.  But again.....this is one of those movies that you watch where it sticks with you and it is a joy to watch regardless of any age you are.	5.0	A Wonderful Non-Disney Fairy Tale	2007-05-25	3	3	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3I69IXPTDVKQF	Stephen B. O'Blenis	"""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the story of a little girl in the middle of the Spanish civil war, whose mother has recently married a military officer whose brutal nature is soon to be revealed to mother and daughter when they movie into the military garrison the officer commands.  As the war between the garrison and the hill-based rebels rages, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is free during the calm periods to explore the dark woods, where she discovers a mysterious labyrinth....The first thing that needs to be said is that the movie isn't as open-and-closed as its advertising makes it seem.  In the ads it talks about a little girl escaping into a world of her own imagination, to escape a brutal reality.  In my mind, it's not a given that what happens in the labyrinth and during other strange events, is just Ofelia's imagination.  Not to give anything away regarding the ending, but throughout ""Pan's Labyrinth"" you can find plenty of clues that would lead to either outcome - that it's an imagined world, or that it's really happening.  As for the events whose reality is in question, Ofelia discovers a Faun inside the labyrinth who tells her that she's really the daughter of the moon, and requests her assistance in certain tasks.  Accompanied by strange, insectoid-fairies, Ofelia returns to the more familiar human world, although at times she wonders if the Faun has revealed the full truth....In that human world, the officer, Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez), rules the garrison, its soldiers, its staff of servants, the nearby village, and his own family (including his new child by Ofelia's mother) with an iron fist, and is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the rebels.  Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the man behind ""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"" walks a lot of thematically similar territory to ""Backbone"" - innocents caught in a vicious world not of their own making, the desperation of the powerless against the powerful, and the strong connection of a child with a kind of otherworld.  The themes tie together intricately, and one of the tag lines to the movie - 'Innocence Has A Power Evil Can't Imagine' - gives a tantalizing hint to what may be going on inside some of the movie's mysteries.On the techinal side, the movie is perfect - outstanding acting, special effects that are alternately beautiful and horrifying (including one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history), a great musical score, perfect suspense.  This is a must for fans of edgy fantasy, horror, and even war movies and intense dramas.  A++"	5.0	Brilliant Dark Fantasy	2007-04-09	9	8	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	AT07UZQQR7ZEH	"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov..."	"The first of two times I saw writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's Oscar-winning PAN'S LABYRINTH on DVD, it disappointed me because it wasn't at all what the critics led me to expect.  With its echoes of THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I thought the whole movie would take place in a dark and scary fantasy world with a young girl.  Actually, only half of the movie is dark fantasy.  The other half is real world Spain in 1944 with a sick mother named Carmen (Ariadne Gil) and a brutal Army Captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  With the fabulous young Ivana Baquero as 12 year old heroine Ofelia, this film comes alive on a mandatory second viewing as a dark fantasy masterpiece, especially with immeasurable help from Del Toro's audio commentary on the Spanish Civil War and his film intentions.We have two worlds in PAN'S LABYRINTH:  the real world of Vidal and Carmen and a housekeeper named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) in a house.  And a scary fantasy world ruled over by the sympathetic Faun (Doug Jones and elaborate visual effects).  Linking the two worlds are Ofelia, a deep green forest with mossy trees, and an old mill with a whole fantasy universe beneath it.  But only Ofelia can see the fantasy world.  So the movie exists on parallel tracks with careful use of color in both worlds (blues-greens and oranges-browns--the movie won Oscars for Cinematography and Production Design and Makeup).  Faun promises to help Carmen get well if Ofelia will do three tasks (the concept of threes throughout is definitely deliberate).  The Brothers Grimm and Del Toro's own 2001 movie THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (which Leonard Maltin loved) are also sources as we start to wonder whether the fantasy world really exists, or is all a product of Ofelia's vivid imagination.Rent or buy the double disk of PAN'S LABYRINTH.  Besides a widescreen transfer and very insightful commentary on disk one with the movie, disk two has a Charlie Rose Show interview with Del Toro and two other great Mexican filmmakers, ""The Power of Myth"" featurette, prosthetic and visual effects, and the careful use of color and the concept of three objects/people throughout.  Disk two also has a Director's Notebook and storyboards and animated comic book plates for the fantasy characters.The film's ending is controversial; I find it quite haunting.  What if Ofelia herself does not exist or was swallowed up by fantasy creatures--a giant toad, fairies, a man with no face, the grotesque but sympathetic Faun--and can only be seen by people with vivid imaginations?  Del Toro also cites LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD as a filmic source and constantly mentions his own THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, which I guess I have to rent.  But give PAN'S LABYRINTH two viewings before you throw the DVD box across the room in frustration.  This is a filmmaker to study in depth.  And his newest film is a fascinating and wondrous--and sometimes very brutal--adult fairy tale fantasy that was also an Oscar nominee for Foreign Language Film.PAN'S LABYRINTH has been rated ""R"" for graphic violence and strong language."	4.0	A wondrous and scary Spanish fantasy	2007-05-27	7	7	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS	Stephen M. Lerch	Pan's Labyrinth begins with a mother moving to a military type outpost at the end of the Spanish Civil War. She is taking along her only daughter, Ofelia, the real focus of the tale, who believes in fairies and magic. It turns out she is supposedly the daughter of the King of the Underworld and finds herself performing various tasks in an attempt to return to her rightful kingdom.The special effects, especially with Faun, the entity trying to get Ofelia to regain her position in the Underworld, are nothing short of fantastic. The creature is believable in a way that a plain CG creature cannot be. This thing is legitimately creepy, and the entire time I found myself thinking &#34;there's gotta be something evil about this thing,&#34; despite it trying to &#34;help&#34; Ofelia. The way this is woven into the story, how you hate the stepfather, worry about the sick, pregnant mother, adds to a sense of foreboding that permeates the entire film. And that's the point.When you come to the end of the movie, there's an amazing feeling of release - it's not the happiest, most uplifting ending, but it left me, at least, satisfied.Video:1080p VC1 encoded video. New Line has apparently applied DNR (digital noise reduction), however I didn't really find that to be all that distracting. For purists, I would recommend jumping on an import copy instead if you think you will notice. I can't really notice on my 52&#34; TV, so I am OK with the release.In terms of the cinematography, again, del Toro shows masterful use of light, and especially darkness, to increase the sense of foreboding and enhance the mood.Audio:For all intents and purposes, you have only one real option for the language of the film, and that's Spanish in DTS-MA 7.1. There is no spoken English language option. This will be a deal breaker for some, but not myself.The audio is also nothing short of amazing. The shadow and light create a world of atmosphere, and the audio is so well done that it adds even greater depth and further enhances even the most mundane scenes. Turn it up.Extras:Very little is done in HD for the extras. What is included, however, is definitely worth watching if you enjoy the film at all.Director's Prologue -del Toro giving an introduction to the film that had him lose 40 lbs and almost killed him (his words)Director's Commentary - If you want added insight and depth to the film, this is a great, great commentary. del Toro's commentaries are always good, and this one is no different.The Power of Myth -featurette on the tales that influenced this tale.Pan and the Fairies- Featurette looking at the character effects (Pale Man and Faun especially are interesting to see). Shows how they blend CG and practical effects to make the special effects work as well as they do.The Color and the Shape- Featurette on the cinematography of the film. Disappointingly short, but worth a watch.The Lullaby: The Melody Echoes the Fairy Tale - Look at the film score.The Charlie Rose Show Excerpt - roundtable conversation with Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron, and Alejandro Inarritu. Not Pan specific, but worth a watch, especially when you realize these 3 directors are friends and offer critiques of one another's films.The Director's Notebook- You can look at different aspects of the production: Lost Character: El Hombre de Madera, Torture of the Maquis, The Phases of the Moon, Iconography, Echo Echo, The Underground Kingdom: Miniature Construction, and The Mill: Set DesignStoryboard ComparisonsVFX Plate Compare - lighting test w/ end scene shown side by sideDigital Comics- Four animated comics delving into back stories for the film.Photo GalleriesMarketing Campaign Materials - Trailers for the filmOverall:Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing film, provided an amazing release on Blu Ray, only hampered by the fact that the extras are mostly standard definition and not HD. This doesn't detract from the film, and the insight provided by the extras really outshine the limitation.Highly recommended.	5.0	Absolutely amazing film, with a great transfer and release on Blu Ray	2013-08-21	1	1	0
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2PN62S0L13TD	"Stephen Norquist ""S. Norquist"""	"This is another movie I wanted to like but ultimately can not recommend.The acting was top notch and the effects and visual sequences were simply amazing. However given all these positive things, the story was the failure here. Also the incredible emphasis on violence, brutality and blood.This is one of the ""most"" violent films I have seen in recent memory, and I have seen Kill Bill many times.Unlike Kill Bill where the violence is over the top and entertaining this movie is very hard and real. We see good or innocent people murdered and tortured with no care. It is just too much. I know Spain was really into all that inquisition stuff back when, but it is sad to see that this vicious kind of violence still exists as entertainment in their culture.The story is about a 8-10 year old girl's plight. Her mother is a weak and foolish woman who after her husband dies decides to marry a sociopath and take her little innocent daughter who is still dealing with the death of her beloved father into this psycho's world.This monster is the captain of an outpost that stands against a group of rebels who are trying to change things. The captain runs the outpost like Dachau and tortures and murders anyone who even looks sideways at him.The girl's stupid mother is of course seduced by his darkness and power and gets herself pregnant with his son, his heir to evil.As we learn later, he could care less about the mother, and all she is to him is a piece of meat who's purpose is to allow him to propagate his evil.The death of the girl's father and that unresolved trauma combined with the horror of living in the hell her mother has lead her into causes the girl to create a fantasy world in her mind and a series of adventures that she undertakes.This is where the story gets very sad because you are aware that everything she is going through is in her mind, a fugue state brought on by the horror and emotional shock of all that has happened and is happening to her.By the end of the film pretty much everyone is dead, murdered, or tortured and there is no pay off, no hope.Despite what the fantasy sequence at the end may imply, it, in reality, is just a sad brutal end to an experience that no young child should ever be forced to endure. The guilt for the whole thing can be placed squarely at the door step of her stupid and selfish mother and her new sociopathic husband.I can not recommend this film except to those who like to see people get hurt and killed and enjoy a good nihilistic romp."	2.0	Ornamented Nihilism	2007-06-05	34	13	21

The violence may be largely in-context, but it is also the film's Achilles' Heel.Recommended, but not for the squeamish, even if they are Art Savvy...	5.0	The symmetry of sacrifice...	2007-07-18	1	1	0

If your too lazy to read subtitles and appreciate one of 2006's best movies, then stop calling it a bad movie. And to those who raved the movie for violence needs to see the point. Without the violence, what reason would Ofelia have for escaping to this fantasy world. The point of the movie is to show how innocence is ruined by a harsh, cruel world. People keep saying that the violence detracts from the movie, when it's the violence that glamorizes the point.P.S. The Movie is wonderful.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	ABP2UMJY61K8A	Summeroz	"What it is about:A young girl Ofelia goes with her mother to a remote mountain village in Northern Spain where mother's new husband is waiting for them.  Ofelia's stepfather is a sadistic Captain in the army who is hunting rebels/guerillas who oppose Franco.Ofelia is a reader of fairy tales and she is immediately surprised and delighted to find that the remote village has fairies living there.  Ofelia follows the fairy into a labyrinth and finds a faun who tells her she is the long lost princess of a magical kingdom.  Ofelia is told that she must do 3 daring tasks to be able to return to her kingdom and so her adventure begins.While Ofelia is completing her tasks we also see her mother.  Her mother is pregnant and incredibly sick.  Her mother spends the majority of the movie lying in bed drugged and with fever.  When she isn't drugged we see that she is a woman suffering.  She knows her husband doesn't like Ofelia and she tries desperately to get Ofelia to act like a good girl and good stepdaughter.  Ofelia loves her mother and tries her best to help her get better.Ofelia's stepfather, the sick and twisted Captain, goes around killing rebels and torturing people.  He is not a nice man.  We know he cares nothing for Ofelia or really her mother and only cares about having a son.Recommendation:This is a rather dark movie.  The violence is inescapable and brutal, in both the ""real"" world and the fairy tale world in which Ofelia lives.  You see both worlds pulling at Ofelia as she tries to adjust to the cruel world around her and to grown up problems.  The special effects are amazing, the monsters truly scary and the set is of the mountain village is realistic.  You are immersed into the movie the moment it starts and don't break for air until it ends.  If you can tolerate graphic brutal violence this movie is worth seeing.  The acting is superb, the cinematography is excellent and the story compelling.This is an ""adult"" fairy tale and will probably be one of the best movies of the year b/c it is so original and honest.  It doesn't flinch away from the horrors of war and the horrors at home.  This is a must see film."	5.0	A Chilling Fairytale	2007-01-10	10	8	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2KB01ZCNIZQFQ	Sunny in DC	I loved this movie. Dark, sad, violent and so beautiful. Marvelously creative with amazing special effects. The juxtaposition of real life (1940s Spain) and the dark fantasy worked seamlessly together given the context of both.A young girl whose widowed mother has remarried a cruel Captain and is now pregnant, joins the captain and his soldiers in a remote location near the mountains as the soldiers fight the resistance. This is where she finds the labryinth and meets fairy that leads her to a creepy faun. As the world around her turns more and more violent, she retreats to the fantasy world which in turn asks her to perform three truly frightening and horrific tasks.This is not a movie for children. The violence is intense and terribly brutal but part of the reality of the resistance war. It is beautifully acted by the young girl portraying Ofelia. Her lovely face had such a purity in it that you could not help but be drawn into the nightmare of her life which she lived with such dignity and innocence. The actors are extremely well cast. The bond between Ofelia and the housekeeper Mercedes is believable and poignant. Mercedes is pivotal in the film and portrayed with great strength and emotion by Maribel Verdu. While the Captain is nearly a caricature of evil, the moment he holds his infant child in his arms, a hint of vulnerability is shown, which in no means makes him sympathetic, but which showed the breath of the actor in his ability to show some humanity in someone who was basically a monster.Make no mistake, this is a very violent and scary film.

It was also one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. It portrays violence truthfully; while there's probably less scenes of violence than 5 minutes of Tarantino films, visceral fear and agony come thru in a way those empty films never could. The beautiful scenes of survival and hope, goodness, and haunting echos of humanity stay in your mind months after having seen the movie. Oh, and the music - it's so beautiful and wrenching in its portrayal of the princess amidst the terrible misery of those who would prevent her from returning to her true home.	5.0	Simply beautiful; violence portrayed truthfully; heartstopping music	2008-04-19	4	2	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3MC3071WGAB5T	S. Yates	The following may be construed as a spoiler, but is really more of a primer:In fascist Spain, 5 years after the official end of the Spanish Civil War, rebel fighters are still causing problems for a military captain in the wooded north of the country. Rebellion is all around him, even in his own household, but the Captain never demands anything less than absolute obedience, including from his wife Carmen, nearly 9 months pregnant, and Carmen's daughter Ofelia, whose real father died in the Civil War. While Carmen chooses to obey the Captain out of world-weary practicality, Ofelia -- just at the cusp of adolescence -- still retains her sense of fantasy, which ultimately causes her to stray from the Captain's oppressive yoke. She therefore aligns more closely with Mercedes, the head servant in the Captain's house, than she does with her own mother. Mercedes can be seen perhaps as an older version of Ofelia who, while having retained her rebellious nature, has lost her sense of fantasy, and she becomes a surrogate mother for Ofelia as Carmen struggles with a difficult pregnancy.The film has a mirror story that takes place in the fantasy realm, but nevertheless deals with the same themes of the other: namely, rebellion and obedience. The two sides of the mirror interlock as Ofelia crosses in between them. For instance, in one night, she is forbidden from eating from two nearly identical banquet tables, one in the Captain's home and the other in the lair of a horrible creature whose cruelty resembles that of the Captain. As the film progresses, the two mirror-worlds become more and more closely intertwined, in the end leaving the viewer with a mix of intense emotions, still glued silently to their seat even as the credits have finished rolling, completely overwhelmed. Very few films even aspire to that kind of effect, and I can think of none that actually accomplish it to the degree of Pan's Labyrinth.If I had to compare it to any existing film, I would probably say Spirited Away. (Like Pan's Labyrinth, Spirited Away is much better in its original language. Thankfully with Pan's Labyrinth, we're not given the option.) There are many stories in literature and film dealing with pre-adolescent girls discovering their own courage through adventures in Wonderlands, some darker and more sinister than others, but they invariably fail if at least the smarter girls in that age group cannot be considered among the target audience. So while Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away contain some pretty horrifying images not found in the sterilized world of PG and G-rated fare churned out here in the states, it's important to keep in mind just how intelligent girls that age are capable of being -- though maybe fewer than 1 in 10 actually are (the same goes for boys) -- and we should give those deserving few credit for that. Personally, if I were the parent of a 9 year-old who'd read every Harry Potter book, I think it would be highly constructive for her to watch Pan's Labyrinth. Nightmares be damned, as well as MPAA condescension.	5.0	what more is there to say?	2007-05-25	3	2	1

Yes, the fantasy stuff is beautifully done, but it is the intense drama and branching conflicts within these storylines that will have you captivated. The other worldy elements combine with the the melodrama perfectly here, each playing an important part in the slow unraveling of a far more intricate tale than I expected.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2R70Z8WQ8BZNB	"TANTRUM!!!! ""...no longer Maria!"""	"Away from the confusing battlefield of hundreds of customer's reviews concerning feelings and emotions in the New-line cinema edition for this phantasmagorical masterpiece, i would like to express both admiration and respect for Guillermo del Toro for this incredible achievement. The relief i felt after my first watch of this movie, was based on my lost hope to ever find a movie that could make my emotions and basic interests in filmaking, get back in track again in several ways at the same time. After all, look at the ""fantasy"" or the ""horror"" movie industry we're facing these days, or even the ""war drama"" movie industry if there's still any, look at the easy-accomplished style or commercial-digital products in filmaking, designed to warm seats in theaters and sell popcorn with mind bending publicity  based on mass hysteria about what's cool. That's why i totally respect people who didn't like this movie: How can someone leave behind or even pass by this ""black or white"" way of thinking, product of the hypnotic and extreme new cinema, designed for grabbing basic instincts and superficial emotions, throwing'em into a void of nothing?Considering myself a respectable classic fan of good movies, you can't imagine the amount of rented DVDs and endless theater features i've lost myself into. Despite some great movies i even bought, my emotional viewer persona was dying. Even artistic short-films made me sick, and i was slowly becoming an easy entertainment junkie. Searching refugee in my old classic cinema masterpieces, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" found me. After ""Hellboy"", i already said goodbye to my beloved Guillermo Del Toro and his mexican-spanish works like ""Cronos"" and ""The devil's Backbone"", but this last work was so helpful and important for me, i will refer to him as a filmaker, trying to explain this phenomenon according to his ""double"" personality. Enough already about this movie, it's all been said.-""HOLLYWOOD"" DEL TORO: After the succes of his second production, the critical aclaimed awarded ""cronos"", Del Toro made his debut in Hollywood with ""Mimic"", a regular but very creepy and original monster film. He made the best of the ""Blade"" sequels, along with one of the best comic book adaptations, ""Hellboy"". He still is all about horror, graphic and deep-feeling horror as well. But these movies only show a great talented director, but not the real filmaker.CONSEQUENCES: Fans of ""Hollywood"" del Toro found his spanish productions boring, dramatic, absurd, confusing long and dull. Not enough action, not enough horror imagery, not what they expect from the master they know. Dissapointed, they still love him and expect more.-""FILMAKER"" DEL TORO: The real artist emerges in his spanish productions, no doubt about it. He manages to create a masterful, original and extense balance between gruesome horror, tear jerking drama, and spanish culture. His characters are extreme in their roles like the old times, with no moral struggles, redemption issues or search for justice, at all: they are essential, pure, and charismatic. He works with children for the purety and inocence of ""Good"", and with egomaniac psychopatic villans for the ""Evil"". Adults, no matter wich side they choose or their intentions, represent the cruel and unavoidable reality of the world. The intense, visceral Drama is based on Pain and Injustice inflicted on the week, and the will to survive in a demented, ilogical world. The fantasy is the way in wich Del Toro expresses is horror fan persona, and he loves horror imagery, conceptual and graphic in both ways with the same passion. He looks for simple and symbolic scenarios in order to achieve identity and purity, not to disturb character development. Long, complicated takes and  great use of the camera. So what makes him a genious: BALANCE, pure explicit but simple balance. No specific theme or genre is the real backup or background for the other. Bravo Guillermo, like the old days.CONSEQUENCES: Some real serious film critics or fans are atracted to Del Toro's artistic side, just to discover some of the must disgusting scenes they never hope to watch, therefore they don't think necesary, too over the top. More disapointment, from a different side.I think i loved it because of my background in movies: Horror, drama, western, comedy, war movies, cult films, science fiction, etc. Could it be because i'm open to all genres with the same passion and therefore prepared, or just because i love to enjoy a good movie as anyboby?By the way, this edition i just bought in a local store from an importing order is just spanish all the way. The best region 1 is still the New line 2 disc edition DVD set. Highly recomended, that edition contains all the production works, extra material and interviews that may exist, Guillermo del Toro likes to share every single aspect of his work.My respects, and good luck.- Maria"	5.0	It's so good to have good old fairy tales back: Perfect, masterful balance between several genres.	2008-03-19	4	4	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2MYUI8IT6UBUU	"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com"""	Immersed in mystical fairies and demoniac monstrosities, Pan's Labyrinth is an enchanting tale of spellbinding imagination contrasting with the austere realities of war. A strikingly mature fantasy fused with fervid violence, staggering visuals and ingenious creations, this macabre fairy tale is the most innovative and beautiful film of the year.Dreamy little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is taken to an army stronghold with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) to live with her stepfather, the merciless Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). It is 1944 in the aftermath of the Spanish Revolution, where Vidal is anxious to destroy a remnant rebel group hiding in the surrounding forest. Alone and powerless, immersed in violence and cruelty, Ofelia explores a stone labyrinth that houses the magical faun Pan. As he bestows upon her several daunting tasks, Ofelia lives out her own dark fable as she confronts monsters both hellishly alien and all too human.The character and creature designs are simply phenomenal. The human characters are excellently depicted, allowing the audience to truly despise the villains and root for the heroes. There's nothing worse than feeling sorry for the bad guy when he gets it in the end. This film ensures that you don't. It is the fantastical monstrosities however, that are the true visual feast, such as Pan himself, a minotaur-like faun covered with scaly skin and fleshy branches and leaves, and crowned with enormous diabolic horns. The Pale Man is also a prime example of wicked genius; he is pasty white with thick, sagging flesh and bleeding red eyeballs affixed in the palms of his hands, and must thrust them in front of him to guide his twitching stride. Both characters employ brilliant prosthetics and makeup, magnificently brought to life by actor Doug Jones. To further mystify the viewer, the full body designs include fragile stilt-like legs that couldn't possibly house a man in a rubber suit.As we all know, special effects don't make the movie, and exemplarily Pan's Labyrinth uses such effects to perfectly compliment an inspired story full of imaginative originality. Including predefined mythological concoctions such as the faun, fairies and a mandrake, Pan's Labyrinth beautifully melds familiar fantasy myths with its abundance of unique and devilish creations. The central motif is a brilliant parallel to those creatures, and fuses themes of fervid imagination and brutal reality, love, innocence, bravery and sacrifice. Contrasting against the gritty background of the Spanish Revolution, Pan's world is both a dreamy escape and a nightmarish prison.The acting too is commendable, most notably with Ivana Baquero, who evokes an exquisite blend of compassion and emotion. Del Toro favorite Doug Jones gets us so immersed in Pan's fantasy world that perhaps the only fault with the film is the relatively short amount of screen time the elusive faun receives. Acting aside, this likely nominee for the Best Cinematography Oscar features ominous structures, old creaking buildings, and winding stone labyrinths that mark the forested landscape...	5.0	Read the full review at www.MoviePulse.net	2007-05-20	1	1	0

I can't say the word ""adult"" enough. If you take small children to see this, be prepared to pay for some therapy.That said, ""Pan's"" is a strange and somewhat wonderful film.Del Toro, who has had better success working in his native tongue (""The Devil's Backbone"") but has also directed ""Mimic"", ""Hellboy"" and ""Blade 2"" in the United States, combines elements of fantasy, horror and fairy tales with actual historical events to create a lively, beautiful world. The elements and influences of historical events help to make the overall film more powerful; we have all seen films filled with wonderful CGI creations, but they don't seem real. In these cases, the filmmaker wants to show off their tools, everything they can imagine. But when they spend so much time on the effects, they have little time or talent to develop characters or narrative. Del Toro achieves this delicate balance by rooting the story in the real world.Some of the characters or events may have been changed, or fictionalized, but the action is rooted in real history, grounding the fantasy elements in reality. Another factor helping all of these items blend together is the historical setting. Because the story is set over sixty years ago, during the Spanish Civil War in the 1940s, it also lends itself to a more fairy tale quality. Colors are a little more saturated, everything is a little old fashioned looking and it becomes more real. As we come to accept the environment, we become more willing to accept the creatures living in this world.Del Toro waits for the story to get going before delving into this other fantasy world. And once he does, we have to specifically enter this world, meet these creatures along with Ofelia. She is our guide, our escort. Also, the film alternates between these two worlds, reminding us of Ofelia's real life circumstances. All of these choices help to make the film real.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an adult fairy tale and you should pay special attention to the word ""adult"". If you take a child to this film expecting to see a live action version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" you should also arranged for some ongoing therapy. This is a beautiful film, but it is also a violent and bloody film. But in a way, this makes it all the more wonderful.Ofelia has misgivings about going to live with her mother's new husband, Captain Vidal. And we quickly learn her initial feelings are justified. Vidal is a mean, cruel and sadistic man. Charged with squashing the revolutionaries, he will stop at nothing to accomplish this. If he catches one, he gets the information he needs and kills them. His men are instructed to be just as merciless.This violence is mirrored in the fantasy world Ofelia enters. All of the best fantasy films and fairy tales use elements from the ""real world"" in the fantasy realm and ""Pan's"" follows this tradition. Not only is Ofelia's quest tied to her real world, but she encounters challenges and violence in this place she so desperately seeks for escape.Ivana Baquero is very good as Ofelia, the young girl thrust into two new and very different worlds. Following in the footsteps of other good child actors, she brings an innocence to the role making the character all the more memorable. She seems vulnerable, but shows some strength as she begins to enter this other fantasy world. Like Cinderella, Wendy and other fairy tale heroines, Ofelia has both a natural curiosity and fearlessness that suits her well. Baquero shows how much Ofelia cares for her sick mother, how much she is willing to go through, and the various aspects of her character.As mentioned, Captain Vidal is a mean, intense man and Sergi Lopez makes him even more memorable. The role is a bit stereotypical; a few too many explosive moments, but when Vidal is quiet, he is more effective and more menacing. There are scenes in which Sergi Lopez demonstrates both of Vidal's methods of intimidation; in some, the Captain merely speaks, saying things that turn his victim's hearts cold. These are by far the better, scarier moments. When he screams and shouts, he appears far too stereotypical and villainish.Maribel Verdu plays Mercedes, the Captain's housekeeper. She stands by and watches as Vidal takes out his frustrations on her people, the local townspeople who are also revolutionaries, but she says nothing to protect her position. As soon as Ofelia and her mother arrive, she senses Ofelia may be something special and looks out for her, in a way, without jeopardizing her position. Soon, she can't stand it anymore and exacts her revenge on the sadistic Captain in a very memorable way.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a real find and instantly brought to mind the same feeling I had after I discovered the work of Peter Jackson or Jean Pierre Jeunet. Their films are similar in tone, style and look. If there is a difference, it is that Del Toro's films are more violent. People will be harmed and some will die. But that doesn't detract from the beauty of the characters, story, events he depicts in this very special ""Labyrinth""."	5.0	A Fairytale for Adults: Chilling, Violent and Beautiful	2007-01-13	9	7	2

I considered letting my 12-year old son watch this with me, but then decided to watch it on my own. I would highly recommend any parent do the same. I'll probably save this movie 'til my son is a bit older.I'm not a linguist, but for me, ""The Labyrinth of the Faun"" would have been a better translation than ""Pan's Labyrinth.""

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A7X6TKDZJV9HM	T. Jacobs	I saw this movie for the first time at 4 in the morning. Its beautifully done and graphically violent all rolled up into one. Despite the somber tone and violence, there lies a wonderful story. It is about a girl and her pregnant mother who go to live with her sadistic stepfather (who is a military captain)in the war of 1944. One night the girl discovers a fairy that leads her to a Labyrinth, where she soon discovers her destiny.She must complete three tasks before the Moon is Full. That is as far as I will go with the story. (just have to see it for yourself) but the movie definitely keep me watching the the end.  Was the little girl going to complete the three tasks?

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2H1J0WGGPGYJ	Tom	This film I've seen 2-3 times over several years.Each time, afterwards, I began to understand more.It is a wonderfully creative and inventive film.Worth reading a bit about the story line ahead of time, since if you're English speaking you'll be reading subtitles, and the story seems complicated.  However, it isn't all that complicated, IF you are a bit prepared by a preliminary story-line read ahead of time.After the 2nd or 3rd viewing, I began to understand and see quite a bit of (what now seems obvious) symbolism, making connections between occurrences in the film (in the fantasy) that provide parallels between the story and great, classic tales and of Christian traditions, or simply suggestive of universal tales of human survival that are found across cultures.If you like mystery, if you like children and their dreams, if you can accept realities of tragedies behind life's continuum, but believe in hope eternal, and if you can tolerate some painful scenes, this film is for you!Visually very appealing overall.Great film.	4.0	SYMBOLISM here in this film	2014-04-06	0	0	0

But this film just did not sit well w/me, it wasn't the director or the actors, it was the story itself. The ending was a major letdown for me, because it wasn't very good. The best aspect were the effects.I'm not sure what else to say.Jan. 24, 2011)Well, now I realize I was wrong to criticize this movie the way I did, I just watched it for a second time and overall liked it.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that starts so well that you hope it will stay that good but which actually surprises you and constantly improves. It's a remarkably layered work about the importance of choice even in an emotional and political dictatorship and about the fictions and fantasies that sustain people through the worst circumstances. On the surface this appears to be little more than a more fantastic spin on The Spirit of the Beehive, sharing its post-Spanish Civil War setting as well as the broken family setting, but this is a far superior film in every way. Although marketed largely as a fantasy, its real power lies in the scenes set in the real world where Sergi Lopez's all too believable Fascist monster is mopping up the few remaining communist guerrillas in the hills while waiting for his sick wife to give birth to his son while her daughter from her first marriage tries to reassert her own identity rather than submit to the Captain's idea of family.The challenges of the mythical world are far less disturbing - or violent - than the real one, and it's all too easy to see why she wants to escape into the darkness of the labyrinth where at least the hope of something better exists. But then she's not the only one escaping into the imagination, as her mother sustains herself with a romanticised view of her meeting the captain that he has no interest in whatsoever. To him stories - even a part of his family history that has passed into local legend - exist only to be denied. Lopez's greatest sin isn't the pride that he admits to, or even that he is so pitiless, it's that he chooses to obey without question: the girl's small triumph is that she does not. And the triumphs in the film are generally small, quiet ones, where courage and fear go hand in hand, making the few acts of decency all the more important when they occur. There is one ""saved by the cavalry"" moment that at first doesn't convince but does prove to be there for a definite purpose that makes the ending all the more powerful.But while there's a lot going on underneath the surface of the film, it doesn't crush it with the weight of its ideas. It's directed with a visual assurance and, at times, playfulness that sweeps you along, sometimes with delight, sometimes with apprehension, but never simply for the sake of a nice shot or a neat special effect (most of which are incredibly well integrated for such a low budget feature). The performances are superb, with Lopez somehow managing to avoid turning his irredeemable character into a caricature: this is an evil without conscience that is all too recognisable. Javier Navarette's beautiful score is also adept at walking the fine line between magic and emotion without crossing the line into schmaltz.It's a remarkable film, the only new one that I saw last year that I'd genuinely say is one of the greatest of all time. Practically perfect and definitely one to add to your collection."	5.0	Fantastic in all the very best senses of the word	2007-04-13	9	9	0

But, like Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" the acting was what really drew me in.  This movie is no different.  The acting was SUPERB, the story was very, very well written and the pace was nice.  Not to slow and not too fast.  The fact that there was really more than one plot in the movie was impressive.  To be able to understand what was going on in each plot and how it all came together at the end was amazing.  Unlike the mess of the ""Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End"".  This movie was not only entertaining, but intelligent.  It reminds me in a way, of Ridley Scott's ""Legend"".  Which to me, was the ultimate fantasy movie.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3GPO2V1VBPXL5	user	I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDB ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if it's adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies.	3.0	Good, but not as good as they'll have you believe	2007-02-06	14	3	11

These are the positive things about this movie: its beautifully made, the character development is superb, and the acting is great! The negative things about this film, for me, was that I felt like it was trying to tackle two completely different directions: one, about a young girl who's immersed into a fantasy world that leaves the audience wondering if it's real or her own imagination, and the other, into the dark side of war, with all its gore and violence that comes with it. The idea is not a bad one, but I don't think it meshes too well. All the dark but enchanted beauty of Pan's mythological world is what drives the film's creativity, but is then tainted with all the gore and violence of Pan's nightmarish real world. At times all the blood and gore is just downright depressing. I know this film takes place during war, but I wish the director didn't have to resort to such violence to make the film darker than what it already is. And the ending was such a downer...it only left me wondering, why? Why was that necessary?Overall, I wasn't too pleased with this movie. And it's a shame, because it started out so wonderfully and I almost started to like it.

It definitely deserves a place in my DVD library, so I will be purchasing it as soon as possible.While many would argue that the violence is too much to bear, I think it perfectly captures the reality of the war.

There is much more war than fantasy in this film, so much that I wouldn't even call it a fantasy, but rather a drama (even more so when the film reveals its ending).Highly recommended, and worth every single star and then some.	5.0	Life isn't a fantasy...or is it?	2007-06-02	7	7	0

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A5X1B2HBQUR3P	"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn"""	"A beautiful and poignant film which starts at the outset as a children's fairy tale but it is a fairy tale for adults. This is the story about a girl named Ofelia who we are shown lives in 2 world's: 1) The Anti franco post civil war regime where the spanish Maquis guerrillas are fighting a resistance against the Hitler like ruthless captain Vidal and his army men and 2) her own fairy tale fantasy land in a neverland filled with menacing and magical creatures and healing living plants. The main repeating character world from this fantasy world is an enigmatic faun. What is a faun, you ask ?. I looked up wikipedia ""fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland.....have horns and both resemble goats below the waist, humans above"". Something like a hybrid unicorn I would guess. Incidentally a faun is used in  C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. That faun is possibly a classic faun, the one used by the director in this film is more of a menacing creature which is like cross between the alien and some ostrich. This faun is real creepy, freaked me out.  This is the first movie of it's kind that I have seen where a fantasy movie plays as a parallel thread to a real world movie. The movie is poignant,tragic and enchanting in its score, visual style and essense which is a very tough feat to put off all at once, credit to the director, production designer, and screenplay writer. So in that sense it's not really a fairy tale for kids. Ofelia has to block out the brutal aspects of the violence she is seeing all around her. Further the physical pain endured by her mother during late stages of pregnancy bearing captain Vidal's child (She is not fond of captain Vidal, she senses him as a ruthless and uncaring man, which is what he is when he tell his doctor ""if a choice has to made between the mother and the child, save the baby""), adds to her sense of loss and despair which she compensates by creating this fantasy world that she indulges in from time to time. The real world story has a momentum of it's which could have served as one whole film, a story of Mercedes, the lady cook who in the pantry of captain Vidal. Mercedes is secretly helping her husband and the resitance. Her Husband is part of the guerrillas. Comming back to the mystical Faun from this mystical land, gives Ofelia three tasks. Completion of all three tasks is suppossed to reinstate Ofelia has the princess of this fairy land, a throne that has been waiting for centuries waiting for her re-incarnation. And now her time has finally come. This is not like the Harry potter goblet of fire tasks. The task here serve to immerse us into the believability of this world. The creatures are other worldly, kind of out of place for childeren's fairy tale. The monster in the second task has eyes on his hands and he gets activated when she picks the ripe fruits of the monster's dinner table. It is an amazing escapist movie but which has this beautiful poignant movie score, a great directorial vision and an ambience of a different kind of fairy tale interspersed with the horror of the real world. What a joy of a film to watch. I recommend one and all to see this film. This is a spanish movie by the mexican director Guillermo del Toro, the guy who made blade2, hellboy, and hellboy2: The golden army. In the end we get the subtle idea of the whole film of Ofelia. But I won't everything way lest I rob you of the joy of watching this movie.regards, VIkram"	5.0	Poignant,tragic and enchanting in its score, visual style and essense , a tough feat to pull off all at once	2008-02-06	1	1	0

There is one major circumstance, though. The violence. This is a pretty violent movie, yet it is as though the violence is needed as a dire signal of how bad the situation is. There is also a disturbing ""old-man with eyeballs for hands"" creature that has all the food before it, yet it rather dine on kids. A strange paradox, if you catch its meaning.

"Set after Spain's Civil War, 12 year old Ofelia escapes into her fantasy world inspired by the books she's read. Her mother has remarried after the death of Ofelia's father to a brutish, sadistic Captain fighting rebels. Ofelia meets Pan a creature that convinces her that she is the reincarnation of a princess of the underworld who died ages ago. Her father has been waiting for her to be reborn but to prove that she is indeed a princess she must accomplish three tasks before the next full moon so she can be reunited with her father and mother.Del Toro's film isn't perfect nor is it as good as some of his other efforts but it is a worthwhile film from this very talented director. It won't appeal to everyone (and it isn't meant to). The performances from all the actors are quite good particularly the little girl playing Ofelia who gives a natural performance without overplaying her role. The production design is, as with all Del Toro's films, exceptional (in fact there are other visual motifs that refer to ""Hellboy"" one of Del Toro's most successful mainstream projects).Like Del Toro's other films ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Cronos"", ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a powerful occasionally gruesome sad fantasy film. This isn't fantasy as in ""The Wizard of Oz"" but darker much closer in tone to the original colorful (and equally gruesome)Grimm Brothers fairytales. Del Toro's film shares a sensibility with some of Terry Gilliam's darker films. If you didn't enjoy ""The Devil's Backbone"" or any of Del Toro's other films, then you won't enjoy this often visually stunning sad tale.Pan's Labyrinth (as it is known by its English title)is shown with subtitles in Spanish. It won't be for everyone there are a number of brutal, gruesome scenes but these are balanced out by Del Toro's arresting visual imagery."	4.0	"Powerful, dark fantasy film in the vein of Del Toro's ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Cronos"""	2007-02-09	5	3	2

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A17JVVAKWEB0M	Wesley Mullins	"In post Civil War Spain, eleven year old Ofelia travels into the mountains with her pregnant and severely ill mother, as they join her new stepfather, a torturous Fascist Military Captain whose assignment is to decimate fledgling bands of Communist guerillas.  With the brutality of war all around her and a mother who seems destined to not survive her pregnancy, Ofelia's escape from the horrors of the world are in her collection of fairy tales, including one that seems to come alive in an ancient labyrinth.In one of Ofelia's books, she learns of Princess Moanna, the daughter of an underworld King, who is believed to live in the mortal world, but will someday return to rule alongside her father.  One night in the labyrinth, Ofelia meets a faun who tells her she is the lost Princess and will be able to return home if she completes three tasks.  I say she ""meets"" a faun, others may say she ""imagines"" meeting a faun.  The film is open to interpretation, as those who believe in fairy tales see the entire action of the film as true, while others see her supernatural adventures as a young child's imaginative way of dealing with war and death.Ofelia's quest to complete the faun's tasks makes up much of the plot of Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth.  Almost oblivious to the war around her, Ofelia battles giant toads and child-eating monsters, scenes presented in brilliant colors that juxtapose the dark bluish-grey scenes of war.  Countering her story is the Captain's brutal dictatorship over the mountain, as he kills without cause and tortures to both get answers and satisfy urges within.  Although a film advertised as a ""fairy tale"", the true-to-life violence in the Captain's scenes rivals anything released since The Passion of the Christ.  Del Toro unapologetically displays the real consequences of meeting flesh to a blade or the butt of a gun.That the director doesn't distinguish between his two stories, that he doesn't favor one over the other is the magic of Pan's Labyrinth.  Viewers who believe are just as convinced as to the existence of the fawn as they are of the guerillas.  And to those of us who have never known war, we can relate just as much to the enchantment of Ofelia's dreams as we can to the barbarity of Spain's nightmare."	5.0	2006's Best Film	2007-09-19	2	2	0

Del Toro is a master storyteller, but there was no sense of urgency here, hence the film dragged on, rather than flowed.  I also have to say that graphic violence in this film didn't belong.  We already know, you're going to kill a man, so why do we need to see it in graphic, bloody detail?  That was another thing that took away from the movie.  I felt as if I was watching Apocalypto all over again, dreading extreme violence at every turn.  I am sure, I would've liked the film more, had it not had all this blood, and had it been faster paced.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A3J0OXB9KIC5SS	WILLIAM H FULLER	"After 491 customer reviews, what's one more?  Oh, why not?I have but one criticism of the film as it is available with English subtitles, and that is the title itself. From ""Labyrinth of the Faun"" it has been rendered ""Pan's Labyrinth.""  In Greek mythology, Pan was one particular sylvan god who possessed a strong phallic character and who was known to pursue nymphs for his own amusement. The English title inclined me to doubt the motives of the faun until the very end of the story, when I felt that it had unintentionally created a red herring.  Although indeed associated with Bacchus, fauns as a group were rather less venal than Pan, and I could accept one of their number as serving the great god of the earth and relating to Ofelia with more disinterest than I could Pan.My annoyance with the transliteration of the title aside, the story told by this film is fantastically rich both in symbolism and in its multiple layers of interpretation.  It even invites us to consider the question of the nature of reality.On the most superficial level, we see a young girl escaping a most brutal reality by plunging mentally into a fantasy world complete with kings, princesses, fairies, toads, and, of course, a faun.  But is it a fantasy world?  Philosophers have long argued the nature of reality and whether or not it even exists beyond one's perception and interpretation of it.  This intentional ambiguity of what is real and what is imaginary (and, indeed, whether there is even a distinction between the two) permeates the entire viewing experience.Is the creature we first meet a large winged insect or a fairy (a question specifically asked of it by Ofelia)?  Does it mutate from insect-like form to fairy-like form in the physical domain or just in Ofelia's imagination--or does her imagination inform the physical domain?  Does the mandrake root under the bed really mitigate her mother's suffering, or does Ofelia imagine that it does, mentally creating the reality she longs for?  Does the burning of the mandrake cause her mother's death, or is it mere coincidence which Ofelia's imagination imbues with a cause-and-effect significance?As has been asked by other reviewers, is Ofelia herself merely an imaginative young girl subjected to the unending horror of war, rebellion and retribution, or is she the symbolic manifestation of something much greater?  As her blood drips into the concentric circular pools, she is taken before the great god, her father--or does her dying mind create this final fantasy?  While not at all overbearing or blatantly obvious, there is more than a little Christian symbolism mixed with the Pagan here!  That the great god, Ofelia's father (in the fairy tale--or is it in reality?), rules a kingdom beneath the earth does not, however, imply that he is satanic but rather suggests a Pagan earth god rather than a Christian sky god, a depiction that fits well with the fairy tale motif and the presence of a faun.The labyrinth itself--what does it signify?  Of course, one might expect to find a magic labyrinth in a fairy tale, but is it also symbolic of the entrapping cruelty of life with its myriad twists and turns, most of which lead only deeper into its midst?  At the end of the labyrinth (of life?) lies the entrance to the magic kingdom (of heaven?).The film maker does not stint on realism.  The cruelty of Franco's fascist police is vividly portrayed, not merely suggested.  Torture, death, blood and pain are naturalistically depicted.  There are a few occasions when many viewers may avert their eyes from the screen.  Yet, beyond the action, entertaining, imaginative, creative, and horrific as it may be from scene to scene, the true power of this film lies in the many different interpretations it weaves in the viewer's mind, in the multi-layered symbolism of the setting and of the characters themselves, and in the questions that it subtly inserts in the viewer's consciousness, questions that will resurface to enthrall the viewer long after the film has run its course.Seeing ""Pan's Labyrinth"" assures that one will never look at fairy tales in quite the same light again."	5.0	A Rich and Wondrous Blurring of Fantasy and Reality	2007-09-25	1	1	0

It's a Civil war drama combining elements of fairytale as subplot. The film features very good performances and high quality production. While there is characters and story is well developed, I feel that there was not enough fairy activity or special effects. There was really just the Faun, his miniature fairies and that canibalistic monster. I just thought that there is not enough coverage of world of the fairies when the little's girl Ofelia/fairy princess returned to eventually.

The national sport, bullfighting, is performance art and death. Surrealism is as Spanish as Salvador Dali. Here, there is art, death, and surrealism, set in the war that begat Picasso's Guernica (surrealism, art, and death again).This is a fairy tale of the old kind, the ones that Lang's colored fairy tale books wouldn't tell, at least not in the original form. Everyone has death in them, or murder. ""I've gutted pigs before"" isn't a threat, so much as a daily fact of life. Even a little girl, all knees and elbows, makes her own choice about who will die, or maybe just a choice about who won't.Behind the horrors of war, though, there's another world. Beings of vast power populate it, and bestow bits of their power where they will. Every action in that world beyond has some special portent. Somehow, though, the menace of that other-world is always something that little Ofelia can manage, even master. The real horrors are out here.It would have been too easy to turn this into a flat out effects-fest. Effects in this movie are good, but subordinate to the story in ""Labyrinth of the Faun"" (the Spanish title).

Yesterday it came to my door, and I was satisfied.While the movie is enjoyable, and a must see, it was not nearly as violent as many reviews stated that it would be. Most prolific movie watchers will find little to wince at. Pan's Labyrinth was also not very scary, nor a thriller.I found the movie to be a bit slow, and thin when it came to the fantasy elements. Trailers make us think that ""Pan"" is a movie that is 90% fantasy scenes. In reality, fantasy elements eat up only about 5-10% of the runtime. Lastly, I found it hard to connect with the characters.Now, with all this said, I still liked the movie very much. the acting was top notch, and the film making wonderful. The score was a great addition as well. The subtitles can be tricky, especially if you are trying to munch on a movie snack, but halfway through the flick you forget they are there.I recommend seeing Pan's Lanyrinth, but not buying it until you watch it first. It is not a movie I can see myself purchasing, nor really passionately remembering 5 years down the road."	4.0	Good Movie,	2007-05-28	9	6	3
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2QFO64UAU5N18	"W. Lucas ""wvl"""	I have this on standard DVD format and will probably get it on Blu-Ray as well. The movie is a bit long for a non speaking Spanish person, like me, but all and all, it is a good movie. I do believe it is a bit mature for the younger audience, even though the story circles around a young child. It is probably a good idea not to let the young watch the movie just yet. Wait until they can get a since of what is real and what isn't.  This movie can certainly give nightmares to a small child. However, on the other hand, it is a good movie if you want to learn Spanish. I rate this movie to be a 5 for the story, but rate it low because it will not support the young children.	5.0	A bit mature for the younger audience, but a good story nonetheless	2007-10-26	43	7	36
B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1D9EQU96P4HOQ	"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing ""Up Late Every NIght..."	"Yes, it has layers of interpretation and meaning.Yes, the cinematography is beautiful.Yes, I'm glad filmmakers from all over the world are making use of Hollywood's special efffects boon.The puzzle, however, is this:  if all these people see Pan's Labyrinth"" as ""astounding"" ""astonishing"" ""glorious"", and  overwhelmingly complex"" -- then what have they been watching lately?There is no question that there are films in the last 5-7 years that have taken complexity to an all new level.  But this movie probably won't make that list.  It is a beautiful film -- and informs most of us of a history we never learned in school or at our grandfather's knee.  It is also beautiful as a psychological piece, and even as semi-alegorical fantasy.But at its heart, it really only manages to tell the history, albeit rendered as hard non-fiction overlayed with mythic fantasy.  Still -- that makes it only what it is -- a look through a looking glass we haven't been shown before.  And considering what we know of WWII, it doesn't carry the weight of shock and awe that it might have 40 years ago.What keeps the ""layers"" from standing on their own separate feet is that there is never any doubt that the mythic and fantastical elements are all inside a child's head.  There is never a moment when we think the fantasy is actually the solid part of the story.  Had the fantasy been constructed as a truly magical world, then the horror of reality at the end might have been actual horror.  As is, it is just one more confirmation that we have been watching a sad, lonely, depressed and abused girl escaping into the safety of her own mind.It is a highly respectable film -- as far as it goes.  It has a lyric pace and emotional tone that sets it apart from many other fantasy films -- but like all those German ""Neverending""-movies, it takes its purpose and mission far too seriously to actually be enjoyable or likeable.  It is not a ""see again and again"" movie, which is what I was encouraged to hope for from all the reviews and critical hoo-rahs.One caveat, however.  I've heard the filmmaker talk about this movie twice, now, and I am persuaded that he, like so many in the world, has a different mythos playing in his unconscious than the average American.  Or even the well-read, well-considered American.  The culture  which constructed his childhood is not the same ""global-culture"" in which he (nor we) now resides.  And they are far from the mythos of the Grimms  Hans Christian Anderson, Oscar Wilde and Walt Disney that filled my childhood.  That being so, I am sure that the mythos resinating in his child's memory and unconscious is the one filling Pan's Labyrinth -- and so those with the same childhood culture probably see much more depth in this film than those with another childhood culture.And for that audience, Pan's Labyrinth may very well be astonishing and amazing."	3.0	A puzzle...	2007-08-02	7	3	4

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1BYGXZTXEX9DF	"W. Smith ""Steampunk Enthusiast"""	The overly artsy Pan's Labyrinth is perfect for applause with the quirky Cannes Film Festival crowd...but it's not for general consumption.  The first thing that I must mention is that this film can't decide what it's want to be...a fantasy children's adventure or a war film?  What we get in the end is a hybrid which has two oil and vinegar elements that don't mix.On the subject of violence I am not usually disgusted by violence...love Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, etc...but this film was over the top.  It was if the director was going out of his way to gross out the audience...and it comes off as sophomoric at best.The monsters encountered by the main character(a little girl) are overly gruesome...and I think it's inappropriate to have such a young actress interacting with such vile menaces.I could forgive the violence if, in the end, the film had a point.  Other than a political bias painting communist partisans as kind and gentle souls who, despite being Marxist guerrillas, are apparently boy scouts too, the movie seems to have no clear message.  If there is no message, then it also fails as a simple adventure.Pan's Labyrinth=Utterly disappointing on level.  I encourage would-be buyers and viewers to stay away from this overly hyped nonsense.	1.0	Quirkiness and Violence...Without a Point	2007-06-12	72	18	54

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2D0PC7NLRXU7M	W. Traynor	I was expecting pure fantasy when I watched this film, but instead I was exposed to an overly violent, dark, humorless and downright grim film about a sadistic Spanish captain fighting rebels during WWII. The fantasy aspects of the film were secondary and not particularly innovative or moving. I've seen it all before. While the movie is well-acted and directed, its fantasy and reality aspects do not mesh into a cohesive film. I was expecting something along the lines of the Lord of the Rings-type fantasy, but was surprised to find that fantasy took up about 25 percent of the film. This film is not quite what was advertised. At times, I felt like I was watching a B-film horror movie mixed with Goodfellas-type violence. Unfortunately, that combination doesn't work well.	3.0	Overrated	2007-05-29	26	12	14

The DVD case is beautiful, reminds much of the LOTR Special Edition Disks. It's got a rubber band around it like for a diary and there's also Ophelia's key added if only in thick cardboard. Then there's a small booklet with short abstract and sketches to the film. Beautiful!Of course, I will also get this 2-Dics Special Edition in May and hope all the things I mentioned will be included as well.

As far as I'm concerned this picture gives you all the elements of the perfect film. For blu ray owners this film is showcase material. The picture quality is superb and the 7.1 sound mix is fantastic.Pan's is a realistic fairytale I guess you could say but this is not a film for children, hence the R rating. The villian is as nasty as they come and the violence is brutal. The images are incredible and the score is great.

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale for grown-ups, and what a beautiful movie...it follows the life of a young girl, Ofelia [played by a talented young actress, Ivana Baquero] who is forced to leave the city and move to the Spanish countryside together with her expectant mother on the orders of her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a monstrous brute with no human compassion whatsoever. Ofelia's feelings of alienation provides the setting for her entry into the magical underworld of the labyrinth, where she meets a faun who reveals her 'true' identity, an ancient princess of the underworld who needs to complete three tasks in order to reclaim her position. So we have Ofelia coping with the demands set upon her by the faun, and in the real world, we witness Spain's Civil War, with the Captain ruthlessly hunting down dissidents. There are great supporting roles here played by the housekeeper Mercedes who is also helping the rebels, the doctor who treats Ofelia's mother [also aids the rebels], and of course the magical beings that inhabit Ofelia's alternate world. Some of these beings are scary [the baby eating monster for example], but nothing is as scary as the real world inhabited by cruel humans...the Captain's predilection for torture makes for wince-inducing viewing. The cinematography evokes a magical world a la Alice in Wonderland, whilst also showing the stark realities of war. Unlike some of the other reviews, I actually thought the fantasy and real elements merged together quite well...especially where it concerned Ofelia's attempts to help her ill, expectant mother. I did wish that more time had been spent on developing the fantasy element in the story...it just felt like there was a lot more to be said concerning Ofelia's exploration of the 'other' world. As for the score, it is simply haunting. This is definitely an adult movie because of the excessive and graphic violence, and also the frightening images both in the real and imaginary realm. Del Toro has directed a masterpiece that bears repeated viewing.	5.0	The Labyrinth of the Faun	2007-05-28	14	13	1

B00005JPA6	Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)	A2YTILWEWPWH4T	"Zoe Collins ""The Book Worm"""	Pan's Labyrinth was undoubtedly one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen.  I will admit, the depths of human cruelty in this movie were violently disturbing but when you look beyond that, there is a fantastic story being told.  I felt as though the story was very well blended with fantasy and real life elements.  Honestly, if you give this movie a chance, the subtitles will NOT detract from the story or the gorgeous cinematography that the movie portrays.  Do not expect this movie to be a Disney fairy tale or a complete fantasy.  There are some harsh real life realities interwoven into the plot.  This is definitely not a movie for children or those who like fluffy feel-good films.I think the level of violence in this film comes from a cultural difference in movie making.  I find that American audiences love a lot of movie violence (car chases, explosions, blood splatters, etc.) where as this movie portrays a more real life violence more often seen in real life war situations.  Seriously, though, this movie was not as violent as some very popular films I have seen.  Saving Private Ryan anyone?  This movie did not touch that level of violence.In my opinion, the reason Del Toro did not concentrate wholly on the fantastical portions of the film is because the fantasy relied so heavily on what was going on in Ofelia's real life.  She was so ready to believe the faun when he said she was a princess because she wanted escape.  She was alone and afraid and when the faun gave her a chance to leave those fears behind, she took it.  It was also easy for her to accept the fantasy because she believed in it already or she wanted to believe in it, exemplified by the type of books that she insistently read.  The fantasy and her real life became so intertwined to the point that the viewer couldn't tell anymore whether it was in her head or real.  It really does not make a difference which it is, the point is that Ofelia needed escape and this was her medium to do so.Honestly, give this film a chance.  It is worth it.	5.0	Mesmerizing	2007-05-19	19	18	1
